	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of the trial are to assess erythroid response to darbepoetin alfa, as determined by changes in hemoglobin and/or red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependence and to describe the safety profile of darbepoetin alfa in patients with MDS. The secondary objective is to assess bone marrow progenitor BFU-E growth before and after treatment with darbepoetin alfa.</brief_summary>
