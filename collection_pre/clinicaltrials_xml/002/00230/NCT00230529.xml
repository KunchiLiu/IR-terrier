	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of Infliximab (Remicade) in Patients With Plaque Type Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and possible usefulness of infliximab therapy for patients with severe plaque psoriasis. In a previous small study of infliximab in 33 patients with psoriasis, about 80% of patients treated with infliximab showed improvement in their psoriasis symptoms after the first 3 infusions, while 20% of patients who received placebo showed improvement. The patients will receive infusions of infliximab either 3 or 5 mg/kg or placebo at weeks 0,2,6. Patients who have significant psoriasis at week 26 will receive an additional infusion.</detailed_description>
