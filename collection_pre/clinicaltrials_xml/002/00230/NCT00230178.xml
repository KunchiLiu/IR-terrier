	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, multi-center, open-label, parallel group study with three arms: - Rasburicase alone - Rasburicase followed by Allopurinol - Allopurinol alone The primary objective is to compare the adequacy of control of plasma uric acid concentration and the safety profile among the three arms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rasburicase Versus Allopurinol in Tumor Patients at Risk for Hyperuricemia and Tumor Lysis Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After signing the informed consent and having met the inclusion criteria, patients will be randomized to 1 of the 3 arms and treated for a total duration of 5 days. Patients in all arms will receive chemotherapy beginning 4-24 hours after the first dose of rasburicase or allopurinol.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Meets high risk or at potential risk for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): A patient is at high risk for TLS if he/she presents with: Hyperuricemia of malignancy (plasma uric acid &gt; 7.5 mg/dL); A diagnosis of very aggressive lymphoma/leukemia based on the Revised EuropeanAmerican Lymphoma (REAL) classification of lymphoma/leukemia; Acute myeloid leukemia (AML); Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast crisis; or High grade myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anemia with excess blast, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and refractory anemia with excess blast in transformation) only if they have &gt; 10% bone marrow blast involvement and are given aggressive treatment similar to AML. A patient is at potential risk for TLS if he/she presents with: A diagnosis of aggressive lymphoma/leukemia based on the REAL classification of lymphoma/leukemia plus 1 or more of the following criteria: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt;= 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (IU/L) Stage IIIIV disease Stage III disease with at least 1 lymph node/tumor &gt; 5 cm in diameter In addition to the abovementioned eligibility criteria, the patients should have the following criteria: 2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 03 3. Age &gt;= 18 years 4. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months 5. Negative pregnancy test (females of child bearing potential) and use of effective contraceptive method (for both males and females). A pregnancy test may be performed on serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). 6. Signed written informed consent</criteria>
