	<brief_title>IRAD2 : Patients With Respiratory Failure at Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title : Effects of home pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with chronic respiratory failure and nutritional depletion State of the art : The IRAD2 trial is evaluating a 3-month home intervention which includes education, oral supplements, exercise and androgenic steroids in undernourished patients with chronic respiratory failure. The main objective is to increase the six-minute walking distance by more than 50 m with an improvement in health-related quality-of-life. Secondary end-points include a reduction in exacerbation rates by 25%, a reduction in health-related costs and an increase in survival during the year following intervention. Material and methods : This interventional, multi-centre, prospective, two-armed parallel, controlled trial is being conducted in 200 patients. In both groups, "Control" and "Rehabilitation", 7 home visits are scheduled during the 3-month intervention for education purpose. In the "Rehabilitation" group, patients will receive 160 mg/d of oral testosterone undecanoate in men, 80 mg/d in women, oral dietary supplements (563 kcal/d) and exercises on an ergometric bicycle 3 to 5 times a week. Expected results : In the event of significant responses to intervention, this trial would validate a comprehensive and global home-care for undernourished patients with chronic respiratory failure combining therapeutic education, oral supplements, androgenic substitution and physical activity.</detailed_description>
