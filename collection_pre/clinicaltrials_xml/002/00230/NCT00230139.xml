	<brief_summary>The value of fusion of functional and anatomical data has been described using several fusion techniques for various nuclear medicine procedures and morphologic imaging modalities (SPECT-CT, SPECT-MRI, Coincidence-CT). We hypothesize that NM -CT data has advantages over the data obtained using separately performed NM study and conventional anatomic imaging as CT. We hypothesize that more accurate localization of the radio-isotope activity on NM images will improve diagnostic accuracy and will have an impact on patient management: Improved accuracy of NM study will improve tumor localization, the evaluation of the extent of disease and the post therapy follow up. It will direct other diagnostic procedures to lesions otherwise undetected, or exclude the need for more invasive procedures. It can also guide invasive procedures and radiation-therapy planning, thus improving therapy results and avoiding unnecessary treatment-related side effects.</brief_summary>
