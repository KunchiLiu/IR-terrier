	<brief_summary>Delivery of conformal radiation therapy following radical prostatectomy is limited by the inability to define the clinical target volume (CTV). This stems from a poor understanding of patterns of local recurrence and limitations of standard imaging techniques.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a promising modality for imaging the prostatic bed following radical prostatectomy. MRI provides more detailed postoperative anatomy to guide CTV delineation, the ability to document local recurrence patterns, and a method to assess intrafraction prostatic bed motion and deformity to define appropriate planning target volume margins. The aim of this pilot study is to develop a technique for external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) following radical prostatectomy based on MRI-delineation of the CTV. Twenty patients will be enrolled in this pilot, development phase.</brief_summary>
