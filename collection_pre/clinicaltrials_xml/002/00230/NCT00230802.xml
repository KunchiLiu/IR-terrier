	<brief_summary>Our aim is to compare the safety and efficacy of 2 different empiric levothyroxine dose adjustment recommendations to be made at the first confirmation of pregnancy in women with a history of hypothyroidism. Subjects will be women with a prior diagnosis of hypothyroidism who are taking thyroid hormone replacement and who are less than 8 weeks pregnant. Upon confirmation of pregnancy, subjects will be randomized to increase their weekly thyroid hormone dose by either 2 or 3 tablets (28 or 42%). Thyroid function will be evaluated every two weeks in the first 20 weeks and then again at week 30 and post-partum. Primary endpoints will be the proportion of women in each group who remain euthyroid throughout the first trimester and throughout pregnancy.</brief_summary>
