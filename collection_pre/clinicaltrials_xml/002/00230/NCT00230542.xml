	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effects (good and bad) the combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed have on patients with recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin and Pemetrexed in Recurrent Platinum Sensitive Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Before patients receive any chemotherapy treatments they will be given three medications to prevent side effects from the chemotherapy drugs. These medications are vitamin B12, folic acid and dexamethasone. - Chemotherapy treatments will be given intravenously in the outpatient clinic. Pemetrexed will be given first and will take 10 minutes to infuse followed by carboplatin which will take 30-45 minutes to infuse. These treatments will be repeated once every three weeks for 6 cycles of chemotherapy (18 weeks). - Before each chemotherapy treatment the following tests and procedures will be performed: physical exam and medical history; evaluation of ability to undertake daily activities; and blood tests. - After every 2 cycles of chemotherapy (every 6 weeks) patients will have a CT or MRI scan to measure how well their cancer is responding to treatment. - The study treatment will last for 6 cycles of chemotherapy as long as the tumor does not grow and the patient isn't experiencing any severe side effects.</detailed_description>
