Traditionally, the first therapy offered is humidification which can liquify airway secretions and decrease airway swelling. This study will compare the effectivenesss of 40% and 100% humidity through a specially designed machine called a nebulizer, with the usual humidity set-up (blown into the patient's face from a hose).</brief_summary>
