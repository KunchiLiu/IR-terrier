	<brief_summary>This project is a randomized, open-label trial of adefovir dipivoxil (Hepsera) and lamivudine combination therapy versus adefovir dipivoxil (Hepsera) monotherapy. Both adefovir dipivoxil and lamivudine are nucleoside analogues approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. The primary hypothesis is that subjects treated with combination therapy will see their viral DNA count decrease in an amount greater than subjects treated with monotherapy. The secondary hypothesis is that subjects treated with combination therapy will have a higher HBeAg conversion rate compared to historical controls of subjects treated with lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil monotherapy.</brief_summary>
