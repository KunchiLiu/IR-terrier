	<brief_title>Study in Non-responder Hepatitis C Genotype 1 Patients With EMZ702, Pegylated Interferon and Ribavirin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, 28 patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 who have failed previous treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin will be treated. The study treatment will consist of the same type and doses of pegylated interferon and ribavirin to which the patient failed to respond plus EMZ702. EMZ702 will be administered intravenously twice a week during the first 12 weeks of treatment.
