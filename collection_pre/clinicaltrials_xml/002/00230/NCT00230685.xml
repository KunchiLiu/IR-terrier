	<brief_summary>The Hammersmith Hospital provides a clinical service for patients with Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations that is unique in the United Kingdom. Measurements obtained as part of standard clinical practice that has evolved since 1985 allow us to assess whether particular groups of individuals that we see are more prone to recognised complications such as strokes, brain abscesses, pregnancy related complications or pulmonary hypertension. We hypothesise that certain clinical characteristics will predict the susceptibility of individuals to particular complications.</brief_summary>
