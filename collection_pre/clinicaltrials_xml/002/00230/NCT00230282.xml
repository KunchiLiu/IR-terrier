	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in previously untreated CLL patients. Participants will receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide on days 1, 2, and 3 of six 28-day cycles.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-arm study evaluated the safety and efficacy of the combination of fludarabine 25 mg/m2/d IV and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2/d SC in previously untreated CLL patients. Participants received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide on days 1, 2, and 3 of six 28-day cycles, followed by a no-treatment rest period (observation) for 3 to 12 weeks. Responders entered a no-treatment rest period (observation) for 3 to 8 weeks, then depending on status, continued on follow-up or on-study to receive Campath stating at 3 mg/day with the dose adjusted to the maximum tolerated dose.</detailed_description>
