	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigation is to assess the prevalence of infectious disease seropositivity (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus [CMV]), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), syphilis, Epstein-Barr virus and H. pylori in a group of patients presenting with specific autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis [RA], undifferentiated connective tissue disorder [UCTD], Sjogren, antiphospholipid syndrome - APS, vasculitides, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], polymyositis, Hashimoto, multiple sclerosis, primary biliary cirrhosis [PBC], etc.), using the BioPlex 2200 and complementary EIA kits as compared to matched controls (by age, sex and ethnicity).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this investigation is to assess the prevalence of infectious disease seropositivity (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus [CMV]), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), syphilis, Epstein-Barr virus and H. pylori in a group of patients presenting with specific autoimmune diseases (RA, UCTD, Sjogren, antiphospholipid syndrome - APS, vasculitides, SLE, polymyositis, Hashimoto, multiple sclerosis, PBC, etc.), using the BioPlex 2200 and complementary EIA kits as compared to matched controls (by age, sex and ethnicity). We will assess in our Center 100 patients with multiple sclerosis for the antibody profile of different infectious agents. Comparative assessments will be performed with normal matched subjects.</detailed_description>
