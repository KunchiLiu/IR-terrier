	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Evaluating Slow-Release Formulation TAXUS Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent in the Treatment of In-Stent Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Percutaneous approaches to in-stent restenosis (ISR) have included balloon angioplasty alone, rotational atherectomy, cutting balloon angioplasty, directional coronary atherectomy, excimer laser angioplasty, placement of a second stent or any combination thereof, and intra-coronary brachytherapy. Of these, only brachytherapy has been shown to reduce recurrent restenosis after PCI for ISR, - and is now considered the standard of care. Logistical considerations in establishing and maintaining a radiation program have limited the widespread availability of this modality. These considerations include the need for involvement of radiation oncologists, physicists, and safety officers; nuclear licensing requirements; need for increased shielding and safety training; equipment and procedural complexities; as well as increased procedural time and costs. Furthermore, recurrent ISR after brachytherapy may still occur. Stent based drug delivery for the treatment of ISR holds promise as a much simpler, safer and potentially more effective alternative to brachytherapy. This is a prospective, randomized (1:1), open-label, multicenter, safety and efficacy trial for the treatment of in-stent restenosis. The primary objective is to demonstrate a superior or non-inferior 9-month target vessel revascularization (TVR) rate for TAXUS-SR stent compared to intra-coronary brachytherapy (beta source).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cumulative target lesion length is &lt;/= 46 mm (visual estimate). Reference vessel diameter (RVD) is &gt;/= 2.5 and &lt;/= 3.75 mm (visual estimate) Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is &gt;/= 25% Any previous or planned treatment with a nonstudy antirestenotic drugcoated or drugeluting coronary stent in the target vessel. (Note:previous or planned treatment with heparin or phosphorylcholine coated stents is acceptable, as long as, the procedure with the nonstudy stent meets the protocol defined criteria for nontarget lesion interventions.) Previous or planned treatment with intracoronary brachytherapy (gamma or beta source) in the target vessel Previous external radiotherapy to the heart or target vessel area Known genetic radiation sensitivity disorders (i.e. ataxiatelangiectasia, etc.) Side branch of the target lesion includes ostial narrowing &gt;/= 50% diameter stenosis (DS) and is &gt;/= 2.0 mm diameter Target lesion has been previously treated for ISR with the placement of a second stent(s), which covers &gt;/= 50% of the original stent length (a true "stent sandwich") Target vessel is pretreated with an unapproved device, directional or rotational coronary atherectomy, laser, or transluminal extraction catheter immediately prior to delivery of randomized treatment (stent placement or intracoronary brachytherapy) Recent myocardial infarction (MI) (symptom onset &lt;/= 72 hours prior to randomization) CKMB &gt;2x the local laboratory's upper limit of normal (ULN) (refers to a measured value on the day of the index procedure as drawn per protocol) Anticipated treatment with warfarin during any period in the 6 months post index procedure Anticipated treatment with paclitaxel, oral rapamycin or colchicine during any period in the 9 months post index procedure Planned use of both the study stent and a nonstudy stent (i.e., commercial stent) in the treatment of the target lesion</criteria>
