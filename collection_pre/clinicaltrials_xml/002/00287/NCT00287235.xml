	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Extracorporeal Albumin Dialysis (ECAD) using the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS®) device in improving severe HE by 2 grades compared to Standard Medical Therapy (SMT) in patients with chronic End Stage Liver Disease (ESLD) during a 5 day study period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Albumin Dialysis to Treat Patients With Hepatic Encephalopathy Using The Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial was a two-group unblinded multicenter clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive either SMT or SMT plus five days MARS® treatment. The trial design called for patients to receive a baseline hepatic encephalopathy (HE) assessment on admission, and at 12-hour intervals, giving 10 HE measurements during treatment using a refinement / adaptation of the Conn West Haven HE Criteria HE scoring system</detailed_description>
