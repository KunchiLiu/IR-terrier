	<brief_title>Effect of Cold Air Cooling on the Incidence of Post Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation Following Laser Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- 70% incidence of post inflammatory hyperpigmentation has been reported following a Q-switched nd:YAG laser treatment of acquired bilateral nevus of Ota-like macules. - We assumed that epidermal cooling may minimize the non-specific injury to the epidermis caused during laser irradiation, leading to the decreased incidence of post inflammatory hyperpigmentation.</detailed_description>
