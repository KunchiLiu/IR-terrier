	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Giving bortezomib together with thalidomide may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with thalidomide works in treating patients with newly diagnosed stage II or stage III multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib and Thalidomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage II or Stage III Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor efficacy of bortezomib and thalidomide in patients with newly diagnosed stage II or III multiple myeloma. - Determine the incidence and severity of peripheral motor/sensory neuropathy in patients treated with this regimen. - Assess the ability to mobilize and collect stem cells in patients who undergo future autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation. - Determine the time to response in patients treated with this regimen. - Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and oral thalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 4 courses. Patients who plan to undergo transplantation AND achieve ≥ 50% reduction in the tumor burden proceed to transplantation off study. Patients who do not undergo transplantation receive 2 additional courses of therapy beyond best response for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve at least a partial response after completion of treatment may receive maintenance therapy comprising bortezomib IV every 2 months and oral thalidomide* once daily OR twice every 2 months (i.e., the day before and the day of bortezomib administration) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *For patients who had previously discontinued thalidomide, maintenance therapy may consist of bortezomib only. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the beginning of each study course, and after completion of study treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
