	<brief_summary>Device: computerized physician order entry. We wanted to investigate if the introduction of a computerized intensive care unit system reduced the incidence and severity of medication prescription errors (MPEs). A prospective trial was conducted during 5 weeks in a paper-based unit versus a computerized unit. The registration of different classes of MPEs was done by a clinical pharmacist. An independent panel evaluated the severity of MPEs.</brief_summary>
