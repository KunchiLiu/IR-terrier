	<brief_summary>Migraine headaches have previously been shown to be responsive to intranasal lidocaine in a small study. Using a nebulizer to administer the drug would improve the feasibility of using the treatment. It would also spare the patient narcotics with their attendant side effects. Because of the potential for placebo effect a placebo control is necessary in this study.</brief_summary>
