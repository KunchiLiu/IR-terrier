	<brief_summary>This study will investigate Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)as a cause of sleep disturbance. Patients with GERD may experience all or some of the following symptoms: stomach acid or partially digested food re-entering the esophagus (which is sometimes referred to as heartburn or regurgitation) and belching. Even very small, unnoticeable amounts of rising stomach acid may cause patients to wake up during the night. This study will also investigate the effect of Rabeprazole, (brand name Aciphex) on patients with known insomnia. Rabeprazole is an FDA approved medication already marketed for the treatment of GERD.</brief_summary>

Upon completion of the 2 week course of rabeprazole, subjects will repeat the overnight pH and sleep studies. Upon completion of these studies, participation is complete.</detailed_description>
