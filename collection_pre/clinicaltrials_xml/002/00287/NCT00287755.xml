	<brief_summary>To evaluate the usefulness of chemosensitivity test in evaluating the appropriate adjuvant cancer chemotherapy after gastric surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Chemosensitivity Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients: clinical Stage III gastric cancer patients. Informed consent will be obtained before surgery. Eligible patients: surgical Stage II, IIIA and IIIB gastric cancer patients. Chemosensitivity test: The surgical specimen will be sent Mitsubishi BCL, Co. Ltd. to be tested by CD-DST chemosensitivity test and RT-PCR for thymidylate synthetase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase mRNA. The test results will be blinded for the doctors on duty. Treatment: All the patients will be treated with S-1 at a dose of 80 mg/m2 b.i.d. for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks rest. The treatment will be continued until the recurrence or 1 year after operation. Primary endpoint: 3-years disease-free survival rate Secondary endpoint: 3-years overall survival rate and side effect (CTCAE v3.0) Evaluation of chemosensitivity test: The cutoff condition will be determined based on the accumulated data of CD-DST and mRNAs. Hypothesis: The responder detected by CD-DST and/or TS, DPD mRNA will have a favorable survival outcome comparing with resistant cases.</detailed_description>
