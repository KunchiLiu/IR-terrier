	<brief_summary>Hepatorenal syndrome is a common complication of cirrhotic patients. The prognosis of patients with HRS is very poor. It have been demonstrated that vasoconstrictors agents (Terlipressin) plus albumin are effective in the reversal of the treatment. However, previous studies are pilot studies and they are not able to give information about an improvement in survival. This comparative randomized study was delineated to test the efficacy of terlipressin on survival.</brief_summary>
