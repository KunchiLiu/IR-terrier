	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Pirfenidone in Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety and efficacy study of pirfenidone in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Approximately 320 patients at approximately 50 centers will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive pirfenidone 2403 milligrams or placebo equivalent administered in divided doses three times per day (TID) with food. The primary outcome variable will be the absolute change in percent predicted Forced Vital Capacity from Baseline to Week 72. Patients will be randomized by geographic region. Patients will receive blinded study treatment from the time of randomization until the last patient randomized has been treated for 72 weeks. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will periodically review safety and efficacy data to ensure patient safety. After week 72, patients who meet the Progression of Disease (POD) definition, which is a ≥ 10% absolute decrease in percent predicted Forced Vital Capacity or a ≥ 15% absolute decrease in percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLco), will be eligible to receive permitted idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis therapies in addition to their blinded study drug. Permitted idiopathic pulmonary therapies include corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and N-acetyl-cysteine (with restrictions).</detailed_description>
