	<brief_summary>Concomitant administration of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) may boost the expansion of immune reconstitution and broaden specific T cell responses not achievable by vaccination alone. The main objective of that study is to test the validity of this hypothesis with vaccines which are routinely administered to HIV-1 patients(tetanus toxoid and hepatitis A virus vaccines) in order to, if proven of value, use this strategy of HIV vaccination in the near future. This is a pilot, randomized, clinical open label study aimed to investigate thymic functionality and the HIV-specific responses after administration of rhGH in HIV-1 infected patients in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction and Expansion of T Cell Repertoire Using Growth Hormone and Vaccination in HIV-1 Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of a therapeutic vaccine is to control, induce and expand humoral and cellular immune responses capable to control HIV infection. The administration of a conventional vaccine results in the expansion of peripheral clones. Concomitant administration of rhGH may boost this expansion and reconstitute specific T cell responses not achievable by vaccination alone. In this study we want to investigate whether the administration of rhGH expand T cell repertoire and whether there is an increase in the specific cellular responses to HIV-1 and recall antigens and, lately, whether this responses can be further amplified after immunization with tetanus toxoid and hepatitis A vaccines. This Hypothesis will be evaluated by the measurement of thymic volume, the expansion of na√Øve, memory and effector cell subsets, analysis of thymic emigrants (TRECs) before, during and after rhGH administration and vaccination. Moreover, T cell receptor rearrangement, specific antibodies and cellular responses to antigenic peptides will be determined.</detailed_description>
