	<brief_summary>Patients who have schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, a psychotic disorder, and are being treated with a medication called Risperidone Long Acting Injectable medication or another antipsychotic medication are candidates for the study. The purpose of the study is to find out from patients' family how they feel the medication has affected their relationship with them. The study will involve meeting with family members three times over the course of one year. The first time will be at New Hampshire Hospital (NHH) or at a community mental health center and the follow up times will be at a convenient place and time for the family member (s), in the community. We will ask them to answer questions from the Family Burden Interview and Quality of Life Questionnaire. The family will not be charged for any test that is completed solely for this study. The family will be provided a travel stipend to meet with the researchers.</brief_summary>

We will be interviewing the patient's family, and they will be sharing information as to how they feel their relationship with the patient is going. All efforts will be made to keep this information confidential; however, there may be unforeseen circumstances that could lead to breaching of confidentiality. If the family expresses need for help the research staff will make recommendations for referral to a provider.</detailed_description>
