	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Imatinib Added to Chemotherapy in Treatment of Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent advances in treatment have increased the cure of childhood ALL to 75% or better. However, attempts to improve results for resistant subtypes of ALL, such as Ph+ ALL, have been largely unsuccessful. Imatinib, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinases, is currently being tested in several phase I, II and III trials covering most Chronic Myeloid Leukemia patient populations and patients with overtly relapsed or refractory Ph+ALL. Pediatric patients with Ph+ALL will receive Imatinib, added to intensive, post-induction BFM-type chemotherapy. The endpoint will be the evaluation on the long-term clinical outcome, in particular on the Disease Free Survival (DFS).</detailed_description>
