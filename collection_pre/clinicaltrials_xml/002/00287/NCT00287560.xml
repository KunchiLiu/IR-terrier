	<brief_title>Effect of a Modified Propofol Preparation on Injection Pain During Induction of Anesthesia in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain on injection is the most frequently reported side effect associated with the use of propofol for induction of anesthesia. Various measures have been taken to reduce the pain on injection, e.g. administration of lidocaine or fentanyl prior to propofol administration, mixture of lidocaine and propofol as well as cooling of the emulsion. Although pain on injection had been reduced with some of the above mentioned methods, they may not be regarded as a satisfactory solution of the problem.</detailed_description>
