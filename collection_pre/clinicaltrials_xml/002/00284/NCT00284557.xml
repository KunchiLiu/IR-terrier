	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether participation in a group-based health education curriculum is superior to receipt of standardized health educational materials for children who are overweight or at risk for overweight with regard to achievement of a healthier body weight and improvement of key eating and physical activity behaviors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Primary Care Behavioral Approach for Addressing Childhood Overweight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the United States, childhood obesity has tripled since 1970 such that 15% of those 6 to 19 years of age are obese, with higher observed prevalences for African-American and Hispanic children. Childhood obesity has significant short- and long-term health consequences. To avoid future morbidity, children who are obese or at risk for obesity must be identified and treated at an early stage. The primary care setting, where most children receive health care and where BMI should be tracked, may represent an early opportunity for identifying and treating childhood obesity. However, translational research is needed to test whether existing strategies for childhood obesity can be adapted for delivery via the primary care setting The ultimate purpose of this work is to help overweight children, particularly those who are African-American, optimize their lifespan and quality of health through achievement of a healthier body mass index (BMI). Specific aims are to perform outcome and process evaluations to determine whether the intervention results in improvement in BMI percentile or habitual healthy eating and physical activity behaviors, and whether the intervention is feasible. The outcome evaluation component involves a randomized controlled trial, in which overweight children (BMI for age percentile &gt;=95th) and children at risk for overweight (BMI for age percentile 85-94th)together with a parent/caregiver receive the primary care-based intervention or health education materials only. The intervention will focus on four main behavioral changes: decreasing consumption of key calorie-dense foods, increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables to ≥ 5 a day, reducing targeted sedentary behaviors to &lt; 15 hrs per week, and increasing moderate and vigorous physical activity to 60 minutes or more daily. We will assess change in BMI percentile, number of servings of calorie-dense foods daily, and percent of time spent in sedentary and physical activities at 6-, 12-, and 18-months using mixed-model ANCOVA for repeated measures.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria included that the child must be: 1. Obese (BMI ≥ 95th percentile for age and gender) or atrisk for obesity (85th ≥ BMI &gt; 95th percentile for age and gender); 2. AfricanAmerican by parent report; 3. 711 years of age; 4. Without any medical or psychological condition that would make weight loss or physical activity dangerous, or psychological disorders that would make adoption of health behaviors difficult; 5. Without any complications of obesity that indicate prompt referral to a pediatric obesity treatment center for more aggressive weight loss therapy; 6. Together with the parent/caregiver indicate that they are ready to make changes in their eating and physical activity behaviors; 7. Have a parent/caregiver willing to participate. As noted above, to participate in this study the child must not have a medical or psychological condition that would make weight loss or physical activity dangerous, psychological disorders that would make adoption of health behaviors difficult, or complications of obesity that necessitate prompt referral to a pediatric obesity treatment center for more aggressive weight loss therapy. Examples of medical or psychological conditions that would render the child ineligible for this study include uncontrolled or poorlycontrolled asthma or hypertension, bulimia, mental retardation or severe learning disability, as well as pseudotumor cerebri, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis.</criteria>
