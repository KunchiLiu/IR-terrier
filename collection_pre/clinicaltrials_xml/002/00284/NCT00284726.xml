	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare 2 different cold storage solutions, used to preserve donor lungs for lung transplantation, and their effect on cytokine activation related to ischemic reperfusion injury. Primary endpoint is 30 day survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Cold Storage Solutions on Ischemic Injury in Lung Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The length of ischemic time in harvesting lung allografts is associated with graft survival. It is further thought that ischemic changes in early post-transplantation bronchoscopic biopsies has a direct correlation with later development of chronic rejection.</detailed_description>
