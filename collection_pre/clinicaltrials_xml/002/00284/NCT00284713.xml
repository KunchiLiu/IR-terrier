	<brief_title>Progenitor Cell Therapy in Dilative Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initial clinical pilot trials suggested that intracoronary infusion of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (BMC) may enhance left ventricular functional recovery in patients with acute myocardial infarction. It is unknown, however, whether such a strategy might also be applicable to patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Therefore, we initiated the TOPCARE-DCM - trial (Transplantation Of Progenitor Cells And Recovery of Left Ventricular Function in Patients with non ischemic Dilatative CardioMyopathy) aiming to regionally improve left ventricular contractility by selective infusion of BMC into the left anterior descending coronary artery. Patients will be randomized 2:1 (20/10) BMC Infusion versus standard medical therapy</detailed_description>
