	<brief_summary>The long-term use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) in patients who have received a kidney transplantation is associated with renal dysfunction and hypertension. The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of replacing the calcineurin inhibitors by using basiliximab at monthly doses.</brief_summary>
