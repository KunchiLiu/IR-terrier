	<brief_title>Efficacy of a Mechanical Gait Repetitive Training Technique in Hemiparetic Stroke Patients (AVC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Modern concepts of gait rehabilitation after stroke favor a task-specific repetitive approach. The aim of the study is to test the efficacy of a body weight support treadmill training technique enabling nonambulatory patients to have the repetitive practice of a gait-like movement compared to a conventional rehabilitation program in the acute phase. Hemiparetic stroke patients will be randomly included in a 4 week rehabilitation program associating physiotherapy and gait trainer therapy or physiotherapy alone. The primary endpoint will be the walking speed (time needed to walk 10 m) at the end of the rehabilitation program. Functional ambulatory category, walking endurance, time to self sufficient gait recovery, needing for mobility and self assistance, spasticity and economic evaluation of the two strategies will also be assessed.</detailed_description>
