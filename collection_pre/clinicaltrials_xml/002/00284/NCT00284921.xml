	<criteria>Inclusion criteria 1. Patients hepatitis C positive (serology test within the last 12 months and determined by thirdgeneration assay). 2. Recipients of heartbeating cadaveric, living unrelated or living related nonHLA identical donor kidney transplant, treated with basiliximab and CsAME as primary immunosuppression. Exclusion criteria 1. Multiorgan recipients (e.g. double kidney, kidney and pancreas or kidney and liver) or previous transplant with any other organ. 2. Kidneys from nonheart beating donors. 3. ABO incompatibility against the donor. 4. Patients with panel reactive antibodies of &gt;50% at most recent assessment prior to transplantation and /or prior graft lost due to immunological reasons in the first six months posttransplantation or patients who are considered to be at increased risk of acute rejection by the principal investigator Additional protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
