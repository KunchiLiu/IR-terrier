	<brief_title>Acupuncture for Hot Flushes in Menopause</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study objective is to determine whether Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) acupuncture-care together with self-care is more effective than self-care alone, to relieve climacteric complaints among women who seek alternatives to hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). Study design is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms. Study participants are postmenopausal women who document a mean value of 7 flushes/24 hours and who are not using HRT or other prescribed medication that may influence climacteric complaints. The treatment group will receive 10 sessions of TCM acupuncture-care and self-care; the control group will engage in self-care only. The duration of intervention period is 12 weeks with evaluations at baseline, 4, 8, 12 weeks, and follow up at 6 and 12 months after baseline. Primary endpoint is change in daily hot flush frequency in the two groups from baseline to 12 weeks; secondary endpoint is health related quality of life. N in each treatment group: 143 (286 altogether).</detailed_description>
