	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the benefit of using online, tailored behavioral weight management materials (Balance), in combination with nutritional materials (Balance and Nourish), in conjunction with a goal setting tool (Balance and Achieve), or a combination of all three (Balance, Nourish and Achieve). This objective will be evaluated by measuring weight loss rates as reported by study participants at 3, 12, and 18 months post-enrollment. The hypothesis is that adding additional materials will increase the effect of the intervention over just using Balance alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of a Web-based Tailored Weight Management Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a randomized control, web-based trial for weight management with four treatment arms. Participants will be assigned to receive tailored materials from either: 1) the Balance program, 2) the Balance and Nourish programs, 3) the Balance and Achieve programs, or 4) the Balance, Nourish and Achieve programs. Participants will be recruited directly through their health care organization. In order to participate, participants must visit the website to confirm their eligibility, e.g. valid e-mail address. Those who wish to participate will provide consent on the Web, and then will be presented with an online questionnaire. These questions will provide baseline data for each participant and will be the basis for the tailoring of the Balance materials each participant will receive. Within 24 hours of submitting the completed questionnaire, participants will be informed by e-mail that their tailored Balance plan is available on the website. They will receive follow-up materials by e-mail during the six-week period after they enroll. Participants who have been assigned to additional programs will be sent e-mails with links to the relevant programs. At 3, 12 and 18 months, all participants will be assessed via an online survey. The assessment will include weight management parameters, psychosocial outcomes, and program utilization. This data will be self-reported. STUDY POPULATION The study sample will be drawn from members of three integrated delivery systems: Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO), Kaiser Permanente Ohio (KPOH), and Group Health Cooperative (GHC) of Puget Sound. In order to participate, participants must access and enroll in the study on the Web. A total of 1,848 participants will be enrolled within a six-month period, with approximately 450 participants in each treatment arm. By 18-month follow-up, we assume successful data collection from at least 65 percent of the enrollees, or 1200 participants, 300 in each treatment group. The study is open to those who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</detailed_description>
