	<brief_title>Use of Thalidomide in Patients With Arachnoiditis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arachnoiditis, a neuropathic disease caused by inflamation of the arachnoid membrane that surrounds and protects the spinal nerves,can result in a debilitating state that is characterized by numbing and tingling, stinging and burning in the lower back or legs, and possible muscle cramps, twitching and spasms. Current treatments are not always effective in treating the pain associated with arachnoiditis. Recent research has indicated that a group of chemicals called cytokines that are produced by various cells in the body may be responsible for generating the pain response. Medications that effect the release of cytokines or block the action of cytokines may reduce the pain response. Various anti-cytokine medications are now being used to treat painful disease states such as rheumotoid arthritis and Crohn's Disease. In this study the anti-cytokine medication, Thalidomide, is being evaluated for it's effect in treating pain associated with arachnoiditis.</detailed_description>
