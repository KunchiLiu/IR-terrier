	<brief_summary>SAVE PACe is a large, prospective, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial with the main objective to study the effect of unnecessary right ventricular apical pacing on the clinical outcome of time to development of persistent AF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SAVEPACe - Search AV Extension and Managed Ventricular Pacing for Promoting Atrio-Ventricular Conduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional dual-chamber pacing maintains atrioventricular synchrony but results in high percentages of ventricular pacing, which causes ventricular desynchronization and has been linked to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with sinus-node disease. Patients with sinus-node disease and intact atrioventricular conduction are randomly assigned to receive conventional dual-chamber pacing or dual-chamber minimal ventricular pacing with the use of new Medtronic pacemaker features designed to promote atrioventricular conduction, preserve ventricular conduction, and prevent ventricular desynchronization. The primary end point was time to persistent atrial fibrillation.</detailed_description>
