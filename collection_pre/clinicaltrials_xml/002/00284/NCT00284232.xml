	<brief_summary>A randomized controlled trial in patients with type 1 diabetes, assessing the metabolic effects of accurate blood sugar results and education. A systematic approach in self-monitoring blood glucose will improve metabolic control in type 1 diabetes patients. Education in SMBG combined with a high analytical quality instrument for SMBG, introduced in a systematic and thorough way will improve HbA1c by 0,5% and keep it over a period of 9 months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Written informed consent 130 patients with type 1 diabetes to be included - age 18-70 - HbA1c of 8% or higher, variation in HbA1c over the last 18 months sholuld be &lt;1,5% - Treated with multiple insulin injections or insulin pumps - Variation in weight less than 5kg within last year - Using SMBG on a daily basis - Mental capacity and stability to participate - No hypoglycemia unawareness - No likelihood that patient will drop out or not perform according to protocol - Continious recruitment from the outpatient clinic at Stavanger University Hospital from October 2004-October 2005 - 9 months follow-up - Possible 12 month extension after initial - Intervention group receives new SMBG instrument, education and advice on treatment changes at baseline, 1,2,3,6 and 9 months. Control group continues regular care following national guidelines of Norway. This includes visits usually every 3-6 months at the outpatient clinic and possibly with their GP in addition.</detailed_description>
