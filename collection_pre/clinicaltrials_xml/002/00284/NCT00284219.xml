	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoking is a major public health problem causing significant morbidity and mortality. Yet, smoking cessation therapies are often ineffective at helping smokers break their addiction. The mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system plays a crucial role in mediating the reinforcing effects of nicotine. Recently, acute high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of frontal brain regions has been shown to efficiently modulate the mesolimbic dopamine systems in both animals and humans. For this reason, we investigated whether 10 high-frequency (10Hz) rTMS treatments over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can help people to withdraw smoking in comparison to placebo rTMS. Smokers seeking to quit are recruited through newspaper advertisements. Participants were randomized to 10 days of either real or placebo high frequency rTMS.</brief_summary>
