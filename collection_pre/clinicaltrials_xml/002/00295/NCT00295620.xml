	<detailed_description>ABCSG 16 S.A.L.S.A is assessing the effect of further 2 years vs further 5 years of adjuvant treatment with anastrozole after initial 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. S.A.L.S.A. is a randomized open multicentered phase III study comparing the efficacy of secondary adjuvant endokrine treatment of Arimidex® (Anastrozol) for 2 or 5 years after primary adjuvant endokrine therapy in patients with hormonreceptor positive mammakarzinom. Patients are examined at screening, after 6 months, then every year until 5 years. The subsequent yearly follow up with mammographie and clinical examination ends 10 years after the screening. S.A.L.S.A. started in February 2004 and has recruited 3484 patients until June 2010 at 78 sites all over Austria. Primary Endpoint: 1. Proof of the effect of 2 years versus 5 years of Anastrozol after 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy on the disease free survival Secondary endpoint: 1. Proof of the effect of 2 years versus 5 years of Anastrozol after 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy on the overall survival 2. Comparison of fracture rate in both therapy groups 3. Comparison of incidence of 1. a secondary carcinoma except the contralateral mammacarcinoma 2. contralateral mammacarcinoma in both therapie groups</detailed_description>
