	<brief_title>Cisplatin, Pemetrexed and Bevacizumab for Untreated Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary endpoints will include: objective response rate overall survival In addition, the objective of the analysis of the correlative science data is to determine any association between tumor expression of VEGF/KDR complex and/or the presence of sv40 (as detected by PCR amplification) and objective response.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria 5.2.1 Patients must have histologically proven malignant mesothelioma (epithelial, sarcomatoid, or mixed subtype) not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy. Eligible sites of origin include the pleura, peritoneum, and tunica vaginalis. 5.2.2 Patient's disease must not be amenable to curative treatment with surgery. Evidence of gross unresectability will include but not be limited to direct extension into the chest wall, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, pulmonary or cardiac function that is inadequate to tolerate resection, and sarcomatoid or mixed histology. 5.2.3 Patients must be &gt; 18 years old 5.2.4 Patients must have measurable disease. Adequate organ function and functional status a. General Medical Concerns 5.3.1 Patients must not be pregnant or breast feeding. 5.3.2 No "currently active" second malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer. Patients are not considered to have a "currently active" second malignancy if they have completed therapy and have a less than 30% risk of relapse. 5.3.3 No uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to: active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 5.3.4 No HIV positive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with study medications. 5.3.5 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to bevacizumab or other agents used in the study. 5.3.6 Inability to interrupt aspirin or other nonsteroidal medication for a 5 day period. c. BevacizumabSpecific Concerns Subjects meeting any of the following criteria are ineligible for study entry: 5.3.7 Patients with brain metastases are excluded 5.3.8 History of myocardial infarction or CVA (stroke) within 6 months of study entry. 5.3.9 Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. Patients on therapeutic doses of coumadin are eligible as long as the INR is maintained in the range of 23 and there is no evidence of active bleeding. 5.3.10 Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 0, anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study 5.3.11 Urine protein:creatinine ratio less than 1.0 at screening 5.3.12 Serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture</criteria>
