	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Zoledronate may delay or prevent bone marrow metastases in patients with breast cancer. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well zoledronate works in treating bone marrow micrometastases in women with stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zoledronate in Treating Bone Marrow Micrometastases in Women With Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response of bone marrow micrometastases, as measured by immunocytochemistry/flow cytometry (IC/FC), during and after 2 years of treatment with zoledronate in women with stage I-III breast cancer. Secondary - Evaluate the effects of zoledronate on the bone osteoclast activation marker, n-telopeptide, in these patients. - Evaluate the incidence of distant recurrences in high-risk women with early-stage breast cancer and bone marrow micrometastases who receive adjuvant zoledronate. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients receive zoledronate IV over 15 minutes once a month for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
