	<brief_title>Phase II Study Efficacy and Safety of Two Dosing Regimens of MN-001 in Patients With Interstitial Cystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two dosing regimens of MN-001 in patients with Interstitial Cystitis (IC). Patients will be screened for study eligibility within seven to nine days of randomization. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either 500 mg MN-001 bid, 500 mg MN-001 once daily or placebo. Patients will be dispensed study drug beginning at Baseline (Visit 2) and will return to the study center for Visit 3 (28 days ± 2 days after Baseline), and Visit 4 (56 days ± 2 days after Baseline), at end of study for safety and efficacy assessments. The patient will be contacted by telephone at Week 6 (42 days ± 2 days after Baseline) for an interim follow up. Study drug will be dispensed at Visits 2 and 3. Safety assessments will include adverse events, physical examinations, clinical laboratory testing, and changes in vital signs. Efficacy assessments include percentage of patients at least "moderately improved" for each treatment group using the patient reported Global Response Assessment (GRA) (see Appendix 1). Secondary assessments include a decrease in bladder pain/urgency based on change in the patient rating from baseline to endpoint using the GRA (see Appendix 1), modified Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency (PUF) Patient Symptom Scale (see Appendix 2) and the O'Leary Sant IC Symptom and Problem Index.</detailed_description>
