	<brief_title>Comparing Efficacy &amp; Safety of Tacrolimus With/Without MMF or Monoclonal Anti-IL2R Antibody in Liver Transplantation.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomised trial which combines MMF with tacrolimus and so avoids steroids in immunosuppressive maintenance could demonstrate alternatives to current immunosuppressive regimens. There is evidence that reduced steroid usage could further decrease the onset of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and viral infections combined with high efficacy for patients and graft survival. Since the use of MMF in liver transplantation is becoming an alternative in the rescue setting this could contribute to a steroid-free immunosuppressive approach.</detailed_description>

Patient is requiring ongoing dosing with corticosteroids. Patient is exhibiting symptoms of, or is having any previous history of neoplastic disease Patient or donor is known to be HIV positive.
