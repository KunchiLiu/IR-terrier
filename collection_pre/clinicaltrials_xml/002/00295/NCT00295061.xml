	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical study (ChAMP - Comparability pharmacokinetics of Alpha-1 Modified Process) is to compare the pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability of Alpha-1 Proteinase Inhibitor (Human), modified process (Alpha-1 MP) and Prolastin in adult Alpha1-antitrypsin deficient patients. Patients will be infused intravenously with study drug on a weekly schedule for 24 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic comparability of Alpha-1 MP to Prolastin® in subjects with Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. This study is divided into three 8-week treatment sequences including an initial 8-week double-blind treatment period (with one of the 2 study drugs), a second 8-week double-blind treatment period (with the other study drug), and a third 8-week open-label treatment period (with Alpha-1 MP).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Documented diagnosis of congenital Alpha1antitrypsin deficiency Must be receiving augmentation therapy with plasmaderived (human) Alpha1Proteinase Inhibitor (Prolastin®) for at least one month prior to study entry.
