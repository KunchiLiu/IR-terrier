	<brief_summary>The lifetime of substance use disorders in schizophrenia is close to 50%. Substance abuse in schizophrenia is associated with negative consequences. Unfortunately, there no clear guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of this dual diagnosis population. Preliminary results suggest that second-generation antipsychotic drugs (mainly clozapine) may relieve drug cravings in schizophrenia. We performed a 12-week pilot study to evaluate the impact of quetiapine, a second-generation antipsychotic, on substance abuse parameters, psychiatric symptoms and side effects in patients schizophrenia and comorbid substance use disorders. Our expectation was a 20 % decrease in drug cravings from baseline to end-point.</brief_summary>
