	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn whether Saxagliptin added to thiazolidinedione (TZD) therapy is more effective than TZD alone as a treatment for Type 2 diabetic subjects who are not sufficiently controlled with TZD alone</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assessing Saxagliptin Treatment in Type 2 Diabetic Subjects Who Are Not Controlled With TZD Therapy Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subjects will participate in a lead-in period, and qualifying subjects will continue into a short-term randomized treatment period. Subjects who complete the short-term period will be eligible to enter the long term extension period. Also, subjects in the short-term period who have an elevated blood sugar that requires additional medication for blood sugar control will be eligible to enter the long-term treatment extension period where they will receive metformin (defined as rescue medication) added onto their blinded study medication</detailed_description>
