	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and clofarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of clofarabine when given together with cytarabine and to see how well they work in treating patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cytarabine and Clofarabine in Treating Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with high-dose cytarabine followed by clofarabine. - Document the safety profile and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. - Phase I: Patients receive high-dose cytarabine IV over 3 hours followed by clofarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats for up to 4 courses (1-2 induction courses, 2-3 post-remission courses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A cohort of 3-6 patients receives the starting dose of clofarabine. If 1 of 6 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), a subsequent cohort of patients receives clofarabine at the next higher dose. If ≥ 2 of 6 patients experience DLT, the dose of cytarabine is reduced and subsequent cohorts of patients receive cytarabine at reduced doses and clofarabine as per the dose-escalation scheme above. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
