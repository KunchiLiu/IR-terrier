	<brief_summary>The management of high-risk pregnancies require substantial use of medical resources. Our goal is to determine the effectiveness of a nurse case management program in which case managers are assigned to patients with high-risk conditions. Our hypothesis is that women with diabetes in pregnancy or hypertension who are assigned a nurse case manager will have lower glucose levels and lower blood pressure levels</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Nurse Case Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will recruit 50 women for each arm of the study. We we conduct a stratified randomization (by disease) in which women are randomized to a nurse case manager who provides on-going face-to-face contact compared to women who are assigned to a case manager with telephone contact only.</detailed_description>
