	<brief_summary>A compassionate method of treatment is offered to patients where lesions do not meet acceptable criteria for standard therapy. Visudyne (Photodynamic Therapy) and laser photocoagulation treatment (a treatment using heat from a fine point laser beam) have not been found to be effective in treating the lesions these patients have. Anecortave acetate is an experimental drug that is being tested to prevent the growth of blood vessels under the retina in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Conditions With Open Label-Anecortave Acetate Sterile Suspension ( 15mg.) Where Lesions do Not Meet Acceptable Criteria for Standard Care.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will receive a sub-Tenon injection of 15mg of Anecortave acetate in their study eye with the use of a counter pressure device. Patients will then be followed for up to 24 months. The patients will have the option of extending their participation in the study for an additional 24 months. Statistical analysis will include comparison of patient follow-up visual acuity and angiographic data.</detailed_description>
