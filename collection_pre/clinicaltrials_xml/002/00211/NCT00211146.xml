	<brief_title>A Study to Confirm the Safety and Efficacy of Epoetin Alfa (PROCRIT) Administered Perioperatively vs. the Standard of Care in Blood Conservation in Patients Undergoing Major Elective Spinal Surgery (SPINE Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of the study is to demonstrate that there is no clinically important additional risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in adult spine surgery using a perisurgical regimen of epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®) versus the standard of care for blood conservation. Spine surgery was selected as the population to study because anti-coagulant therapy is not always administered in association with this surgery type. In addition, the efficacy of epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®) in protecting patients from receiving allogeneic red cell transfusion across adult spinal procedures will be studied. Patients scheduled for elective spinal surgery, who agree to participate in the study, and meet eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®) or standard of care. No perioperative anti-coagulation therapy is to be administered during the study. The study hypothesis is that there is no increased risk of DVT in patients receiving perisurgical epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®) treatment. Epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®) 600U/kg administered once per week for 3 weeks prior to surgery and on the day of surgery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects scheduled for elective spinal surgery (with a minimum of 3weeks lead time) with significant anticipated perioperative blood loss (24 units of blood) Hemoglobin &gt;10 and &lt; 13 g/dL at screening Female subjects must be post menopausal for at least one year, surgically incapable of childbearing (hysterectomy or tubal ligation), or practicing an acceptable method of birth control (e.g., hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, or barrier and spermicide). The subject should continue with the same method for the duration of the study. If a female subject is practicing an acceptable method of birth control, she must have maintained her normal menstrual pattern within the three months prior to study entry No clinically significant abnormal hematologic or serum chemistry values. Negative serum pregnancy test for female subjects not post menopausal for at least one year or surgically incapable of childbearing (hysterectomy or tubal ligation) No primary hematologic disease No clinically significant disease/dysfunction of the cardiovascular (NYHA Classification Class IIIV), neurologic (cerebral), pulmonary, endocrine, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary systems, which in the opinion of the investigator would put the subject at increased risk for a thrombovascular event, compromise the subject's ability to respond to rHuEPO therapy, or otherwise impair their ability to participate in this study No history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) No subjects who are to receive perioperative pharmacologic anticoagulation (e.g., coumadin, heparin, lovenox, aspirin/ASA) No subjects prohibited from receiving blood transfusions</criteria>
