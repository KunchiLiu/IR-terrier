	<brief_title>Study Comparing Effectiveness of Intraperitoneal Insulin Administration to Subcutaneous Insulin Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Implantable insulin delivery pumps have been shown to reduce the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia in Type 1 DM subjects, as demonstrated in numerous European studies. Glycemic control is difficult to attain in subjects using exogenous insulin due to the risk of severe hypoglycemia. This study is aimed at comparing the efficacy of intraperitoneal (IP) insulin therapy to intensive subcutaneous insulin therapy over a period of 12 months.</detailed_description>
