	<brief_title>EPIC(Effect of PhosLo on Phosphorus Levels in Chronic Kidney Disease)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with impaired kidney function, dietary phosphorus can not be completely excreted, which leads to elevated levels of serum phosphorus. Elevated serum phosphorus leads to increased levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), and is associated with bone disease and other adverse consequences such as soft-tissue and vascular calcification, and increased morbidity and mortality. It is therefore important to prevent hyperphosphatemia and maintain serum phosphorus levels within the range recommended by K/DOQI. In patients on dialysis, phosphate binders are routinely used to control serum phosphorus by absorbing dietary phosphate during the transit through the intestine. However, the use of phosphate binders for non-dialyzed patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not an FDA approved indication, although some physicians treat patients prior to dialysis based on clinical judgment. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of calcium acetate (PhosLo) in controlling serum phosphorus in patients with moderate to severe decrease in kidney function.</detailed_description>
