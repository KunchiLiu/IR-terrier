	<brief_summary>This research study was designed to help improve the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in young children. An interventional strategy using a scoring system based on risk factors and symptoms/episodes was tested to determine its ability to identify children likely to benefit from induction of asthma controller therapy at an early age. The score was derived through completion of a survey instrument referred to as the asthma risk questionnaire (ARQ). The utility of the ARQ along with the health care utilization and use of controller therapy for respiratory illnesses within one year were examined.</brief_summary>
