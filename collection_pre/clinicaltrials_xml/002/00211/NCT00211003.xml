	<detailed_description>Doripenem is an antibiotic medication not yet approved by the US FDA. This is a phase 3, multicenter, prospective, open-label (though with blinded outcome assessments), randomized study of doripenem versus a comparator antibiotic in patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia. The study consists of screening phase, open-label treatment phase, and follow-up. Both patients on ventilator and not on ventilator are enrolled. The primary endpoint is the clinical response rate at early follow-up visit. The patients may receive either doripenem or comparator; total duration of the treatment is 7 to 14 days.</detailed_description>
