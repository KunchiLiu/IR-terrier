	<brief_title>A Study of the Effectiveness and Safety of Dapoxetine in the Treatment of Men With Premature Ejaculation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One form of male sexual dysfunction is premature ejaculation (PE), which is also referred to as rapid ejaculation (RE). The study consists of 2 phases: pre-randomization phase (a screening visit and a 2-week baseline period); 12-week double-blind treatment phase during which patients will receive one of 2 doses of dapoxetine or placebo for use on an "as-needed" basis. The total duration of the study is approximately 14 weeks. Assessments of effectiveness include the average intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (as measured by stopwatch) during sexual intercourse, during the treatment period; control over ejaculation, participant and partner satisfaction with sexual intercourse, participant overall impression of change and severity of symptoms, based on questions asked at monthly intervals through the treatment phase. Safety assessments include the incidence, severity, and type of adverse events during the study, ECGs, as well as laboratory tests. At the end of the baseline period, patients from selected study centers will undergo blood sampling and ECG monitoring before and after the first dose of study medication. The study hypothesis is that treatment for 12 weeks with dapoxetine prolongs intravaginal ejaculatory latency time, compared with placebo, in men with PE. Oral tablets of dapoxetine (30 milligrams [mg] or 60mg) or placebo taken as needed during 12 weeks of treatment. No more than 1 dose within a 24-hour period.</detailed_description>
