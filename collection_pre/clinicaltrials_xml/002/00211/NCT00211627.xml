	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Determine Safety and Effectiveness of KEEPASLEEP Device in Simple Snorers.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Keepasleep airway device is a novel and unique buccopharyngeal airway device to enhance breathing during sleep. This method has not been described in the medical literature and has been successful in limited testing. This clinical trial is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the KEEPASLEEP device utilizing 30 subjects with simple snoring. Each subject will serve as his/her own control. The device augments airflow into the posterior pharynx to minimize airway collapse,tissue vibration, and consequent snoring.The device passes through the retromaxillary space and requires that the subject be absent their wisdom teeth.</detailed_description>
