	<brief_summary>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the most common pathogen encountered in infections associated with orthopedic surgery. StaphVAXÂ® is a bivalent S. aureus types 5 and 8 vaccine which contains the purified capsular polysaccharides that have been implicated as a major factor in the invasiveness of S. aureus. Immunoprophylaxis by vaccinating against S. aureus prior to surgery could provide sufficient antibody concentrations during surgery and the wound healing period so as to decrease the risk of S. aureus infection. This study aims to demonstrate the immunogenicity and safety of a single dose of StaphVAX in patients who are candidates for orthopedic surgery.</brief_summary>
