	<brief_summary>S. aureus is the most common pathogen involved in prosthetic joint infection. StaphVAXÂ® is a vaccine to prevent these infections, which conjugates the purified capsular polysaccharides of S. aureus to a carrier protein. It is currently being evaluated for future licensing. This study aims to demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of StaphVAX in patients who are candidates for knee or hip arthroplasty.</brief_summary>
