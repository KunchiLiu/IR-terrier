	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Type 1 Diabetic subjects using the Paradigm 722 System, which is a glucose sensor-augmented insulin pump, can improve glycemic control when compared to subjects using the Paradigm 715 insulin pump only.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of the Paradigm 722 System to Improve Glycemic Control in Adult and Adolescent Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glycemic control remains a significant challenge for both adult and adolescent Type 1 diabetics. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGMS) is currently used by clinicians to record continuous, retrospective glucose measurements which aid in identification of glycemic excursion patterns. This data is then used to make therapy change recommendations for the future. The Paradigm 722 System transmits real-time glucose measurements to the insulin pump every 5 minutes, allowing users to view their current glucose values, as well as to review glycemic excursions and trends over a 24-hour period. This System will alert users to high and low glucose levels, and will allow subjects and their clinicians to treat to a therapeutic target HbA1c under monitored conditions. Subjects wearing the Paradigm 722 System will be compared to subjects wearing the Paradigm 715 Insulin Pump over a 6 month period to evaluate changes in glycemic control (HbA1c).</detailed_description>
