	<brief_title>An Effectiveness and Safety Study of IDEA-033 in Comparison to Oral Naproxen and Placebo for the Treatment of Osteoarthritis of the Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study is to evaluate the safety of and to identify the dose(s) of IDEA-033 that will provide a minimum clinically meaningful effect for treating the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee. This study will also compare the safety profile of the three doses of IDEA-033 in treating the signs and symptoms associated with osteoarthritis for 12 weeks. The primary hypothesis is that at least one of the three doses of IDEA-033 is superior to placebo with respect to three primary efficacy endpoints of WOMAC Pain, WOMAC Physical Function, and Subject Global Assessment of Response to Therapy. A second hypothesis is that there is an increase in efficacy with increasing doses of IDEA-033. Patients will receive one of five treatments for 12 weeks:Three doses of IDEA-033, or naproxen 1 g over-encapsulated tablet + placebo or placebo</detailed_description>
