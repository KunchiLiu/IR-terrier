	<brief_summary>Congenital Telangiectasia or Coat's disease is an uncommon disorder that involves the growth of blood vessels of the macula. These blood vessels msy extend beneth the retina to produce an area of sub-retinal neovascularization(growth of abnormal blood vessels under the retina which "leak" fluid, causing reduction in vision). Limited forms of treatment are available in managing the neovascularization and its consequences. Anecortave Acetate injection will be considered as an attempt to control the growth of the abnormal blood vessels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Congenital Telangiectasia (Coat's Disease) With Open-label Anecortave Acetate (15mg.)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After evaluation, the patient will receive an injection of anecortave acetate (15mg) juxtascleral with a special cannula in the study eye. the patient will be contacted via phone on the day following the injection. If problem arises patient has to come back to see the study doctor. if patient is stable, a 3 month follow-up visit will be st-up.if the patient does not show improvement, the patient may be offered either thermal laser or PDT. If patient is stable, on the month 6 visit ,the patient will again receive another injection of anecortave acetate. The succeding follow-up schedule will be followed for a total of 24 months.</detailed_description>
