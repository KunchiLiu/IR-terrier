	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of direct-to-patient mailings designed to increase patient's adherence to prescribed beta-blockers following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Prior to developing patient materials, focus groups were conducted with patient who had previously suffered an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to identify the issues and information that patients felt were important to include in our materials as well as the best way to present the information. Additionally, patient materials were "pre-tested" with AMI patients to ensure that the materials were clear and easy to read and that the key messages were understood.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims: 1. Assess the persistence of beta blocker use for post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients following a direct to patient intervention designed to increase rates of evidence-based long-term use of medications (beta blockers, lipid lowering agents, aspirin and ACE inhibitors) that increase survival following AMI. 2. Describe patient and system characteristics associated with differences in impact of the intervention Research Design and Methods: We will conduct a randomized controlled trial within the 4 participating HMOs (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Health Partners, and Kaiser Permanente Georgia). Inpatient data will be used to identify patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of AMI 4-6 months before the extraction date. Practices will be block-randomized to the intervention group or to usual care. To increase repetition of the message, there will be two personalized mailings, occurring at 4-6 months post AMI, and at 9 months. The first message will include elements in the table below, and the repeat message will be shorter, but include similar information. The message will come from the patient's own health plan with the choice of specific individual (e.g. quality assurance department, medical director, or Chief of Cardiology) being informed by our qualitative work. This intervention will be done in collaboration with the cardiovascular care committees and quality assurance departments of participating Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs).</detailed_description>
