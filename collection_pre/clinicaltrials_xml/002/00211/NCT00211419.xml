	<criteria>1. A male or female with evidence of exudative agerelated macular degeneration with clinical/angiographic/optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) which has not responded to current therapy 2. Baseline bestcorrected visual acuity (BCVA) 20/40 to 20/640 3. Patient must be willing and able to comply with the protocol and provide informed consent. 1. Patients on intravenous, subcutaneous, or anticoagulant therapy (with the exception of aspirin and antiplatelet therapy) and cannot take a 5 day holiday from therapy prior to the injection procedure. Note: Patients on oral anticoagulant therapy may be considered to participate if the physician responsible for monitoring the anticoagulant therapy agrees that the patient may take a 5 day holiday from therapy prior to each anecortave injection. The attending doctor must notify the principal investigator and this notification will be made part of the source documentation. Anticoagulant therapy may resume either the evening of or the morning after the injection procedure. 2. Patient with known glaucoma or steroid induced ocular hypertension 3. Intraocular pressures of 21 mmHg or greater at time of entry into the study 4. Patient with significantly compromised visual acuity in the study eye due to concomitant ocular conditions 5. Patients who have undergone intraocular surgery within last 2 months or capsulotomy within last month in study eye 6. Patient participating in any other investigational drug study 7. Inability to obtain photographs to document CNV (including difficulty with venous access) 8. Concomitant oral steroids or topical ophthalmic steroid use 9. SubTenon's injection of steroids within the past 6 months 10. Patient with significant liver disease or uremia 11. Patient with known adverse reaction to indocyanine green, iodine, verteporfin, or triamcinolone 12. Patient is pregnant or nursing 13. Age less than 50 years old</criteria>
