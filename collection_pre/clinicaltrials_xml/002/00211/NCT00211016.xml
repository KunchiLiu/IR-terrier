	<detailed_description>Doripenem is an antibiotic medication not yet approved by the US FDA. This is a phase 3, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label study of doripenem versus comparator to assess the effectiveness and safety of doripenem in the treatment of VAP in adult patients. The study consists of screening phase, open-label treatment phase, and follow-up. The treatment duration is from 7 to 14 days. The primary endpoint is the clinical response rate of doripenem at the early follow-up visit. The patients will receive either doripenem or comparator for 7 to 14 days.</detailed_description>
