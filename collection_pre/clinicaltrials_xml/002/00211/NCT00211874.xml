	<brief_summary>For congestive heart failure (CHF) patients with systolic dysfunction, a randomized controlled trial compared nurse-based disease management to address problems in patient and clinician management with usual care for effects on hospitalization and functioning among ethnically-diverse patients in ambulatory practices.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Congestive heart failure (CHF) disproportionately afflicts Black and elderly people, and is a leading cause of hospitalization &gt; 65 years. Although effective therapies can improve functioning and survival in patients with systolic dysfunction, many may not be receiving the full benefit of existing knowledge, including counseling on self-management and appropriate doses of medications. Patients play a critical role in managing a chronic condition such as CHF, but may not have the skills to do so. Clinicians may not provide counseling or medications consistent with evidence-based guidelines. Systematic reviews of clinical-behavior change have suggested that interventions targeted to specific problems are more likely to be successful. Based on shortfalls identified in patient self-management and clinical care in Harlem, a predominately non-white area in northern Manhattan, we tailored a nurse-management intervention to address the problems documented, and evaluated its effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial. This trial among primarily-minority patients addresses important gaps in this literature: the study targeted problems documented among CHF patients in Harlem, enrolled patients from ambulatory practices, randomly assigned patients between nurse-management and usual care, and evaluated their subsequent health-related outcomes. Hypothesis: the nurse-management program would result in nurse patients' having fewer hospitalizations and reporting better functioning.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• adults &gt;18 years, systolic dysfunction documented on a cardiac test (echocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography, myocardial stress sestamibi/thallium testing, or leftheart catheterization), English or Spanishspeaking, communitydwelling at enrollment, and current patient in a general medicine, geriatrics, or cardiology clinic or office at a participating site. • medical conditions that prevented a patient's interacting with the nurse, including blindness, deafness, and cognitive impairment; medical conditions that required individualized management that might differ from standard protocol, namely pregnancy, renal dialysis, and terminal illness; and procedures that corrected systolic dysfunction, such as heart transplantation.</criteria>
