	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multi-center, randomized, parallel-group, maintenance trial of Serostim® in subjects who have completed a prior Serostim® Human Immunodeficiency Virus-associated Adipose Redistribution Syndrome (HARS) trial (Study 22388). The subjects, who encountered toxicity during the antecedent protocol, will be assigned to a 1 milligram (mg) dose. All other subjects will be randomized in 1:1 ratio, to receive up to 2 mg or 4 mg of Serostim®, beginning from Day 1 of Week 1. Doses will be adjusted downward in subjects weighing less than 55 kilogram (kg). Serostim® therapy will be continued at the assigned doses through Week 12 (Period 1). Subjects, who will encounter toxicity during Period 1, will be assigned to the 1 mg group for Period 2. All other subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive up to 2 mg or 1 mg of Serostim® on a weight adjusted basis. Period 2 therapy will begin on Day 1 of Week 13, continuing through Week 36. Study visits are required at Screening (that is, Final Visit of the antecedent trial), Day 1 of Week 1 (Baseline), and at Weeks 2, 6, 12, 14, 24, 30 and 36.</brief_summary>

This does not apply to subjects whose study drug was temporarily stopped or whose study drug dose was reduced prior to the Final Visit (Screening), provided they continued in the antecedent protocol and are stable at the time of the Final Visit (Screening)</criteria>
