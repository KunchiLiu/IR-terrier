	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if calcium score can be used as a predictor of coronary artery disease in heart transplanted patients, as it is used in non-transplanted persons.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi Detector-Row Computed Tomography (MDCT) Calcium Score of Heart Transplanted Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have shown that a negative calcium score is a strong independent negative predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD in heart transplants (HTx) differs from CAD lesions in native hearts. The aim of this study is to see if there is a similar relation between coronary artery calcium and CAD in transplanted hearts as in native hearts.</detailed_description>
