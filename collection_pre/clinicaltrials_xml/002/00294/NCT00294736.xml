	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 1 study of escalating doses of Tarceva in patients with advanced NSCLC who currently smoke. Part I will establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Tarceva in current smokers. In Part II, patients will be randomized 1:1 to two treatment groups: Arm A (Tarceva MTD established in Part I) and Arm B (150 mg Tarceva daily). Patients in both arms will be treated for two weeks and then have pharmacokinetic samples collected on day 14. Part II is open as of Nov-2006.</brief_summary>
