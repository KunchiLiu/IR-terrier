	<brief_title>Defining the Best Approach to Block the Pain After Knee Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 patients being treated for ACL repair or knee arthroplasties under regional anesthesia will be randomized to three groups: Fascia Iliaca Block (FIB), Femoral Block (FB) with stimulating catheter or FB without stimulating catheter. A catheter will be placed according to each technique, before the surgery. A bolus of local anesthetic will be given pre-surgery and at the end of the operation, in all groups. A continuous infusion will be started for 48 hours. All patients receive a standard analgesia cocktail and rescue medication. Pain and level of activity, as well as side effects, will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
