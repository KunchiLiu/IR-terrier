	<brief_title>Short or Long Schemes of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Prostate Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prophylactic antibiotic is used to minimize the infective complications risk following transrectal biopsy of the prostate. The majority of works points to the need of antibiotic prophylaxis previously to transrectal prostate biopsy. However, there is a lot of controversy and diversity of therapeutic schemes in the literature concerning the ideal drug to be used and the time employed for infectious prophylaxis. The objective of this randomised study was to assess 2 different schemes of antimicrobial prophylaxis, aiming to determine the difference in infective complications with a single dose of ciprofloxacin 2 hours before the procedure vs. ciprofloxacin for 3 days</detailed_description>
