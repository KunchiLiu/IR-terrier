	<detailed_description>The primary aim of the present study is to improve the maintenance of weight loss, and hence the physical, psychological and social well-being, of obese patients who have sought weight loss treatment. To do so, it will implement a cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) with motivational enhancement strategies specifically designed to target weight maintenance. It is hypothesized that the maintenance-oriented CBT approach will result in sustained weight loss, as well as improved physical, psychological and social well-being.</detailed_description>
