	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the tolerability and safety of valsartan in patients with stable, chronic heart failure (NYHA Class ll-lll). The 12-week double blind study has a 2-week (maximum) screening, and a 10-week active treatment phase. In each of the treatment arms (QD and BID), patients are up-titrated to a maximum valsartan total daily dose of 320 mg. Patients remain on their prior CHF standard care therapy throughout the study period, and the up-titration of valsartan is based on patient tolerability.</brief_summary>
