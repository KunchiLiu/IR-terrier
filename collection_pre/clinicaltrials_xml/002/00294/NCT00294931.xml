	<brief_summary>This multicenter phase II trial is designed to study the unique combination of chemotherapy (irinotecan./carboplatin) and bevacizumab in the extensive-stage setting. This clinical setting seems ideal for evaluation of the role of bevacizumab in delaying progression and prolonging survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan, Carboplatin, Bevacizumab in the Treatment of Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients will receive 6 courses of irinotecan, carboplatin, and bevacizumab. The interval between chemotherapy courses will be 28 days. If after 6 courses of treatment, patient's response is a CR/PR/SD they will continue on Bevacizumab until tumor progression or up to 6 cycles (6 months) total. Treatment sequence: - Irinotecan 60mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 - Carboplatin AUC=4 day 1 only - Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg days 1 and 15</detailed_description>
