	<brief_summary>To assess equivalence in the rates of functional graft survival at 12 months after transplantation in patients receiving induction therapy with cyclosporin (CsA, Neoral) and Rapamune® followed by CsA dose reduction and concentration-controlled Rapamune® versus induction with CsA and Rapamune® followed by discontinuation of CsA and concentration-controlled Rapamune®.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age: = to ≥ 18 years. Endstage renal disease, with patients scheduled to receive a primary or secondary renal allograft from a cadaveric donor, from a livingunrelated donor, or from a livingrelated donor. Patients with second and subsequent transplants must have maintained their primary graft for at least 6 months after transplantation (with the exception of graft failure due to technical reasons). Evidence of active systemic or localised major infection prior to initial Rapamune® administration. Evidence of infiltrate, cavitation, or consolidation on chest xray obtained during screening. Use of any investigational drug or treatment up to 4 weeks prior to enrolling in the study and during the 12month treatment phase. Exception: the use of erythropoiesis stimulating products. In these cases, erythrocytestimulating products must be discontinued prior to administration of Rapamune®.</criteria>
