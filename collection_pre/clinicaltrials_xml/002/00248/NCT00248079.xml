	<criteria>1. Patient is at least 18 years old 2. Patient is an acceptable candidate for percutaneous coronary intervention and emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery 3. Patient has clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease or a positive functional study 4. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days before the trial procedure 5. Patient or patient's legal representative has been informed of the nature of the trial and agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as approved by Human Research Ethics Committee of the respective investigational site 6. Patient agrees to comply with specified followup evaluations and to return to the same investigational site where the procedure was performed. Patients participating in the PK substudy must agree to the additional followup procedures as required by the substudy 1. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin or bivalirudin, clopidogrel or ticlopidine, cobalt, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, polymer coating components or a sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be adequately premedicated 2. History of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to drugs such as ABT578, rapamycin, tacrolimus, everolimus, or any other analogue or derivative 3. Platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm³ or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm³, or a white blood cell (WBC) count &lt; 3,000 cells/mm³ 4. Serum creatinine level &gt; 170 micromol/L within 7 days prior to index procedure 5. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction within 72 hours of the intended trial procedure (defined as: Q wave myocardial infarction or nonQ wave myocardial infarction having CK enzymes &gt; 2X the laboratory upper limit of normal with the presence of an elevated CKMB (any amount above the laboratory upper limit of normal)) 6. Previous stenting anywhere in the target vessel 7. PCI of the target vessel within 30 days prior to the procedure 8. Implantation of a drug eluting stent in any nontarget vessel within 30 days prior to the procedure. Implantation of a Cypher stent in any nontarget vessel within 90 days prior to the procedure 9. PCI of a nontarget vessel with a bare metal stent within 30 days prior to the procedure that results in any MACE event. If the bare metal stent is implanted within 72 hours prior to the procedure, a post procedural serial CK or CKMB measurement above the investigational site's upper limit of normal (two below upper normal required for enrollment) 10. PCI of a nontarget vessel within 24 hours prior to the procedure 11. Planned PCI of any vessel within 30 days postprocedure. Planned stenting of any vessel with a Cypher or Endeavor stent within 60 days postprocedure 12. Planned PCI of the target vessel within 9 months postprocedure 13. During the index procedure, the target lesion requires treatment with a device other than PTCA prior to stent placement 14. History of a stroke or transient ischemic attack within the prior 6 months 15. Active peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal bleeding within the prior 6 months 16. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions 17. Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months 18. Any previous or planned treatment of the target vessel with antirestenotic therapies including, but not limited to brachytherapy 19. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device trial that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current trial endpoints; or requires coronary angiography, IVUS or other coronary artery imaging procedures 20. Documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30% at the most recent evaluation</criteria>
