	<brief_summary>Main Research questions: 1. Who are the patients referred for treatment at the Psychotic Disorders Clinic? 2. What are the outcomes from treatment for first episode psychosis in multiple outcome domains? 3. What hospital resources are used over the early course of the illness? 4. How satisfied are patients and family with the treatment and services they received? This is an important study that will help us evaluate the service and treatment offered by the Psychotic Disorders Clinic's specialized early intervention program,which helps young people experiencing early stages of psychotic illness.A growing body of evidence suggests that intervening earlier in the course of the illness with specialized and complimentary pharmacological and psychosocial treatment may be associated with improved outcomes.</brief_summary>
