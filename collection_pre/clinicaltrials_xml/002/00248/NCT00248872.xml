	<brief_summary>The long-term objective is to determine whether better adherence to prescribed medications can be achieved through positive affect induction and self-affirmation leading to reduction in hypertension-related outcomes such as end-stage renal disease, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality among African American patients with poorly controlled hypertension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial of Changing Medication Adherence In Hypertensive African-American Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this randomized trial is to evaluate, among African American patients with poorly controlled hypertension, whether a novel intervention of positive affect induction and self-affirmation is more effective than usual care in increasing adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications. The main outcome will be the change in medication adherence rate from enrollment to 12 months, which is defined as percentage (%) of prescribed doses taken by the patient during the interval of observation as measured by electronic medication event monitoring system (MEMS). 2. Secondary objectives 1. To determine, among African American patients with poorly controlled hypertension, the extent to which positive affect induction and self-affirmation influence patients' self-efficacy. 2. To determine, among African American patients with poorly controlled hypertension, the extent to which positive affect induction and self-affirmation influence medication adherence in those with significant depressive symptomatology (CES-D score &gt; 16). 3. To determine, among African-American patients with poorly controlled hypertension, the extent to which positive affect induction and self-affirmation influence blood pressure control. 4. To explore the health beliefs of hypertensive African-American patients, regarding the meaning, causes and treatment of hypertension. In addition, the factors that facilitate and prevent adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications will also be explored using a qualitative approach.</detailed_description>
