	<brief_summary>Serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, such as sertraline, are the medication of choice in post-traumatic stress disorder. However, it takes several weeks before they ameliorate symptoms. Therefore, we will add ziprasidone (vs. placebo) medication during the first four weeks of sertraline in order to find out if this strategy accelerates symptomatic relief.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ziprasidone and Sertraline in PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A current problem in the pharmacotherapy of PTSD is that the medication of choice, serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, take several weeks before they show considerable effects on PTSD symptoms. Addition of typical neuroleptics, such as ziprasidone, offers a potential strategy to bring about a faster symptomatic relief, because they display anxiolytic properties without the risk of dependence. Therefore, in addition to standard sertraline therapy (at least 8 weeks), we will give ziprasidone vs. placebo over the first four weeks in a double-blind randomized design.</detailed_description>
