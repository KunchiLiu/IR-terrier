	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with docetaxel works in treating patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine and Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Persistent, Recurrent, or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate in patients with previously treated persistent, recurrent, or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with gemcitabine and docetaxel. Secondary - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the duration of response and survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 4 additional courses of therapy beyond documentation of CR. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-41 patients will be accrued within 42-49 months.</detailed_description>
