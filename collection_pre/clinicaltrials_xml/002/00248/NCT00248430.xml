	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. An autologous stem cell transplant using the patient's stem cells may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. Giving white blood cells from a donor may help the patient's body destroy any remaining cancer cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate the white blood cells to kill cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of donor white blood cell infusions and interleukin-2 and to see how well they work in treating patients who are undergoing an autologous stem cell transplant for relapsed advanced lymphoid cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donor White Blood Cell Infusions and Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant for Relapsed Advanced Lymphoid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the feasibility and toxicity of haploidentical related donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) and interleukin-2, in terms of acute graft-versus-host-disease, graft failure, and transplant-related mortality, in patients with relapsed advanced lymphoid malignancies undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation. Secondary - Determine the extent, degree, and duration of donor chimerism in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine, preliminarily, activity of haploidentical DLI, as measured by complete response rate, in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV over 15-60 minutes on day -2 and undergo autologous stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients receive haploidentical related donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) IV on days 1, 5*, and 10* and interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV continuously on days 1-12. NOTE: *DLI are not administered on days 5 or 10 if grade 3 or 4 graft-versus-host disease is present After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then every 3-12 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
