	<detailed_description>Specific aims: Among 213 Latino adult patients who have had coronary artery angioplasty within the past month, the specific aims of the proposed study are: 1. To determine whether patients who have more depressive symptoms at the time of angioplasty are less likely to be active in physical activity at two years. Physical activity will be measured by a survey that asks patients to describe their activities including leisure activities or housework. 2. To determine whether lower perceived social support, lower self-efficacy for engaging in physical activity, and greater perceived stress mediate the effects of depressive symptoms on participation in physical activity. Long-term objectives: The long-term objective of this study is to use these data to develop a culturally tailored intervention to increase participation in physical activity and ultimately improve the overall health and well being of Latino adults with coronary artery disease. Outcome: The outcome is being in the action or maintenance stage of physical activity two years after angioplasty The stage of physical activity participation will be based on the Stages of Change model. This model describes behavior change as a continuum from pre-contemplation to contemplation.</detailed_description>
