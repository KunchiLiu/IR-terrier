	<brief_summary>This study intends to assess the ability of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in the detection of benign and malignant ovarian masses compared to unenhanced ultrasound. By using an intravascular contrast agent, this noninvasive and feasible imaging technique will allow the investigators to define specific microcirculation patterns in 100 women with ovarian lesions. The intravascular contrast agent properties will be compared between benign and malignant adnexal masses. The final purpose of this ultrasonography is to allow the early detection of tumors and to improve the characterization between benign and malignant lesions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SonoVue (Sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles) is a microbubbles preparation that is stable, resistant to pressure and specifically designed to be used as a contrast agent for ultrasound imaging. Study design : one contrast-enhanced ultrasonography is proposed before any surgery to patients with ovarian mass.</detailed_description>
