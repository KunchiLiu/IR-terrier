	<brief_title>ICP Versus Intracranial Compliance Guided Management in SAH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study SAH-patients are randomized to treatment based on international standard care (ICP/CPP guided therapy) or intracranial compliance (ICP mean wave amplitude) guided therapy in addition to ICP/CPP guided therapy. Main outcome variables are survival and neurological outcome after 3 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
