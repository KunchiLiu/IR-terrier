	<brief_summary>The long-term objective of this study is to determine whether a positive affect and self-affirmation condition added to an empirically demonstrated approach for motivating behavior change is more effective than a standard approach in reducing risk factor behavior among a high-risk group of patients with coronary artery disease. Thus, the goal of the project is to refine and improve strategies for long-term maintenance of physical activity among patients post-angioplasty or stent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial: Changing Behavior in Post-Angioplasty Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among coronary artery disease patients who have just had either angioplasty or stents, the objective of this randomized trial is to evaluate whether a novel behavioral intervention that employs induced positive affect and self-affirmation is more effective than an intervention without positive affect in increasing the maintenance of newly initiated physical activity post-procedure. Secondary objectives: - To determine whether more patients who receive the positive affect and self-affirmation intervention initiate more multiple behavior changes (e.g., changes in more health behaviors directed to their risk-factor profile) than those in the control group at one year. - To determine whether the positive affect and self-affirmation intervention increases physical activity among patients who have depressive symptoms. - To determine whether patients who are successful in increasing physical activity are more successful at changing other health behaviors.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patients undergoing coronary artery catheterization who are found to have at least single vessel stenosis and who have had revascularization with angioplasty or coronary artery stenting will be eligible for enrollment. Patients must be able to provide informed consent within the one week after the procedure. Patients who are unable to walk several blocks regardless of the reason will be excluded from all the trials (e.g., arthritis, stroke, claudication). Enrollment in other trials designed to modify postprocedure behaviors. Patients who refuse to participate will be excluded. If at any time prior to enrollment in the study, the patient's cardiologist determines that the patient should not participate in this study, the patient will not be enrolled in the trial.</criteria>
