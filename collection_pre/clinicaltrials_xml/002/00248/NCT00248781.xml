	<brief_title>Home-based Exercise Via a Telecommunications System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle have been shown to accelerate and exaggerate the age-related decline in muscle strength. In this context, a rapid decline in strength among older adults has been linked to physical frailty, falls, functional decline, impaired mobility, and nursing home placement. Substantial evidence now suggests that habitual physical activity is associated with the maintenance of muscle strength and physical function well into the 8th and 9th decades of life. We propose to investigate the effects of a home-based resistance exercise program, administered via an interactive telecommunications system without the participation of health professionals, in functionally limited older veterans. Subjects will be randomized to either the automated exercise group or an attention placebo control group. The exercise group will undergo resistance training at home three times a week for 6 months, guided by the telecommunications system, followed by a 6-month maintenance phase of less frequent interaction with the system. Outcome measurements will include muscle strength and physical performance related to daily activities at 3, 6, and 12 months to determine the efficacy of the intervention and the time course and durability of the effect. The control group will also interact with the telecommunications system once a week for the whole year, but no exercise will be prescribed. If this home-based, automated, interactive exercise program is effective, it will provide a low-cost easily disseminated approach to improving the strength and functional status of older veterans</detailed_description>
