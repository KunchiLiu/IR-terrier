	<brief_title>Early Aerobic Training Program After Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and efficacy of an early supervised aerobic exercise program for patients following a minor ischemic stroke. Patients after a minor ischemic stroke would be randomized within 1-3 weeks of stroke onset to a control group (6 weeks of low intensity stretching and coordination exercises followed by a supervised aerobic training program) or an experimental group (immediate aerobic training program). Patients will be evaluated for measures of ambulation endurance, mobility, gait, functional assessment and clinical follow-up after 6 weeks and again 3 months later.</detailed_description>
