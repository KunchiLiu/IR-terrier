	<brief_title>Resistance Exercise Training for the Shoulder and Neck Following Surgery for Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will be conducting a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of progressive resistance exercise training (PRET) on shoulder and neck dysfunction due to spinal accessory neurapraxia/ neurectomy in patients with head and neck cancer. Sixty-four head and neck cancer survivors will be randomly assigned to PRET or standard care. Participants assigned to the PRET group will exercise 3 times per week for 12 weeks. The goal of the exercise program will be to enhance scapular stability, and improve mobility and strength of the upper extremity. The resistance exercise program will be progressive in terms of the number of sets and repetitions performed, as well as amount lifted, depending on baseline strength levels and overall performance status. The primary outcomes for the study include pain and dysfunction, active and passive range of motion measures, strength and endurance testing, and quality of life. Nerve conduction testing and electromyography will be performed to assess/ monitor the status of the spinal accessory nerve and trapezius muscle function respectively.</detailed_description>
