	<brief_summary>This research is being done to evaluate if NRP104 is a safe drug. The other purpose is to learn if NRP104 produces a high and any other effects like amphetamine and other stimulant drugs that are abused. This information will give some indication if NRP104 can be abused. NRP104 is an investigational drug. This means that it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Healthy people, between the ages of 18 and 55 with histories of substance abuse that include stimulant drugs, may join. Amphetamines are drugs that are used most often to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, to treat narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness) and for weight loss.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Likeability, Safety, and Abuse Potential of NRP 104 in Adults With Histories of Stimulant Abuse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a need for a less abusable stimulant medication that can provide symptom control for children with ADHD as compared to the conventional stimulant products. Currently, the top line amphetamine product Adderall XR(R) for the treatment of children with ADHD involves a once-a-day morning dosing of up to 30 mg per day per Adderall XR(R) Package Insert. Adderall XR(R) has potential for abuse and is hence is classified as a schedule II product. As part of the development of NRP104 for treatment of children with ADHD, it is important to evaluate the abuse potential of NRP104 in comparison to immediate release d-amphetamine. A previous exploratory dose ranging study (NRP104.A01) with NRP104 demonstrated that doses of NRP104 up to 150 mg are safe and produce effects equal to or less than 40 mg of immediate release d-amphetamine. When compared with those of d-amphetamine, diethylproion produced effects qualitatively similar to those of d-amphetamine but were significantly less potent. Intravenous and subcutaneous routes diethylpropion was less potent as compared to oral route (Jasinski et al; 1974). This larger study is designed to compare the abuse potential of NRP104 with the Schedule II d-amphetamine sulfate and the Schedule IV diethylpropion hydrochloride. Data collected from this study will be used to evaluate the abuse potential of NRP104.</detailed_description>

Subject must voluntarily consent to participate in this study. Able to swallow the study medication whole. History of clinically significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrine, oncologic, hematologic, neurologic, psychologic, immunologic or pulmonary disorders; or cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, epilepsy, diabetes, psychosis, glaucoma, or any condition which in the opinion of the Investigator would jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact study results or prevent the subject from completing the study. Presence or history of any medically diagnosed, clinically significant Axis I psychiatric disorders other than substance abuse (including bipolar disorder, any psychotic disorder, and Tourette's disorder or family history of Tourette's). Serious suicidal risk determined by the investigator. Presence of a severe learning difficulty or mental retardation, or any condition that would interfere with participation or completion of the study.

Blood loss, donation of one pint or more, or plasma donation within 60 days prior to study initiation. Clinically significant abnormalities at screening or admission on results of ECG or lab tests, including lab deviations requiring acute medical intervention or further medical attention. Treated with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, currently or within 13 days of initiation of the study medication. Require any of the following medications: clonidine or other alpha2 adrenergic receptor agonists, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) theophylline, coumarin anticoagulants, or anticonvulsants; or have taken an SSRI in the 35 days before initiation of the study medication. Currently physically dependent on benzodiazepines as determined by clinical evaluation and/or urine drug screen at screening. Currently physically dependent on opiates as determined by naloxone challenge. Currently physically dependent on alcohol as determined by clinical evaluation or has a confirmed positive Breathalyzer test at screening or admission. Preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing. Use of any prescription medications (except birth control) within 14 days of admission, or will require any prescription medications, or any overthecounter (OTC) medications (other than acetaminophen), or herbal supplements or vitamins during the study. Positive urine pregnancy test at screening or admission. Female subject is pregnant or lactating. Related to any person directly or indirectly involved with the conduct of the study or currently participating in the study.</criteria>
