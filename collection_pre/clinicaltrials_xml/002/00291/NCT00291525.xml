	<brief_summary>Various patient groups with the On-X Valve can be maintained safely on lower doses of blood thinner(Coumadin®) or on antiplatelet drugs (aspirin/Plavix®) only rather than the standard dose of Coumadin and aspirin presently recommended by ACC/AHA or ACCP professional societies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized On-X Anticoagulation Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a longitudinal, randomized (randomization to occur at the 3 month follow-up) study comparing the On-X valve on low dose anticoagulation (test group) to concomitant control groups of On-X valves receiving standard Coumadin/aspirin therapy, and also to FDA objective performance criteria (OPC) for heart valve replacement. It is a multicenter study consisting of 20 centers in the United States enrolling no more than 1200 patients (200 in each of 6 groups). There are three test arms of the study: low risk aortic valve replacement, high risk aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement. Each arm has an equivalent control. Test therapies are: low risk aortic valve replacement - aspirin/Plavix, high risk aortic valve replacement - Coumadin at INR of 1.5 to 2.0 plus aspirin, and mitral valve replacement - Coumadin at an INR of 2.0 to 2.5 plus aspirin. Follow-up will run for 5 years in each patient.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients requiring isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR), or isolated mitral valve replacement (MVR). AVR patients receiving low dose or antiplatelet only anticoagulation will be divided into groups at low risk and high risk for thromboembolism with all patients being in the low risk group except for patients with the following conditions which place a patient in the high risk group: Chronic atrial fibrillation Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30 % Enlarged left atrium &gt;50mm diameter Spontaneous echo contrasts in the left atrium Vascular pathology Neurological events Hypercoagulability Left or right ventricular aneurysm Lack of platelet response to aspirin or clopidogrel Women receiving estrogen replacement therapy Concomitant cardiac surgery is allowed Adult patients Right side valve replacement Double (aortic plus mitral) valve replacement Patients with active endocarditis at the time of implant Previous confirmed or suspected thromboembolic event or thrombophlebitis Other terminal illness Patients who are in an emergency state Inability to return for required followups Patients with an OnX valve implanted within the study and subsequently explanted Patients who are known to be pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are lactating Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or know to be HIV positive Patients who are prison inmates or known drug or alcohol abusers Patients unable to give adequate informed consent.</criteria>
