	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is complicated by considerable cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, at least partly due to hypertension. Nocturnal hypoxia, hypercapnia and acidosis stimulate chemoreceptors and presumably increased secretion of vasoactive hormones which might be responsible for hypertension in these patients. The aim of this study is to measure the secretion of vasoactive hormones at night and to analyse the relationship between vasoactive hormones, oxygen saturation and the blood pressure at night.</brief_summary>
