	<brief_summary>The immune response of uraemic patients to hepatitis B vaccination is impaired compared to healthy subjects. After vaccination, anti-HBs peak antibody concentrations are reduced. As the persistence of anti-HBs is closely related to the initial anti-HBs peak, a more immunogenic vaccine, allowing higher antibody concentrations, would be a benefit for this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Compare the Immune Response and Safety Elicited by Henogen's Adjuvanted Hepatitis B Vaccine Compared to Aventis Pasteur MSD's Hepatitis B Vaccine in Pre-Dialysis and Dialysis Patients Who Responded to Previous Hepatitis B Vaccination But Lost Antibody.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participants will receive either Henogen's adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine or Aventis Pasteur's hepatitis B vaccine. The study involves a total of 3 visits and blood samples will taken at each of these visits.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects whom the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g., completion of the diary cards, return for followup visits) should be enrolled in the study. A male or female subject 15 years of age or older at the time of the study entry. Written informed consent obtained from the subject/ subject's parents or guardians. Predialysis patients, peritoneal dialysis patients and patients on haemodialysis. Predialysis patients is defined as a subject with a documented creatinine clearance of les or equal to 30 ml/min. Seronegative for antiHBc antibodies and for HBsAg at screening. Documented previous hepatitis B vaccination with one full primary course of licensed vaccine (the cumulative dose for primary vaccination is at least 160 mg of hepatitis B vaccine) with or without subsequent boosters. The last dose should have been administered at least three months before the planned dose of study vaccine in this study. Documented response to previous hepatitis B vaccination (i.e. antiHBs antibody concentrations ³ 10 mIU/ml after primary vaccination or after booster/s with licensed vaccine), but for whom there is a loss of antiHBs antibody concentrations below 10 mIU/ml at the time of inclusion into the study. Patients who have antibody concentrations below 50 mIU/ml at the time of inclusion will also be recruited provided that this antibody concentration is less than half of the highest documented antibody response achieved after primary vaccination or booster/s. The interval between the blood sample corresponding to the documented response and the hepatitis B vaccine dose received prior to this blood sample should be at least 25 days If the subject is female, she must be of nonchildbearing potential, i.e., either surgically sterilized or one year postmenopausal; or, if of childbearing potential, she must be abstinent or have used medicallyapproved contraceptive precautions for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and must agree to continue such precautions for two months after completion of the vaccination series. Subjects who have participated in the HN014/HBV001 or HN017/HBV003 study Use of any investigational or nonregistered drug or vaccine within 30 days preceding the study vaccine administration, or planned use during the study period. Use of any registered vaccine within 7 days preceding the study vaccine administration. History of hepatitis B infection. Known exposure to hepatitis B virus within six months. Use of immunoglobulins within six months preceding the first study vaccination. Immunosuppression caused by the administration of parenteral steroids or chemotherapy (oral steroids are allowed). Any confirmed or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. (Acute disease is defined as the presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever. All vaccines can be administered to persons with a minor illness such as diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection with or without lowgrade febrile illness, i.e., oral/ axillary temperature &lt; 37.5°C (or 37 °C in Czech Republic). Oral/axillary temperature equal or superior to 37.5 °C (or 37 °C in Czech Republic). Pregnant or lactating female</criteria>
