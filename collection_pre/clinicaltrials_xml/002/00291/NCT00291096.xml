	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this project is to develop an integrative system of breast cancer risk assessment based on epidemiologic and biologic risk variables, as well as to develop or refine risk biomarkers which may be useful in predicting and monitoring response to prevention interventions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protocol for Women at Increased Risk of Developing Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To correlate established risk biomarkers such as cytomorphology obtained from random periareolar fine needle aspiration ( RPFNA), mammographic breast density, serum bioavailable estradiol and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 with each other and with 5-10 year Gail risk estimates. Where available, and with appropriate safe guards to maintain status for breast cancer susceptibility genes may be included. 2. To determine the relative predictive value of established risk biomarkers for the development of DCIS and/or invasive cancer. 3. To evaluate potential new breast tissue-based biomarkers including Ki-67, PCNA, ER, COX-2, aromatase, methylation of key tumor suppressor genes (i.e., RAR, p16, etc), proteomic patterns in RPFNA and nipple aspirate fluid (NAF), as well as NAF hormone levels, and correlate them with other risk biomarkers listed in 1. 4. To determine the prevalence of polymorphisms of a panel of genes important in hormone and xenobiotic metabolism as well as DNA repair and correlate these polymorphisms with established risk biomarkers listed in 1, as well as with development of DCIS and invasive cancer. 5. To maintain contact with this initially identified cohort of high risk women, acquire demographic data, biologic specimens and data and follow them prospectively for the development.</detailed_description>
