	<brief_summary>A pilot study to assess the effects of six months of letrozole on breast tissue risk markers in postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy at high risk of developing breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protocol for Women at Increased Risk of Developing Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A pilot study of letrozole in postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy at high risk of developing breast cancer. Subjects will have hyperplasia with atypia (or borderline Epithelial Hyperplasia/Atypical Hyperplasia) and evidence of Estrogen Receptor expression by random periareolar fine needle aspiration and baseline serum estradiol levels less than or equal to 150 pg/ml. The feasibility of performing RT-qPCR on breast specimens for aromatase expression will also be done at baseline.</detailed_description>
