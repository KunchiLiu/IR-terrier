	<brief_summary>Management of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, relies upon the health care providers and the patients self-care. Self management programs for diabetes that target self-empowerment tools have been found to be effective in some studies, but have not typically included individuals on Medicaid. Our goal for this trial was to observe if patients participating in such a program could decrease glycated hemoglobin levels, improve health status and improve self-care practices.</brief_summary>
