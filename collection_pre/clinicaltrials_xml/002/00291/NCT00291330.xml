	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to determine the comparative safety and efficacy of dabigatran etexilate 150 mg bid administered orally and warfarin as needed (pro re nata - prn) to maintain an International Normalised Ratio (INR) of 2.0-3.0 for 6 month treatment of acute symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE), following initial treatment (5-10 days) with a parenteral anticoagulant approved for this indication. This trial aims to demonstrate non-inferiority of dabigatran compared with warfarin in patients with acute symptomatic VTE. After achieving non-inferiority, this trial also aims to establish superiority (by means of hierarchical tests) of dabigatran over warfarin.</brief_summary>
