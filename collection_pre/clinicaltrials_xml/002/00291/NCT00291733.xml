	<brief_summary>Levodopa-induced dyskinesias have been associated with irregular oscillatory discharge characteristics of basal ganglia. From the other hand, LEV which shares a different electrophysiologic profile than other antiepileptics, inhibits hyper-synchronization of abnormal neuronal firing in experimental models of epilepsy. LEV also reduces levodopa-induced dyskinesias in MPTP-lesioned macaques and modulates "priming phenomenon" which associated with long-term changes in synaptic function that can lead to dyskinesias in PD. Study objectives : - To evaluate the effects of levetiracetam (LEV) in two doses (500 and 1000mg) vs placebo on disabling dyskinesias that develop as result of long-term treatment with levodopa, occurring at the time of maximal clinical improvement in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). - To evaluate the safety of LEV in patients with PD and antiparkinsonian medication.</brief_summary>
