	<brief_summary>This double-blind, stratified, parallel group study is to determine whether aiming for 'Total control' results in better airway hyper-responsiveness than maintaining the treatment level at which 'Well-controlled' asthma was achieved. The primary endpoint is the mean change in PC20 methacholine. Well controlled subjects (as assessed after a 12 week run-in period) will enter a 24 week treatment period during which they will record PEF(Peak Expiratory Flow), symptoms, rescue beta2-agonist use over 24 hours, night time awakenings, asthma exacerbations, emergency visits due to asthma and Adverse Events. At every visit lung function measurements and airway hyper-responsiveness will be measured.</brief_summary>
