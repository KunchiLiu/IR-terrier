	<detailed_description>The goal of the present study is to investigate the effectiveness of Condrosulf速 800 mg tablets vs. placebo once a day for 6 months in the symptomatic treatment of finger joint osteoarthritis in 160 randomised patients. Primary endpoints: Primary endpoints of the study are the evaluation of global spontaneous pain (Huskisson's Visual Analogue Scale: VAS) and the score of Dreiser's algo-functional index (FIHOA) during the treatment with the tested product, Condrosulf速, versus placebo. Secondary endpoints are: Efficacy evaluation: Global impression of efficacy expressed by the patient and the physician (VAS), Grip strength (measured manometrically); Morning stiffness duration; Consumption of Paracetamol; Tolerability (4-point verbal scale); Adverse Events occurring during the treatment period; Other parameters:Treatment compliance; Biological markers of arthritis</detailed_description>
