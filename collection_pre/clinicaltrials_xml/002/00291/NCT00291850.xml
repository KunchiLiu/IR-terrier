	<brief_title>Phase II Trial of Dose-dense Paclitaxel and Cisplatin as Neo-adjuvant Chemotherapy for Operable Stage II and IIA NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, single-arm Phase II study of dose-dense regimen with paclitaxel and cisplatin supported by pegfilgrastim as neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with operable stage II, IIA NSCLC. Paclitaxel will be administered via intravenous infusion over approximately 3 hours at dose of 175mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle. Cisplatin 75mg/m2 will be given via intravenous infusion on day 1 (after paclitaxel) according to institutional guidelines. Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) fixed dose of 6mg (0.6mL of a 10mg/mL solution) as a single subcutaneous injection on Day 2 of each study cycle. All drugs will be given in 2-weekly cycle. Three cycles of pre-operative chemotherapy are planned.</detailed_description>
