	<brief_summary>Regular exercise is strongly recommended to help maintain a healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately, children and young adults with damaged spinal cords may not be able to exercise regularly. However, there is an exercise bike specially designed for persons with damaged spinal cords that enables them to pedal by directly stimulating the muscles in their legs. Our study is designed to determine the benefits of exercise for Spinal Cord Injured (SCI) patients using this bike.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of FES on Children With Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The inability to walk due to spinal cord dysfunction has profound effects on patients, both physiologically and psychologically. Complications associated with walking upright include loss of muscle mass from atrophy, reduction in bone mineral density (osteoporosis), compromised cardiovascular endurance, loss of sense of well-being, etc. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) of the lower extremities has been found to reverse many of these complications. We propose to examine the use of FES in children who have suffered from spinal cord injury (SCI). We plan to examine the effect of FES bike therapy on bone mineral density and psychological well-being.</detailed_description>
