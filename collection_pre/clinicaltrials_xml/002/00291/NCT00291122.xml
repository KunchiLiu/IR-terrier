	<brief_title>An Examination of Predictors of Indicators of Response to Celecoxib in Women Who Have a Diagnosis of Early Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess the quantitative real time PCR results of oligonucleotide probes for a number of gene transcription products that may be useful as predictors or indicators of response to celecoxib, the feasibility of performing six different molecular assays by qRTPCR on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue obtained from breast cancer core biopsies and breast cancer reexcision patients, to assess change in Ki-67, PCNA, and several other markers by qRTPCR, correlate change in expression of Ki-67, PCNA, CAX-2, and bcl-2, measured by immunohistochemistry to change measured by qRTPCR, and to determine the reliability of the qRTPCR and immunohistochemical assays by performed selected assays on the same tissue in two different institutions</detailed_description>

	<criteria>women with a recent diagnosis of T1 or T2 noninvasive breast cancer by large core needle or excisional biopsy confirmation that tissue was processed in methods acceptable to protocol and sufficient tissue remains post diagnostic analyses to perform research assessments reexcision planned within 10 days to 6 weeks from study start no hormone replacement therapy within 90 days prior to biopsy no history of asthma, allergy ASA, NSAIDS, celecoxib of other COX2 inhibitors for a chronic nononcological condition with the excision of low dose ASA (160 mg daily) during 4 weeks prior to biopsy and for the duration of the study no celecoxib or rofecoxib use within one month of biopsy no history of gastrointestinal ulcer or ulcerative colitis requiring treatment no current anticoagulants no neoadjuvant antihormone or chemotherapy as treatment following biopsy prior to study entry or concurrently with participation on study no aromatase inhibitor in the six months prior to participation no concomitant lithium no known significant bleeding disorder</criteria>
