	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is primarily to investigate the safety profile of HuMax-CD20 in patients with active RA. Furthermore, the trial is designed to identify the dose levels to be used in future trials (based on evaluations of safety, pharmacokinetics and ACR and DAS responses).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HuMax-CD20 in Active Rheumatoid Arthritis, Phase I/II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial consists of a double-blind, placebo controlled, dose escalation part with randomization to trial treatment within each of three sequential cohorts (Part A), and a parallel group part with randomization into one of four treatment arms (Part B). Patients in Parts A and B will receive two infusions of either HuMax-CD20 (300 mg, 700 mg, or 1000 mg) or placebo and will be followed for safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic measurements for 24 weeks. Hereafter patients will be followed every 12 weeks until B-cells (CD19+ cells) have returned to baseline levels. For patients in Part B, the follow-up visits at 36 and 48 weeks after initial trial treatment (Follow-up Visits 1 and 2) will include additional measurements of safety and efficacy.</detailed_description>
