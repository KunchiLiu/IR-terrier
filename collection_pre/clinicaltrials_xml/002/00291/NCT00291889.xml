	<brief_summary>Vaccination against tuberculosis (TB) /healthy PPD-negative adults aged 18 to 45 years.Three doses of primary vaccination followed by a booster dose after completion of primary vaccination course. Booster vaccination will be given only to subjects receiving the candidate tuberculosis vaccines and not to the subjects receiving active comparators or control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity of GSK Biological's Candidate Tuberculosis Vaccine Mtb72F/AS02 in Healthy PPD-negative Adults.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety and immunogenicity of 2 antigen doses in PPD-negative adults will be evaluated. In addition, 2 active comparator groups of volunteers will receive the vaccine alone without an immunostimulant and 1 control group will receive the adjuvant (AS02) alone to assess the true effect of the candidate tuberculosis vaccine (Mtb72F/AS02).</detailed_description>
