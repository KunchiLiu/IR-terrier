	<brief_title>Myocardial Regeneration and Angiogenesis in Myocardial Infarction With G-CSF and Intra-Coronary Stem Cell Infusion-3-DES</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MAGIC Cell-DES trial was designed as a randomized, controlled trial to recruit 100 patients with AMI and OMI. Patients who were successfully revascularized with DES in the culprit lesion were eligible for enrollment. After revascularization, patients were randomized by use of a randomization table. After randomization, study processes were not blinded. In the cell infusion groups after successful PCI, PBSCs were mobilized by daily subcutaneous injections of G-CSF (Dong-A pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea) at 10 g/kg body weight for three days. At day 4, mobilized PBSCs were collected with COBE spectra apheresis system (COBE BCT. Inc., Lakewood, CO, USA) using the mononuclear cell collection methods and infused selectively to infarcted myocardium via over-the-wire balloon catheter. The primary end point to evaluate efficacy was the change in LVEF, measured by MRI. The secondary end points were changes in LV volume, myocardial perfusion measured by coronary flow reserve (CFR), and the development of major adverse cardiac events (MACE; death, new MI, revascularization, hospitalization due to aggravation of ischemia or heart failure).</detailed_description>
