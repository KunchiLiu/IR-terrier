	<brief_summary>To assess the efficacy of dronedarone versus placebo for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm after electrical, pharmacological or spontaneous conversion of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFL). To assess the efficacy of dronedarone versus placebo on AF/AFL-related symptoms. To assess the efficacy of dronedarone versus placebo on ventricular rate control in case of AF/AFL recurrence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EURopean Trial In Atrial Fibrillation(AF) or Flutter (AFL) Patients Receiving Dronedarone for the maIntenance of Sinus Rhythm (EURIDIS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, parallel arm, placebo-controlled, multicentre, multinational, phase III study. To be eligible, patients must be in normal sinus rhythm at randomisation and must have an ECG-documented history of recent AF/AFL reverted to normal sinus rhythm by electrical, pharmacological or spontaneous conversion</detailed_description>
