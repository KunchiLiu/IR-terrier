	<brief_summary>Polyneuropathy associated with anti-MAG monoclonal IgM gammopathy is responsive of mainly a sensory deficit in predominantly males ,aged 40-70 years. Significantly high serum anti-MAG antibodies are linked with demyelinating features of the peripheral nerves.Rituximab, an anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody is a new drug which reduces B-lymphocytes. This study will test the safety and efficacy of rituximab in the treatment of patients with anti-MAG polyneuropathy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RIMAG Study: Trial of Rituximab Versus Placebo in Polyneuropathy Associated With Anti-MAG IgM Monoclonal Gammopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acting of a polyneuropathy for which there is not any treatment of reference today (see supra), a test of double-knowledge versus placebo is justified. Acting of a chronic polyneuropathy, the clinical evaluation must be led over one one year period. Acting of a sensitive polyneuropathy and the awaited benefit being the IMPROVEMENT OF the CLINICAL SIGNS, the principal criterion is a sensitive score in addition validated in chronic sensitive polyneuropathies immunodeficiency syndrome. The patients answering the criteria of inclusion and none inclusion (see V-2) will be randomized in 2 groups: the first group will receive a perfusion IV of rituximab to the amount of 375 mg/m2 of body surface, once per week, during 4 weeks (see VII-3); the second group will receive 4 perfusions IV of placebo according to same methods'. The evaluation (see VI-1) will be carried out at the time of the randomization, then repeated in 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year.</detailed_description>
