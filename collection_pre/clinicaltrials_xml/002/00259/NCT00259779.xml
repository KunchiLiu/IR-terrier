	<criteria>Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and an acute exacerbation After the acute treatment a simple pulmonary function test shows a value of 30%60% of the predicted normal value. Patients, who, based on the clinical examination after the initial acute treatment, are candidates for a course of oral steroids for the treatment of acute symptoms due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Diagnosis/history of asthma Oxygen uptake (saturation) is &lt;92% after the initial acute treatment A requirement for regular use of oxygen therapy Regular treatment with any inhaled steroid &gt;1 000 µg/day at study entry Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria will be evaluated by the investigator</criteria>
