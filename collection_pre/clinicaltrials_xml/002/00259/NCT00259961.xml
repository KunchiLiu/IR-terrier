	<brief_summary>Long-term results following laparoscopic and open Nissen fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux will be objectively assessed in a selected population of patients already included in a randomized controlled trial comparing the two different techniques. The presence of postoperative symptoms will be evaluated by an independent clinician using an objective questionnaire. The recurrence of gastro-oesophageal reflux will be studied by 24-hours pH study. Furthermore the presence of gastric motility disorders will be studied by electrogastrography and 13C-octanoic acid breath test.</brief_summary>
