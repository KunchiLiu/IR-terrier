	<brief_title>Insulin Resistance and Vessel Function After Meals: Does Early Intervention Make a Difference?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background:Insulin Resistance (IR) is accompanied by a high incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease. IR is present in individuals with pre-diabetes/ type 2 diabetes. Epidemiological data demonstrate a tight relationship between postprandial blood sugar, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Endothelial dysfunction seems to be the very first sign of CVD. Purpose: We propose to determine whether attenuation /normalization of post-prandial hyperglycaemia, through the administration of an oral hypoglycaemic agent of ultra rapid action (nateglinide), ameliorates endothelial function in the IR. We extrapolate that a better endothelial function in the brachial artery reflects regression of atherosclerotic changes in the coronary system. Method and Study Design: Prospective, open, parallel, group comparison study of 1 intervention group, 1 intervention control group and 1 disease control group. The intervention group and the intervention control group each consist of 30 individuals with IR. Individuals in the intervention group receive an individually adjusted dose of nateglinide 3 times daily during 12 weeks. The third group consists of 10 healthy, young individuals. All groups are followed during 3 months with an otherwise unchanged lifestyle. Endothelial function is measured with the Flow Mediated Dilation method before and after the intervention/observation period.</detailed_description>
