	<brief_summary>To assess the efficacy of dronedarone versus placebo for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm after electrical, pharmacological or spontaneous conversion of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFL). To assess the efficacy of dronedarone versus placebo on ventricular rate control in case of AF/AFL recurrence. To assess the efficacy of dronedarone versus placebo on AF/AFL-related symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>American-Australian-African Trial With Dronedarone in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation or Atrial Flutter for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, parallel arm, placebo-controlled, multicentre, multinational, phase III study. To be eligible, patients must be in normal sinus rhythm at randomisation and must have an ECG-documented history of recent AF/AFL reverted to normal sinus rhythm by electrical, pharmacological or spontaneous conversion.</detailed_description>
