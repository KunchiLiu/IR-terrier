	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if retarded phosphatidylcholine is as effective as mesalazin in preventing an acute episode in ulcerative colitis. The hypothesis is, that ulcerative colitis is cuased by a defect in the barrier function of the colonic mucus. The background of the study is the finding that the phosphatidylcholine content of the colonic mucus is reduced in patients with ulcerative colitis, in both healthy and inflamed parts of the colon.</brief_summary>
