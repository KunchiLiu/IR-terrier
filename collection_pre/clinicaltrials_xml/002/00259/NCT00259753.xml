Patients must have ETDRS best corrected visual acuity of 64 to 24 letters (20/50 to 20/320 Snellen Equivalent) in the study eye. 3. Patients must be age 50 or older 1. Patients who have received prior treatment with any investigational new drug or device for wet AMD in the study eye within 24 weeks of the screening visit. 2. Patients with advanced glaucoma (greater than 0.8 cup:disk) or intraocular pressure above 22 mmHg in the study eye. 3. Patients with any retinal vasculopathies, including diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusions, etc. in the study eye. 4. Patients with any subfoveal scarring, atrophy, or hemorrhage in the study eye. 5. Patients whose CNV lesion in the study eye contains more than 25% scarring and/or atrophy. 6. Patients who have undergone any extrafoveal/juxtafoveal laser treatment of the study eye within two weeks prior to the screening visit. 7.
