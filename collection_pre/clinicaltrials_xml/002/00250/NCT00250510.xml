	<brief_title>Reimbursement Effects on Enrollment in Obesity Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective study to determine whether a reimbursement incentive (the prospect of reimbursement of half of the out-of-pocket fee for participation in the UAB EatRight Weight Management Program, when it is contingent upon consistent Program participation and loss of 6% of initial body weight) is associated with (1) a higher rate of Program enrollment and (2) greater percent weight loss, greater reductions in medication dosages and costs, and fewer visits to health care providers after 12 weeks and 9 months.</detailed_description>
