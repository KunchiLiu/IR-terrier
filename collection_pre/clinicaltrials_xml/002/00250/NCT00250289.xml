	<brief_title>Prevention of Oral Malodor With an Oral Sticker Containing Herbal Formula</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral malodor (Halitosis, Fetor ex ora) is a common and disturbing condition, affecting according to some studies about one quarter of the population. This condition may start at any time from early childhood through adolescence, adulthood and old age and vary in character and severity.The bacteria responsible for malodor production are for the most part Gram negative oral bacteria (2- 4) such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia. These bacteria reside on various locations within the oral cavity (e.g. tongue dorsum, interdental space, periodontal pockets, tonsils) and breakdown salivary and oral proteins into their amino acid building blocks. Some of these amino acids (e.g. methionine, cysteine, tryptophan, lysine) are further metabolized yielding malodorous volatile products such as methylmercaptan, hydrogen sulfide, indole, skatole and cadaverine (5-7). These are foul smelling compounds, which are released during exhalation and speech.in our study we intend to use an aprooved mucosal sticker containing carbopol and hydroxypropylcellulose mixed with the herbal ingredients and placed on the palatal mucosa.than mesure the volatile sulfur compounds to observe if the composition has antimalodor effect and for how long. the herbal ingredients are used for many years for medicinal and nutritional purposes. if our hypothesis is right we might have another formulation and method of application to prevent oral malodor</detailed_description>
