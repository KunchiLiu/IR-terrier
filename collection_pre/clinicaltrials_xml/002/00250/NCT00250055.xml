	<brief_summary>In general, to determine the sensitivity of light transport to tissue from morphological features of clinical significance. Determine how specific structural features contribute to light scattering. Investigate light scattering differences in tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells. Develop and implement quantitative and sensitive methods for measuring morphological properties. Clinical measurements.</brief_summary>
