	<detailed_description>1. To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Myocet at different dosages in combination with Taxotere at the fixed dose of 35 mg/m2 on day 2 and 9 every 21 days and weekly Herceptin as first line therapy in patients affected by HER-2/neu positive metastatic breast cancer 2. To enhance the proportion of complete remission 3. To allow the feasibility of the combination of Herceptin with both Myocet and Taxotere without an enhanced risk of cardiotoxicity</detailed_description>
