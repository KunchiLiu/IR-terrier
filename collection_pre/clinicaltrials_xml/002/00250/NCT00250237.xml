	<brief_title>Post-operative Haloperidol Versus Placebo for Prevention of Post-operative Delirium After Acute Hip Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A post-operative delirium is a serious and frequent (35-65%) complication with high morbidity and mortality in high risk patients. In this study we investigate whether we can prevent a delirium from occuring after surgery in patients with a hip fracture of 75 years of age and older. It's a randomised double-blind single centre placebo-controlled study of haloperidol versus placebo.</detailed_description>
