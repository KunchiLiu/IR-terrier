	<brief_summary>Primary Aim Determine the response rate and time to progression of the combination of thalidomide, interferon, and octreotide in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (cancer of the liver that can't be treated surgically). Secondary Aims 1. Determine the toxicity of this combination in this population. 2. Determine the survival of this patient cohort treated with the combination. 3. Determine the percent of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have a positive octreotide scan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Thalidomide, a- Interferon +/- Octreotide in Patients With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate and time to progression of the combination of thalidomide, alfa interferon, and octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. If patients are eligible for and agree to take part in the study, they will be assigned to one of two treatment arms depending on SSR status. If SSR status is positive or unknown, patients will receive oral doses of thalidomide starting at 200mg a day and increasing to 800mg at increments of 200 per week depending on tolerance. They will also receive injections three times a week of alpha interferon and monthly injections of octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) 30 mg into their buttocks muscle.. If the patient SSR status is negative, patients will not be given subcutaneous injections of octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) but will receive the thalidomide and alfa interferon only.</detailed_description>
