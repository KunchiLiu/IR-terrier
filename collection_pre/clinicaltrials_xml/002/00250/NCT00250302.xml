	<brief_summary>Mesenchymal stem cells are found in bone marrow, and have the ability to differentiate into different tissue types. The primary objective of the study is to examine the safety of using such cells to treat patients suffering from distal tibial shaft fractures. The cells will be isolated from the patient's bone marrow, loaded onto a carrier and implanted locally at the fracture site.</brief_summary>
