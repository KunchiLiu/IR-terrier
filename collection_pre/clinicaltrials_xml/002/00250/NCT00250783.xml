	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to provide a repository for long-term storage of endometrial cancer tumor and normal tissue, ascites and serum. This material will be used in studies to better understand the molecular biology of endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-Clinical Models in Gynecological Tumors A Tissue Repository</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE This protocol will create a central repository for banking tumor and other tissues as well as serum from patients with uterine corpus tumors. In addition, this protocol will also serve as a central repository for serum and tissue to healthy post-menopausal and peri-menopausal controls. There will be an "internal" bank. The internal bank will have samples available to UNM investigators.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patients undergoing hysterectomy, or who have endometrial cancer, and are under routine surveillance. Patients may have received prior hormonal, cytotoxic chemotherapy, irradiation or surgical therapy. Healthy postmenopausal and perimenopausal women. A consent form must be signed by the patient prior to study entry. Study Patients: Patients who do not have primary uterine corpus tumors. Patients with less than one gram of tumor tissue available to procurement. Controls: Patients unwilling to have their medical records reviewed for height, weight, and general medical history (see attached data sheets).</criteria>
