	<brief_title>An Open-Label, Multi-centre, Phase III Study of Local Tolerability of ZOMACTON 10MG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S has developed a new ZOMACTON 10 mg formulation. The formulation provides a higher concentration and thereby a smaller volume to be administered. ZomaJet Vision X is a needle-free injection system. It sends a thin jet of ZOMACTON through the skin and into the subcutaneous tissue without the use of a needle. The mode of administration is referred to as "transjection". By use of ZomaJet Vision X, both transjection and reconstitution of ZOMACTON 10 mg can be done without using a needle. The rationale of the study is to describe the local tolerability of the new ZOMACTON 10 mg administered by ZomaJet Vision X.</detailed_description>
