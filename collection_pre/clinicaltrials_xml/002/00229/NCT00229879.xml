	<brief_title>Rare Tumor Case Review</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We excised an intrapericardial teratoma tumor out of a child approximately one month ago. This is a very uncommon tumor overall, and even more uncommon in children. The majority of reports in the literature are single case reports I would like to report ours, as well as do a literature review to combine all of the cases and see if some conclusions can be made about this rare tumor in children.</detailed_description>
