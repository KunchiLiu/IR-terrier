	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine which from the four combinations tirofiban+sirolimus eluting stent (SES), tirofiban+bare metal stent (BMS), abciximab+SES, abciximab+BMS is the possible gold standard treatment for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in terms of efficacy and cost-efficacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicentre 2x2 Factorial Randomised Study Comparing Tirofiban Versus Abciximab and SES Versus BMS in AMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination abciximab plus bare metal stent (BMS) is currently considered the standard therapy for AMI. The use of sirolimus eluting stent (SES) is related to a reduction of the need for urgent target vessel revascularization (TVR). With current acquisition prices for abciximab and SES, replacing abciximab with tirofiban, administered as a single high-dose bolus (SHDB) regimen, is a promising strategy that would preserve financial resources. In a recent study the combination tirofiban and SES resulted to be associated to an overall lower major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) rate with respect to the abciximab plus BMS. However, since no conclusion can be drawn yet regarding the relative contribution of a specific GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor or a stent type with respect to the other, the combination of abciximab and SES may be associated to an even lower event rate with respect to SHDB tirofiban and SES, thus offsetting the higher initial cost. Comparison(s): four strategies (SHDB tirofiban + BMS, SHDB tirofiban + SES, abciximab + BMS, abciximab + SES) are compared to determine the possible gold standard treatment for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in terms of efficacy and cost-efficacy.</detailed_description>
