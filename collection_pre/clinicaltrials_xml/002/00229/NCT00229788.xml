	<brief_summary>For children who develop graft failure following cardiac transplantation, retransplantation is often considered. While some centers have reported equivalent results for retransplantation as compared to primary transplantation, this strategy remains controversial. We seek to examine outcomes following re-transplantation in children and identify risk factors for mortality. In addition, adult African-Americans have been reported to have lower survival following heart and other solid-organ transplantation. The relationship of recipient race to survival following pediatric heart transplantation has not previously been reported.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective 1: For children who develop graft failure following cardiac transplantation, retransplantation is often considered. While some centers have reported equivalent results for retransplantation as compared to primary transplantation, this strategy remains controversial. We seek to examine outcomes following re-transplantation in children and identify risk factors for mortality. Objective 2: Adult African-Americans have been reported to have lower survival following heart and other solid-organ transplantation. The relationship of recipient race to survival following pediatric heart transplantation has not previously been reported. Methods: We would like to review the United Network for Organ Sharing database. We plan on reviewing database records of heart transplantation subjects &lt;18 years of age from 1987 to 2004. Indications for retransplantation and patient race characteristics will be collected and evaluated. Analysis will be performed using proportional hazards regression controlling for other potential risk factors. The contribution economic disparity, insurance status and HLA mismatching to disparities in outcome will also be explored.</detailed_description>
