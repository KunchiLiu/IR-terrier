	<brief_title>Child With Anomalous Drainage of IVC to Left Atrium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dr. Kogon would like to do a case-report and review of the literature regarding children with the diagnosis of anomalous drainage of the inferior vena cava to the left atrium. At Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, we have seen a single patient with this diagnosis in 2004 and Dr. Kogon would like to discuss this patient in combination with the others already in the literature to see if any conclusions can be drawn about this uncommon heart defect. Currently there are about 20 cases reported in the literature and Dr. Kogon will be reporting on this one case seen in 2004. The case report of our patient will utilize his medical chart. We hope to provide a brief summary of his clinical presentation, his radiographic evaluation, his operative findings, and his outcome. The only PHI that will be collected will be dates (i.e. date of birth, dates of procedures).</detailed_description>
