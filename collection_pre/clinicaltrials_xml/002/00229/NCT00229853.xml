	<brief_title>Thoracoscopic Vascular Rings Chart Review</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In addition to dividing the vascular ring, some surgeons stress the importance of performing a diverticulopexy (an additional stitch which holds the ring open and prevents recurrence). This is a difficult step to perform through the thoracoscope. We plan to review the use of this step, the diverticulopexy, and collect data regarding the ease of the procedure and the overall outcome. Once we have accomplished this, we hope to present our initial results of this new procedure.</detailed_description>
