	<detailed_description>Patients randomized to the intervention arm received a telephone call from managed care nurses asking about their pneumococcal vaccination status and whether they would like to be vaccinated. We compared six month follow-up of pneumococcal vaccination in electronic medical records for the intervention versus control group. We tested the percent vaccinated in each randomization arm using chi-square tests for proportions.</detailed_description>
