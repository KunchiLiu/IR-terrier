	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the rates of medication errors in pediatric outpatients in 6 office practices. Further, we wish to determine the effectiveness of a computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system in reducing errors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medication Errors and Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) in Ambulatory Pediatrics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has the following 2 goals: Aim 1: To determine the rates, types, and predictors of medication errors and ADEs. Aim 2: To perform a trial assessing the effectiveness of an intervention (CPOE) on reducing serious medication errors. We hypothesize that: 1. Medication errors and ADEs are frequent in ambulatory pediatrics. 2. Presence of the following predictors will be associated with higher error rates: cultural, racial, socioeconomic, educational, and linguistic barriers to communication, understanding, and successful completion of prescribed therapies; complex medical or chronic medical conditions; complex medication regimens; non-physician providers with limited clinical experience; high provider workloads; and complex prescription refill systems. 3. Prevention strategies, including both technology-based and behavioral/ human factors-based interventions, will be effective and cost-effective in reducing rates of serious medication errors (defined as preventable ADEs and non-intercepted potential ADEs).</detailed_description>
