	<brief_title>Rehabilitation in Primary Care: A Project to Maximize the Health Status of Adults With Chronic Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary health care is changing so that people receive the care that they need at the front line. Rehabilitation has been identified as one service that should be offered in primary care, to address the needs of adults who have or are at risk of poor health from chronic conditions such as arthritis, heart disease and depression. Two full time therapists (one physiotherapist and one occupational therapist) will offer rehabilitation to a sample of 170 adults with chronic illness over an 18 month period (170 people will also be enrolled in a control group) at the Stonechurch Family Health Centre. Key outcomes include health, hospital admissions and emergency room visits.</detailed_description>
