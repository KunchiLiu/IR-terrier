	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the relationship between frequency of meals and hepatic fat content and insulin sensitivity. We, the researchers at Rockefeller University, hypothesize that low plasma insulin levels (as achieved by periods of fasting) will prevent insulin resistance and reduce hepatic lipid content. In contrast, frequent, carbohydrate-rich meals will predispose to hepatic steatosis (non-alcoholic) and insulin resistance. This is a 6 week inpatient study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The hypothesis will be tested by studying two groups of normal subjects who will receive a defined weight maintenance diet: one group will be given meals twice a day and other group will be given eight meals (snacks) per day. At the beginning of the study period and after 4 weeks following the specified frequency of meals, the study subjects will have their whole body insulin sensitivity and hepatic fat content measured by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and MRI of the liver, respectively.</detailed_description>
