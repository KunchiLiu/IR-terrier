	<brief_summary>To determine the clinical effects of garlic in preventing and treatment of patients with chemotherapy related febrile neutropenia.These patients have a very high incidence of infections which are not routinely covered by the standard empiric therapy. Adding a non- toxic and possibly effective therapy may reduce the risk for infections, synergize the empiric antibiotic treatment and may lessen the need for broader spectrum and more severe side effects.</brief_summary>
