	<brief_summary>This research is being done to evaluate if NRP 104 is a safe drug. The other purpose is to learn if NRP104, when injected into a vein, produces a high and any other effects like amphetamine and other stimulant drugs that are abused. This information will give some indication if NRP104 can be abused. Healthy people, between the ages of 18 and 55 with histories of substance abuse that include stimulant drugs, may join. Amphetamines are drugs that are used most often to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, to treat narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness) and for weight loss.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Abuse Liability Study of Intravenous NRP104 in Adults With Stimulant Abuse Histories</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a need for a non-scheduled stimulant medication that can provide symptom control for children with ADHD as the conventional stimulant products do. Currently, the top line amphetamine product Adderall XR (R) for the treatment of children with ADHD involves a once-a-day morning dosing of up to 30 mg per day per Adderall XR (R) Package Insert. New River Pharmaceuticals has developed three NRP104 dose strengths of 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg to provide amphetamine base equivalent to Adderall XR (R) 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg, respectively. Adderall XR (R) and other amphetamine and methylphenidate containing preparations are liable to intravenous abuse. As part of the development of NRP104 for treatment of children with ADHD, it is important to evaluate the abuse potential of NRP104 given intravenously in comparison to immediate release d-amphetamine. This study will conduct relevant information to address appropriately the objectives of determining abuse potential of intravenously administered NRP104.</detailed_description>

Able to understand that they can withdraw from the study at any time. Minimum reading level of Grade Six as determined by the REALM test, at the investigator's discretion. Subject must voluntarily consent to participate in this study. History of clinically significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrine, oncologic, hematologic, neurologic, psychologic, immunologic or pulmonary disorders; or cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, epilepsy, diabetes, psychosis, glaucoma, or any condition which in the opinion of the Investigator would jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact study results or prevent the subject from completing the study.

Blood loss, donation of one pint or more, or plasma donation within 60 days prior to study initiation. Clinically significant abnormalities at screening or admission on results of ECG or lab tests, including lab deviations requiring acute medical intervention or further medical attention. Treated with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, currently or within 13 days of initiation of the study medication. Require any of the following medications: clonidine or other alpha2 adrenergic receptor agonists, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) theophylline, coumarin anticoagulants, or anticonvulsants; or have taken an SSRI in the 35 days before initiation of the study medication. Currently physically dependent on benzodiazepines as determined by clinical evaluation and/or urine drug screen at screening. Currently physically dependent on opiates as determined by naloxone challenge. Currently physically dependent on alcohol as determined by clinical evaluation or has a positive Breathalyzer test at screening or admission and confirmed by a second reading. Preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing. Use of any prescription medications (except birth control methods) within 14 days of admission, or will require any prescription medications, or any overthecounter (OTC) medications (other than acetaminophen), or herbal supplements or vitamins during the study. Positive urine pregnancy test at screening or admission. Female subject is pregnant or lactating. Another member of the subject's household currently participating in the study.</criteria>
