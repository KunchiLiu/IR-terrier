	<brief_title>PI-88 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Hepatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although early diagnosis and treatment improve survival, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rarely cured and recurs frequently after regional therapy or transplantation. Hepatic resection can improve 5-year recurrence-free survival by up to 25%. Micrometastases of HCC have been detected by molecular techniques in 88% of patients at the time of surgery, and probably cause postoperative recurrence. Efforts to reduce the risk of recurrence after a curative resection have been tried, including various regimens of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy. In this study , an anti-angiogenic agent, PI-88, is being used as an adjuvant therapy for HCC patients after curative hepatic resection. The efficacy endpoints, including tumour non-recurrence rate, time to first recurrence and 1-year survival rate are being evaluated. Several risk factors associated with tumour recurrence are also being analysed. There are two stages to this study. In stage 1 there are three arms - untreated control and two arms are two different PI-88 dose. In stage 2 the better of the two PI-88 arms will be continued against the control arm.</detailed_description>
