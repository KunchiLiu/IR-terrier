	<brief_summary>High intake of cereal fibre has been shown to be associated with reduced weight gain and improved insulin sensitivity. We hypothesize these effects are due to the short chain fatty acids derived from the bacterial fermentation (breakdown) of fibre in the colon (large intestine). Insulin resistant subjects will be randomized to receive 2 servings of a low-fibre cereal (eg. puffed rice) or 2 servings of a high-fibre cereal (wheat bran cereal) per day for one year. The effects of the diets on body weight, appetite, abdominal fat, blood short chain fatty acids, glucose, insulin, lipids and hormones will be measured</brief_summary>
