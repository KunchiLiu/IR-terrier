	<brief_summary>In the treatment of coronary heart disease which is the major cause of heart attack, direct mechanical treatment with catheters such as the coronary angiography,coronary balloon intervention and stenting intervention are the mainstay of therapy in recent years. In that procedures, we should use the contrast media, and it may cause kidney toxicity especially in the patients with underlying kidney disease and decreased kidney function. We intended to find out which contrast agent has less kidney toxicity in the catheter based treatment of coronary arterial diseases in patients with underlying decreased kidney function</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RECOVER:Comparison of Renal Toxicity Between Visipaque(Iodixanol)and Hexabrix(Ioxaglate)in Renal Insufficiency Undergoing Coronary Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iodixanol, a nonionic, dimeric, iso-osmolar contrast medium (IOCM), may be less nephrotoxic than nonionic, monomeric, low-osmolar contrast media (LOCMs) in high-risk patients. We compared the nephrotoxicity of iodixanol with that of ioxaglate, an ionic, dimeric LOCM, in patients with renal impairment.</detailed_description>
