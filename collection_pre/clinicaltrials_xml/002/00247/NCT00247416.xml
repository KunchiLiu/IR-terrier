	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find better treatment for lung cancer and to find out what effects the combined treatment of carboplatin and gemcitabine when given with or without dexamethasone have on cancer. This study will determine if dexamethasone, when given before standard chemotherapy will increase the cancer fighting effects and reduce the side effects of chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Carboplatin and Gemcitabine on Stage IIIB Pleural Effusion and Stage IV Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects enrolled in the study will be placed in one of two treatment arms. All subjects have a 50-50 chance of being placed into either treatment arm. Treatment Arm 1 will receive chemotherapy alone, Treatment Arm 2 will receive chemotherapy with dexamethasone given pre-treatment.</detailed_description>
