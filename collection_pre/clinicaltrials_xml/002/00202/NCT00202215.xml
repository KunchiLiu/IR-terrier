	<detailed_description>As part of the Providence Continuing Care Center's continuing quality improvement initiatives this study is to more systematically evaluate the success of the Chrysalis Day Hospital Program in dealing with some features of eating disorders commonly experienced by its patients. At intake all clients will be approached to give informed consent to participate. If they do consent they will have their height and weight recorded( if they request they will not be told their weight)as part of the usual intake process conducted by a dietician. When clients exit the program they again will be approached to be weighed. The body mass index will be calculated and compared to admission values. The Chrysalis Program is a unique day hospital approach to treating individuals with severe personality disorders (primarily Borderline)that views the eating disordered behaviour common to these clients as a symptom of many and by addressing core issues of affect dysregulation as well as psychoeducation about eating the eating problems will improve .</detailed_description>
