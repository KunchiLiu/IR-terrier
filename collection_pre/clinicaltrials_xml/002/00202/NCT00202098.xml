	<brief_title>Effects of Variable Ventilation on Respiratory System of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this interventional study we want to evaluate the effect of Variable ventilation (1) in patients with ARDS. Patients will be mechanically ventilated with Variable Ventilation (3 step with increased level of variability) and "traditional" CMV, for a total of 4 step. Each step lasts in 60 minutes. During this period we will record the gas exchange parameters and the mechanics of the respiratory system. 1. Arold S, Mora R, Lutchen K, et al.
