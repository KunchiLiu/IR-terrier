	<brief_summary>Leg ulcers are emotionally distressing and painful, and often require months or years to heal. Although rarely acknowledged as a pressing health care issue, leg ulcers comprise a common, complex, and costly condition, managed primarily through community home care services. Indeed, leg ulcers are the most frequently seen and treated chronic wound. There is consensus in recent international, evidence-based practice guidelines that graduated, multi-layer compression is the most effective treatment, and greatly reduces healing time. High compression is more effective than low compression. However, there is no clear evidence as to which high compression technology is the most effective in promoting healing, the most acceptable to patients, or the most cost-effective to the health care system. This study is designed to answer these questions through a randomized trial conducted in the community, where most leg ulcer care currently takes place. Issues such as effectiveness in healing, quality of life, physical discomfort, personal preference, cost to the system and to the individual will be taken into consideration in evaluating two most commonly used types of compression bandaging.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Community RCT of the Effectiveness of Two Compression Bandaging Technologies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Although rarely recognized as a pressing health care problem, leg ulcers comprise a common, complex, and costly condition. Over 80% of ongoing management of chronic wounds occurs in the community, and leg ulcers are one of the most frequently seen chronic wounds. The cost of leg ulcer care is considerable, being reported in both the UK and France to account for 2% of their total national health budgets. In Canada, the impact is only now being recognized due to the pressure on home care caseloads resulting from hospital downsizing, nursing shortages, and growing numbers of complex health populations. In one Ontario study, the care for fewer than 200 community leg ulcer cases cost in excess of $1.5 million for supplies and nursing visits, which translates to $100s of millions yearly Canada-wide. The impact on the individual is significant--chronic, painful, and often takes years to heal. Two-thirds of individuals with leg ulcers have at least one recurrence, and 45% have a history with the condition dating back 10 years. State of Knowledge &amp; Clinical Practice Guidelines: Over the past decade, evidence from RCT studies and a recent Cochrane systematic review in BMJ demonstrated that venous leg ulcers treated with compression therapy are more likely to heal. Multi-layer high compression systems are more effective than low compression. However, the small number of people in trials comparing different high compression systems meant the review was unable to draw conclusions about their relative merit. Four of these trials have compared 4-layer bandage with short stretch technologies--the most commonly used technologies in Canada. In total, these trials involved only 220 patients, and were thus underpowered. Furthermore, they did not consider factors such as client preference and ease of use, or incorporate an economic evaluation. Plan of Investigation: The study will be a multi-centre, pragmatic, randomised trial of two types of compression bandaging technologies, incorporating an economic evaluation. Research objective: To compare the effectiveness of 2 high compression technologies delivered in the community on ulcer healing, recurrence rates, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Interventions: Four-layer bandage vs. Short-stretch bandage. Sample size: 414 total, 207 in each arm (80% power, " 0.05 to detect 4 week difference in time to heal). Inclusion Criteria: leg ulcer&gt;1 cm in any one dimension, minimum duration of 1 week, ABPI&gt;0.7. Randomization: will be carried out and stratified by: Clinical Centre (3 Health Regions in Ontario); Margolis' Prognostic Model (ulcer area and duration), Ulcer episode (1st or recurrent ulcer). Analysis: Primary outcome: time-to-healing of the reference ulcer. Secondary outcomes: quality of life &amp; expenditures for treatment. Durability of healing will be assessedâ€”follow-up for up to 52 weeks post-healing to determine recurrence rates associated with both technologies. Summary: There is consensus internationally in recommending the application of graduated multi-layer compression. High compression is more effective than low compression; however, there is no clear evidence as to which high compression technology is more effective.</detailed_description>
