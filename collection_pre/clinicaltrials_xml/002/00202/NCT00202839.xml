	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, randomized, comparative, multicenter, 48-week study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in adult subjects with a diagnosis of compensated chronic hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus (HCV)-ribonucleic acid (RNA) positive) (Genotype 1). All subjects will complete 24 weeks of treatment, termed the Pilot Treatment Program, after which all eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups. One group will be followed for an additional 48 weeks without study medication, while the other will be continuously treated for an additional 24 weeks and then followed for another 24 weeks without study medication. Sustained virologic response, defined as undetectable HCV-RNA in serum at the end of the follow-up period, will be measured along with other outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peg-Intron/Ribavirin in G 1 HCV for Non-Extended Versus 24 Week Extended Treatment After 24 Weeks (Study P04144)(COMPLETED)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, randomized, comparative, multicenter study for evaluation of PegIntron/Ribavirin therapy in the efficacy and safety in adult subjects with a diagnosis of compensated chronic hepatitis C (HCV-RNA+) (Genotype 1). This is a 48-week study, for which all subjects should participate in the Pilot Treatment Program and complete 24 weeks treatment. To avoid a treatment gap, subjects who will be screened and eligible subjects will sign informed consent prior to the end of the Pilot Treatment Program. After completion of the Pilot Treatment Program, all eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to either study group. Subjects in the 24-Week Treatment arm will be followed-up without study medication for 48 weeks; subjects in the 48-Week Treatment arm will be continuously treated for another 24 weeks and all subjects in the 48-Week Treatment arm will be followed for another 24 weeks after completion of the treatment period. Subjects in both arms will be evaluated at screening, randomization, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 36 and 48 weeks after randomization.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must be willing to give written informed consent and be able to adhere to dose and visit schedules. Males and nonpregnant females and aged &gt;= 18 years, subjects who are over 65 years of age must be in generally good health and must be discussed with and approved by the principal investigator prior to entry. The laboratory evaluation within 6 months prior to entering the Pilot Treatment Program must meet the following criteria: Hemoglobin values of &gt;= 12 g/dL for females and &gt;= 13 g/dL for males Neutrophil count &gt;= 1.5 X10^9/L Platelets count &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL Serum creatinine within normal limits Positive serum HCVRNA (&gt;= 50 IU (100 copy numbers)/mL) AntiHCV positive Available HCV genotype 1 Liver biopsy performed within 12 months prior to entry to this protocol with a pathology report confirming that the histological diagnosis is consistent with chronic hepatitis (METAVIR system &gt;=F1). Compensated liver disease with the following hematological, biochemical, and serologic criteria at the screening visit: Hemoglobin values of &gt;= 9 g/dL Neutrophil count &gt;= 0.75 x 10^9/L Platelets count &gt;= 50 x 10^9/L Prothrombin time (PT) prolong &lt;= 3 sec, International Normalized Ratio (INR) &lt;= 1.2 Total bilirubin &lt;= 3 mg/dL Within normal limits (subjects requiring medication to maintain TSH levels in the normal range are eligible if all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met). AntiHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) negative. Alphafetoprotein (AFP) value within normal limits obtained within 12 months prior to entry. Results above the upper limit of normal but &lt;= 50 ng/mL require both of the following: AFP value &lt;= 50 ng/mL obtained within 9 months prior to entry in the study or during the Screening period, and Ultrasound obtained within 9 months prior to entry or in the screening period in the study for evidence of not having hepatocellular carcinoma. A urine pregnancy test obtained prior to the initiation of pilot treatment must be negative. Female subjects must not be breast feeding. Reconfirmation that sexuallyactive subjects are practicing acceptable methods of contraception during screening period. Complete 24 weeks treatment of the Pilot Treatment Program with PegIntron + Ribavirin. Must be never treated with interferon for HCV infected hepatitis (treatment na√Øve) before the Pilot Treatment Program. The total amount of PegIntron and Ribavirin received during the pilot treatment program must achieve more than 80% of the recommended dosage. Women who are pregnant or nursing. Have decompensated cirrhosis. History of severe psychiatric disease, especially depression. Concurrent malignancies (including hepatocellular carcinoma). Unstable or significant cardiovascular diseases. Subjects with (ECG) showing clinically significant abnormalities. Prolonged exposure to known hepatotoxins such as alcohol or drugs. History of thyroid disease poorly controlled on prescribed medication. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Has suspected or confirmed significant hepatic disease from an etiology other than HCV. Patients coinfected with hepatitis B and /or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Severe renal disease or myeloid dysfunction. History of organ transplantation other than cornea and hair transplant. Any medical condition requiring, or likely to require during the course of the study, chronic systemic administration of steroids. Any other condition which in the opinion of the investigator would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere with the subject participating in and completing the protocol. Allergy to interferon.</criteria>
