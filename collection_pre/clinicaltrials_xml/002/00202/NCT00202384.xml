	<brief_summary>Clinical and experimental evidences suggest that there is a variability in therapeutic response to immunomodulating therapies in Multiple Sclerosis patients. Microarrays is a technology that permits to monitor the expression levels of thousands of genes at a time. The specific aim of this study is to identify predictive factors of therapeutic response in MS patients treated with high-dose Interferon-Beta.</brief_summary>
