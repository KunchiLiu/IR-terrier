	<brief_summary>This study design is subject to relevant SFDA regulations about clinical trials. Patients will be screened for inclusion into the study at the initial visit(240 patients to be recruited) and then undergo a minimum of 3-7 day’s placebo washout period(placebo wash out is to eliminate the effect of prior antipsychotic medication with tablets without any active ingredients)(patients without prior antipsychotic medication are exempt from the washout phase).
