	<brief_summary>In this project we plan to evaluate the effectiveness of erythrocytapheresis against phlebotomy, both regarding the impact on the reduction in iron overload as well as reduction in patient "burden". Aspects of cost effectiveness will be included in the final analysis. Results of the study would allow decision-making based on Evidence Based Medicine on the "best" therapeutic options available for newly-diagnosed as well as existing primary hemochromatosis patients.</brief_summary>
