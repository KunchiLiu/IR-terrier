	<brief_summary>This is a 10-week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to investigate the effect of Cannabis Based Medicine Extract (Sativex) on patterns of brain activation associated with movement in 20 MS patients suffering from lower limb spasticity. Spasticity is a common symptom in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), occurring all over the course of the disease, particularly in the progressive phase.Physiologically, spasticity and hyperreflexia habitually seen in patients with pyramidal syndrome is due to lesions of other descending pathways, such as the cortico reticulospinal pathways, which participate in voluntary movements.It is now known that an endocannabinoid system acts in humans by at least two types of cannabinoids receptors, CB1 and CB2. There is evidence to support the view that the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC), and cannabinoids in general, can reduce muscle spasticity in people with MS. Aim of the study will be to evaluate the effect of Sativex on: (i) patterns of brain activation associated with movement (fMRI) in MS patients suffering from spasticity; (ii) changes in level of spasticity (H-reflex); (iii) changes in intracortical excitability and on synaptic intracortical network of the motor areas (double shock TMS).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Baseline assessment will be followed by randomisation and dose introduction. Patients will be randomly assigned to two counterbalanced groups starting either with Sativex or with placebo as the first drug. They will be dispensed sufficient study medication for two weeks together with a diary. During the two-week treatment period all the patients will have to be reached the optimal, individualised dosage to subjectively relief spasticity.Patient will return after three weeks and they will undergo the fMRI and neurophysiological evaluations.Then patients will perform a two-week washout period and they will be requested to intake the alternative medicine. After two weeks patients will perform a second fMRI/neurophysiological study. Two weeks later, after a second washout period, a last visit will be performed to conclude the study.</detailed_description>
