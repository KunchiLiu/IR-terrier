	<brief_summary>The investigators want to study the relative effects of physical exercise vs. extended-release niacin (lipid-lowering drug) in patients with coronary heart disease and low HDL cholesterol ("good cholesterol") on - lipid profile - endothelial function as measured by ultrasound The endothelium is the inner part of the blood vessels. Impaired endothelial function is known to be associated with atherosclerosis which can ultimately lead to diseases such as stroke, heart attack and others. Endothelial function can be assessed non-invasively by ultrasound. Both interventions mentioned above have been shown to have a beneficial effect on lipid profile and endothelial function. However, the relative effects are unclear.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Versus Niacin in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and Low High-Density Lipoproteins (HDL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comparison of physical exercise vs. extended-release niacin in patients with CAD and low HDL cholesterol (&lt; 1,03 mmol/L) on lipid profile and endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilatation of radial artery. Secondary goals are the assessment of biochemical markers of atherosclerosis, expression of monocyte surface markers, oxidative stress and thrombogenicity.</detailed_description>
