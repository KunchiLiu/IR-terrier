	<brief_title>Study of the Effectiveness of Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment in Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women experience multiple changes in their anatomy and physiology during pregnancy that may cause pain and adversely affect quality of life. Additionally, about ten percent of women will experience signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia or pre-term labor during their first pregnancy. Preliminary studies of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) have demonstrated a decrease in pain during pregnancy, although the mechanisms responsible for this effect are unclear. Another theory is that osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) may help normalize sympathetic outflow, thereby minimizing pregnancy complications. A recently published retrospective study also suggests that pregnant women receiving osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) may be at lower risk for pre-term delivery and the presence of meconium during delivery.</detailed_description>
