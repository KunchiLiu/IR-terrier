	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine if there is a link between cow’s milk allergy in infants and regulatory T cells dysfunction that should be transient in infant acquiring oral tolerance after 12 month avoiding food and persistent in others. Cow’s milk allergy is evaluated by basophils activation test, T cells activation test, specific humoral response (IgA, IgE, IgG) in allergic infants before and after 12 month avoiding food, before and after low dose milk exposure, before and after oral challenge. Number and function of regulatory T cells and microflora composition are measured at the same time. Allergic infants are compared to age matched control group.</brief_summary>
