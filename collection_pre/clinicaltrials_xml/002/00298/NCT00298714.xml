	<brief_summary>There is evidence on the beneficial effects of the administration of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors antagonists on liver fibrosis in hepatic stellate cells, experimental models of liver fibrosis in rodents and limited information in chronic hepatitis C with mild fibrosis. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of long-term administration of oral Losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, on liver fibrogenesis in patients with chronic hepatitis C and fibrosis F2-F3 (METAVIR score).</brief_summary>
