	<brief_summary>Patients treated with the antiepileptic drug Oxcarbazepine often develop syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone(SIADH)We want to test the hypothesis, that these patients have a higher reabsorption of water during the Aquaporine2 water channels,a higher concentration of Vasopressine (AVP), and a lower clearance of water.This situation will tend to normalize, when the patients are treated with fluid restriction</brief_summary>
