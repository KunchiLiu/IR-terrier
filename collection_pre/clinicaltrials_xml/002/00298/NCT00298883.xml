	<brief_summary>Trial of the use of Myfortic to reduce anti-HLA alloantibody in patients waiting for renal transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pre-formed HLA antibodies prevent renal transplantation because of the risk of hyperacute rejection. We propose a prospective study evaluating the efficacy of Enteric Coated Mycophenolate Sodium (Myfortic) in decreasing the titers of anti-HLA alloantibodies in patients awaiting kidney transplantation. Myfortic is an immunosuppressant that inhibits the proliferation of B and T cells by blocking the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. We will attempt to determine whether a 6-week course of Myfortic adequately decreases the antibody reactivity to a level compatible with transplantation.</detailed_description>
