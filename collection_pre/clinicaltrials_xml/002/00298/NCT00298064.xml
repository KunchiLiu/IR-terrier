	<brief_title>Assessment of EGFR Genomic Alterations as Prognostic Markers in Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is done to gather preliminary data for determining the best way to test EGFR expression in patients with cervical cancer who will receive treatment with EGFR inhibitors in the future. This study is designed to obtain preliminary data of genomic and phenotypic alterations of the EGFR pathway in high grade cervical intraepithelial lesions (HG-SIL) and invasive cervical cancers (CC) to be used later for therapeutic guidance and to evaluate genomic (over-expression, amplification, point mutations, etc.) and phenotypic alterations of other transduction pathways interacting with the EGFR pathway.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Samples from patients diagnosed with HGSIL (n=300) and CC (n=300) with a followup of at least 24 months, existing at the Department of Pathology will be retrieved by the Tissue Repository, deidentified them and provided with code numbers that will not be linked to patient's data. None Specified.</criteria>
