	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the tolerability and safety of rituximab in combination with methotrexate (MTX) and etanercept or adalimumab in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The secondary objective was to explore the efficacy of rituximab in combination with MTX and etanercept or adalimumab in participants with active RA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Tolerability of Rituxan With Methotrexate and Etanercept or Methotrexate and Adalimumab in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of 4 parts: screening, treatment, post-treatment, and safety follow-up. Prior to Day 1, participants were discontinued from all disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) except MTX and etanercept or adalimumab. All participants who met eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the trial were randomized to receive 500 mg rituximab or placebo on Day 1 and Day 15. A subset of 18 participants was enrolled initially and followed through Week 12 for safety. The remaining 42 participants were to be enrolled after the last participant in the subset completed Week 12 and the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) conducted a safety review and approved enrollment of these additional participants. Participants were dosed on Day 1 and Day 15 and followed for 56 weeks, while remaining on their current dose of MTX and etanercept or adalimumab throughout the study. The primary endpoint was assessed at Week 24. All participants in double-blind treatment, including those who received placebo or rituximab, who met the open label inclusion/exclusion criteria anytime from Week 24 through Week 40, were eligible to enter the open label retreatment phase. These participants received open label rituximab on Day 1 and Day 15 of the retreatment phase, and were followed monthly until Week 24 then every 2 months until Week 56, while remaining on their current dose of MTX and etanercept or adalimumab throughout the study. Participants received 1 course of open label treatment only. All participants were required to return for safety follow-up (SFU) assessments at Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 after withdrawal or completion of the study. Participants whose peripheral CD20+ B cells remained depleted at the end of the SFU periods for the primary and OL portions of the study entered extended safety follow-up (ESFU). Assessments for ESFU were performed at 12-week intervals until peripheral B-cell levels returned to within normal range or baseline level (whichever was lower).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Must give written informed consent. If required by local law, candidates must also authorize the release and use of protected health information (PHI). 2. Male or female participants, between 18 and 65 years of age, who have a diagnosis of active RA for at least 6 months, diagnosed according to the revised 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the classification of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 3. Must have at least 5 tender and 5 swollen joints at Screening and Day 1. 4. Must have been treated with etanercept at 50 mg per week (25 mg twice per week or 50 mg once per week) or adalimumab at 40 mg every other week for at least 12 weeks immediately prior to Day 1. 5. Must have been treated with methotrexate (MTX) greater than or equal to 15 mg per week and less than or equal to 25 mg per week (dose may be as low as 10 mg if unable to tolerate higher dose) for at least 12 weeks immediately prior to Day 1, at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks. 6. Must be willing to receive oral folate. 7. Oral glucocorticoids must not exceed 10 mg per day of prednisone (or equivalent dose) and must have been administered at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1. 8. Any concomitant nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be stable for at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1. 9. For participants of reproductive potential (males and females), use of a reliable means of contraception (e.g., hormonal contraceptive, patch, intrauterine device, physical barrier) throughout study participation. Exclusions Related to RA 10. Rheumatic autoimmune disease other than RA, or significant systemic involvement secondary to RA (e.g., vasculitis, pulmonary fibrosis, or Felty's syndrome). Secondary Sj√∂gren's syndrome or secondary limited cutaneous vasculitis with RA is permitted. 11. Functional Class IV as defined by the ACR Classification of Functional Status in Rheumatoid Arthritis. 12. History of, or current, inflammatory joint disease other than RA (e.g., gout, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, seronegative spondyloarthropathy, Lyme disease) or other systemic autoimmune disorder (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], inflammatory bowel disease, scleroderma, inflammatory myopathy, mixed connective tissue disease, or any overlap syndrome). 13.
