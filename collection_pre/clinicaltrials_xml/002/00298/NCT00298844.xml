	<brief_summary>The study aim is to establish a consecutive population of newly referred type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and among these to describe the degree of macrovascular disease by evaluating left ventricular systolic and diastolic function (echocardiography), myocardial perfusion (single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)), the peripheral vascular perfusion (strain gauge toe blood pressure measurements and a ultrasound scan of the a. carotis communis). Further, the degree of microvascular disease will be evaluated (glomerular filtration rate assessment, fundus photography and biotesiometry). Finally the cohort will be followed the next two years to assess the prognostic value of the above-mentioned parameters</brief_summary>
