	<brief_title>A Quality of Life Study in Patients With Migraines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A form of depression known as dysphoric-like disorder is common in people with epilepsy, which may significantly affect the quality of life in these people, as shown in a previous study. However, it is unclear if this depressive disorder is unique to patients with epilepsy. In order to assess whether these symptoms are unique and idiosyncratic to the epilepsy population, in this multi-center study, these dysphoric depressive features will be contrasted to those seen in patients with other neurologic or psychiatric conditions. Migraine is selected as one of the comparison disorders because it shares with epilepsy characteristics of being a recurrent episodic central nervous system disorder, and our site will only enroll patients with migraine headaches.</detailed_description>
