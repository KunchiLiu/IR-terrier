	<brief_title>Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Home-Based Peer Support on Maternal-Infant Interaction, Infant Health Outcomes, and Postpartum Depression (PPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This controlled study will help establish the link between support for maternal caregiving, maternal-infant interaction, infant neuroendocrinology and infant cognitive and social development. The primary hypothesis predicts that home-based peer support will improve maternal-infant interactions. Secondary hypotheses predict that home-based peer support will: improve infants' cognitive development; improve infants' social development; decrease average daily salivary cortisol levels in infants; reduce maternal depressive symptomatology; and improve maternal perceptions of social support.</detailed_description>
