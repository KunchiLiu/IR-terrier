	<brief_summary>Selectins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced kidney injury and resultant delayed graft function (DGF). PSGL-1 is a ligand for P-, E-, and L-selectin. It has been reported that YSPSL (rPSGL-Ig) blocks P-selectin and, to a lesser degree, E- and L-selectin. Both sPSGL-1 and YSPSL (rPSGL-Ig) have been shown in animal models to reduce both cytokines and tissue damage associated with ischemia reperfusion and to improve renal function post-transplant. Therefore, the current phase I/II clinical study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of YSPSL (rPSGL-Ig) in preventing DGF in patients undergoing cadaveric kidney transplants and to determine a dose for future pivotal studies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>YSPSL for Prevention of Delayed Graft Function Part B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a multicenter, single-dose, dose-escalation study. The study will be in 2 parts: the first, Part A, will be an open label evaluation of single doses of four dose cohorts; the second, Part B will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose study of two dose cohorts. Patients who are undergoing cadaveric kidney transplantation and are at risk for development of DGF, based upon known risk factors, will be eligible to participate in the study. A maximum of 24 patients will be enrolled in Part A. 60 patients will be enrolled in Part B.</detailed_description>
