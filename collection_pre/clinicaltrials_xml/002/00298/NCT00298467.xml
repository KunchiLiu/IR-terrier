	<brief_summary>This study is an open-label, fixed-dose, multicenter study of MDX-060 in patients with ALCL who have relapsed or refractory disease. There will be 3 phases of this study: Induction, Maintenance, and Follow-up. Patients will be required to attend all protocol-required visits in the 4-week Induction Phase, in which administration of MDX-060 will occur, as well as other testing. Patients who complete the Induction Phase may be eligible for additional MDX-060 treatment ever 2 months for 1 year in the Maintenance Phase. Patients who complete the Maintenance Phase with a response of stable disease or better will be followed every 2 months for 1 year or until disease progression. The purpose of this study is to determine objective response rate at Day 50 in patients with relapsed or refractory classic systemic ALCL or primary cutaneous ALCL treated with MDX-060. Other objectives will be evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label, fixed-dose, multicenter study of MDX-060 in patients with ALCL who have relapsed or refractory disease. There will be 3 phases of this study: Induction, Maintenance, and Follow-up. Patients will be required to attend all protocol-required visits in the 4-week Induction Phase, in which administration of MDX-060 will occur, as well as other testing. Patients who complete the Induction Phase may be eligible for additional MDX-060 treatment ever 2 months for 1 year in the Maintenance Phase. Patients who complete the Maintenance Phase with a response of stable disease or better will be followed every 2 months for 1 year or until disease progression. The primary objective of the study is to determine the objective response rate (ORR) at Day 50 in patients with relapsed or refractory classic systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (csALCL) or primary cutaneous ALCL (pcALCL) treated with MDX-060. The ORR will be based on an adaption of the NCI Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) for patients with csALCL and will be based on the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) for patient with pcALCL. Secondary objectives include 1) characterizing progression-free survival (PFS); 2) determining response duration (RD); 3) characterizing the effect of MDX-060 on health-related Quality of Life (QoL); 4) evaluating patients with pcALCL using an adaption of the NCI Response Criteria for NHL; 5) characterizing the immunogenicity of MDX-060; 6) characterizing the safety of MDX-060; and 7) determining the best objective response rate (BORR) during the Maintenance Phase of the study.</detailed_description>
