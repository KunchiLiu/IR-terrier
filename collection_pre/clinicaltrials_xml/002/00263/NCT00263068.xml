	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open-label trial to assess safety and tolerability of rotigotine (SPM 936) in subjects with idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), administered at an optimal dose for up to 1 year. Subjects who successfully completed the Maintenance Period and the Taper Period of SP792 are allowed to enroll in this trial. All subjects will begin the Titration Period at a daily dosage of 1.125mg rotigotine (2.5cm2 patch). Subjects will be up-titrated at 7-day intervals in 1.125mg (2.5cm2 increments, initial titration step only) and 2.25mg intervals (5cm2) increments to a maximum dose of 6.75mg/day (15cm2) rotigotine. The maximum length of titration is 28 days (Â±3 days), although not all subjects will require 28 days to reach their optimal dose. A subject's dose may be increased or decreased, as needed by the investigator to maintain a subject's effective dose during the Maintenance Period. A Taper Period is provided to allow for safe, gradual withdrawal from trial medication</brief_summary>
