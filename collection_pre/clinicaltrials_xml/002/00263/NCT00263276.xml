	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if BMS-512148 is effective in controlling blood sugar levels as determined by HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose in patients who have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Patients should first try to control their diabetes with diet and exercise and should not have previously been treated for their diabetes (very short periods of time are acceptable). The safety of BMS512148 will also be studied</brief_summary>
