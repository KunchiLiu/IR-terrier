	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter clinical trial to compare pain, physical function, and other outcomes in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias randomly assigned to watchful waiting without an operation, or a standard hernia repair with mesh. We studied the safety of delaying operation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Watchful Waiting Versus Open Tension-free Repair of Inguinal Hernia in Asymptomatic or Minimally Symptomatic Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CONTEXT Many men with an inguinal hernia have minimal symptoms. Whether deferring operation is safe and a good option for some patients has not been assessed. OBJECTIVE To compare pain and the Physical Component Score (PCS) of the SF-36 at two years in men with minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias randomized to watchful waiting (WW) or a standard tension-free hernia repair (TFR). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS. Between January, 1999 and December, 2004 we conducted a multicenter trial of 720 men (364 WW, 356 TFR) who were followed for 2-4.5 years. Men were excluded with hernia pain interfering with activities; undetectable hernias; infection; American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status &gt;3; recent difficulty in reducing the hernia. INTERVENTIONS Men assigned to WW were followed at 6 months and annually and watched for hernia symptoms. Men assigned to operation received TFR, and were followed at 3 and 6 months, and annually.</detailed_description>
