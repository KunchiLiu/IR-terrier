	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Vitamin D supplementation reduces the symptoms of muscle stiffness and joint tenderness that some patients may develop after starting therapy with Anastrozole for breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Dose Vit D Musculoskeletal Symptoms &amp; Bone Density in Anastrozole-Treated Breast Cancer With Marginal Vit D Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with the following aims: - To compare the effects of high dose vitamin D versus standard dose vitamin D on musculoskeletal pain in breast cancer patients receiving anastrozole when vitamin D levels are in the insufficient but not deficient range (10 to 29 ng/ml). - To evaluate the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency in post-menopausal women with a history of breast cancer who are treated with anastrozole and have musculoskeletal symptoms versus those who are asymptomatic. - To establish correlations between levels of vitamin D, the levels of PTH, the degree of bone loss and the severity of musculoskeletal symptoms. - To evaluate the effect of standard dose versus high dose Vitamin D replacement on bone density in post-menopausal women with a history of breast cancer who are treated with anastrozole and have musculoskeletal symptoms.</detailed_description>
