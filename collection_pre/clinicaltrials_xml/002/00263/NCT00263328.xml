	<brief_summary>A new immunosuppressive drug, based on the inhibition of an important enzyme in the immune system called JAK3, is being developed by Pfizer to prevent transplant rejection. In study A3921009, kidney transplant patients were given a JAK inhibitor or tacrolimus for 6 months posttransplant. Patients who completed study A3921009 were offered the opportunity to participate in study A3921021 which will extend the evaluation of safety and efficacy of CP-690,550 versus tacrolimus through 8 years posttransplant. In treatment group 1 (control arm), subjects will continue to receive tacrolimus. In treatment groups 2 and 3, subjects will continue to receive CP-690,550. Per Amendment 4, the tacrolimus comparator arm will be discontinued.</brief_summary>
