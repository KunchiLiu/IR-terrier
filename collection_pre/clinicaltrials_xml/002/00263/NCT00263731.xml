	<brief_title>Metabolomic Analysis of Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It has long been known that cancer cells absorb and break down substances in the body differently than healthy, non-cancer cells. This process of absorbing and breaking down substances is known as metabolism and is increased in cancer cells. Recent research suggests that this increased metabolic activity makes it easier for cancer cells to multiply. The objective of the study is to characterize the metabolism of glucose by lung tumors by serum metabolite analysis, using a variant of glucose (sugar) which makes up 1% of glucose in nature.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Lung Cancer Patients (Groups 1 &amp; 2) patients with suspected, clinically diagnosed, or histologically diagnosed lung cancer. Occasionally, other cancers (including metastatic cancers to the lung) may be resected for the study as negative controls for NSCLC, as warranted by the particulars of the case. patients must have general medical conditions to allow them to undergo surgical resection of their primary tumor history of diabetes for the experimental group (surgery + glucose); patients with a history of diabetes are allowed in the control group (surgery/no glucose) known hepatitis C or HIV (AIDS) Healthy Subjects (Group 3) at least 30 years of age preferably be fasting for 12 hours (minimum 8 hours) prior to enrollment prior history of diagnosed lung cancer known hepatitis C or HIV (AIDS)</criteria>
