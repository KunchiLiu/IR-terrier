	<brief_summary>7-methylxanthine has been shown to increase the concentration and thickness of collagen fibrils in rabbit sclera. Deficient collagen in the sclera may be the cause of progression of childhood myopia. The study hypothesis is that treatment with 7-methylxanthine will stabilize the sclera and prevent further progression of myopia.</brief_summary>
