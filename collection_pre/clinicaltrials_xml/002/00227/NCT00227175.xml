	<brief_title>Cornell Translational Behavioral Science Research Consortium: Hypertension Qualitative Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. The first goal is to explore the meaning, causes and treatment of hypertension in eligible patients. In addition the cultural, social, and psychological factors that either facilitate or serve, as barriers to behavioral change will be illuminated in this patient population. Through a series of open-ended questions we will explore and build a better understanding of how hypertensive African American patients view their illness and the difficulties they have in taking their antihypertensive medications as prescribed. 2. The second goal of the qualitative phase is to use the responses obtained to inform how we should operationalize and tailor the positive affect induction and self-affirmation intervention methods in hypertensive African American patients.</detailed_description>
