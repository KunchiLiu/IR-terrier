	<brief_summary>Once intervention class or staff contact is removed, obese adults participating in behavioral weight-loss programs often give up healthy eating habits and regain weight. We examined whether taste-based goal setting, which minimizes perceived deprivation by promoting taste and moderation, would sustain long-term reductions in saturated fat and body mass index (BMI).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Once intervention class or staff contact is removed, obese adults participating in behavioral weight-loss programs often give up healthy eating habits and regain weight. We examined whether taste-based goal setting, which minimizes perceived deprivation by promoting taste and moderation, would sustain long-term reductions in saturated fat and body mass index (BMI). Participants were randomized to Taste-Based Choices (taste-based goal setting + a standard 6-month behavioral weight-loss intervention), Smart Consumers (a standard 6-month intervention alone) or Community Access (access to commercial/community-based behavioral weight-loss programs) and followed over 18 months. To test our hypotheses, we examined a set of orthogonal contrasts (TBC and SC vs. CA; TBC vs. SC) on reductions in saturated fat (Block FFQ) and clinic-measured BMI.</detailed_description>
