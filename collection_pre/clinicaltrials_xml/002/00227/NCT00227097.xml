	<brief_title>Educ'Avk: Recommendations for the Antivitamin K's Gestion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard strategies for the implementation of recommendations are exclusively focused on practitioners. But often they do not appear to be effective (insufficient time accorded per patient, lack of training…). However some qualitative surveys have shown the benefit of a greater role on the part patient in the process of transmitting recommendations through the practitioner. In this study, patient education is begun by the angiologist or a pharmacy student under the responsibility of the hospital investigator. Follow-up is realized by the patient’s general practitioner. More patient involvement in the realization of the recommendations could increase the proportion of practitioners who follow the recommendations and decrease the iatrogenicity of antivitamin K (AVK).</detailed_description>
