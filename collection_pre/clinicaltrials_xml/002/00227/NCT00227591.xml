	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well giving lenalidomide together with prednisone works in treating patients with myelofibrosis. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of myelofibrosis by blocking blood flow to the cancer. It may also stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving lenalidomide together with prednisone may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide and Prednisone in Treating Patients With Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the rate of complete or partial remission from treatment with a combination of lenalidomide and prednisone in patients with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine drug toxicity. II. To examine duration of response. III. To examine the effect of treatment on bone marrow fibrosis, angiogenesis, and cytogenetics. OUTLINE: For courses 1 and 2, patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily and oral prednisone once daily on days 1-28. For course 3, patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-28 and oral prednisone once on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, and 27. Patients with stable or responding disease after course 3 receive oral lenalidomide alone once daily on days 1-28 for courses 4-6. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for up to 5 years from study entry.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must be diagnosed with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM); agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, postpolycythemic myeloid metaplasia, or postthrombocythemic myeloid metaplasia are included NOTE: Diagnosis must be confirmed by central pathology review; diagnostic samples must be submitted; patient may register and begin treatment based on the local pathology review. If the central review does not confirm patient's eligibility to participate in the trial, protocol treatment must be discontinued Patient must have discontinued chemotherapy (hydroxyurea, alpha interferon, anagrelide, other myelosuppressive agents, thalidomide, or any other experimental therapy) as well as growth factors and systemic use of corticosteroids &gt;= 28 days prior to starting study drug All nonhematologic toxicity must be resolved to =&lt; grade 1 Patient must be lenalidomidena√Øve (never treated with lenalidomide) ECOG performance status (PS) of 0, 1, or 2 at study entry Hemoglobin level =&lt; 10 g/dL or transfusiondependent Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,000 uL Platelet count &gt;= 100,000 uL Serum creatinine =&lt; 2.0 mg/dL Total bilirubin =&lt; 2.0 mg/dL (if elevated; direct bilirubin =&lt; 2.0 mg/dL) AST (SGOT) =&lt; 3 x ULN unless attributed to hepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding because this study involves an investigational agent whose genotoxic, mutagenic, and teratogenetic effects on the developing fetus and newborn are unknown; women of childbearing potential who are sexually active, must use 2 accepted methods of birth control at the same time for 4 weeks prior to lenalidomide treatment, during lenalidomide treatment, and up to 4 weeks after lenalidomide treatment is finished; sexually active males must use a latex condom for contraception during the study and up to 4 weeks after treatment with lenalidomide has ended All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test 1014 days prior to the start of lenalidomide treatment to rule out pregnancy; another blood test to rule out pregnancy must be done 24 hours prior to the start of treatment with lenalidomide Patient must not have any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which, based on the physician's opinion, places the patient at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study Patient must not have any known hypersensitivity to thalidomide or lenalidomide Patient must not have any known positive status for HIV or infectious hepatitis type A, B or C Patient must not have any other active malignancy NOTE: SWOG patients are strongly encouraged to be registered on SWOG9007 ("Cytogenetic Studies in Leukemia Patients"); SWOG institutions registering patients to SWOG9007 should follow the instructions for specimen submission</criteria>
