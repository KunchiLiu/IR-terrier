	<brief_summary>ALTU-238 is a long acting crystalline formulation of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) that is being developed for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency in adults and children. ALTU-238 is designed to require fewer injections than the currently available formulations of rhGH.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Growth hormone deficient men and women ages 1860 years with a hypothalamic and/or pituitary structural lesion or longstanding idiopathic GHD Growth hormone deficiency as determined by pituitary testing within the last five years by either of the two following tests: 1. Insulin hypoglycemia (glucose &lt; 50 mg/dL) with maximum GH &lt; 5 ng/mL (5 µg/L) by radioimmunoassay or &lt; 2.5 µg/L, if measured by immunoradiometric assay 2. ArginineGHRH infusions with maximum GH &lt; 5 ng/mL (5 µg/L) or &lt; 2.5 µg/L, if measured by immunoradiometric assay Women must be of nonchild bearing potential (hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or IUD are acceptable) during the three months prior to entering the study, or postmenopausal (no menses for one year or more), or six to twelve months without menses and βestradiol levels &lt; 20 pg/mL Glucocorticoid use is allowed provided the subject has been on physiologic (&lt;7.5 mg prednisone or equivalent/day) replacement doses for at least 3 months Free thyroxine (T4) within the normal range at Screening. If the subject is receiving thyroid hormone replacement therapy, the dose must be stable for at least 6 weeks prior to Screening Willing and able to provide written informed consent BMI 20 36 kg/m2 Any previous or ongoing clinically significant illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, could prevent the subject from completing the study Any history of cancer within the past 5 years, except for dermal squamous and basal cell carcinoma with documented 6month remission. Subjects with a more recent history of successfully treated cervical carcinoma in situ will not be excluded provided there is documented 12month remission BMI &lt;20 or &gt;36 kg/m2 Any allergic or abnormal reaction to human growth hormone Inability of the subject to discontinue use of their regularly prescribed human growth hormone treatment from six weeks prior to Day 1 through the completion of the study Serum creatinine &gt; 1.4 mg/dL Hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia from any cause Hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia or any other disorder which may affect bone and bone markers including the use of bisphosphonates or other medications for osteoporosis Participation in another clinical trial 30 days prior to screening Demonstrated inability to comply with protocol requirements (e.g. uncooperative attitude, inability to return for followup visits, history of medical noncompliance, and/or poor likelihood of completing the study) Blood donation within 56 days of the screening visit Plasma donation within seven days of the screening visit Positive serum pregnancy test Women of child bearing potential Abuse of alcohol; to be determined by principal investigator Abuse of prescription or illicit drugs; to be determined by principal investigator</criteria>
