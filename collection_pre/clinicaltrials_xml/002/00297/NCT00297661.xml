	<brief_summary>Context: Sirolimus-eluting stents and paclitaxel-eluting stents, as compared with bare-metal stents, reduce the risk of restenosis. It is unclear whether there are differences in safety and efficacy between the two types of drug-eluting stents. Objective: To determine differences in safety and efficacy between sirolimus and paclitaxel eluting stents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sirolimus-Eluting Versus Paclitaxel-Eluting Stents for Coronary Revascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: Randomized controlled, observer-blind trial comparing sirolimus-eluting stents with paclitaxel-eluting stents Patients: 1012 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The two groups had similar baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with either stable angina or an acute coronary syndrome were eligible to participate if they had at least one lesion with stenosis of at least 50 percent in a vessel with a reference diameter between 2.25 and 4.00 mm that was suitable for stent implantation. Allergy to antiplatelet drugs, heparin, stainless steel, contrast agents, sirolimus, or paclitaxel; participation in another coronarydevice study; and terminal illness.</criteria>
