	<brief_title>Spinal Manipulative Therapy: Dual-Task Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study sought to determine whether a 2-week regimen of spinal manipulative therapy could improve postural control under 2 conditions. Condition one was a complex postural task which consisted of a shoulder width stance on a compliant surface with eyes closed to remove visual input. Condition 2 was as above with the addition of visio-spatial cognitive task (serial 7s subtraction). These tasks were performed on a force-place designed to capture center of pressure data. Data was captured prior to the onset of therapy and then again after 6 treatment sessions (2-week period). Data was also collected 1 week post treatment to note any lasting effects following therapy. This pilot study utilized a repeated measures designed with no control group.</detailed_description>
