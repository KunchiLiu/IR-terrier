	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of roflumilast on exacerbation rate and pulmonary function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Roflumilast will be administered orally once daily in the morning at one dose level. The study duration will last up to 56 weeks. The study will provide further data on safety and tolerability of roflumilast.
