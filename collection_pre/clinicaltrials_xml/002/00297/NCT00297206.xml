	<brief_summary>Limited data are available on valaciclovir use in children and valaciclovir is not currently approved for use in pediatrics. The marketed formulation of valaciclovir is not ideal for use in pre-adolescent patients who may have trouble swallowing solid oral dosage forms. An extemporaneous suspension formulation of valaciclovir has been developed to expedite the provision of benefits to children similar to those from administration of valaciclovir solid formulations in adults.</brief_summary>
