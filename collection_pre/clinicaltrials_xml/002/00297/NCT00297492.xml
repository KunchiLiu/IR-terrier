	<brief_title>Gradual vs. Abrupt Cessation Treatment for Smoking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For cigarette smokers who intend to stop smoking, most treatment guidelines recommend abrupt cessation. There is evidence from some small studies that gradually reducing the number of cigarettes per day smoked may increase success in quitting. In this study, we will randomize smokers who want to quit smoking in the next 30 days to one of three groups: gradual reduction, abrupt cessation, and minimal intervention.</detailed_description>
