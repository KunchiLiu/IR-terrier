	<brief_title>Preoperative Combined Radiochemotherapy for Patients With Rectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 60 patients with locally advanced rectal carcinoma (cT3, Nx, M0) of the lower and middle rectum will be recruited. The radiotherapy is an essential part of therapy of the advanced rectal carcinoma and the additional administration of a chemotherapy will positively influence the effect of the therapy (downstaging-rate, rate of distant metastases, survival-rate). Probably a downsizing and downstaging (as per literature and by own experience) can be reached with an preoperative combined radiochemotherapy.</detailed_description>
