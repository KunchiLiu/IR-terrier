	<brief_title>Motivational Interviewing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this randomized control trial is to evaluate, among 190 African-American patients with poorly controlled hypertension followed in a community-based primary care practice, whether motivational interviewing is more effective than usual care (routine counseling) in achieving adherence to prescribed blood pressure medications at 12 months. The project aims to: 1) determine whether patients who receive motivational interview counseling have greater reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure than those in the control group at 12 months. Clinic blood pressure readings will be assessed at baseline and at every three months thereafter for one year and 2) assess the effect of self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation as potential mediators of motivational interview on adherence. Self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation will be assessed at baseline and every three months thereafter for one year.</detailed_description>
