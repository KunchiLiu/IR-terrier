	<brief_summary>A novel procedure for generalized anxiety disorder where an odorant cue is paired with the state of deep relaxation during training. It is hypothesized that by smelling the odor in an anxiety-provoking situation, the patient will more easily invoke a state of relaxation, providing greater relief from the distressing tension and worry that characterize GAD.</brief_summary>

With the odor serving as a contextual cue for the state of relaxation.</detailed_description>
