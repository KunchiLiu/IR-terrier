	<brief_title>KATHY:Cognitive-behavioural Therapy for Hypochondriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The central feature of hypochondriasis is preoccupation or fear of having a serious disease based on misinterpretation of bodily signs. Psychotherapeutic treatments have developed with focus on different aspects of the condition. Several controlled trials have examined the effectiveness of different treatment strategies. Hypothesis: Hypochondriasis is accessible for treatment. Specific cognitive treatment focused on misinterpretation of bodily sensations is more effective than short-term non-specific psychodynamic psychotherapy. Method: Patients with hypochondriasis were randomisation to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), psychodynamic psychotherapy, or waiting list. Patients on waiting list were subsequently randomised to CBT or dynamic psychotherapy. The patients received six-teen sessions over a period of six month. Follow-up assessments were made six and twelve month after treatment.</detailed_description>
