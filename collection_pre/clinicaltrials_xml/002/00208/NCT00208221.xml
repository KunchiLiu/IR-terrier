	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a dose of ramipril combined with a normal dose of telmisartan 80 mg will be more effective than ramipril 20 mg in reducing microalbuminuria in hypertensive patients with diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Higher Dose of Ramipril Versus Addition of Telmisartan-Ramipril in Hypertension and Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of ramipril 10 mg and telmisartan 80 mg versus ramipril 20 mg in patients with diabetes type II, hypertension and microalbuminuria (Urinary-albuminuria creatinine ratio of 2.0 to 25 mg/mmol) on 1. Microalbuminuria 2. Blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and ABPM), Renin-angiotensin system, Catecholamines, Oxydative stress 3. Comparison at 4, 8 and 12 weeks with addition of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg if BP over 130/80 mmHg</detailed_description>

Premenopausal women whoo are not surgically sterile or who are not practicing acceptable means of birth control and do not agree to submit to periodic pregnancy tests. Known or secondary forms of hypertension. Intolerance to angiotensin (AT) 1 receptor blockers or angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Hepatic or renal dysfunction. Creatinine &gt; 150 umol or enzymes greater than 2 times upper limit of normal. Hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis, renal artery stenosis on a solitary kidney, postrenal transplant or with only one kidney. Uncorrected volume depletion.

Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) within the preceding three months. History of angioedema. Sustained ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or other clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmias as determined by the clinical investigator. Second or third degree AV block, left bundle branch block or any clinically relevant conduction abnormality as determined by the clinical investigator. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, hemodynamically relevant stenosis of aortic or mitral valve. Administration of digoxin. Patients with a fasting glucose greater than 7.0 History of drug or alcohol dependency. Use of antihypertensive agents such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, alphablockers, betablockers, calcium channel antagonists, direct vasodilators that cannot be stopped for the trial. Administration of other nonantihypertensive medications known to affect blood pressure (e.g. oral corticosteroids, monoamine oxidase [MAO] inhibitors, nitrates) at any time during the trial. Chronic use of salt substitutes containing potassium chloride; potassium supplements; extreme dietary restrictions. Uncorrected sodium depletion as defined by a serum sodium level less than 135 mEq/L. Clinically significant hyperkalemia as defined by serum potassium level greater than 5.2 mEq/L.

Known hypersensitivity to any component of telmisartan, ramipril or hydrochlorothiazide. Any other clinical condition which, in the opinion of the principal investigator, would not allow safe completion of the protocol and safe administration of trial medication. Blood donation in the preceding 1 month.</criteria>
