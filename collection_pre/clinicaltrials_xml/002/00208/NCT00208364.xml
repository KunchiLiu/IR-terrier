	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to monitor the performance and determine the metal ion release of the Pinnacle™ Cup with a metal-on-metal bearing combination in the treatment of patients with hip joint disease requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the study will be evaluated at regular intervals following hip surgery using patient, clinical and x-ray assessments. A subset of patients will also have blood samples taken at regular intervals to allow the metal ion levels to be determined.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>i) Male or female subjects, aged between 18 and 70 years inclusive. ii) Subjects who are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in this investigation and from whom consent has been obtained. iii) Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are able to understand this investigation, cooperate with the investigational procedures and are willing to return to the hospital for all the required postoperative followups. iv) Subjects undergoing primary total hip replacement who are suitable for cementless acetabular components. i) Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing condition that would compromise their participation and followup in this study. ii) Subjects undergoing revision hip replacement. iii) Women who are pregnant. iv) Subjects who are known drug or alcohol abusers or with psychological disorders that could affect followup care or treatment outcomes. v) Subjects who have participated in a clinical study with an investigational product in the last 12 months. vi) Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims. Additional Exclusion Criteria for Subjects Having Blood Analysis: 1. Subjects who currently have other metallic foreign bodies including trauma products and joint arthroplasties unless known to be pure titanium or titanium alloy. 2. Subjects with an occupational exposure to cobalt or chromium. 3. Subjects who have ingested medication or vitamins containing cobalt or chromium within the last 12 months. 4. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, will possibly require a separate joint replacement operation within the next two years, including revision operations. 5. Subjects who are undergoing a simultaneous bilateral total hip replacement.</criteria>
