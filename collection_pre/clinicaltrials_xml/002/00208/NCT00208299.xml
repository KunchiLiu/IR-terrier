	<brief_summary>Adenoscan® (adenosine) is an approved pharmacological stress agent indicated as an adjunct to thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in patients unable to exercise adequately. The investigational drug, regadenoson (CVT-3146) is a selective A2A adenosine receptor agonist, the receptor responsible for coronary vasodilation, and is being studied for potential use as a pharmacologic stress agent in myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) studies. This study will compare the safety and efficacy of regadenoson to that of Adenoscan in detecting reversible myocardial perfusion defects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ADVANCE MPI 1: Study of Regadenoson Versus Adenoscan® in Patients Undergoing Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ADVANCE MPI 1 is a multi-national, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, parallel group clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of regadenoson in SPECT MPI compared to that of the approved pharmacological stress agent, Adenoscan. Patients referred for a clinically indicated pharmacological stress MPI study will be eligible for enrollment. The trial is designed: - to compare the pharmacological stress SPECT images obtained with regadenoson to those obtained with Adenoscan, and - to compare the safety and tolerability of the two stress agents.</detailed_description>
