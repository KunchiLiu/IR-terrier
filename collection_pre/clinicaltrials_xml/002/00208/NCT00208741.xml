	<brief_title>Study To Evaluate The Effects Of Gabitril™ In Patients With Social Anxiety Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is being conducted at two sites in the United States. Approximately 50 patients, who are between the ages of 18 and 65 years old will be enrolled at Emory. This study consists of two parts. The first part consists of 12 weeks of open-label treatment with Gabitril. If the study doctor determines that the patients condition has improved and they have completed the initial 12 weeks of treatment they may be eligible for the second part of the study. This part is a 24-week double-blind treatment period with either Gabitril or placebo (inactive medication). There will also be a follow-up visit about 1 to 3 weeks after they have completed taking the study medication. Altogether study participation is expected to last approximately 37 weeks.</detailed_description>
