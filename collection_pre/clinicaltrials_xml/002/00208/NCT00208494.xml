	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of artificial hips with metal heads and metal sockets to artificial hips with ceramic heads articulating with metal socket components. The success of the total hip arthroplasty (THA) will be based upon all of the following clinical and radiographic criteria being met at the two-year evaluation: (1) the patient's clinical results as measured using modified Harris Hip evaluation rating system, and the absence of a complication that requires the surgical removal or replacement of a component; and (2) radiographic findings at study endpoint (i.e., two years follow-up). Clinical and radiographic success at two (2) years postoperative is required for the study hip to be deemed successful.</brief_summary>
