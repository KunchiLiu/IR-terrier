	<brief_title>A Comparison of Two Standard Therapies in the Management of Dementia With Agitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous researchers have attempted to establish a "target dose" for antipsychotic medications (such as risperidone, quetiapine, or olanzapine) in treating symptoms of agitation in dementia. They have tried to identify the dose with the best risk-benefit ratio for patients considering the significant side effects the medications can cause. Patients taking the doses identified respond only partially and continue to experience some symptoms of agitation, however. One study showed that in patients whose agitation symptoms were not adequately controlled by the target dose of an antipsychotic medication alone, the addition of divalproex further improved behavior in 72% of patients. The goal of this study is to compare two standard therapies for the management of agitation symptoms in dementia patients. Subjects in this study will include patients who are admitted to the Wesley Woods Inpatient service for the treatment for dementia complicated by behavioral symptoms. After a patient reaches the target dose of risperidone (up to 1.5 mg/day), quetiapine (up to 175 mg/day), or olanzapine (up to 7.5 mg/day) and agitation symptoms are still not adequately managed, he or she will be randomized to one of two groups. Group 1 participants will continue to receive increasing doses of antipsychotic medication until symptoms are controlled or he or she is unable to tolerate the dose. Group 2 participants will continue to receive the target dose of antipsychotic medication and also receive increasing doses of divalproex until symptoms are controlled or he or she is unable to tolerate the dose. Patients will be evaluated at 4 time points during hospitalization. Patients will be evaluated using scales that measure changes in cognition, function, and behavior. Laboratory and ECG results, and scales testing for movement disorders will be done to monitor safety. The family will then be contacted about 3 months the patient's hospitalization to assess current treatment status, residential status, and health status.</detailed_description>
