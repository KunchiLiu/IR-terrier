	<brief_summary>It has been proposed that a higher cut off for BMI (body mass index) is to be used in Maori to define overweight and obesity. However, no one has assessed the prevalence of co-morbid conditions associated with BMI. It is well known that Maori are at greater risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease compared to non-Maori and a delay in the identification of those who are overweight and obese may be detrimental for Maori. We will assess BMI, other measures of adiposity and prevalence of co-morbid conditions with a comparison with a similar matched non-Maori population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measures of Obesity and Co-Morbid Conditions in Maori</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a body composition analysis study of people self-identifying Maori and non-Maori participants from both Dunedin and Invercargill. The study consists of a clinical visit for anthropometry and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), followed by a single Dexa Scan visit. Participants meeting all the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study. Outcome will be determined by examining Dexa Scan data and surrogate clinical endpoints. The clinical endpoints include: anthropometric measurements, Dexa analysis, bioelectric impedance, and BP measurements, and the biochemical measures of: lipid profile, fasting insulin and glucose, liver functions and uric acid levels.</detailed_description>
