	<brief_summary>New immunization recommendations in the US include vaccination of adolescents against pertussis and meningococcal disease. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Tdap (Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid And Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed) and MCV4 (Meningococcal conjugate vaccine against serotypes A, C, Y and W-135) vaccines be administered to adolescents at the same office visit if vaccination with both vaccines is indicated. Therefore, this study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with Boostrix co-administered with Menactra as compared to the administration of either vaccine alone in healthy adolescents 11 - 18 years of age.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A phase IV, randomized, partially blinded multicenter study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with GlaxoSmithKline's tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine, adsorbed [Tdap Boostrix®] co-administered intramuscularly with Aventis-Pasteur's meningococcal (serogroups A, C, Y and W-135) polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine (Menactra™) as compared to the administration of either vaccine alone in healthy adolescents 11-18 years of age. "Experimental design: Prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter study with three groups: Group 1: Boostrix + Menactra on Day 0, blood samples at Month 0 and Month 1 Group 2: Boostrix on Day 0, Menactra at Month 1, blood samples at Month 0, Month 1, and Month 2 Group 3: Menactra on Day 0, Boostrix at Month 1, blood samples at Month 0, Month 1 and Month 2 Treatment allocation: randomized 1:1:1 Type of study: self-contained Duration of the study: Approximately one month for each subject in Group 1 and approximately two months for each subject in the Group 2 and Group 3."</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy subjects as established by medical history and historydirected physical examination before entering into the study. Previously completed routine childhood vaccinations against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis diseases according to the recommended vaccination schedule at the time. Females of childbearing potential at the time of study entry are required to have a negative pregnancy test prior to administration of the dose of vaccine and are required to be abstinent or use adequate contraceptive precautions for one month prior to vaccination. Subjects also are required to agree to continue such precautions for two months after vaccination. Administration of a preschool booster of DTP vaccine within the previous 5 years Administration of a diphteriatetanus (Td) booster within the previous 5 years Previous vaccination against N. meningitidis Hypersensitivity to latex History of serious allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) following any other tetanus toxoid, diphteria toxoid or pertussiscontaining vaccine or any component of the study vaccines History of encephalopathy (e.g. coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) within seven days of administration of a previous dose of pertussis vaccine taht is not attributable to another identifiable cause Progressive neurologic disorder, uncontrolled epilepsy or progressive encephalopathy: pertussis vaccine should not be administered to individuals with these conditions until a treatment regimen has been established and the condition has stabilized Previous history of GuillainBarré syndrome</criteria>
