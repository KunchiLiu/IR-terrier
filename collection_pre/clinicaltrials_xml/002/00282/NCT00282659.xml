	<brief_title>The Use of Magnesium to Improve Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, and Glucose Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular cation and plays a vital role in many physiologic processes. It has been determined that patients with cardiovascular disease have intracellular magnesium (Mgi) deficiencies. Among the ICD registries in Europe and the United States 64% and 77% of patients also carry the diagnosis of CAD, respectively. Patients with CAD have risk factors that lead to the development and or propagation of atherosclerosis. Paramount among these risk factors are hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Comparison: Magnesium compared to placebo in patients with ICDs to evaluate the effect they have on cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose.</detailed_description>
