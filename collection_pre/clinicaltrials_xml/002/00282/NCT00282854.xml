	<brief_title>Genetics of Rolandic Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common type of childhood epilepsy—affecting more than 50,000 children in the United States—and has a complex genetic inheritance. The seizure prognosis is relatively benign, however, many children with RE also have problems with speech and language, reading, and motor coordination. Symptoms of the disorder overlap with more severe types of epilepsy. The purpose of this study is to find the genes that influence RE and its related traits. Identifying genetic causes for the variants would improve diagnosis and allow for early intervention. Researchers will enroll 1000 children with RE and 3000 controls for participation in the study. The scientists will request medical histories and (salivary) DNA samples from the participants. Participation can be completed by mail and telephone. Results from this study should provide important information regarding diagnosis and prognosis of RE, may be useful in clinical management, and, eventually, may lead to a cure for this and other forms of epilepsy.</detailed_description>
