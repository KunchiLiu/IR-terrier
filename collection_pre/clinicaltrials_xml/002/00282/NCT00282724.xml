	<brief_summary>Lamellar ichthyosis is a congenital disease of the skin with a generalized scaling. The primary activity of liarozole is considered to be the inhibition of the degradation of a substance called retinoic acid, which is the principal endogenous regulator of growth and differentiation of epithelial tissues in mammals. The current study intends to evaluate the efficacy and safety in patients with lamellar ichthyosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Two Doses of Liarozole vs. Placebo for the Treatment of Lamellar Ichthyosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lamellar ichthyosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that is apparent at birth and is present throughout life. Although the disorder is not life threatening, it is quite disfiguring and causes considerable psychological stress to affected patients. Prevalence is less than 1 case per 300,000 individuals. Treatment is mainly symptomatic i.e. emollients with or without keratolytic agents. Treatment with systemic retinoids is reserved for those patients, refractory to conventional therapy, because of the long-term adverse effects and teratogenicity of systemic retinoids. Liarozole may provide a new concept for the treatment of this condition. Because of its mechanism of action, retinoic acid (RA) levels will only be increased in tissues that are targets for RA production. The proposed Phase II/III study intends to evaluate the efficacy of liarozole compared with placebo, in patients with lamellar ichthyosis.</detailed_description>
