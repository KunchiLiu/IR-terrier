	<brief_title>Balloon Prophylaxis of Aneurysmal Vasospasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) afflicts over 30,000 patients a year in the United States. Fifteen percent of those who survive the initial bleeding die or suffer disabilities because of delayed ischemic deficit (stroke) due to vasospasm. Vasospasm is a condition in which the arteries in the brain constrict, not allowing sufficient blood flow and oxygenation. Research on the pharmacological prevention and treatment of vasospasm has resulted in only minimal improvement for this problem. Transluminal ballooning is a procedure that opens blood vessels, allowing blood flow and oxygen to get to the brain more easily. Researchers believe that this dilation of the blood vessels lasts for at least 7 days. This procedure is used to treat severe vasospasm although it is not commonly used to prevent vasospasm. The purpose of this trial is to find out if this procedure, performed immediately after the aneurysm is secured, prevents spasm in the brain and improves patient outcome. Eligible SAH patients whose aneurysm has been repaired by neurosurgical or endovascular procedure and who are enrolled in the study will be randomized to receive either the prophylactic transluminal ballooning procedure or to receive standard care, which includes currently existing therapies for the treatment of vasospasm. Participants will be asked to return for follow-up examinations at 3 and 6 months to evaluate recovery using a standardized outcome scale.</detailed_description>
