	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a 12-week candesartan treatment compared with hydrochlorothiazide on insulin sensitivity assessed with hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Double-Blind Randomized Cross-Over Trial Comparing Metabolic Effects of Candesartan, Hydrochlorothiazide and Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate the mechanisms underlaying the diabetes-preventing effect of candesartan with respect to possible impact on insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and adipose tissue function and distribution. For this purpose comparisons will be performed with hydrochlorothiazide and placebo treatment. It is hypothesized that candesartan will improve insulin sensitivity as compared to hydrochlorothiazide and possibly also in comparison with placebo and that this could be explained by altered fat tissue function or distribution or by an altered sympathetic to parasympathetic balance in the autonomic nervous system. Hydrochlorthiazide is chosen as comparator because thiazides are a recommended firs-line therapy in hypertension. This drug class has some detrimental effects on glucose tolerance and in insulin sensitivity.</detailed_description>
