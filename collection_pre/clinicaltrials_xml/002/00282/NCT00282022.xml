	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as VNP40101M, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well VNP40101M works in treating patients with recurrent or refractory locally advanced or metastatic small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VNP40101M in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Locally Advanced or Metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall response rate (partial and complete) in patients with relapsed or refractory locally advanced or metastatic small cell lung cancer treated with VNP40101M. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease state (sensitive relapse [progressive disease &gt; 3 months after responding to first-line chemotherapy] vs resistant disease [progressive disease during or ≤ 3 months after first-line chemotherapy]). Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 15-30 minutes once weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 6 courses. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of therapy after CR. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 18 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 87 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
