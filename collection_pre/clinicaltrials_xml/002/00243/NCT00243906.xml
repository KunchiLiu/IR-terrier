	<brief_title>Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS) II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal of Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS II) study is to refine thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute ischemic stroke who can be treated within three hours of stroke onset. This multi-center, non-randomized pilot study will provide preliminary data about the benefits and risks of combined intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial (IA) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and low-intensity ultrasound energy in ischemic stroke patients with baseline NIHSSS &gt;/= 10 in whom intravenous treatment can be started within three hours of stroke onset. rt-PA is a thrombolytic, clot-dissolving drug. The primary objectives for the study are to obtain reliable estimates of the effectiveness and safety of a treatment approach combining IV/IA rt-PA and ultrasound for stroke patients; and to determine if the estimated effectiveness of combined IV/IA rt-PA at 3 months—as compared to the 3 month outcome of placebo-treated patients in the NINDS rt-PA Stroke Trial—warrants proceeding to a large, phase III randomized trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age: 18 through 80 years (i.e., candidates must have had their 18th birthday, but not had their 81st birthday) Initiation of intravenous rtPA within 3 hours of onset of stroke symptoms. Time of onset is defined as the last time when the subject was witnessed to be at baseline (i.e., subjects who have stroke symptoms upon awakening will be considered to have their onset at beginning of sleep) An NIHSSS &gt;/= 10 at the time that intravenous rtPA is begun History of stroke in the past 3 months Previous intracranial hemorrhage, neoplasm, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or arteriovenous malformation Clinical presentation suggests a subarachnoid hemorrhage, even if initial CT scan is normal Hypertension at time of treatment; systolic BP &gt; 185 or diastolic &gt; 110 mm Hg) or aggressive measures to lower blood pressure to below these limits are needed. Presumed septic embolus Presumed pericarditis, including pericarditis after acute myocardial infarction Recent (within 30 days) surgery or biopsy of parenchymal organ Recent (within 30 days) trauma, with internal injuries or ulcerative wounds Recent (within 90 days) severe head trauma or head trauma with loss of consciousness Any active or recent (within 30 days) hemorrhage Known hereditary or acquired hemorrhagic diathesis, coagulation factor deficiency or oral anticoagulant therapy with INR &gt; 1.5 or institutionally equivalent prothrombin time Females of childbearing potential who are known to be pregnant and/or lactating or who have positive pregnancy tests on admission Baseline lab values: glucose &lt; 50mg/dl or &gt; 400mg/dl, platelets &lt;100,000, or Hct &lt;25 Subjects that require hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis Subjects who have received heparin within 48 hours must have a normal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) to be eligible Subjects with an arterial puncture at a noncompressible site or a lumbar puncture in the previous 7 days Subjects with a seizure at onset of stroke Subjects with a preexisting neurological or psychiatric disease that would confound the neurological or functional evaluations Other serious, advanced, or terminal illness Any other condition that the investigator feels would pose a significant hazard to the subject if Activase (Alteplase) therapy is initiated Current participation in another research drug treatment protocol; subject cannot start another experimental agent until after 90 days Informed consent is not or cannot be obtained. For example, obtunded subjects are not automatically excluded from the study. However, if the next of kin or legal guardian (i.e., the individual legally empowered in the state where the consent is obtained) cannot provide consent, randomization and entry into the study could not proceed CT Scan High density lesion consistent with hemorrhage of any degree Significant mass effect with midline shift Large (more than 1/3 of the middle cerebral artery) regions of clear hypodensity on the baseline CT scan. Sulcal effacement and/or loss of greywhite differentiation alone are not contraindications for treatment</criteria>
