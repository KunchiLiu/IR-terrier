	<brief_summary>Treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa is increasingly difficult. Resistance to cheap efficient antimalarial drugs poses an increasing threat. The rapid emergence of resistance to sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine, already seen in East Africa is growing and is likely to have an striking impact on mortality in many other African regions where no obvious alternatives are available. WHO recommends the use of drug combinations containing artemisinin compounds, i.e., artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT). Previous clinical trials have shown that the combination of artesunate with mefloquine is highly effective and well tolerated in the treatment of multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria, retaining the benefit of rapidity of action while augmenting cure rates, and apparently slowing the development of mefloquine resistance. Compliance with sequential combination regimen of antimalarial drugs is notoriously poor. Therefore, in order to limit the development of resistance to both drugs and ameliorate patients' compliance to antimalarial treatments, an optimal simultaneous combination regimen of artesunate and mefloquine in a practical single blister pack has been developed by Mepha Ltd. and successfully tested.

	<detailed_description>Artequin dosages could only be tested in children able to swallow tablets and with a body weight of more than 20 kg. However, there is a great need for an Artequin formulation for smaller children unable to swallow tablets. The new Artequin Paediatric oral formulation is a flavoured, taste-masked preparation of granules of 50 mg artesunate and 125 mg mefloquine as a fixed-dose combination (once daily in one single Stickpack, i.e. 3 Stickpacks for a 3-day treatment). It is suitable for children with up to 20 kg body weight (with a range of 10-20 kg).</detailed_description>
