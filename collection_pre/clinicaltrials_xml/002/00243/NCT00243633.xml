	<brief_summary>The conventional sonography is frequently used to detect incidental focal liver lesions because of its availability, innocuity and low cost. Nevertheless, sensibility and specificity of conventional sonography does not exceed 70% for tumoral affections. Consequently the interest of this practice must be reconsidered by studying its ratio cost/diagnosis contribution. These limitations of conventional sonography have led to the use of other imaging modalities and invasive or costly procedures such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or biopsy. The availability of real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging (CEUS) has changed the strategy in the characterization of focal liver lesions, on healthy or cirrhotic liver in a neoplastic context or not, without inconvenience for the patient. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the place of CEUS in term of diagnostic relevance and catch of load cost, in the characterization of focal liver lesions detected but not characterized by CT or conventional sonography.</brief_summary>
