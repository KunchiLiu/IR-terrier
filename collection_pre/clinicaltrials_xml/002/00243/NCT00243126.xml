	<brief_summary>This is an exploratory/developmental study to support the early phases of development and evaluation of a family-based HIV prevention program for adolescent girls prior to a full-scale trial. Research on the new intervention will include evaluating the feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability of the intervention, and allow us to obtain the preliminary data needed as a pre-requisite to a larger-scale intervention study. Adolescent females and their mother/guardian will be randomized to either: a family-based risk reduction intervention; or a no-treatment control group condition. Participants in both conditions will be assessed at baseline, immediate post-intervention, and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. A subset of families (12 adolescents and 12 mothers) will participate in a qualitative interview following the 6-month follow-up, in which information will be obtained on participant perception of procedures and intervention content, and whether they have utilized skills taught following the end of the project.</brief_summary>

A subset of 24 participants from the intervention condition (12 adolescents and 12 mothers) will participate in a qualitative interview following the 6-month follow-up, in which information will be obtained on participant perception of procedures and intervention content, and whether they have utilized skills taught following the end of the project. Interviewers will collect participant data from the baseline and follow-up behavioral interviews using a Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) method on a portable computer.</detailed_description>
