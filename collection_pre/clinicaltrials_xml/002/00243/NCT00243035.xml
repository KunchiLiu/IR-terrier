	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib when given together with bortezomib and to see how well they work in treating patients with relapsed multiple myeloma. Tipifarnib and bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving tipifarnib together with bortezomib may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of tipifarnib when administered with bortezomib in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma. (Phase I) II. Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II) III. Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II) Secondary I. Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II) Tertiary I. Determine whether this regimen overcomes CAM-DR in primary myeloma cells and establish whether ex vivo efficacy predicts a clinical response in these patients. II. Determine if activated Akt predicts clinical resistance and if levels of phosphorylated Akt are reduced by tipifarnib and bortezomib in these patients. III. Determine whether molecular profiles from primary isolates (suspension vs adhered) correlate with clinical response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of tipifarnib followed by a phase II study. Phase I: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 6 patients are treated at the MTD. Phase II: Patients receive bortezomib as in phase I and tipifarnib as in phase I at the MTD. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 52-64 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
