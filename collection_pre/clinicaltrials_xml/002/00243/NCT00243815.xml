	<brief_title>Use of Ibuprofen to Prevent IUD Site Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increased menstrual bleeding and pain are the primary side effects that lead to early removal of the copper intrauterine device (IUD). Ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are a proven treatment for such IUD-induced problems. This study will determine if prophylactic use of ibuprofen can improve continuation rates of the IUD. A total of 2,019 first-time IUD users were recruited in Chile for this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Half of the participants were given ibuprofen and instructions to take 1200 mg daily during menses (for up to 5 days each cycle) for the first six months of IUD use. The other half were asked to take an identical-appearing placebo in the same manner. The primary study endpoint was IUD removal within 12 months of insertion.</detailed_description>
