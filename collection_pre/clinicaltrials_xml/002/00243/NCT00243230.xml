	<brief_summary>Vicriviroc (vye-kri-VYE-rock) is an investigational drug (not yet approved by Government Regulatory Authorities for commercial use) that belongs to a new class of drugs, called CCR5 receptor blockers. This group of drugs blocks one of the ways HIV enters T-cells (the cells that fight infection). The purpose of this 48-week study is to evaluate 2 dose levels of vicriviroc in HIV patients who have not responded adequately to standard HIV treatments. This study was designed to evaluate these doses of vicriviroc, when taken in combination with other appropriate HIV drugs, in terms of ability to decrease the level of HIV (viral load) in the blood and safety</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vicriviroc (SCH 417690) in Combination Treatment With Optimized ART Regimen in Experienced Subjects (VICTOR-E1) (Study P03672AM6)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study of vicriviroc maleate in HIV subjects infected with CCR5-tropic virus only for whom standard antiretroviral treatment (ART) has failed. The study will evaluate the antiviral efficacy of two doses of vicriviroc (20 mg QD and 30 mg QD) compared with placebo when added to optimized ART therapy. The optimized background regimen will be chosen by the investigator based on results of drug susceptibility tests, history of prior antiretroviral drug use by the subject, and drug toxicity. The background regimen must include at least 3 antiretroviral drugs (not including study drug), one of which must be a ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor (â‰¥100 mg ritonavir). There will be two interim analyses: when all subjects have completed 12 weeks and 24 weeks of treatment, respectively. Based on the balance of safety and efficacy determined in these analyses, a dosage or dosages will be selected for further study in additional registrational trials. The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted when all subjects have completed 48 weeks of treatment. After Week 48, subjects who meet applicable criteria will be offered open label vicriviroc 30 mg QD, if appropriate, until the sponsor terminates the clinical development of vicriviroc. Additionally, subjects who discontinue early from the study prior to Week 48 will be offered re-screening for the open label segment of the study.</detailed_description>
