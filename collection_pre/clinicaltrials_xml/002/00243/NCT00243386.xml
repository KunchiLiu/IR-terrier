	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this randomized, two-arm parallel clinical study in 66 previously treated patients with severe or moderately severe hemophilia A is to compare the rate of bleeding episodes for standard prophylaxis (20-40 IU/kg every 48 ± 6 hours; actual dose determined by the investigator) with that of alternate prophylaxis (20-80 IU/kg every 72 + 6 hours; actual dose determined by Baxter utilizing an algorithm and the patient's pharmacokinetic data). The rates of bleeding episodes for the on-demand regimen and the prophylaxis regimens will also be compared for the cross-over portion of the study. Enrolled patients will be treated originally on demand for a period of 6 months and then they will be randomized into one of the prophylaxis arms. Prophylactic treatment will last for a period of 12 months +/- 2 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject has severe or moderately severe hemophilia A as defined by a baseline factor VIII level &lt;= 2% of normal, as tested at screening The subject has a documented history of at least 150 exposure days to factor VIII concentrates (either plasmaderived or recombinant) The subject is within 7 to 65 years of age The subject has a Karnofsky performance score &gt; (greater than) 60 The subject is human immunodeficiency virus negative (HIV) or is HIV+ with a CD4 count &gt;= 400 cells/mm³ (CD4 count determined at screening, if necessary) The subject has been on a documented ondemand treatment regimen for at least 12 months immediately prior to enrollment The subject has a documented history (e.g. in medical charts or dispensing information, or signed investigator statement) of at least 8 joint hemorrhages in the 12 months immediately prior to enrollment The subject resides within the coverage area of the mobile compliance device; coverage area will be determined at screening The subject or the subject's legally authorized representative has provided written informed consent The subject has a known hypersensitivity to factor VIII concentrates or mouse or hamster proteins The subject has a history of factor VIII inhibitors with a titer &gt;= 0.6 BU (by Bethesda or Nijmegen assay) at any time prior to screening The subject has a detectable factor VIII inhibitor at screening, with a titer &gt;= 0.4 BU (by Nijmegen Assay) in the central laboratory The subject has severe chronic liver disease as evidenced by, but not limited to, any of the following: International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt; 1.4, hypoalbuminemia, portal vein hypertension including presence of otherwise unexplained splenomegaly and history of esophageal varices. The subject has been diagnosed with an inherited or acquired hemostatic defect other than hemophilia A (e.g., qualitative platelet defect or von Willebrand's Disease) The subject has been treated during the last sixty (60) days prior to or is being treated at screening/enrollment with an immunomodulating drug. The subject has participated in another investigational study within thirty (30) days of enrollment The subject has previously participated in a clinical study with rAHFPFM The subject's clinical condition may require a major surgery (defined as moderate to critical risk and perioperative blood loss ≥ 500 mL) during the period of the subject's participation in the study The subject is female of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test</criteria>
