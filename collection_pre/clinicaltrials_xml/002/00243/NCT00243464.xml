	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether once daily treatment for up to 8 weeks of calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel is more effective than twice daily treatment of calcipotriol scalp solution in patients with scalp psoriasis. The primary outcome is patients with clear or minimal disease after 8 weeks treatment. Further the occurrence of relapse and rebound after end of treatment in patients with clear or minimal disease will be investigated.</brief_summary>
