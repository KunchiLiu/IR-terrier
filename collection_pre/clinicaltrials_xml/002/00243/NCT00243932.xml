	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of High Dose CoQ10 in ALS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative disorder. Available treatment for ALS remains scarce. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated in the pathophysiology of ALS. Oxidative stress refers to the effects of cell-damaging reactive oxygen species, also known as free radicals. Oxidative stress is thought to contribute to nerve cell loss in ALS. Mitochondria are organelles within each cell that are sometimes called "powerhouses of the cell" because cellular energy metabolism is located within the mitochondria. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a mitochondrial cofactor known for its antioxidant properties, has prolonged survival in the mouse model of ALS and has slowed functional decline in another neurodegenerative disorder, Parkinson's disease. The goals of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-dose comparison phase II study are to obtain preliminary efficacy data and to select the preferred dose for a larger phase III study. Participants were randomly assigned to CoQ10 (at two different dose levels) or placebo in the first stage, then the 2,700 mg dose was selected in the second stage. Duration of the trial was 9 months with a total of 7 visits.</detailed_description>
