	<brief_title>MOTIV Study- Effect of Antidepressive Treatment by Escitalopram in Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is known to have an adverse effect on post-operative mortality and morbidity after coronary artery bypass grafting. Cardiac surgery is known to cause transient depression in patients. The purpose of this double-blind, randomized study is to determine the effect of an antidepressive medication (Escitalopram), started preoperatively and given during 6 months, on 6-month and 1 year post-operative morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting. Treatment is given from 21 to 15 days pre-operatively until the 6th post-operative month. Morbidity as defined by the STS database as well as mortality is checked during 1 year.</detailed_description>
