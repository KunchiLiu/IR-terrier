	<brief_title>Benefit of a Collaborative Approach to Improve the Quality of Medicines Use in Elderly Inpatients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Widespread evidence reveals frequent inadequate use of medicines in elderly patients. This includes inappropriate prescribing (overuse, underuse, misuse) that can lead to adverse drug events and drug-related admissions to hospital. In addition, when a patient is transferred from acute care settings to ambulatory care settings, discrepancies in medicines used often occur and can be hazardous. Despite this, only limited data exist on the effectiveness of optimization strategies targeted at frail elderly inpatients. Comparison: elderly inpatients receiving geriatric evaluation and management (GEM) care versus elderly inpatients receiving pharmaceutical care in addition to GEM care.</detailed_description>
