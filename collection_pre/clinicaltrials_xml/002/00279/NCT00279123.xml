	<brief_summary>Endoscopic treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers is effective to prevent rebleeding. Adjuvant medical treatment to increase gastric pH may further decrease rebleeding. Recent studies on potent acid suppression by proton pump inhibitors (PPI) demonstrated the efficacy in preventing rebleeding. Lau demonstrated that high dose intravenous infusion of omeprazole decreased rebleeding in peptic ulcers with stigmata of recent hemorrhage. There is little data regarding the effect of pantoprazole on bleeding peptic ulcers. Furthermore, the optimal dose of PPI is unknown. Few studies have included measurement of gastric pH in addition to clinical outcome. This study compares the effect of two doses of intravenous pantoprazole with no acid suppression in bleeding peptic ulcers after endoscopic therapy. In addition to the usual clinical endpoints, gastric pH is monitored to study the relation of pH elevation and the clinical outcome.</brief_summary>
