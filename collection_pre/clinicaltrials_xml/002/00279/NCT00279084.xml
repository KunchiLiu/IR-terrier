	<brief_summary>In type 2 diabetics, progression from chronic kidney disease to end stage renal disease may be slowed down by therapeutic interventions as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors use, control of high blood pressure and proteinuria, control of hyperglycaemia, protein intake restriction, smoking cessation. Correcting anaemia in these patients may prevent impairment of renal function. International guidelines indicate that haemoglobin level has to be of 110 g/L in these patients. We conduct an interventional randomized trial to evaluate the potential benefit of an haemoglobin level of 130 g/L in patients with type 2 diabetes and with a chronic kidney disease defined by a Cockcroft's creatinine clearance of 25 - 60 ml/min.</brief_summary>
