	<criteria>Males and females, 18 years of age or older. Only 1 prior treatment course with visilizumab (or placebo in a blinded visilizumab study). Response (as defined in parent protocol) of intravenous steroidrefractory ulcerative colitis (IVSRUC) disease to visilizumab or placebo. Symptomatic worsening (ie, an increase of ≥3 points in MTWSI score) from the subject's best response on the parent study, an MTWSI score of ≥9, sustained for at least 2 assessments performed at least 1 week apart, and a confirmatory MTWSI ≥8 within 1 day prior to randomization. CD4^+ Tcell count ≥ 200 cells/mcL at screening for this protocol, or ≥ 80% of the subject's screening baseline count prior to enrollment on the parent study. Mayo assessment (including flexible sigmoidoscopy) performed by a trained, blinded evaluating physician within 2 weeks prior to randomization. Adequate contraception from the day of consent through 3 months after the last dose of study drug. Negative serum pregnancy test. Negative Clostridium difficile test. Signed and dated informed consent, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) if applicable. UC requiring immediate surgical, endoscopic, or radiologic interventions. White blood cell count less than 2.5 x 10^3/mcL; platelet count less than 150 x 10^3/mcL; or hemoglobin less than 8 g/dL. Active, medically significant infections, particularly those of viral etiology, eg, known cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis. This includes any incidence of opportunistic infections within the past 12 months. Live vaccination within 6 weeks prior to randomization. Significant organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal, liver, CNS, pulmonary, vascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or laboratory abnormality, history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias within 6 months prior to consent. History of lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) or malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has been adequately treated within the past five years. Seropositive for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV1), hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen, or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Pregnancy or nursing. Treatment with any other UC salvage drugs (including but not limited to infliximab or another antiTNFa drug, cyclosporine, tacrolimus [FK506], adalimumab, thalidomide, or another experimental agent), or therapies (surgery, pheresis, affinity columns) since the first course of treatment with study drug in the parent visilizumab study. Treatment with any other investigational drug or therapy within 60 days prior to randomization. Nontherapeutic levels of chronic antiseizure medications in subjects with a history of seizures. Any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, makes the subject unsuitable for study participation.</criteria>
