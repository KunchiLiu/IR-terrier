	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether intraoperative computer-assisted navigation improves prosthetic implant positioning as compared to conventional intraoperatve instrumentation in Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary data to be obtained is to determine whether mechanical axis of the limb malignment differs between patients whom have computer-assisted TKA and those treated with conventional intraoperative instrumentation. Three months after surgery follow-up radiographic data will provide evidence on the initial implant position as determined with a series of x-rays including: full length standing, standard AP weight bearing, lateral, patellar, kneelingfilm views and CT evaluation. In addition, a correlation betweeen the CT measures and the kneeling x-ray can be performed at this time. Clinical (Knee Scale Society, WOMAC, and SF-36) data will also be obtained at the three month interval.</detailed_description>
