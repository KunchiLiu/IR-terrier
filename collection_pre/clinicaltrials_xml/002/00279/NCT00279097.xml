	<brief_title>Safety Study to Evaluate Intracranial Pressure During High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a single site safety study to evaluate changes in intracranial pressure during or immediately following HFCWO treatment with the Vest™ in neurosurgical subjects with intracranial pressure monitors having normal opening pressures and ICP less than or equal to 20 mmHg. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate changes in arterial blood gases that may result with Vest™ therapy in ventilated patients.</detailed_description>
