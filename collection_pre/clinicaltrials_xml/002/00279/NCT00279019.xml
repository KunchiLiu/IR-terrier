	<brief_summary>GSK233705 is a high-affinity specific muscarinic receptor (mAChR) antagonist which is being developed for once daily treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The long duration of action of GSK233705 when administered via inhalation in animal models supports the potential for use as a once-daily bronchodilator for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
