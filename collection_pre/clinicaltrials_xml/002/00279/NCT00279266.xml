	<brief_title>Oral Thiamine for the Treatment of Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is estimated that more then 5 million people in the United States suffer from Diabetes Mellitus, and of these up to 80% suffer from painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Multiple medications have been tried for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy. These medications are directed at symptomatic relief and do not address the underlying cause of painful peripheral neuropathy. Thiamine is a water-soluble vitamin that participates in carbohydrate metabolism. Deficiency of thiamine causes beriberi, characterized by painful peripheral neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. Basic research has suggested that thiamine deficiency may also be involved in the etiology of diabetic neuropathy by preventing the glycation of nerve fibers as well as apoptosis of endothelial cells. A study in the developing world found that oral thiamine and pyridoxine were helpful in improving the pain experienced in diabetic peripheral neuropathy as well as improving signs of neuropathy seen on neurological examination. A screening study of patients with type II diabetes found that 76% of patients tested had a low serum thiamine level. Our study will examine the effect of oral thiamine supplementation on the symptom of pain in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In addition we will follow serum thiamine levels to see if clinical change correlates with changes in serum thiamine levels</detailed_description>
