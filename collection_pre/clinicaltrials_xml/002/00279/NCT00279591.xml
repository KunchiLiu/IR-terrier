	<brief_title>Near-Continuous, Noninvasive Blood Pressure Monitoring to Improve Outcomes in Pediatric Transport</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>94 transported patients were randomized to a control arm, monitored with a standard oscillometric blood pressure device (Dinamap), or an experimental arm, monitored with a near-continuous, noninvasive blood pressure device (Vasotrac).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Pediatric patients transported by Angel One to Arkansas Children's Hospital. 2. Age Group: 1 year 17 years AND 3. Patients at risk of developing SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), according to the criteria below. i. The presence of at least two of the following four criteria (one of which must be abnormal temperature or leukocyte count): A. Core temperature of &gt;38.5 C or &lt;36 C. B. Tachycardia, defined as mean heart rate &gt;95th percentile for age in absence of external stimulus, chronic drugs, or painful stimuli. C. Mean respiratory rate &gt;95th percentile for age, or &gt;10% immature neutrophils. OR 4. Patients with moderate or severe head trauma, at risk of developing secondary ischemic brain injury, according to the criteria below. i. Glasgow Coma scale &lt;15 with one or more of the following: A. Mass lesion or cerebral edema on CT or MRI scan. B. PostTraumatic Seizure. C. Multiple Trauma. D. Focal Neurologic Signs. E. Intubation for control of suspected intracranial hypertension. 1. Wrist circumference less than 11cm (minimum size for the Vasotrac device). 2. Contractures of the wrists, not allowing correct placement of the Vasotrac device. 3. Hematoma(s) located on both wrists from recent redial (&lt;24hr) artery puncture. 4. Patients likely to proceed to brain death per assessment of the referring physician. 5. Patients being treated for malignant hypertension.</criteria>
