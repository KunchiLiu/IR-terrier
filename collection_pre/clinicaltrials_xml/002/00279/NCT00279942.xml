	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia syndrome is a chronic, generalized pain syndrome that affects the musculoskeletal system (1). This syndrome is typically diagnosed in patients who experience generalized musculoskeletal pain and have excessive tenderness in at least 11 of 18 specific points (2). Although the primary cause of fibromyalgia syndrome is unclear, a growing body of evidence indicates that the widespread pain associated with this syndrome is due to abnormalities in the central nervous system. Therefore, drug therapy for fibromyalgia syndrome is most often aimed at the central nervous system and includes tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, analgesics, and anticonvulsants (1). In addition to medical therapies, complementary and alternative medicine therapies have been used to treat fibromyalgia syndrome symptoms (3). Soy is a widely used dietary supplement that has not been previously tested for treating fibromyalgia syndrome.</detailed_description>
