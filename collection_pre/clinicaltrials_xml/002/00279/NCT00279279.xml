	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test specific device programming in patients without a previous history of a life-threatening, abnormally fast heartbeat who are implanted with a Medtronic ICD (Implantable Cardioconverter Defibrillator) or ICD with CRT (Cardiac Resynchronozation Therapy) device. The information learned from this study could be used to guide physicians in future ICD or CRT device programming.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient is a candidate for a nonreplacement Medtronic ICD device from the Marquis family or has had a nonreplacement Medtronic Marquis based ICD system implanted within the previous 6 months and has not had any appropriately treated spontaneous VT/VF episodes during that time. Patient has history of spontaneous sustained symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. If patient has had an electrophysiology test in the past, and has sustained inducible VT &lt;180 bpm.</criteria>
