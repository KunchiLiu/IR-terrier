	<brief_summary>In the present study we are examining the clot formation and clot stability in patients with severe haemophilia A after they receive recombinat factor VIII and after addition of tranexamic acid. Our hypothesis is that addition of tranexamic increases the clot stability. The perpective of the study is to document whether it is relevant to use traneksamic acid in surgery in patients with severe haemophilia A.</brief_summary>
