	<brief_summary>We sight to evaluate whether patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have more epicardial fat than patients without CAD, which would suggest that epicardial fat may be more than an “innocent bystander” and be actively involved in the disease process. Its role as a modulator of vascular response and myocardial function could potentially lead to new areas of cardiac research. We also sight to evaluate whether epicardial fat from patients with CAD releases more adipokines than subcutaneous fat from these patients which could prompt studies into the differential regulation of adipokine secretion in this tissue. Thus for e.g., the use of thiazolidinediones (glitazones), statins, ARBs or other compounds that can specifically modulate adipokine secretion could be explored to determine their benefit in ameliorating the effects attributable to increased epicardial fat.</brief_summary>
