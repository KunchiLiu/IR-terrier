	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IPX054, carbidopa-levodopa immediate-release tablets, and carbidopa-levodopa controlled-release tablets in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of IPX054, IR Carbidopa-Levodopa, and CR Carbidopa-Levodopa in Subjects With Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IPX054 contains two different drugs called levodopa and carbidopa in one tablet. - levodopa turns into a material called 'dopamine' in your brain. The dopamine helps to improve the symptoms of your Parkinson's disease. - carbidopa belongs to a group of medicines called 'aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitors'. It helps levodopa work more effectively by slowing the speed at which levodopa is broken down in your body.</detailed_description>
