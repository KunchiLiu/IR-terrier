	<brief_summary>Controversies still exists concerning the overall clinical effects of blood-based vs. crystalloid- based cardioplegic solution for myocardial protection during cardiac arrest. Both techniques are used world-wide. No larger prospectively randomized studies comparing the two methods have been reported. The aim of this study is to collect a large number of clinical data to create a proper basis for evaluation of the two techniques.</brief_summary>
