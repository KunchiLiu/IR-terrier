	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Octreotide may stop or slow the growth of tumor cells and may be an effective treatment for liver cancer. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well octreotide works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic liver cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Octreotide in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To verify that long-acting somatostatin analog octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) depot will extend median survival from 5 months to 8.75 months in patients with locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma with a CLIP score of 3 or more. Secondary - To document tolerability of this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to underlying degree of liver disease as defined by CLIP score classification. Patients receive short-acting octreotide subcutaneously three times daily on days 1-21 OR days 1-28. If the patient tolerates short-acting octreotide, the first dose of long-acting octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) depot will be given intramuscularly beginning on day 8 OR day 15. Treatment with long-acting octreotide repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 6 months.</detailed_description>
