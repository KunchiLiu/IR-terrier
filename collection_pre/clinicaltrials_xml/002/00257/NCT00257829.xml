	<brief_summary>The Phenomenon of Tumor Hypoxia Many solid tumors are relatively resistant to treatment with ionizing radiation and certain chemotherapeutic agents such as anthracyclines that are affected adversely by acidic pH. These effects have primarily been attributed to the presence of hypoxic cells within the tumor. The relevance of hypoxia with respect to failure of radiotherapy to cure certain malignancies has had a chequered history. However, in recent years the evidence that hypoxia plays a central role in relative radioresistance has become more compelling. Since approximately two-thirds of all women suffering from cervical carcinoma receive radiation as a component of their therapy, an enhanced understanding of the interactions between hypoxia and radiation as a component of their therapy, an enhanced understanding of the interactions between hypoxia and radiation resistance is critical to improving outcome among those with cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
