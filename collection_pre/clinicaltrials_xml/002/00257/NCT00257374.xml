	<brief_summary>Background: Pedialyte and Gatorade are advocated for the treatment of dehydration in viral gastroenteritis, but there is limited evidence to support their use. Objective: To examine the efficacy, safety and palatability of Pedialyte, Gatorade, and a New Oral Rehydration Solution (NS). Design: Randomized double blind. Setting: Inpatient, community hospital. Patients/Interventions: 75 consecutive adult patients (m/f=44/33) admitted with viral gastroenteritis were randomized to receive Gatorade, Pedialyte or NS for 48 hours. A yogurt/rice diet was allowed ad libitum. Measurements: Stool and urine output, electrolytes, fluid intake, body weight, hematocrit and palatability of solutions. Limitations: Smaller sample size and higher drop out (20%).</brief_summary>
