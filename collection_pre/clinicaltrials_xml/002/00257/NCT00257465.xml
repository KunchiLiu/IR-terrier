	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a vaccine composed of patients' own melanoma cells treated with the chemical, dinitrophenyl (DNP)(called a hapten), is safe and stimulates an immune response to patients' own cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Autologous, Hapten-Modified Vaccine in Patients With Stage III or IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with stage III or IV melanoma need to have at least one tumor mass of at least 2.5 cm (about 1 inch) diameter than can be removed for vaccine production. If the vaccine is successfully made and if the patient is eligible, the patient will be assigned to receive one of 4 doses of the vaccine, include one group that will receive a zero dose. All patients will receive injections of their vaccine as part of immune system testing and will receive low dose cyclophosphamide and BCG. Eight injections of the vaccine will be administered as an injection into the skin of the arm over a 6 month period. Before and after vaccine administration, patients will be tested for immunity to their own melanoma cells by DTH testing, which is similar to a tuberculosis test. All side effects caused by the vaccine will be recorded.</detailed_description>
