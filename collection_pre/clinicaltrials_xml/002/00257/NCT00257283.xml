	<detailed_description>Patients with renal failure have a high incidence of cardiovascular disease and increased premature mortality. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from fish are known to have cardioprotective effects in subects with normal renal function. The aim of present study is to examine the effect of OMACOR (Omega-3-acid ethyl ester 90) on the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, who has previously experienced a cardiovascular event.
