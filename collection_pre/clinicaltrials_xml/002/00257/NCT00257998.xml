	<brief_summary>Recently a clinical prediction rule (CPR) has been developed and validated that accurately identifies patients with low back pain that are likely to benefit from a lumbo-pelvic manipulation. The studies that developed and validated the rule used the identical manipulation procedure. However, recent evidence suggests that different manual therapy techniques may result in the same outcome.Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of three different manual therapy techniques in a subgroup of patient with low back pain that satisfy the CPR.</brief_summary>
