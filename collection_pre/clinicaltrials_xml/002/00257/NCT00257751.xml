	<brief_summary>Clopidogrel (Plavix), a platelet ADP receptor antagonist, has become the standard of care to prevent thrombosis in interventional cardiology and is increasingly being used in unstable angina and NSTEMI. An increasing number of patients are referred to emergent or urgent CABG, and several studies, as well as our own experience, have shown that preoperative administration of irreversible platelets inhibitors increase the risk of bleeding complications following CABG.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Different Regimen of Aprotinine(Trasylol) Administration in Patients Receiving Antiplatelet Therapy With Clopidogrel (Plavix)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aprotinine (Trasylol) is a potent antifibrinolytic agent known to reduce bleeding after cardiac surgery. The most commeon practice is to give Trasylol in high doses immediately before surgery, during the operation, and during the first postoperative hours. However, it has also been shown that there is a hemostatic effect of the drug when given in a lower dose postoperatively, but this remains unclear.</detailed_description>
