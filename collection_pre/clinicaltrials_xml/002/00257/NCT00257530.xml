	<brief_summary>This study will test whether addition of imiquimod to standard antimony therapy provides a significant benefit in subjects with newly diagnosed cutaneous leishmaniasis. Based on our previous results, we hypothesize that lesions in patients who receive the combined treatment of pentavalent antimony and imiquimod as a first line therapy will resolve more rapidly and produce less scarring than treatment with pentavalent antimony alone.</brief_summary>
