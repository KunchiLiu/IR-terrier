Pregnancy or lactation. Absence of medically approved contraceptive methods for females of childbearing potential. Marijuana or hashish users. Administration of other investigational drugs within 30 days prior to screening visit. Previous participation in a rimonabant study. Presence or history of allergic reaction or intolerance to multiple drugs. Presence of any other condition (e.g., geographic, social) that the Investigator feels that would restrict or limit the patient's participation for the duration of the study. Related to endocrine and metabolic disorders: Presence of any clinically significant endocrine disease according to the Investigator. Note: euthyroid patients on replacement therapy will be included if the dosage of thyroxine is stable for at least 3 months prior to screening visit. Fasting Cpeptide &lt; 1.0 ng/mL. Related to other disorders: Presence of any severe medical or psychological condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would compromise the patient's safety or successful participation in the study. Presence or history of cancer within the past five years with the exception of adequately treated localized basal cell skin cancer or in situ uterine cervical cancer. Related to laboratory findings: Positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen and/or hepatitis C antibody. Abnormal TSH level (TSH &gt; ULN or &lt; LLN). Hemoglobin &lt; 11 g/dL and/or neutrophils &lt; 1,500/mm3 and/or platelets &lt; 100,000/mm3. Positive urine pregnancy test. Positive urine test for marijuana or hashish metabolites. Related to previous or concomitant medications: Oral antidiabetic agent except if it is not within 6 months prior to screening visit and only if it was prescribed for no more than 4 months. Insulin except if it is not within 6 months prior to screening visit and only for management of gestational diabetes or shortterm use to maintain glycemic control for hospitalization, medical procedures, or intervention.
