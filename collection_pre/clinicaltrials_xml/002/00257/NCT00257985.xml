	<brief_title>Glyceryl-Trinitrate-Induced Headache in Patients With Familial Hemiplegic Migraine Type 1 and 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) induces migraine attacks indistinguishable from spontaneous attacks in approximately 80% of migraine sufferers. After systemic administration GTN is transformed to nitric oxide (NO). Treatment of spontaneous migraine attacks with an inhibitor of NO is effective in 60% of patients. These data show that NO is involved in both initiation and maintenance of migraine attack. The consequence of migraine gene mutations on relevant migraine pathways has never been tested. The aim of the present study is to explore functional consequences of migraine gene mutations on their responses to GTN infusion. The project will improve our understanding of the neurobiology of migraine and stimulate development of new treatment targets.</detailed_description>
