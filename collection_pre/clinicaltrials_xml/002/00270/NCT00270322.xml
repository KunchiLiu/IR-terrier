	<brief_title>Pain Treatment After Total Knee Replacement - Continuous Epidural Versus Intravenous Patient Controlled Analgesia With Morphine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee replacement (TKR) is known to be one of the most painful surgical procedures. Many treatments have been used post TKR: IV opioids, epidural infusions, peripheral nerve blocks. No one method has been recognised as the best one. In this study we will compare two well established methods of pain treatment: 1. continuous infusion of local anesthetics + opioids into the epidural space, 2. patient controlled analgesia with IV Morphine. The study design is double blind. Patients will have a combined spinal-epidural anesthesia for the operation and then will be connected to 2 different pumps, one to the epidural catheter and one to the intravenous catheter, for the first 24 hours post-operatively. Pain scores, total analgesic medications other than study medications, adverse reactions to study medications, complications and patient satisfaction will be followed by blinded observers and compared between groups.</detailed_description>
