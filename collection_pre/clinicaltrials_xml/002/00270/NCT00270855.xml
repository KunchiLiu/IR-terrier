	<brief_summary>The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate and compare the health benefits of using upper extremity exercise versus functional electrical stimulation for lower extremity exercise. It is our hypothesis that both Functional Electrical Stimulation Leg Cycle Ergometry (FES LCE) exercise and voluntary Arm Crank Ergometry (ACE) upper extremity exercise will increase whole body energy expenditure, thereby increasing muscle mass, insulin sensitivity, glucose effectiveness and improving lipid profiles in adults with paraplegia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: Spinal cord injuries (SCI) predispose individuals to impaired fitness, obesity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, placing them at greater risk for diabetes, coronary artery disease, and upper extremity overuse syndrome as body weight increases. The specific objectives for the current proposal are to compare the impact of FES (functional electrical stimulation) lower extremity exercise versus upper extremity arm crank ergometry on energy metabolism, body composition and fat deposition, insulin sensitivity, glucose effectiveness, lower extremity bone mineral density and lipid profiles, in adults with complete paraplegia. Research Plan: A randomized, baseline-controlled, prospective, 16-week interventional trial will be employed to assess the impact of FES LCE versus volitional arm crank ergometry exercise on energy metabolism, body composition and fat deposition, insulin sensitivity, glucose effectiveness, lower extremity bone mineral density and lipid profiles in adults with complete paraplegia. Methods: Twenty-four 18-65 y.o. individuals with motor complete T4-L2 SCI will be assigned to either FES lower extremity exercise or upper extremity arm crank ergometry to compare impact on energy expenditure, obesity, and insulin sensitivity. Both groups will be provided similar nutritional assessments and intervention. Exercise training will consist of five, 40-minute sessions at 70% maximal heart rate (HRmax) each week for a total of 16 weeks. Resting metabolic rate, exercise energy expenditure, body composition by 4-compartment modeling, visceral adiposity, insulin sensitivity, glucose effectiveness, lipid profiles, and lower extremity bone mineral density (BMD) will be determined before and after 16-week exercise interventions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Criteria for participation will include men and women within the age range of 1865 years old with BMI&gt;25 kg/m2 who have had T4L2 MotorComplete (ASIA A&amp;B) SCI for duration of greater than 12 months to ensure a homogenous sample. Persons who are unresponsive to surface neurostimulation, have participated in an FES or ACE exercise (&gt; 60 minutes/week) program within the past 3 months, and those with known orthopedic limitations, CAD, diabetes mellitus (fasting glucose&gt;126 or HgbA1c&gt;7.0) or known family history, hypothyroidism, and/or renal disease will be excluded from the study. Additionally, individuals with uncontrolled autonomic dysreflexia, recent (within 3 months) deep vein thrombosis, or pressure ulcers &gt; Grade II will be excluded.</criteria>
