	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to determine if CIC 50 mg/day or 200 mg/day (ex-valve) administered once daily in the morning is non-inferior to placebo with respect to growth velocity in children with mild persistent asthma following a 12-month treatment period The secondary objective is to investigate changes in growth in terms of bone age (wrist X-ray), and maintenance of asthma control and safety with ciclesonide</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Females between 5 and 7.5 years and male between 5 and 8.5 years of age with normal heights, a history of mild persistent asthma for at least 3 months prior to visit 1, a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of ³80% of predicted following at least a 4hour albuterol withhold, and treated with noncorticosteroid asthma medications on an asneeded or daily basis, or with low doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) for at least one month prior to Visit 1. Subjects were to be no greater than Stage 1 in the Tanner classification of sexual maturity, and they had to be able to demonstrate effective use of the MDI devices and perform reproducible pulmonary function test. Subjects with a history of lifethreatening asthma, severe respiratory impairment, history of abnormal growth, concurrent disease or condition which may substantially affect growth, previous requirement for daily or alternate day oral corticosteroids (OCS) treatment for ³60 days within the 2 years of Visit 3 and/or any use of OCS within 30 days prior to Visit 1 or during the runin period, previous treatment with moderate or high doses of inhaled corticosteroid during the 30 days prior to Visit 1</criteria>
