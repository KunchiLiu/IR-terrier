	<brief_title>Study of ISA247 (Voclosporin) in De Novo Renal Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prograf® (tacrolimus) is associated with numerous side effects, including neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, polyoma nephropathy, QT prolongation, and New Onset Diabetes Mellitus After Transplant (NODAT). Voclosporin is a novel calcineurin inhibitor intended for use in the prevention of organ graft rejection. Comparison(s): Voclosporin at 3 dose levels (0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/kg twice a day) compared to tacrolimus</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females aged 18 65 years inclusive at the time of screening. Patients must be receiving a first cadaveric or living donor renal transplant. Patients must be able to receive oral medication at time of randomization. Females who are not pregnant or nursing or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study, or 3 months after last dose of study medication. Sexuallyactive women of childbearing potential (including those who are &lt; 1 year postmenopausal) and sexuallyactive men who are practicing a highly effective method of birth control. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly and will include implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, doublebarrier method, sexual abstinence, or a sterile partner. Sexuallyactive men and women of childbearing potential should continue to practice contraception as outlined above during treatment and for ≥ 3 months after the last dose of voclosporin. Able to give written informed consent prior to screening procedures. Able to keep study appointments and cooperate with all study requirements, in the opinion of the investigator. Receiving a HLA (human leukocyte antigen)identical living related transplant. Cold ischemic time &gt; 24 hours. Peak PRA (panel reactive antibodies) &gt; 30% Cadaveric donors who are over age 60, nonheart beating donors, or any cadaveric donors positive for HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Transplantation of multiple grafts (e.g. kidney and pancreas). Systemic infections requiring continued therapy at the time of entry into this study. (Prophylaxis against cytomegalovirus [CMV] and/or pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) infection will be permitted). Serologic evidence or known latent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) virus. Known negative serology prior to study entry may be used. A current malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years or a history of lymphoma at any time. Subjects can be enrolled with a history of squamous or basal cell carcinoma that has been surgically excised or removed with curettage and electrodesiccation. Requires prohibited medications or treatment during the study. Alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), or gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT) ≥ 3x upper limit of normal (ULN) at time of transplantation. White blood cell count ≤ 2.8 x 10^9/L. Triglycerides ≥ 3x ULN. Pregnant women or nursing mothers. Has used any investigational drug or device within 28 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to enrollment. Previous exposure to voclosporin. A history of active alcoholism or drug addiction within 1 year prior to study entry. Weighs &lt; 45 kg (99 lbs) or &gt; 140 kg (308 lbs). A history of disease, including mental/emotional disorder that would interfere with the subject's participation in the study, or that might cause the administration of voclosporin to pose a significant risk to the subject, in the opinion of the investigator. Allergy to iodine.</criteria>
