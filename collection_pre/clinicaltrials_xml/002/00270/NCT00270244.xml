	<brief_title>Group Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents in School-based Clinics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is a serious medical condition. It occurs in people of all ages, but only in the past two decades has depression in children and adolescents been taken seriously. Children and adolescents with depression may exhibit such behaviors as pretending to be sick, refusing to go to school or getting in trouble at school, clinging to a parent or worrying that the parent may die, sulking, or acting in a negative or grouchy manner. A previous study demonstrated that, when administered by clinicians in school-based clinics, individual interpersonal psychotherapy is effective in reducing depressive symptoms and improving global and social functioning. This study will assess the effectiveness of group interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-AG) versus treatment as usual (TAU) in improving depressive symptoms of adolescents in school-based health clinics. Participants in this 16-week single-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either IPT-AG or TAU in a school-based clinic. Participants assigned to receive IPT-AG will attend two to three, 40-minute individual pre-group sessions, followed by 12, 90-minute group therapy sessions and two additional individual sessionsâ€”one midway through the group sessions and another upon completion of group therapy. TAU will consist of counseling sessions as regularly conducted by the school clinic social worker and/or referral to another agency. Study visits will occur at baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16, or upon early termination. At the end of 16 weeks, participants assigned to receive IPT-AG will continue in a maintenance program in which they will receive IPT-AG once a month for an additional 6 months. All participants will also be assessed 6 and 12 months post-treatment to measure depressive symptoms, global and social functioning, satisfaction with care, and utilization of other services.</detailed_description>
