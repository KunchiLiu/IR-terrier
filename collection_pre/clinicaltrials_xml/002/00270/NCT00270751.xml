	<brief_summary>Optimal surgical management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax has been a matter of devate, especially regarding the method of pleurodesis. Previous studies have shown that thoracoscopic apical pleurectomy is a reliable method with a very low incidence of recurrence. However, this procedure is more technical demanding and time consuming through thoracoscopy. In addition, a more extensive pleural injury may cause impaired pulmonary function and a higher risk of perioperative complication such as hemothorax. In our previous studies, we have shown that thoracoscopic pleural abrasion with minocycline instillation is an easy and convinent method of pleurodesis which decreases the rate of recurrence without affecting pulmonary function. In this study, we hypothesized that pleural abrasion with minocycline instillation is as effective as apical pleurectomy in preventing pneumothorax recurrence while the short-term and long-term complications are less.</brief_summary>
