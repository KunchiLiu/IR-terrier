	<detailed_description>This is an investigator-initiated, Phase II, non-randomized, single-arm, prospective treatment study. The study will consist of neoadjuvant treatment period (weeks 1 to 20), surgical evaluation period (weeks 20 to 24), and a post-surgical/follow-up period (approximately 3 years). Subjects will be treated on an outpatient basis. Neoadjuvant therapy will consist of epirubicin + cyclophosphamide given every 2 weeks for four cycles followed by a three week break. Subjects will then receive docetaxel every two weeks for four cycles + trastuzumab (one loading dose) then maintenance dose every 2 weeks for 4 treatments.</detailed_description>
