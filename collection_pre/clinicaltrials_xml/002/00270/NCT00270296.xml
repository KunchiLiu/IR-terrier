	<brief_summary>Anti-HIV drug regimens have dramatically improved the rates of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV in developed countries. However, little is known of the effectiveness of such regimens in developing countries, such as Botswana. This study will determine whether Trizivir (TZV), a single pill containing abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine (ABC/3TC/ZDV), or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and lamivudine/zidovudine (3TC/ZDV) is more effective in reducing HIV-1 viral load and preventing MTCT among HIV infected pregnant women in Botswana.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While perinatal HIV infection has become rare in developed countries through the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), it remains a serious problem in developing countries. Botswana has a population of approximately 1.7 million; the prevalence of HIV in Botswana is about 37.4%. In the developed world, HAART has revolutionized the prevention of MTCT among nonbreastfed infants. This trial will compare the effectiveness of a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen versus a triple nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-based regimen in preventing MTCT of HIV. This study will last up to 24 months for mothers and their children. Participants will be stratified based on their CD4 count at screening. Women with CD4 counts of 200 cells/mm3 or more will be in one of two treatment groups and will be randomly assigned to receive either TZV twice daily or LPV/RTV and 3TC/ZDV twice daily. Once in labor, treatment group participants will continue to take their assigned HAART regimen and will also be given additional ZDV. Women with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm3 will receive nevirapine (NVP) once daily for the first 14 days, then twice daily, and 3TC/ZDV twice daily; these women will be in the observational group. Shortly after birth, infants will receive single-dose NVP. A 1-month supply of ZDV will be provided to the mother to administer daily to her child. Mothers will stop HAART at 6 months postpartum or when they stop breastfeeding, whichever occurs earlier. A clinical evaluation, blood collection, and HIV prevention counseling will occur at all maternal visits. An obstetrical exam and physical exam will occur at selected visits. Women will provide at least four samples of breast milk during the first 5 months postpartum. For infants, a clinical evaluation will occur at every visit, and a physical exam and blood collection will occur at selected visits.</detailed_description>
