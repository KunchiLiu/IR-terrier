	<brief_title>Study on Prolonging Bone Metastasis-Free Survival in Men With Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants were randomized to receive denosumab 120 mg or placebo every 4 weeks (Q4W) until approximately 660 participants developed bone metastasis or died and the primary efficacy and safety analyses were completed. All participants undergoing scheduled assessments were offered open-label denosumab 120 mg subcutaneous (SC) until they either developed a bone metastasis, obtained access to commercially available product in this setting, or for up to 3 years, whichever came first. For participants who ended participation before the open-label extension (OLE) phase or withdrew from investigational product during the OLE phase, their survival data was to be collected every 6 months for up to 3 years after their last dose of investigational product. Participants in the Czech Republic and United Kingdom were enrolled under a separate protocol for the OLE phase per Health Authority request, and are reported separately (Study 20080585; NCT01824342).</detailed_description>
