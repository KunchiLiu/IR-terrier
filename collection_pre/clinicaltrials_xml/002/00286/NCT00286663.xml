	<brief_title>Autoimmune Hepatitis Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The object of this protocol is to characterize and monitor auto antigen-specific T cell responses in blood and liver biopsies of patients with anti-SLA/LP or anti-LKM-positive autoimmune hepatitis. The results will provide insight into the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis and the monitoring of auto antigen-specific T cell reactivity in correlation to disease exacerbation and therapy.</detailed_description>
