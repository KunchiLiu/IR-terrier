	<brief_summary>This study shall evaluate in daily medical practice the clinical results of the AV delay hysteresis search algorithm in patients with a INSIGNIA ULTRA or AVT pacemaker implanted for one of the three following indications: sinus node dysfunction, atrial disease (or bradycardia/tachycardia) and atrio-ventricular paroxysmal block. In addition use and outcome of automatic functions will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
