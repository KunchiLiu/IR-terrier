	<brief_title>Myocardial Infarction Size Reduction With Atorvastatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Left ventricular remodelling after a myocardial infarction refers to changes in shape and function of the infarcted and uninfarcted myocardium. Remodelling begins minutes after acute myocardial infarction and may continue for months or years, leading to dilation of the left ventricle (LV) and an increased LV volume. As studies show, LV volume strongly correlates with long-term mortality. Reperfusion after a period of ischaemia (through medication or PTCA) leads to so-called 'reperfusion injury'. This results in myocardial dysfunction and damage, which can lead to LV remodelling. In a study where atorvastatin was administered at the onset of reperfusion infarct size was reduced. Atorvastatin led to protection of the reperfused myocardium, independently of its effects on cholesterol. The objective is to measure the effect of atorvastatin, administered orally before reperfusion therapy by PTCA, on infarct size and microvascular reperfusion.</detailed_description>
