	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if treating anemia with subcutaneous erythropoetin in patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) will be associated with reverse ventricular remodeling, significant improvements in exercise capacity, and improved health status, as compared with placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anemia in Heart Failure With a Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFPEF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure frequently occurs in patients with a preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) and affected subjects are predominantly elderly women with several co-morbid conditions. Despite the diversity of underlying clinical pathologies and co-morbid conditions present in these patients, a common pathophysiologic explanation is generally applied to explain their clinical symptoms. Our preliminary data show that a significant subgroup with HFPEF has increases in ventricular volumes and expanded plasma volumes, consistent with a volume overloaded state. In the setting of a preserved EF with end diastolic volume increased, stroke volume must increase, indicating a high output state. Anemia may be an important, modifiable contributor to the observed high output and volume overload as well as exercise intolerance in elderly HFPEF patients, abnormal ventricular remodeling and impaired overall health status and quality of life. This protocol evaluates the impact of treating anemia in subjects with HFPEF. The specific aims of the current study are to provide a comprehensive and mechanistically based assessment of how correcting anemia in subjects with HFPEF can impact on functional capacity, ventricular structure and function and overall health status. We propose to perform a randomized, prospective, double blind study in 80 subjects with HFPEF to test the hypothesis that the administration of subcutaneous erythropoietin will be associated with reverse ventricular remodeling, significant improvements in exercise capacity and improved health status.</detailed_description>
