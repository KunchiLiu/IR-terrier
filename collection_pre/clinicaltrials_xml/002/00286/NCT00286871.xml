	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial in Liver Transplant Recipients Treated in Steroid Sparing Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrent HCV in the liver allograft is becoming the leading indicator for retransplantation. Studies suggest that glucocorticord-based immunosuppression regimens hasten the onset and progression of recurrent chronic HCV liver disease. Treatment of acute allograft rejection with steroid boluses is also associated with rapid HCV recurrence. The relative contribution of various calcineurin inhibitors to recurrent HCV liver disease has not been established. Previous retrospective studies, as well as prospective studies have not demonstrated a difference in recurrent HCV liver disease rates between patients receiving CsA or tacrolimus immunosuppression regimens respectively.</detailed_description>
