	<brief_title>Effect of Omalizumab (Xolair) in Treatment of Patients With AERD and Allergy Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 patients with Aspirin Exacerbated respiratory Disease will be screened to determine if they also have allergic respiratory tract disease as a co-morbid complication. This will involve history, allergy skin tests and a serum IgE level. They must also have been desensitized to aspirin and be taking aspirin 325 or 650 mg morning and night. 40/60 patients will receive omalizumab injections every month for the next 4 months and the other 20 patients, via a random program, will receive placebo injections. Monthly visits with the nurse co-ordinator will involve the following assessments: daily symptom scores, daily use of medications (particularly prednisone and rescue albuterol inhalers), lung function tests, nasal breathing test, measurement of smell and quality of life scores pre and post study.</detailed_description>
