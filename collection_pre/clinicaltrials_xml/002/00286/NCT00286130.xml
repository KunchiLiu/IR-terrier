	<brief_summary>In Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer the following treatments first-line Folfiri+Cetuximab first-line Folfox6 + Cetuximab will be concerning efficacy and safety. The trial compares Folfiri + Cetuximab and Folfox6 + Cetuximab concerning efficacy and safety as first</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Folfox6 + Cetuximab Versus Folfiri +Cetuximab in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The multicenter randomized phase II study will enroll a target of approximately 150 first-line patients with metastatic CRC. EGFR expression is not required for study entry, however, the EGFR status will be measured retrospectively. Patients are randomized to Arm A or Arm B. Arm A: FOLFOX 6 in combination with cetuximab Arm B: FOLFIRI in combination with cetuximab. Both efficacy and safety data will be collected. The investigators will assess response to treatment at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and thereafter every 12 weeks based on imaging Following permanent treatment cessation (stop of all study treatments) patients will be followed-up for.</detailed_description>
