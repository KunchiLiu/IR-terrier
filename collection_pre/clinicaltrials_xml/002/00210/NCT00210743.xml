	<brief_title>Alternate Dosing - Initiation of Every 2 Week Epoetin Alfa (PROCRIT) in the Treatment of Anemia.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective study in non-dialysis subjects with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. Subjects will be enrolled from multiple centers in the United States. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate hemoglobin response rate. The secondary objectives include evaluating the time to when hemoglobin responds, indicated by the results of the hemoglobin blood levels, the change in hemoglobin over time, the transfusion requirements and change in quality of life measurements. These measurements asks for the subjects views about how one feels, activity and energy level, etc. The subjects are administered study drug every 2 weeks through Study Week 27 unless dosing is held or the subject withdraws from the study. Each injection of study drug should not exceed 1 ml in volume.</detailed_description>
