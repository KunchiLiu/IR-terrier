	<criteria>1. histologically proven diagnosis of marginal zone Bcell lymphoma of MALT type arisen at any extranodal site 2. any stage (Ann Arbor IIV) 3. relapsed or refractory disease pretreated with &gt; 1 prior chemotherapy regimen and/or antiCD20 immunotherapy 4. no evidence of histologic transformation to a high grade lymphoma 5. measurable or evaluable disease 6. age &gt; 18 years 7. full recovery from previous therapy, with life expectancy of at least 6 months 8. ECOG performance status 02 9. for primary gastric localized H. pyloripositive disease at diagnosis: 1. persistent disease 1 year after documented H. pylori infection eradication 2. clinical, endoscopic (or histologic) evidence of progression at any time after H. pylori infection eradication 10. no prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy in the last 6 weeks 11. no corticosteroids during the last 4 weeks, unless prednisone chronically administered at a dose &lt;20 mg/day for indications other than lymphoma or lymphomarelated symptoms 12. adequate renal function (calculated or measured creatinine clearance &gt;30 mL/minute), liver function (ASAT/ALAT &lt;2,5 upper normal, total bilirubin &lt;2,5x upper normal) and bone marrow function 13. no evidence of active opportunistic infections 14. no known HIV infection 15. no active HBV and/or HCV infection 16. no serious medical illness likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study 17. voluntary written informed consent before performance of any studyrelated procedure 18. female subject is either postmenopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an acceptable method of birth control (ie, a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study. Male subject agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception for the duration of the study 1. prior diagnosis of neoplasm within 5 years, except cervical intraepithelial neoplasia type 1. (CIN1) or localized nonmelanomatous skin cancer 2. other investigational drugs with 14 days before enrollment 3. evidence of symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) disease 4. severe impairment of bone marrow function (ANC &lt;1.0x109/L, PLT &lt;30x109/L within 14 days before enrollment), unless due to lymphoma involvement 5. evidence of â‰¥ grade 2 peripheral neuropathy within 14 days before enrollment 6. known hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron or mannitol 7. pregnant or lactating status, confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (betahCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not required for postmenopausal or surgically sterilized women 8. any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial</criteria>
