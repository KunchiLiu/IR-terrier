	<brief_summary>Assess the therapeutic activity and safety of the combination of Chlorambucil and Rituximab in MALT lymphomas and determine whether the addition of Rituximab to Chlorambucil will improve the outcome of MALT lymphoma in comparison to treatment with Chlorambucil alone. In April 2006, a third arm of treatment was added to compare the antitumor activity and safety of rituximab alone vs chlorambucil alone</brief_summary>
