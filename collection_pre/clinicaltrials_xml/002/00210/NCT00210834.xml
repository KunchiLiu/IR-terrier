	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare end of study hemoglobin levels between Epoetin alfa at 40,000 units administered subcutaneously once every week and at 80,000 units subcutaneously every two weeks in anemic patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. The secondary objectives of the study are to assess the Hb response, time to Hb response, transfusion requirements, and safety.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Epoetin Alfa (PROCRIT) Initiated at 40,000 Units Every Week Versus 80,000 Units Every Two Weeks in Anemic Patients With Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center study to compare end of study hemoglobin level between Epoetin alfa (PROCRIT) at 40,000 units administered subcutaneously once every week (qw) and at 80,000 units subcutaneously every two weeks (q2w) in approximately 280 anemic patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. The study hypothesis is that a dosing regimen of PROCRIT 80,000 Units q2w subcutaneously (sc) is non-inferior to a dosing regimen of PROCRIT 40,000 Units qw sc with respect to the change in hemoglobin (Hb) from baseline to Study Week 13 for patients with chemotherapy associated anemia and this respective dosing regimen is generally well-tolerated. The patients will receive subcutaneous (under the skin) injections of Epoetin alfa (PROCRIT) at one of the following dosing regimens: 1- Starting dose of 40,000 units sc qw (once every week) OR 2- Starting dose of 80,000 units sc q2w (every two weeks)</detailed_description>
