	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a socio-aesthetic intervention on body image and quality of life in post-surgical patients with mastectomy or tumorectomy for breast cancer.Two groups of randomized subjects were constituted. Patients of the experimental group received 2 or 3 aesthetic care during the first post-surgical week, whereas those of the control group not. Body image, quality of life and diverse other personality variables were assessed at three different times: surgical operation day before, exit day before of hospitalization and three months afterwards. Our general hypothesis is that subjects who receive aesthetic care report levels significantly higher of corporal satisfaction and of quality of life at the end of the hospitalization and three months later than patients of the control group.</brief_summary>
