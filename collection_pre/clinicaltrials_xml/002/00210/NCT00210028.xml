	<criteria>Histologically proven, metastatic or locally advanced inoperable breast cancer Tumor considered potentially hormonesensitive, i.e. presence by IHC of hormone receptors for estrogens (ER+ for more than 10% of cells) and/or progesterone (Pg+ for more than 10% of cells) or both. This expression may have been detected on the primary tumor or at a metastatic site. The method used will be reassessed by IHC if it involves a radioligand technique whenever it is possible to obtain histological material. Progressing on treatment with tamoxifen, given either as adjuvant treatment or for advanced/metastatic breast cancer. Any previous treatment with a steroidal or nonsteroidal antiaromatase in a neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic situation is permitted. Likewise, any previous treatment with chemotherapy and/or herceptin in a nonmetastatic situation is permitted. Postmenopausal patients Age &gt; 18 years At least one measurable lesion according to the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria; for patients who only have bone metastases, an evaluable nonirradiated lytic lesion is required Performance Status (WHO): PS ≤ 2 (Appendix 1). Laboratory tests in accordance with the following criteria: Neutrophils ≥ 2x109/l,Platelets ≥ 100x109/l,Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dl, ASAT, ALAT ≤ 2.5 N , or &lt; 5 N when liver metastasis,bilirubin ≤ 1.5 N creatinin ≤ 1.5 N Signed, written consent before any studyrelated procedure Men Premenopausal patients who are not receiving concurrent LHRH agonist therapy ER and PRnegative patients Contraindication to antiestrogens (thromboembolic risk) or ZARNESTRA Non metastatic tumor susceptible to management by radiotherapeutic and/or surgical means T4d inflammatory tumor (PEV 2 or 3). Shortterm, lifethreatening lesions: hepatic invasion &gt; 1/3 of liver volume, pulmonary lymphangitis, uncontrolled cerebral metastases, carcinomatous meningitis Sensory neuropathy &gt; or = grade 1 (WHO) Previous history of uncontrolled cancers or controlled for less than 5 years, except basal cell skin cancers and in situ cancers of the cervix. Chronic diseases (somatic or psychiatric) with a poor prognosis subjects with enzymeinducing anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) : this treatment is not permitted while taking ZARNESTRA Patients who, for family, social, geographic or psychological reasons, could not be followed up correctly.</criteria>
