	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Intravaginal Ejaculation Time in Men With and Without Premature Ejaculation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multinational, multicenter, observational study in men with and without PE. The study consists of three visits: one visit for screening and enrollment, and two visits for observation after 1 and 2 months (total duration of 8 weeks). No study treatment for PE is administered to patients during the course of the study. Patients and their partners are expected to attempt sexual intercourse at least 2 times a week during the 8-week study period and to use a stopwatch to record the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) during intercourse. At visits during the observation period "patients" (and/or partners if partners are responsible for completing questionaires) also provide patient-reported outcomes (PROs) by answering several questionnaires that include the topics of control over ejaculation, satisfaction with sexual intercourse, personal distress, interpersonal difficulty, and self-esteem. The study will estimate the distribution of the average IELT values for men with PE and men without PE.</detailed_description>
