	<criteria>1. Lymphomatous meningitis documented by positive CSF cytology in either newly diagnosed, relapsed or refractory primary CNS or systemic NHL 2. Pathologically diagnosed CD20positive NHL 3. Age â‰¥ 18 years 4. ECOG Performance Status 0 2 (See Appendix A) 5. Life expectancy of at least 1 month 6. Informed consent must be given according to national/local regulations before enrollment (See Appendix B) 7. Patients may have had prior CNS irradiation, intrathecal methotrexate, cytarabine or thiotepa for treatment of lymphomatous meningitis but these treatments must have completed at least two weeks before the study enrollment and the patients must have recovered from any reversible toxicity caused by prior treatments 8. Concurrent systemic chemotherapy is allowed with the exception of highdose methotrexate (&gt;500 mg/m2/day), highdose cytarabine (&gt;2 g/m2/day), highdose thiotepa (&gt;300 mg/m2/day) or investigational agents 9. No concurrent intrathecal chemotherapy other than rituximab 10. No severe impairment of bone marrow function (ANC &gt;1.5x109/L, PLT &gt;50x109/L), unless due to proven lymphoma involvement 11. No major impairment of renal function (serum creatinine &lt; 1,5 x upper normal) or liver function (ASAT/ALAT &lt; 2,5 upper normal, total bilirubin &lt;2,5x upper normal), unless due to proven lymphoma involvement 12. No evidence of active opportunistic infections 13. No HIV infection 14. No pregnant or lactating status 15. Appropriate contraceptive method in women of childbearing potential or men 16. Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial 17. Absence of a obstructive hydrocephalus or compartimentalization of CSF flow.</criteria>
