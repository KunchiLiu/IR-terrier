No previous or concurrent malignancies with the exception of surgically cured cervical intraepithelial neoplasia type 1 (CIN1) or localized nonmelanomatous skin cancer and of other cancers without evidence of disease since at least 5 years (patients with a previous lymphoma diagnosis will be excluded). 12.
