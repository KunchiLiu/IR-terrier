	<criteria>1. age = 18 years. 2. ECOG performance status 02 3. Histologically proven primary testicular CD20positive diffuse large Bcell nonHodgkin's lymphoma, untreated 4. Ann Arbor stage IE or IIE. Bilateral testicular involvement at presentation will not be considered stage IV. In these patients the final Ann Arbor stage will be determined by the extent of nodal involvement. 5. Bidimensionally measurable or evaluable disease. Patients who have had all disease removed by surgery are eligible. 6. Adequate bone marrow reserve (ANC &gt; 1.000/L, Plt &gt; 100.000/L) 7. Cardiac ejection fraction â‰¥ 50% by MUGA scan or echocardiography 8. No previous therapy with monoclonal antibody antiCD20. 9. No psychiatric illness that precludes understanding concepts of the trial or signing informed consent 10. No other major lifethreatening illnesses that may preclude chemotherapy 11. Have given written informed consent prior to any programspecific screening procedure, with the understanding that the consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice 1. impairment of renal function (creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl) or liver function (bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dl) unless due to lymphoma involvement 2. HIV positive patients 3. evolutive malignancy within 5 years with the exception of localized nonmelanomatous skin cancer</criteria>
