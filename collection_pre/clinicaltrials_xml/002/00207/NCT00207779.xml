	<brief_summary>We, the researchers at Centre National de Greffe de Moelle Osseuse, have shown in a randomised study (in press), that a low dose of unfractionated heparin (100 IU/kg/daily) was safe and effective to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infection in patients with haemato-oncological disease. The aim of this prospective randomised controlled trial is to compare the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infection in 2 groups of patients with haemato-oncological disease: - Group A: heparin impregnated catheters - Group B: low-dose unfractionated heparin (100 IU/kg/daily)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Studies have shown that catheter-related infection may be due to fibrin deposition associated with catheters. Interventions designed to decrease fibrin deposition and thrombus formation have the potential to reduce catheter-related infections. Seven randomised studies have been performed to assess the safety and efficacy of heparin (either as an infusion or bonded to central venous catheter) on central venous catheter-related bloodstream infections. Although a meta-analysis of 4 studies looking at heparin either as an infusion or bonded to central venous catheter showed a strong trend for a reduction in catheter-related bloodstream infection with the use of heparin, these studies used variable definitions of catheter-related infections. We have shown in a randomised study (in press), that low dose of unfractionated heparin (100 IU/kg/daily) was safe and effective to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infection in patients with haemato-oncological disease. The aim of this prospective randomised controlled trial is to compare the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infection in 2 groups of patients with haemato-oncological disease: - Group A: heparin impregnated catheters - Group B: low-dose unfractionated heparin (100 IU/kg/daily)</detailed_description>
