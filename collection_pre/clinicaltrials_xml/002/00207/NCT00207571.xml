	<brief_title>Partner Notification Intervention for STD Clinics.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal of this project is to develop and evaluate an intervention that will increase the number of people who, having been exposed to a sexual partner with chlamydia, gonorrhea or syphilis, (a) are notified and (b) receive evaluation and treatment. The intervention program will be presented entirely by an automated multimedia computer system with touch screen interface. The intervention will be tailored to user, based on demographic and recent sexual history factors. The intervention is designed to (a) motivate and prompt STD clinic clients to recall and identify sexual partners, (b) teach clinic clients a set of social skills for minimizing negative reactions while informing partners that they may be infected with an STD; (c) increase client's self-efficacy relative to disclosing partners names and informing them of their STD exposure, and (d) provide clients with tools for motivating their partners to seek treatment.</detailed_description>
