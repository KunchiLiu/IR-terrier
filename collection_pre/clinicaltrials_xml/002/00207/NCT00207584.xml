	<brief_summary>This study was designed to determine whether taking daily doxycycline during an outbreak of Mycoplasma pneumoniae could prevent a person from getting infected and interrupt ongoing disease transmission during an outbreak. Doxycycline is a treatment for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, but it is not certain that the drug could prevent disease if used prophylactically.</brief_summary>
