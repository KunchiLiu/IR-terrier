	<brief_summary>Studies have shown that the prevalence of respiratory symptoms, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and asthma is high and increasing in elite athletes. The inflammation seen in the airways of elite athletes might differ from the inflammation seen in the airways of "ordinary" asthmatics and it might represent a different kind of asthma. The primary purposes are 1. To investigate the type of airway inflammation in young swimmers. 2. To investigate the acute changes in airway inflammation after a short training session.</brief_summary>
