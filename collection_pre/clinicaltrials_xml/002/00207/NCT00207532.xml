	<brief_summary>CDC staff at the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities have been working closely with a Honduras-based organization, Project Healthy Children (PNS) and the Ministry of Health, on a folic acid supplementation study among female maquila workers. Participants are divided into two groups. One group receives a 1.0 milligram pill daily while the other group receives a 5.0 milligram pill weekly. The aim of this study is to assess serum blood folate levels measured at baseline, midpoint, and endpoint of the study. Hypothesis: Folic acid (5mg)given once weekly is as effective as folic acid (1mg)given daily in raising blood folate levels.</brief_summary>
