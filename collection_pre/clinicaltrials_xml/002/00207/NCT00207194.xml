The primary hypotheses are: 1. TLC-HTN-AA use will improve medication regiment adherence 2. TLC-HTN-AA will improve adherence to 3 healthy diet recommendations 3. TLC-HTN-AA will improve levels of regular exercise 4. Patients receiving TLC-HTN-AA will be more likely to become adherent to all 3 target regiments than patients in the control group</brief_summary>
