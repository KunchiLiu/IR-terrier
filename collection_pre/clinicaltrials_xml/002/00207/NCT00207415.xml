	<brief_summary>The arthritis-specific Arthritis Self Help Course (ASHC) and the more generic Chronic Disease Self Management Program (CDSMP) teach generalizable skills for managing arthritis and other chronic diseases. In some locations it may be more feasible to combine efforts and offer the generic course rather than the arthritis-specific program. However anecdotal evidence has questioned whether people with arthritis obtain as much benefit from the more generic course as they do the arthritis-specific course. The primary purpose of this research study is to compare health outcomes among people with arthritis who participate in either ASHC or the CDSMP. The University of Illinois Project is emphasizing recruiting a balance of uran and rural participants. The results of this research will be used to guide Arthritis program recommendations on the use of ASHC and CDSMP to improve the quality of life for people with arthritis.</brief_summary>
