Both females of childbearing potential and males must utilize effective barrier contraception. Other contraception in addition to barrier methods is permitted; refer to the Investigator Brochure for details regarding potential interactions with ATV and some oral contraceptives WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for up to 8 weeks after the study. WOCBP using a prohibited contraceptive method. Caution is warranted with coadministration of oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) see Investigator Brochure for details Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding Women with a positive pregnancy test on enrollment or prior to study drug administration. Presence of a newly diagnosed HIVrelated opportunistic infection or any medical condition requiring acute therapy at the time of enrollment Primary HIV infection Medical History and Concurrent Diseases Active alcohol or substance use sufficient, in the investigator's opinion, to prevent adequate compliance with study therapy or to increase the risk of developing pancreatitis or chemical hepatitis Physical and Laboratory Test Findings Screening laboratory values measured as follows: Grade IV glucose, Grade IV electrolytes, Grade IV transaminases, Grade IV hematology. Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of study drug Prior history of taking any ARV for more than 10 days Concomitant administration of tenofovir (TDF).
