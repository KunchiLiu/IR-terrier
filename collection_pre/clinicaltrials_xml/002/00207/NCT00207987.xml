	<brief_title>Changes in Cerebral Oxygenation During Deliberate Hypotensive Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The values of cerebral oximetry were analyzed between different stages of anesthetic management. The critical part of anesthetic management is to use the technique of controlled hypotension. The blood pressure was lowered to the level of MABP 50 or 60 mmHg depending on which group patients were assigned to. The values of cerebral oximetry and side effects between 2 groups will be compared at the completion of data collection.</detailed_description>
