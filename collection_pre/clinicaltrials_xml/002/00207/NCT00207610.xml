	<brief_summary>Anemia is common among low-income women after they have given birth. Anemia, or low hemoglobin in the blood cells, is usually caused by not having enough iron. Blood cells usually carry oxygen to other parts of the body. Without enough hemoglobin, the ability of blood cells to carry oxygen is decreased. Memory and work may be impaired. The purpose of this study is to evaluate three methods of giving iron to prevent anemia among low-income women after they have given birth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iron Supplementation Among Low-Income Postpartum Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations to prevent iron deficiency advocate selective screening and treatment of anemia at about 6 weeks postpartum. However, among some groups, such as low income women, data suggest that anemia and iron deficiency are common. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of three stategies to prevent iron deficiency among low income postpartum women in Mississippi. Comparisons: Clinics will be randomized to one of three strategies: 1)Selective anemia screening and treatment of anemic women, 2)universal anemia screening and treatment of anemic women, or 3)universal iron supplementation of 65 mg a day for three months.</detailed_description>
