	<brief_summary>While there are a variety of arthritis education materials available, the evidence-base on most of them is slim, so it i impossible to know what benefits they may have for the people who participate. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of the mail-delivered self-management education program, Arthritis Basics for Change (ABCS) with an emphasis on changes in knowledge, beliefs, behavior, self efficacy and health outcomes, and to evaluate the appropriateness, usefulness, and readibility of the program. This project will assist CDC's Arthritis Program in determining the usefulness of the ABCs program for helping people with arthritis improve their quality of life.</brief_summary>
