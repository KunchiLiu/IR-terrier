	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of CNTO1275 in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a life-long disease that usually starts in young adults. In MS, inflammation and damage to nerve cells occur in the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms of MS are quite variable and may range from being mild to severe and from short to long lasting. People with MS may have a wide variety of symptoms ranging from mild to disabling. Some of thesymptoms of MS include visual disturbances such as double vision, weakness in arms or legs,difficulty with coordination, fatigue, changes in sensations such as numbness and tingling, or difficulties with concentration or memory.The drug being tested in this research study is an antibody called CNTO 1275. Antibodies are natural substances made by the body that stick to and react with other substances in the body that may cause diseases. The body makes antibodies mainly to fight infections. CNTO 1275 is an antibody that has been manufactured in the laboratory. In the test tube, CNTO 1275 sticks to and blocks the activity of a naturally occurring substance in the body called interleukin 12 (IL-12).Higher than normal levels of IL-12 have been found in people who have MS. CNTO 1275 has been tested in animals with a condition similar to MS. In those animals, IL-12 was over-produced.Animals treated with CNTO 1275 showed decreased symptoms of the condition.The purpose of this study is to better understand the safety and effectiveness of CNTO 1275 in people who have relapsing-remitting MS Patients will receive subcutaneous injections of 30, 100, 200 mg of CNTO 1275 or placebo at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 15, and 19 or 100 mgs at weeks 0,1,2,3,11 and 19 and placebo at wks 7 and 15.</detailed_description>
