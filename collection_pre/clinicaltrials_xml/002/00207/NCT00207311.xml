	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in subjects with histological evidence of &gt; 33% hepatic steatosis or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and chronic hepatitis C. Patients who have not been previously treated for hepatitis C (treatment naive) will be enrolled.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study for the Treatment of Significant Steatosis With Xenical Followed by Treatment of Hepatitis C With Pegasys/Copegus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent evidence suggests that patients with concomitant chronic HCV infection and NASH or significant hepatic steatosis (&gt;33%) respond less well to standard antiviral therapy. As previously noted, up to 10% of patients with chronic HCV infection will have concomitant NASH and an even greater percentage will have associated hepatic steatosis. No prospective studies to date have evaluated the sustained viral response rates to standard antiviral therapy in this group of patients who were previously treated with a medication to eliminate or improve the underlying NASH and/or hepatic steatosis. Primary Outcome: To determine if decreasing the amount of NASH or hepatic steatosis in overweight (BMI &gt;27 kg/m2) HCV patients results in improved overall SVR to PEGASYS and Copegus. Secondary Outcome: 1.To determine the amount of steatosis, necroinflammatory activity, and fibrosis change in a group of participants with chronic hepatitis C and NASH or significant steatosis treated with Xenical vs. placebo for 36 weeks. 2. To assess for a difference in insulin resistance, as measured by the QUICKI score, before and after treatment with Xenical or Xenical placebo and diet and exercise.</detailed_description>
