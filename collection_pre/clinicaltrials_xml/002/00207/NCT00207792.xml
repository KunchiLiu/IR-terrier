	<brief_summary>The effect of haematopoietic growth factors on neutrophil recovery after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is well recognized. Recent laboratory studies demonstrated that these cytokines may also modify T-cell and dendritic cell function, but whether the effect is strong enough to alter the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is unclear. The aim of this randomised study is to determine the effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF] (Neupogen; filgrastim) on the risk of acute GvHD after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.</brief_summary>
