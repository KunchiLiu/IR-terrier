	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to examine whether the same total daily dosage of folic acid, when taken as a single daily dose or as multiple divided doses throughout the day, results in different blood folate and homocysteine levels at the conclusion of the study. Further, a comparison of blood folate and homocysteine levels among women taking daily low-dosage (100mcg) and standard- dosage (400mcg) folic acid with those of women taking daily or weekly high-dosage (4000mcg) folic acid will be conducted.</brief_summary>
