	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a biological dressing on the healing process of venous ulcers. The dressing is a reconstructed skin substitute made with the patients own cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Cutaneous Ulcers With a Novel Biological Dressing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis of this trial is that the cutaneous model SASS, a dermal epidermal skin substitute, created by the LOEX could be as high-performant, or even better, than the one's already existent in North America for the wound care. We anticipate showing on 6 patients that ulcer that did not close with conventional treatment, will heal or at least improve with this treatment.</detailed_description>
