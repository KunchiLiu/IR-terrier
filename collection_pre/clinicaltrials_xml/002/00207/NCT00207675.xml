	<brief_title>A Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Infliximab (Remicade) in Pediatric Patients With Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a medical research study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an antibody called infliximab (Remicade) in the treatment of children with Crohn's disease. In this study, subjects will receive multiple doses of infliximab over 62 weeks. The goal of the study is to ensure that the medication is safe and effective in children when it is given for an extended period of time. All subjects will receive an induction regimen of 5 mg/kg infliximab at Weeks 0, 2, and 6. Subjects will then receive either 5 or 10 mg/kg infliximab either every 8 or 12 weeks for up to 46 weeks followed by an open label extension for up to three additional years.</detailed_description>
