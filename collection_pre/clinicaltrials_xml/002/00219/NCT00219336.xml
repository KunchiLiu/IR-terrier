	<brief_summary>The study evaluated the effectiveness of a mail-based self-guided motivational intervention based on Project CHOICES to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) with female students and non-students 18 to 44 years of age living in Florida. The investigators hypothesize that the motivational intervention will significantly reduce more women's risk of an AEP than will an informational intervention aimed at preventing fetal alcohol syndrome. Materials will be available in Spanish and English</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed project will evaluate the effectiveness of a mail-based self-guided motivational intervention based on Project CHOICES to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) among students and non-students. Participants will be women 18 to 44 years of age who are at risk of an AEP. The community targeted will be the state of Florida. Materials were available in Spanish and English The intervention will be based on the investigators' previous experience in (a) promoting self-change of drinking behavior at a community level and (b) preventing reduced risk for AEP through the use of a motivational interventional materials used in Project CHOICES. Using a 2 group randomized design, the self-guided motivational intervention will be compared to an intervention directed at preventing fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The FAS prevention condition, a brochure developed by the CDC, served as the standard treatment control group in that most information available at the community level concerning the effects of alcohol on the developing fetus relate to FAS (e.g., warning labels on alcoholic beverage containers). It is suggested that many women, particularly college students, at risk for AEP do not view themselves as at risk for FAS and therefore do not view FAS-oriented prevention messages as personally relevant. The proposed experimental design will evaluate a mail-based strategy that could be easily implemented throughout communities. The proposed study design will have more methodological rigor and allow a more careful evaluation than would be possible if the intervention was initially targeted at the entire community. The follow-up will be the entire 6-months post-intervention.If successful, this low-cost intervention can be readily disseminated throughout the local area. Specific objectives are as follows: 1. Develop an evidence-based intervention to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies that can be easily disseminated at a community level through the mail and other media outlets. 2. Implement the AEP prevention intervention using a randomized controlled trial with women recruited from a community at higher than normal risk for AEPs. 3. Evaluate the efficacy of the AEP prevention intervention for reducing AEP risk as compared to a community level intervention aimed at preventing FAS using the 3 primary outcome measures in previous Project CHOICES studies: (a) AEP reduced risk through reduced drinking or effective contraception, or both; (b) AEP reduced risk through drinking only; and (c) reduced risk through effective contraception only. 4. Disseminate results of the study to health care providers in the local community.</detailed_description>
