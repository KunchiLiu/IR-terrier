	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2 study being conducted at multiple centers in the United States, Europe and Canada. Patients having pancreatic cancer that is locally advanced or that has spread to other parts of the body (i.e., metastatic) are eligible to participate. Patients must have not had any prior systemic treatment for advanced disease. The purpose of the study is to test whether the angiogenesis inhibitor Axitinib [AG-013736] in combination with gemcitabine is an effective treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer vs. gemcitabine alone by overall survival.</brief_summary>
