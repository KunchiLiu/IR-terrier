	<criteria>Written informed consent by patient or legally valid representative Patients receiving highdose MTX (&gt;1 g/m2 body surface area (BSA) given as an infusion over 24 hours) for the treatment of ALL, NHL or a solid tumour (e.g. osteosarcoma) Age ≥ 18 years Serum MTX &gt;5 µmol/L 42 hours or later after the start of MTX infusion, or serum MTX &gt;1 μmol/L 42 hours or later after the start of MTX infusion together with renal insufficiency, or serum MTX &gt;0.4 µmol/L 48 hours or later after the start of MTX infusion together with renal insufficiency. Renal insufficiency was defined as serum creatinine &gt;1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or oliguria (urine output &lt; 500 mL/24 hours despite adequate hydration, diuretics and alkalinisation).
