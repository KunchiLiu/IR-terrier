	<criteria>HIV1 infection, as documented by any licensed ELISA test kit and confirmed by Western blot at any time prior to study entry. Acute or early HIV1 infection at the time of HAART initiation defined by HIV1 RNA detectable with a negative serology or a negative detuned ELISA. HAART for at least 15 months and no more than 1 detectable HIV1 RNA value (above the 50 copy/mL) for at least 6 months prior to screening. Laboratory values Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) equal to or greter than 750/mm3. Hemoglobin equal to or greater than 9.5 g/dL. Platelet count equal to or greater than 50,000/mm3. Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) equal to or greater than 80 mL/min according to the CockcroftGault formula: Men: (140age in years) x (wt in kg) = CrCl (mL/min) 72 x (serum creatinine in mg/dL) Female: (140age in years) x (wt in kg) x 0.85 = CrCl (mL/min) 72 x (serum creatinine in mg/dL) AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), and alkaline phosphatase equal to or less than 5 x ULN. Total bilirubin equal to or less than 2.5 x ULN. Serum Lipase equal to or less than 1.5 x ULN Negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days. All females of childbearing potential must agree to practice active birth control measures (barrier methods such as condoms, diaphragms, cervical cap, etc. or an intrauterine device such as a coil) to avoid pregnancy while receiving the study drugs and for 30 days after the last dose of the study drugs. Additionally, men enrolled in the study should practice active birth control for the same period of time with their female partners of childbearing potential. Men and women age &gt;18 years. Ability and willingness of subject to give written informed consent More than 1 detectable HIV1 RNA value (&gt;50 copies/mL) within 6 months of screening visit Pregnancy and breastfeeding. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements. Serious illness (requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization) until subject either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy, in the opinion of the investigator, for at least 30 days prior to study entry.</criteria>
