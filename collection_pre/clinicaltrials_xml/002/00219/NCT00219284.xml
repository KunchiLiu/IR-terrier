	<brief_title>Effects of Carbidopa/Levodopa/Entacapone on Motor Function and Quality of Life in Patients With Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label study with blinded raters to evaluate the effects of immediate versus delayed switch to carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone on motor function and quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease with end-of-dose wearing off.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males or females 3080 years of age (inclusive). Patients aged 8185 years were eligible to participate if the principal investigator considered the patient to be in otherwise good health. Clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease exhibiting two of three symptoms (rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia). All patients were required to have endof dose wearing off (EODWO, reemergence of PD symptoms at the end of at least two daily doses of levodopa during waking hours). Taking regular doses of immediate release carbidopa/levodopa Unstable Parkinson's Disease requiring booster doses or treatment with as needed dose regimens of levodopa Female subjects who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or nursing an infant Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to this study.</criteria>
