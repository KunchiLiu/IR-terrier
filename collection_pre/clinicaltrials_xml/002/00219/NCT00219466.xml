	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Two Marketed Investigational Products in Children With Diaper Rash</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects received applications of the investigational products following a gentle cleansing of the diaper zone at every diaper change and following bathing of the child during a 24 hour period. Efficacy was assessed during this study through the documentation of the severity of diaper rash. Results of five anatomic areas and overall severity score by the evaluator's assessments, and parent/guardian's assessments all indicated that both products were significantly effective (P&lt;0.05 in relieving diaper dermatitis (rash) after 12 and 24 hours of treatment. Safety was assessed through the reporting of adverse events during the course of the study. Overall, the reporting of no adverse events under the conditions of the protocol indicate that the investigational products would appear to be safe for their intended use.</detailed_description>
