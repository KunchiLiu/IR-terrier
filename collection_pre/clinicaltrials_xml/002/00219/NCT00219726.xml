	<brief_summary>The aim of this phase II trial is asses the tolerability and the effectiveness of imatinib in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase who are in relapse after stem cell transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Imatinib in Chronic Myelogenous Patients in Relapse After Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will received Imatinib at a dose of 400mg daily. The tolerability of Imatinib given at a daily dose of 400mg will be assessed. The hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses will be evaluated at various check points. Donor/recipient chimerism during Imatinib therapy will be assessed. Survival will be estimated.</detailed_description>
