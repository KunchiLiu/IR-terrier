	<detailed_description>Patients will complete a diary to determine if they qualify for the study. Patients will be randomized to receive either acupuncture or sham acupuncture (needle insertion 1 cm away from acupuncture site). Patients will be blinded to whether they are receiving acupuncture or sham acupuncture. The acupuncturist is blinded as to the patient response. The patients will undergo venupuncture to draw blood to determine sertotonin and beta-endorphin levels. They will receive treatment in 12 sessions over 4 weeks. They will maintain a diary during this time period to document level of pain and frequency of bowel movements. Blood will be drawn at week 2 and 4 and, 6 weeks after cessation of treatment, subjects will again record abdominal symptoms and frequency of bowel movements for 2 weeks. Blood will be drawn for hormone levels at 8 weeks after completion of study.</detailed_description>
