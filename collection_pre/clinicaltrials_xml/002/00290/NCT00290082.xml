	<brief_summary>Neuroleptics are used since a long time in the management of severely agitated patients. Loxapine is routinely used in our country, with, to our knowledge no severe adverse event reported, in this indication. However, recently, benzodiazepines have appeared interesting in agitated patients, with the use of midazolam. The aim of this study is to compare midazolam to loxapine in the treatment of severe agitated patients admitted in the emergency department.</brief_summary>
