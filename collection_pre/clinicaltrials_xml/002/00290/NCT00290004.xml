	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, toxicities, dosage and response rate for an investigational drug, motexafin gadolinium, administered to patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. The secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical benefit rate, the time it takes for a patient's chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma to worsen, the duration of response and the time during which patients survive without chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma worsening. Additionally, the patient's response to motexafin gadolinium will be compared to the response of the patient's cells in a laboratory to motexafin gadolinium.</brief_summary>
