	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Giving internal radiation therapy using a special radiation therapy device may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well internal radiation therapy after lumpectomy works in treating women with ductal carcinoma in situ.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Internal Radiation Therapy After Lumpectomy in Treating Women With Ductal Carcinoma in Situ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate in women with ductal carcinoma in situ undergoing lumpectomy followed by brachytherapy using the MammoSite^® Radiation Therapy System. Secondary - Determine the early and late complication rates and cosmetic outcome in these patients after treatment. OUTLINE: Patients undergo lumpectomy. Patients with negative tumor margins* (no ink on tumor) undergo placement of the MammoSite^® Radiation Therapy System at the time of lumpectomy or within 4 weeks after surgery. NOTE: *If positive margins are present, the surgeon may elect to resect the positive margins and then insert a new MammoSite® device if all other eligibility criteria are met. Beginning 2-5 days after placement of the MammoSite^®, patients undergo brachytherapy through the MammoSite^® twice daily for 5 days (a total of 10 fractions). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for ≥ 5 years.</detailed_description>
