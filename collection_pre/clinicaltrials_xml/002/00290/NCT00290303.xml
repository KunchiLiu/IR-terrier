	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the immune response, safety and reactogenicity of Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib-MenAC vaccine given either with or without a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine to Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™ when given to healthy infants (born to mothers who do not carry hepatitis B virus) at 6, 10 &amp; 14 weeks of age. This study will also include a small group of infants born to mothers who do carry hepatitis B virus; these infants will receive a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and will be vaccinated with Tritanrix™ HepB/Hib-MenAC at 6, 10 &amp; 14 weeks age.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assess if Immune Response of GSK Biologicals' Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib-MenAC Given Without or With Hepatitis B Vaccine at Birth is at Least as Good as Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™ Without Hepatitis B Vaccine at Birth, When Given to Healthy Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized study with three groups (subjects born to mothers who do not carry hepatitis B virus) to receive one of the following vaccination regimens: - GSK Biologicals' Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib-MenAC and hepatitis B vaccine at birth - GSK Biologicals' Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib-MenAC and no hepatitis B vaccine at birth - GSK Biologicals' Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™ There will also be a fourth group (subjects born to mothers who do carry hepatitis B virus) to receive: - GSK Biologicals' Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib-MenAC and hepatitis B vaccine at birth</detailed_description>
