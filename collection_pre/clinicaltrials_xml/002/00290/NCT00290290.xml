	<brief_summary>Most cases of infection of clean-contaminated wounds (wounds without gross spillage of organisms from the gastrointestinal tract) are thought to originate from the skin. Therefore, it is conceivable that application of an optimal antiseptic agent can reduce the rate of surgical wound infections. This trial is to compare the impact of disinfecting the skin with Chloraprep (2%chlorhexidine and 70% isopropyl alcohol) vs. Betadine on the rates of infection of clean-contaminated surgical wounds. The study will also assess the occurrence of adverse effects on the skin from either antiseptic agent and the cost-savings associated with the use of Chloraprep vs Betadine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial. All adult patients, who are scheduled for a clean-contaminated surgical procedure of the alimentary, respiratory, reproductive or urinary tract will be asked to participate.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patients who are scheduled for a cleancontaminated surgical procedure of the alimentary or respiratory tract will be eligible for participation. A cleancontaminated wound is one that is entered under controlled conditions without unusual contamination. Patients will be excluded form the study if: (1) they are unable or unwilling to give informed consent; (2) the patient is less than 18 years of age; (3) there is evidence of preexisting infection at or adjacent to the operative site; (4) a break in sterile technique occurs; (5) the patient has a history of allergy to chlorhexidine, alcohol or iodophors.</criteria>
