	<brief_title>Repeat Nasal Allergen Challenge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-drug, biomarker study to assess the utility of the model of repeated nasal allergen challenges in subjects with atopic rhinitis as a method of inducing an increased response to inhaled allergen, which will more closely resemble the responses seen during the hayfever season.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Male and female subjects with a history of seasonal (intermittent) atopic rhinitis, aged 1840 years. 2. Otherwise healthy with no health problems that may jeopardize the subjects participating in the study, absence of history of other significant allergies. 1. Smokers (use of tobacco products in the previous 3 months). 2. Presence of any respiratory disease other than a history of mild stable asthma not requiring treatment and associated with normal lung function (FEV1 &gt; 80% predicted at screening).</criteria>
