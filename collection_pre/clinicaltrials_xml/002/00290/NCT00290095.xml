	<brief_title>Quality of Life in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell tumor with an annual incidence of 6 pr. 100 000. In the absence of curative treatment, the aim of the therapy is not only to induce an objective response and a prolongation of survival but also to improve the patients quality of life. This project will raise two problems which make QoL-data hard to interpret 1. In a clinical trial where many patients are included, statistically significant differences are obtained. However, there is widespread agreement that p-values do not indicate whether a particular finding has clinical significance because statistical significance does not necessarily equate to a meaningful difference or change in QoL. A crucial task for clinicians in interpreting trial-based QoL results is to determine if the observed change is clinically important to the patient. 2. When measuring changes in QoL in a pretest-posttest design,response shift can affect results. Patients with advanced disease can report surprisingly good QoL.Including response shift into quality of life research would allow a better understanding of changes in the QoL that patients report.</detailed_description>
