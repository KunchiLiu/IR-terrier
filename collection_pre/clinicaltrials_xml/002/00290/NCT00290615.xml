	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab and bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab and bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving capecitabine together with cetuximab, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving capecitabine together with cetuximab, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab works in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine, Cetuximab, Oxaliplatin, and Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Colorectal Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate in patients with unresectable metastatic or recurrent colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with capecitabine, cetuximab, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab. Secondary - Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. Exploratory - Determine the effect of this regimen on the angiogenesis biomarkers in these patients. - Determine the effect of this regimen on wound angiogenesis in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Patients will also receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours, oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 month. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 45 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
