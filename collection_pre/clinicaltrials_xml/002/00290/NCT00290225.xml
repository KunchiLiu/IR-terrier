	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis: that a standardized course of Eastern practices (Breath Water Sound Course -BWS) will significantly relieve PTSD and depression in tsunami victims. Further, that a client-centered exposure treatment (Traumatic Incident Reduction- TIR) would provide additional, significant relief of PTSD and depression in tsunami victims. 180 tsunami victims in Southern India will be divided into three groups: those that only receive BWS course, those that receive the BWS course and TIR and a wait-list control. They will be pretested with the PCL-17 (PTSD scale), the Beck Depression Inventory and the General Health Questionaire. These scales will also be administered post-service as well as five weeks post pre-testing and at three and six month intervals.</brief_summary>
