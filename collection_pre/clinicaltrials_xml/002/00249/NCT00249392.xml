	<brief_summary>Environmental and genetic factors may play a role in the progression of ocular diseases (cataract, retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinal detachment, ocular tumor, etc.). The goal of this project is to establish a series of case-control studies to evaluate risk factors of ocular diseases in China.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidemiologic, Laboratory, and Clinical Characterization of Individuals With Ocular Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to investigate the epidemiologic, genetic, laboratory and clinical characterization of individuals with ocular diseases (cataract, retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinal detachment, ocular tumor, etc.). We will accrue approximately 800 patients as experimental group. The control group consists of age/sex frequency-matched subjects who will be confirmed without ocular diseases. We will explore the environmental (including family history, life style, diet, physical activity, neuropsychological functioningï¼Œplasma levels of oxidative stress and angiogenic factors, etc.) and genetic (including oxidative stress and angiogenic factors, etc.) risk factors. We will study the association between various environmental risk factors with the clinical characterization and correlation between the genetic polymorphisms and the presence of various ocular diseases.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>This is a study only of Chinese. Subjects will be allowed to participate if they selfidentify as Chinese. Individuals with ocular diseases (cataract, retinopathy, agerelated macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinal detachment, ocular tumor, etc.) will be allowed to participate. To participate in the study as the control, subjects should be confirmed without ocular diseases.</criteria>
