	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare voucher-based contingency management (CM) procedures to a lower-cost CM system that provides opportunities to win prizes. Cocaine-dependent outpatients are randomly assigned to (a) standard treatment, (b) standard treatment plus usual magnitude prize CM, (c) standard treatment plus higher magnitude prize CM, or (d) standard treatment plus voucher CM. Urine and breath samples are collected 2-3x/week for 14 weeks. Follow-up interviews are conducted at 1,3,6 and 9 months following intake during which substance use and psychosocial functioning are assessed.</brief_summary>
