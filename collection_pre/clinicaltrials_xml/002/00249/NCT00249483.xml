	<brief_title>Venlafaxine to Reduce Cocaine Dependence in Depressed Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals addicted to cocaine often experience feelings of restlessness, irritability, and anxiety. They also often report feeling depressed when not using cocaine, and they tend to resume cocaine use to alleviate symptoms of depression. Venlafaxine is a medication that is currently used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. Preliminary research has shown that venlafaxine reduces depression, improves mood, and simultaneously reduces cocaine use in cocaine addicts. Further research is needed to confirm the benefits of venlafaxine for cocaine addicts. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of venlafaxine in reducing cocaine use, cocaine craving, and depression in individuals who are addicted to cocaine and diagnosed with depression. This study will begin with a 1-week lead-in phase, during which all participants will receive placebo medication. Participants whose depression levels decrease will not continue in the treatment phase of the study, but will be eligible for cocaine relapse therapy and medication if deemed necessary by the treating psychiatrist. Participants who remain depressed following the lead-in phase will be randomly assigned to receive either venlafaxine or placebo for 12 weeks. Participants assigned to venlafaxine will initially receive a daily dose of 37.5 mg. After 4 days, the dose will be increased to 75 mg; each week thereafter, the dose will be increased by another 75 mg, up to a maximum of 300 mg per day, dependent on side effects and positive responses. Study visits will take place twice a week. At each visit, medication side effects and depression levels will be assessed, cocaine levels will be monitored with urine tests, and self-reports will be completed. Blood will be drawn once per month for laboratory tests. Participants will also attend a therapy session once a week, and they will meet with a psychiatrist every other week for assessments. Participants who show a decrease in depression during the 12 weeks of treatment will continue for an additional 12 weeks to further monitor cocaine use and depression levels.</detailed_description>
