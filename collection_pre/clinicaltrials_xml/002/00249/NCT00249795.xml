	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine if Irbesartan compared to Placebo would reduce the risk of vascular events such as heart attack, stroke, non-cerebral thromboembolic event and death in patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and with at least one major risk of vascular events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial With Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events (ACTIVE I)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ACTIVE I was one of the 3 separate but related trials of the ACTIVE program conducted in AF patients at risk of vascular events. Patients were enrolled first into one of the 2 parallel trials of the ACTIVE program evaluating Clopidogrel: - ACTIVE A comparing clopidogrel + acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and ASA alone - ACTIVE W comparing clopidogrel + ASA and oral anticoagulant (OAC). Then those satisfying additional criteria related to blood pressure and angiotensin receptor blocking agents were re-randomized in the two ACTIVE I arms according to a separate randomization list.</detailed_description>
