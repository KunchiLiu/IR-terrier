	<brief_summary>This study is designed to confirm the safety of the proposed dose and schedule of ABI-007 for hemodialysis patients with vascular access device failure, and to obtain preliminary data on the effectiveness of such treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of ABI-007 for the Prevention of Vascular Access Graft Failure in Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, pilot, phase II study to assess the feasibility of administering ABI-007 intravenously [IV] over 3-5 minutes to patients with hemodialysis graft dysfunction (i.e., either a thrombosed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft, or a patent but dysfunctional PTFE graft). Patients with graft dysfunction who are successfully treated with angioplasty will start treatment after angioplasty or during their first dialysis through the graft following intervention, and will receive 3 subsequent treatments of ABI-007 at 35 mg/m^2 on weeks 5, 13 and 21.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Thrombosed graft within the past 7 days or a patent but dysfunctional polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft (identified by any means) with a stenosis of greater than 50% at the graftvein anastomosis or within 8 centimeters of the graftvein anastomosis which will be referred to as the index lesion. Following angioplasty patients must have residual stenosis of less than 20% post angioplasty for the index lesion and for all other stenoses; also index lesion must be located in the arm. PTFE graft requiring angioplasty must be at least 30 days old. Male or nonpregnant and nonlactating female, and ≥ 18 years of age. Patient or guardian has provided a signed written informed consent for the administration of ABI007 (postangioplasty or at the time of first dialysis through the new graft) using a form that is approved by the local IRB/ethics committee of the investigative site. Patient or his/her legally authorized representative or guardian has been informed about the nature of the study, and has agreed to participate in the study, and signed the Informed Consent form prior to participation in any studyrelated activities. Use of a stent at the time of current angioplasty or at any previous time in the index lesion. No perforation at the time of current angioplasty. Thrombosed graft for more than 7 days. Patient has the following blood counts at baseline: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 2.0*10^9/L; platelets &lt; 100*10^9/L; Hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt; 9 g/dL. Patient has the following blood chemistry levels at baseline: Aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT), alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) &gt; 2.5x upper limit of normal range (ULN); total bilirubin ≥ upper limit of normal (ULN); Unable to give informed consent, or for whom informed consent cannot be obtained from a legal guardian. Women who are pregnant and women of child bearing potential who do not use adequate contraception. 2 procedures of percutaneous or surgical intervention on the PTFE graft within the previous 90 days. Previous participation in another study with any investigational drug or device within the past 30 days or current enrollment in any other clinical protocol or investigational trial. Patient has a life expectancy of less than 6 months. Intended kidney transplant within 6 months of enrollment in the study Any significant medical condition which in the investigators opinion may interfere with the patients optimal participation in the study. Patient is, in the investigator's opinion, unlikely to be able to complete the study through the End of Study (EOS) visit. Patient has a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to the study drug. Documented hypercoagulable state requiring anticoagulation (protein S, protein C, antiphospholipid; anticoagulation on an empiric basis for graft thromboses in not a contradiction). Patient is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. Patient is currently receiving other chemotherapy drug(s).</criteria>
