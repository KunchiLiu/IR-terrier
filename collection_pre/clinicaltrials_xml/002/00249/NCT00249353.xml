	<brief_title>An Effectiveness and Safety Study of CONCERTA® (Methylphenidate Hydrochloride) in the Treatment of Adolescents With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CONCERTA® (methylphenidate hydrochloride) in the treatment of adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with adolescents ages 13-18 diagnosed with ADHD. The study consists of four phases. The Screening Phase establishes the diagnosis of ADHD and provides a one-week washout period without any ADHD medication. The Open-Label Titration Phase initiates the treatment of patients with one CONCERTA® 18 mg daily. Thereafter, the dose is increased approximately every 7 days in 18 mg increments (to a maximum of 72 mg daily), until an individualized dose is identified, based on the clinical judgment of the investigator. During the Double-Blind Phase, subjects are randomized to receive either their individualized CONCERTA® dose or a placebo, for a period of 2 weeks. Subjects who successfully complete the Double-Blind Phase are eligible to receive CONCERTA® for an 8-week, Open-Label, Follow-up Phase. The primary efficacy measurement is the total score of the ADHD Rating Scale, evaluated by the investigator at the end of the Double-Blind Phase. Safety assessments include monitoring adverse events, electrocardiograms (ECG), blood pressure, pulse, height and weight throughout the course of the study. The study hypothesis is that CONCERTA® is more effective than placebo in the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in adolescents, and is well tolerated. Titration Phase: CONCERTA® 18 mg taken orally, once daily, and increased approximately every 7 days in 18 mg increments up to a maximum daily dose of 72 mg. Double-Blind Phase: Individualized dose of CONCERTA® or placebo for 2 weeks. Open-Label Phase: Individualized dose of CONCERTA® for 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
