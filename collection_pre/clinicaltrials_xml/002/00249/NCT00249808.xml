	<brief_summary>Phase IIIb/IV , open-label, multi-centre study in patients receiving efalizumab 1mg/kg/week for 12 weeks. At anytime during the first 12 weeks, non-responding or worsening patients will discontinue efalizumab and enter a 12-week treatment period with other approved antipsoriasis therapies. Objectives: - To establish safe psoriasis control of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis with efalizumab in patients who have failed to respond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant of other systemic therapies including cyclosporine, methotrexate and PUVA. - To evaluate the management of psoriasis events namely rebound and exacerbation, in patients while on Efalizumab or subsequent to its discontinuation</brief_summary>
