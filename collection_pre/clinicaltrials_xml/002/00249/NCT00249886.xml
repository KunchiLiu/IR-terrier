	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether it is advantageous for adolescents who have recovered from depression after a 6 to 12 week course of antidepressant treatment to stay on the treatment a further 6 months or is it just as helpful to stop the medication after recovery. The hypothesis is that adolescents with major depression who recover from the 6 to 12 week trial of citalopram will be less likely to have a recurrence of depression over a 6 month period if continued on the citalopram as compared to those who discontinue the medication.</brief_summary>
