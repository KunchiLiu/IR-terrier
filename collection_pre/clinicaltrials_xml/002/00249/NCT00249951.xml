	<brief_summary>Preterm infants are at risk to develop nephrocalcinosis. Incidence numbers vary according to birth weight and gestation age. Very low birth weight infants have the highest risk index, with ~ 7-10 % of preterm infants developing nephrocalcinosis in the patient population. We, the researchers at the University of Cologne, and others found significantly decreased urinary citrate excretion (hypocitraturia) to be one of the main risk factors. Hence, we hypothesized, that prophylactic treatment with oral alkaline citrate solution (Shol's solution) would help to 1) increase urinary citrate excretion and 2) help to decrease the incidence of nephrocalcinosis.</brief_summary>
