	<brief_title>Bridging Active Heroin Users to Hepatitis C Treatment Using Buprenorphine - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective pilot safety study based on the hypothesis that active, street-recruited heroin users can be successfully treated for hepatitis C after stabilization on buprenorphine. Eligible subjects will be actively using heroin and have hepatitis C viremia; screening will occur at street-based sites like syringe exchange programs. Those who are eligible will sign informed consent, and then be asked to attend 3 weekly educational sessions about hepatitis C and addiction as well as undergo an intake interview. After this, subjects will be inducted onto buprenorphine/naloxone combination therapy (Suboxone) and receive this medication for 12-24 weeks. Once reaching the 12-24 week study time point, subjects will have the option of a 12-week Suboxone taper, or instead of undergoing 6-12 months of hepatitis C treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin while being maintained on Suboxone. Once completing hepatitis C treatment, subjects will undergo a 24-week Suboxone taper, or be transitioned to outpatient Suboxone therapy by a medical provider.</detailed_description>
