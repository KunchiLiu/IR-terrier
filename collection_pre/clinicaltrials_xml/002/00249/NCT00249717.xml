	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of prize-based contingency management (CM) when administered exclusively in groups. Substance dependent patients (N=360) at community-based treatment programs are randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (a) standard, non-CM treatment or (b) standard treatment plus prize CM delivered in groups. In the CM condition, patients earn the opportunity to win prizes for attending groups and submitting drug-free biological specimens. Substance use and psychosocial problems are measured at intake, month 1, month 3 (post treatment), and at 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up evaluations. We also assess patient characteristics that may be associated with improved outcomes within and across conditions.</brief_summary>
