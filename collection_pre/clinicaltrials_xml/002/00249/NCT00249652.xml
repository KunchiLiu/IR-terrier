	<brief_title>Transplant and Addiction Project (TAP) - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants who need a liver or renal transplant and who are ineligible due to current or recent (past 6 months) alcohol and/or other drug abuse are being recruited from the transplant programs at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center (renal), Columbia Presbyterian Hospital (renal/liver) and Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center (liver). Baseline and follow-up computer-assisted assessments and structured clinical interviews along with collection of biological samples (urine, hair) will occur in the transplant clinics; however, phone counseling sessions originate at St. Luke's. Participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatments: (1) usual care (no phone counseling) or (2) usual care + counseling. The telephone counseling sessions are designed to help participants become motivated to remain abstinent and improve other health behaviors such as sleep or stress management.</detailed_description>
