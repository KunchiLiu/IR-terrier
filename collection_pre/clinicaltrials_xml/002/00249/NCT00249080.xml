	<brief_summary>Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis are recognized as a major health concern at the present time. There is information in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies regarding the role of brain iron in normal brain aging that may be enhanced with the use of better scanning equipment and procedures, and by correlating this information with clinical data. This research study aims to develop and evaluate a number of techniques that can potentially improve the effectiveness of three tesla (3T) magnetic resonance imaging of neurodegenerative brain disorders.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligibility: A healthy person without memory complaints or someone with neurodegenerative disease. However, the person should not have metal in the body (ie, pacemaker, implants, shrapnel, etc.), should not be pregnant, and should not have claustrophobic anxieties. Study Procedures: During a regular office visit, a neurologist will perform a routine physical and neurological examination, including your medical and family history, to determine your eligibility for this study. You will then be scheduled for a series of neuropsychological tests, which take between 1 to 1.5 hours, and an MRI scan, which takes approximately 1 hour to complete. This is a longitudinal study and you may be asked to repeat these procedures approximately every six months for the duration of this 2 year project.</detailed_description>
