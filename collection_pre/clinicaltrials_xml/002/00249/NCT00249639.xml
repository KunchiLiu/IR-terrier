	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a low-cost contingency management procedure as compared to standard treatment. Using a cross-over design, CM is implemented at different community-based clinics and compared with non-CM in the same facilities. Research staff collects information regarding patients' demographic characteristics, attendance, and outcomes at the clinics. During Phase A (non-CM), standard clinical practice is in place. During Phase B (CM), all patients have the chance to win prizes by coming to treatment. Each participating clinic is randomly assigned to receive either the A or B phase first; each phase is in effect for 16 weeks.</brief_summary>
