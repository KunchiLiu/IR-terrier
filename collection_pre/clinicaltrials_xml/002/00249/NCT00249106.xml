	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and immune response to a investigational DNA Plasmid HIV vaccine, ADVAX e/g + ADVAX p/n-t (ADVAX), at three different dosage levels, in adults who are not infected with HIV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity of a Plasmid HIV Vaccine in HIV Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a dose escalation trial. Study site staff and volunteers will be blinded, blinding will not apply to the assignment of dose levels (low, middle or high). Volunteers will be screened up to 42 days before vaccination and will be followed for 18 months after the first vaccination. 15 volunteers will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio of active vaccine to placebo. Safety and tolerability of the ADVAX e/g + ADVAX p/n-t investigational product will be evaluated at least 14 days after the tenth volunteer in the lower dosage group receives the second injection before proceeding to the nextdosage group.</detailed_description>

Written informed consent needs to be given before any studyrelated procedures are performed; Willing to undergo HIV testing and counseling, and receive HIV test results; If sexually active female, using an effective method of contraception from screening until at least 4 months after last vaccination, and willing to undergo urine pregnancy test. If sexually active male, willing to use an effective method of contraception from screening until 4 months after the last vaccination. Clinically relevant abnormality on history or examination including history of immunodeficiency or use of systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive, antiviral, anticancer, or other medications considered significant by the designated trial physician in last 6 months; Any acute or chronic medical condition requiring care of a physician (e.g.,, diabetes, coronary artery disease, rheumatologic illness, malignancy, substance abuse) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation; Any of the following abnormal laboratory parameters that are moderate, severe, or very severe: haematology (hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, absolute CD4/CD8 count, platelets); urinalysis, biochemistries (total bilirubin, creatinine, AST, ALT). Volunteers with mild laboratory abnormalities that are judged by the principal investigator or designee to be not clinically significant may be enrolled. Reported high risk behaviour for HIV infection, defined as: Had unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a known HIV infected person or a casual partner (i.e., no continuing established relationship) within 6 months before vaccination Engaged in sex work for money or drugs within 6 months before vaccination Used injection drugs (illicit), or Acquired an STD within 6 months before vaccination ; If female, pregnant or planning a pregnancy within 4 months after last vaccination or lactating; Receipt of blood transfusion or blood products 6 months prior to vaccination; Receipt of a live attenuated vaccine (other than influenza) within 30 days or other vaccine within 14 days of vaccination; Participation in another clinical trial of an investigational product currently or within past 12 weeks or expected participation during this study; Receipt of another experimental HIV vaccine at any time; Infected with HIV1 or HIV2 as indicated by ELISA and/or RTPCR; History of severe local or systemic reaction to vaccination or history of severe allergic reactions; Confirmed diagnosis of hepatitis B (surface antigen, HbsAg); hepatitis C (HCV antibodies) or active syphillis; History of grandmal epilepsy, or currently taking antiepileptics; In the opinion of the investigator, unlikely to comply with protocol.</criteria>
