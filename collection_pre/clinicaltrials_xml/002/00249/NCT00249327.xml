	<brief_summary>This is an evaluation of the effect that an online live action, dramatic vignette about four gay men, two HIV positive and two HIV negative, struggling with the responsibility for safer sex has on the sexual behavior and HIV testing intentions of the gay/bisexual men who watch the vignette and participate in the evaluation study. The primary hypothesis is that men will be more likely to: 1)express the intent to have an HIV test and 2) to express the intent to inform their sex partners of their HIV status after watching the vignette. The secondary hypothesis is that men will be more likely to follow through on these intentions in the three months following the intervention than they were in the three months before viewing the vignette. This is a one group pre-posttest intervention in which each man serves as his own control.</brief_summary>
