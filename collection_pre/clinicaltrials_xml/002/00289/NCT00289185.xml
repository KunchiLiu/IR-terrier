	<brief_summary>GSK Biologicals in partnership with the Malaria Vaccine Initiative at PATH is developing a candidate malaria vaccine GSK 257049 for the routine immunization of infants and children living in malaria endemic areas. The vaccine would offer protection against malaria disease due to the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The vaccine would also provide protection against infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). In order to integrate the malaria vaccine into the EPI regimen in malaria-endemic regions, a new variant RTS,S/AS02D (0.5 mL dose) has been developed. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Safety, Immunogenicity and Efficacy of a Candidate Malaria Vaccine in Tanzanian Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 2b trial designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of RTS,S/AS02D when co-administered with a multivalent DTPw/Hib (Aventis Pasteur's TETRActHib vaccine). Infants randomized to the control group will receive a licensed hepatitis B vaccine, Engerix-B in place of RTS,S/AS02D. Data pertaining to RTS,S/AS02D or Engerix-B will be collected in a double blinded manner; data relating to TETRActHib will be collected in an open fashion. Oral polio vaccine (OPV) will be administered at birth, 8, 12, 16 weeks in co-administration with other vaccines and will not be administered as part of this protocol. Antibody titers to OPV will not be assessed as part of this protocol.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: A male or female infant between 6 and 10 weeks of age at the time of first vaccination. Written or oral, signed or thumbprinted and witnessed informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/guardian(s) of the child. Subjects who the investigator believes that their parents/guardians can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g. return for followup visits). Born to a mother who is HBsAg negative &amp; HIV negative. Born after a normal gestation period (between 36 and 42 weeks). Subjects who live within a 5 km radius of a dispensary. Exclusion criteria: Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Serious acute or chronic illness determined by clinical or physical examination and laboratory screening tests. Laboratory screening tests out of range for haemoglobin, total white cell count, platelets, ALT and creatinine. Previous vaccination with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (wholecell or acellular), Hemophilus influenzae type b or hepatitis B vaccines. BCG administration within one week of proposed administration of a study vaccine. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days of the first dose of vaccine(s). Use of any investigational or nonregistered drug or vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Administration of immunoglobulins, blood transfusions or other blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Previous participation in any other malaria vaccine trial. Simultaneous participation in any other clinical trial. Same sex twin. Maternal death. History of allergic reactions (significant IgEmediated events) or anaphylaxis to previous immunizations. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Any other findings that the investigator feels would increase the risk of having an adverse outcome from participation in the trial.</criteria>
