	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out if specialized programs in the AT500 and EnRhythm pacemakers will reduce the number of irregular heartbeat in the upper chamber of the heart and reduce symptoms (such as shortness of breath, dizziness, and others).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reducing Episodes by Septal Pacing Efficacy Confirmation Trial (RESPECT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study was to confirm the AT500 intervention pacing effectiveness data previously seen in the ASPECT clinical trial and to gather additional data to understand the effectiveness of the intervention pacing features. Specifically, the goal of the trial is to demonstrate a reduction in frequency in symptomatic atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation recurrence with the intervention pacing features in patients with a pacing indication and a history of atrial tachyarrhythmias with atrial pacing leads located in the region of Bachmann's Bundle.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects with fast and/or slow heartbeats who are in need of dual chamber pacing (pacing in both the atria and ventricles) as determined by their doctor. Subjects who have a history of occasional fast heartbeats originating from the upper heart chambers. Subjects who have experienced at least two symptomatic episodes of fast heartbeats three months prior to enrollment. Subjects that are expected to stay on the same heart medications during the length study. Subjects who have permanent (chronic) or persistent (not selfterminating) atrial fibrillation (fast heartbeats originating from the upper heart chambers). Subjects who have atrial fibrillation due to a reversible cause, i.e. electrolyte imbalance. Subjects who are current or immediate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) recipients.</criteria>
