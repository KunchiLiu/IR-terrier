	<brief_title>The Study to Compare the Treatment of Angioplasty and Stents in SFA Occlusions.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center prospective, randomized, two-arm study evaluating performance of the Cordis SMART™ nitinol self-expanding stent as compared to balloon angioplasty only. Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis. It is anticipated that a total of 120 patients will be entered into the study. The study population will consist of symptomatic peripheral vascular disease patients with SFA occlusions. The disease will consist of symptomatic, long de novo or restenotic occlusions (5 - 14.5 cm) on diagnostic imaging with a history of at least 6 months. The occlusions must not extend beyond the proximal popliteal artery. For the purpose of this protocol, no lesion within 3 cm of the upper part of the patella may be treated. The distal popliteal artery must be patent with no hemodynamic stenosis as well as two calf vessels. Reference vessel diameter must be &gt;= 4.0 to &lt;= 6.0 mm. Trial participants will be randomized to the SMART™ nitinol self-expanding stent or to balloon angioplasty only. Patients will be followed for twelve months post-procedure. Study examinations will be done at screening, procedure time, discharge, six, and twelve months post procedure. This study will be conducted at 8 investigational sites in The Netherlands.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Symptomatic leg ischemia by Rutherford Classification (category 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5); duration of intermittent claudication (category 13) should be at least 6 months 2. The patient should be suitable for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and also for stenting. 1. Poor aortoiliac or common femoral "inflow", which would be deemed inadequate to support a femoropopliteal bypass graft. 2. Patient having total occlusions or severe stenosis of the iliac artery on the same side must be excluded. 3. Gangrene in index limb (Rutherford category 6).</criteria>
