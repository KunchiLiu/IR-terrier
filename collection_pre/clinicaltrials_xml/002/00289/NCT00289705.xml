	<brief_title>Surgical Intervention for Morbidly Obese Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe obesity in the adolescence is a major concern since there is a constant rise in prevalence worldwide. There is a need of effective tools to treat those patients since the natural course with conservative treatment is very pessimistic. I. e. most of the subjects having a BMI &gt;40kg/m2 in the adolescence will remain morbidly obese also in their adult life. The three largest centres in Sweden treating obese children (Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm√∂) will offer patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria to be operated with laparoscopic gastric bypass. If not willing to be operated they could join the study as a control case. Subjects will be investigated at the baseline concerning physical health status and existence of medical risk factors but also regarding their quality of life, eating habits and physical activity. They will subsequently be follow over a ten year period regarding these variables.</detailed_description>
