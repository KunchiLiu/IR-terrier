	<brief_summary>SPECIFIC AIM: To test the safety and feasibility of using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH, enoxaparin sodium; Lovenox, Sanofi-Aventis) in lieu of unfractionated heparin (UFH) as antithrombotic therapy for patients in atrial fibrillation undergoing transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guided chemical or electrical cardioversion to sinus rhythm. HYPOTHESIS: Early cardioversion from atrial fibrillation can be safely performed using a short-term anticoagulation strategy of low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox, Sanofi-Aventis) compared to unfractionated heparin, accompanied by a TEE examination prior to cardioversion. The use of LMWH with TEE will result in a safe, cost-effective, and possible efficacious approach to cardioversion of atrial fibrillation compared to UFH with TEE.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with chronic or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation of &gt; 2 days duration who are candidates for early chemical or electrical cardioversion Patients with atrial flutter with a documented history (electrocardiography) of atrial fibrillation Males and females 18 years of age or older Patients have available results of routine clinical labs for standard clinical chemistry and complete blood count within the previous 14 days An INR &gt; 1.4 in patients who have received warfarin prior to enrollment. Use of IV heparin for more than 72 hours immediately prior to randomization. Patients with contraindications to TEE, such as dysphagia, or esophageal strictures. Patients who will need anticoagulation discontinued because of elective intervening procedure, such as cardiac catheterization or surgery. Patients with contraindications to warfarin or heparin Patients who require concomitant therapy during the study period with any drug known to affect coagulation or platelet function (i.e. ASA, NSAID, antiplatelet drugs) Women of childbearing potential, unless pregnancy can be excluded by medical history incompatible with pregnancy or by serum or urine beta HCG levels. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable and thus may require immediate cardioversion.
