	<brief_summary>The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate MBCP performance in bone regeneration after osteonecrosis biopsy of the femur head. This technic may prevent the neck of the femur bone weakness following the healthy area drilling, thanks to a bone reconstruction at the expense of the biomaterial.</brief_summary>
