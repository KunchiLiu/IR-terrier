	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to determine whether candesartan, compared to placebo reduces the progression of diabetic retinopathy in normoalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients with retinopathy. The secondary objective is to determine whether candesartan, compared to placebo, reduces the incidence of clinically significant macular oedema (CSME) and/or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and beneficially influences the rate change in urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER). This study is part of the DIRECT Programme also including a primary prevention study of diabetic retinopathy in type 1 diabetes and a secondary prevention study in type 1 diabetes. The primary objective for all three pooled studies is to determine whether candesartan, compared to placebo, reduces the incidence of microalbuminuria in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female aged 37 75 years with type 2 diabetes diagnosed at age of 36 years or thereafter. Duration of diabetes for &gt; 1 year and &lt; 20 years with stable diabetic therapy within last 6 months. Patients with untreated resting mean sitting SBP &lt; 130 mmHg and mean sitting DBP &lt; 85 or treated resting mean SBP &lt; 160 mmHg and mean sitting DBP &lt; 90 mmHg with retinal photograph grading level &gt;20/10 up to &lt; 47/47 (on ETDRS severity scale). Patients with the following conditions are excluded from participation in the study: Cataract or media opacity of a degree which precludes taking gradable retinal photographs Angle closure glaucoma, which precludes pharmacological dilatation of the pupil History of or presence of proliferative retinopathy History or presence of clinical significant macular oedema (CSME) History or evidence of photocoagulation of the retina Other retinal conditions which may mask assessment, eg, retinal vein occlusion Positive micral dipstick test Presence of secondary diabetes Pregnant or lactating women or women of child bearing potential not practicing an adequate method of contraception Need of treatment with ACEinhibitor Haemodynamically significant aortic or mitral valve stenosis Known renal artery stenosis or kidney transplantation Hypersensitivity to study drug Severe concomitant disease which may interfere with the assessment of the patient, eg, malignancy, as judged by the investigator</criteria>
