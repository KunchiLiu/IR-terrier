	<brief_summary>This is a 24-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-center, placebo-controlled study of tesaglitazar (0.5 and 1 mg) in patients with type 2 diabetes, not adequately controlled on diet and lifestyle advice alone during the run-in period. The study comprises a 6-week single-blind placebo run-in period, followed by 24-week treatment period and a 3-week follow-up period. The study design of GALLANT 2 is identical to GALLANT 22; the blinded study data from GALLANT 2 will be transferred to the GALLANT 22 database and will be analyzed together with the data from GALLANT 22 clinical study.</brief_summary>
