	<brief_summary>Children and adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) very commonly experience difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep. Studies have shown that daytime sleepiness resulting from insufficient sleep can affect attention and learning. Therefore, treating insomnia in children with ADHD may not only improve sleep, but it could potentially improve ADHD symptoms as well. The main purpose of this study is to examine the effects of atomoxetine on ADHD-related insomnia. Atomoxetine (StratteraÂ®) is a non-stimulant drug used to treat ADHD symptoms in both children and adults, and there is evidence that it may also have a positive effect on sleep in children with ADHD. During the study, participants will receive either atomoxetine or placebo for a period of four weeks. We expect that the effects of atomoxetine on sleep will differ from those of placebo, with atomoxetine having a greater effect on improving sleep difficulties.</brief_summary>
