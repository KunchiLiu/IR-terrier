	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare the effects of a modified form (AutoVPAP) of the VPAP non-invasive ventilator versus standard VPAP ventilation on sleep quality and breathing during sleep in stable patients with nocturnal hypoventilation due to restrictive ventilatory disorders (eg. neuromuscular disease or chest wall disorder).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients aged 1880 years Nocturnal hypoventilation (nocturnal peak transcutaneous PCO2 &gt; 6.5 kPa when breathing spontaneously) with Congenital neuromuscular disease (eg. Duchenne muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy), acquired neuromuscular disease (eg. old polio, bilateral diaphragm paralysis) or chest wall disease (eg. idiopathic scoliosis, thoracoplasty) Recruited from 1300 patients attending Royal Brompton Hospital Lind ward ventilator clinic. All patients will be familiar with noninvasive ventilation use but currently using a ventilator which is not a VPAP model eg. BiPAP Harmony, Breas PV403. Able to understand treatment and protocol Unstable respiratory failure (PaO2 &lt; 7.5 kPa, PaCO2 &gt; 8.0 kPa, Uncontrolled heart failure or arrhythmia Moderate or severe bulbar weakness. Unable to understand treatment or protocol</criteria>
