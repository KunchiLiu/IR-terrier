	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that flax oil, as an omega-3 fatty acid, will be superior to placebo in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents. Our primary objective was to determine if flax oil is efficacious in the pediatric bipolar population for reducing symptoms of mania and depression. A secondary objective was to examine fatty acid levels as predictors of treatment response and symptom severity. This clinical trial evaluated whether supplementation with flax oil, containing the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-LNA), safely reduced symptom severity in youth with bipolar disorder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Children and Adolescents With Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric bipolar disorder is a difficult-to-treat recurrent mental illness characterized by a predominant mood state of irritability, and often mixed, rapid-cycling, and psychotic symptoms. Results of randomized controlled trials of lithium, valproic acid, and antipsychotics for early onset bipolar disorder offer hope of improvement for many, yet also demonstrate need for additional treatment options for those children who do not respond adequately to, or cannot tolerate, a first-line mood stabilizer alone or in combination with an atypical antipsychotic. As popular over-the-counter dietary supplements, omega-3 fatty acids represent an appealing option for treatment in the younger bipolar population as they are likely to be better tolerated and cost less compared with conventional mood stabilizing agents. In addition, they have appeal to parents and adolescents due to their perception as a 'natural' substance and relative lack of systemic side effects. To our knowledge, there are no prospective, randomized, controlled trials of flax oil for the treatment of bipolar disorder or selectively evaluating omega-3 fatty acids in the child and adolescent bipolar population. Children and adolescents aged 6-17 years with symptomatic Bipolar I or II disorder (n=51), manic, hypomanic, mixed, or depressed, were randomized to either flax oil capsules containing 550 mg alpha-linolenic acid per 1 gram or an olive oil placebo adjunctively or as monotherapy. Doses were titrated to 12 capsules per day as tolerated over 16 weeks. Primary outcomes included changes in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Child Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R), and Clinical Global Impressions- Bipolar (CGI-BP) ratings using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Baseline and end-of-study free fatty acids were measured and examined for change and relevance to effect.</detailed_description>
