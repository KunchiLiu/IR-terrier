	<detailed_description>Patients with perianal fistulae of Crohn's disease will be prospectively enrolled and receive 3 doses of Infliximab. If reduction of fistula associated discharge of at least 50% will be recorded, commercially available fibrin glue will be instilled into the fistula tract using standard surgical techniques. The patients will be followed for 6 months for fistula healing and complications.</detailed_description>
