	<brief_title>Fitness and Exercise for People With Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is evidence that people with arthritis who participate in appropriate types of physical activity can improve physical function and pain management. Most existing programs focus on improving flexibility and balance. Less attention has been paid to conditioning and overall functional fitness. To address some of these concerns, this study will develop, evaluate, and implement a non-aquatic physical activity program to increase health-related functional fitness in community-dwelling adults with arthritis. Specific goals are: 1. To develop a systematic and progressive program (FEPA: Functional Exercise for Persons with Arthritis) that integrates muscular and aerobic conditioning, balance and trunk/pelvic stabilization exercises emphasizing joint-protective, multi-plane movement patterns that mimic those used in everyday activities. 2. Implement the FEPA program in an ethnically diverse, low SES community sample of older adults with arthritis. 3. Conduct process, outcomes and impact evaluations to assess the effectiveness of the FEPA program for increasing short- and immediate-term health and functional fitness outcomes. 4. Evaluate the sustainability of the FEPA program through a program logic model process and identify inputs, activities and outputs that contribute to successful program implementation and the building of community capacity to support long-term program maintenance.</detailed_description>
