	<brief_title>Preliminary Administration of EPO and Markers of Cardiac Ischemia Induced by CPB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new property of erythropoietin (EPO), independent of its hematopoietic role, has recently been discovered. Indeed, it has been reported that this hormone, following binding to its cardiac or cerebral receptors, is able to induce a spectacular cellular protection against ischemic injury. These cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects have been observed experimentally in rodents as well as clinically in humans. In particular, our team has demonstrated that the administration of NeoRecormon® protects the heart against ischemia in the rat by significantly improving its recovery. In view of these exciting experimental results and of the growing interest of the scientific community for cytoprotective effects of EPO, we are planning the first clinical study examining the cardiac and cerebral protective effects of EPO (NeoRecormon®) in the setting of cardiac surgery.</detailed_description>
