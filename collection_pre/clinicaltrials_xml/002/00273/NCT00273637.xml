	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to better characterize peripartum cardiomyoapthy or pregnancy-related cardiomyopathy by enrolling as many PPCM survivors as possible using both direct and web-based methods of recritment. Patients will anser a questionnaire regarding the onset, progression, treatment and follow-up of their diagnosis as well as the psychosocial aspects of PPCM.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The design of our study will utilize web-based recruitment methods with internet-based support groups for PPCM e.g. www.AMothersHeart.org (www.amothersheart.org/index.html). The directors of these websites will facilitate contact between our research staff and the several hundred members of these web sites. An introductory letter will be posted on the website introducing the cardiovascular research team and describing the purpose, basic methods, and goals of our study. Website members who desire to participate can respond to a dedicated e-mail address we have set up and provide contact information so that we may get informed consent via telephone or mailed written consent. A telephone number will also be provided for participants so that they may call with questions regarding the study. Patients will then receive a questionnaire addressing our study goals. Questions will focus on obtaining family and social history, characterizing presenting symptoms, initial management, and clinical course following delivery of the fetus including extent of cardiovascular follow-up, date of echocardiograms performed, medications, and psychosocial support, if provided.</detailed_description>
