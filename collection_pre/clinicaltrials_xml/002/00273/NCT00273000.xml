	<brief_title>The Importance of Glucagon-Like Peptide-2 (GLP-2)in Mesenteric Bloodflow in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigation will include 10 testpersons. It will be a 2 fase study over 2 days. day 1: The testperson will meet fasting, and take in a standard liquid meal, after this the bloodflow in a mesenteric artery will be measured by use of ultrasonic technique. Bloodsamples will be taken regular in a total wolumne of 200 ml. day 2:The testperson will meet fasting, there wil be administered intraveneous GLP-2 in 3 increasing doses over 3 x 45 min.and one subcutaneous dose. During this the bloodflow in a mesenteric artery will be measured by use of ultrasonic technique. Bloodsamples will be taken regular in a total wolumne of 200 ml.</detailed_description>
