	<brief_title>Trial to Evaluate Steady State Pharmacokinetic Parameters, Efficacy and Safety of Nevirapine in Antiretroviral Drug naïve Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomised open label multi-centre trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety parameters of nevirapine 150mg/m2 and nevirapine 4 or 7mg/kg when administered in combination with ZDV and 3TC for 48 weeks in antiretroviral naive pediatric patients. Primary objective: To evaluate steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of nevirapine 150mg/m2 in antiretroviral drug naive pediatric patients. Secondary objective: To assess efficacy and safety of nevirapine 150 mg/m2 and nevirapine 4/7mg/kg after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment Study Hypothesis: Evaluation of recent pharmacokinetic data has suggested that a dose based on body surface area rather than body weight might be a better therapeutic regimen to achieve steady state plasma concentrations. The goal in this study was to determine if a Nevirapine suspension dose of 150 mg/m2 BID, following a two week lead-in of 150 mg/m2 QD, produces plasma nevirapine steady state concentrations of 4 - 6 ?g/mL in all age groups as was observed in adult safety and efficacy trials.
