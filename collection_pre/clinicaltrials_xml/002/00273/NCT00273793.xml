	<brief_summary>Incentives can be used to facilitate the acquisition of many healthy behaviors, such as smoking cessation. However, there is much room for improvement in the use of incentives. This study investigates how two aspects of providing incentives influence the effectiveness of using incentives to promote smoking cessation. One aspect is the criterion for providing incentives, e.g., whether to require smoking cessation before providing an incentive or to provide incentives following smoking reductions. The other aspect being investigated is whether it is best to use a fixed incentive amount or an amount that increases with continued cessation success.</brief_summary>
