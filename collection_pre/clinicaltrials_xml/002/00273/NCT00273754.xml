	<brief_summary>This is a research study using caffeine in children who have an obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA means children who stop breathing during their sleep due to obstruction in their airway. The purpose of this study is to determine whether caffeine when given in the vein, will wake children up faster and decrease post-anesthesia airway obstruction, as well as the safety and if the drug agrees with the child compared to a placebo (an inactive or dummy agent).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Caffeine on Postextubation Adverse Respiratory Events in Children With Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with OSA are reported to have a higher rate of severe respiratory complications associated with upper airway obstruction during anesthesia and sedation or immediately after anesthesia. Children with OSA (especially those under three years of age, those with severe OSA, cerebral palsy or craniofacial anomalies) are at increased risks for post-operative complications, and require careful monitoring post-operatively. Although the etiology of obstructive sleep apnea is mainly obstruction due to anatomical and neuromuscular abnormalities, we believe that a central element may contribute to OSA. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether administration of caffeine to children with OSA, scheduled for elective T &amp; A under general anesthesia contributes to a faster recovery, less post-operative complications, and a shorter stay in the PACU, DSU and the hospital.</detailed_description>
