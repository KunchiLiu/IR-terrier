	<detailed_description>Neosaxitoxin is a phycotoxins that reversible block the voltage-gated sodium channels at neuronal level. Its activity is express as blocking the axonal conduction, stopping the propagation of the nerve impulse. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the neosaxitoxin efficacy and safety as local anesthetic in a human trial Methods: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, with 10 healthy volunteers. The anesthetic effect will be evaluated using a standardized human sensory and pain model. TSA Neurosensory analyser and Von Frey Technique will be used to evaluate five parameters: sensory threshold for warm and cold, pain thresholds for heat and cold and mechanical touch perception threshold.</detailed_description>
