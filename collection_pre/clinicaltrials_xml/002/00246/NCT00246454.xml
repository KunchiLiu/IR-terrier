	<brief_title>Circadian Rhythms and Sleep in Familial DSPS and ASPS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Tremendous progress in the past few years has led to the identification of several circadian clock genes. This now makes it possible to determine how alterations of human circadian clock genes and their expression could lead to differences in circadian and sleep/wake cycle phenotypes. Of particular interest for understanding genetics of the human circadian system are individuals with sleep phase disorders, such as DSPS and advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS), because recent studies indicate a genetic basis for these disorders. While it is assumed that both ASPS and DSPS are disorders of circadian timing, little is known about how the circadian clock system, or its interaction with sleep processes, are affected in these individuals. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Participants will complete questionnaires and actigraphy to determine sleep patterns and quality.</detailed_description>
