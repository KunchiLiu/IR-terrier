	<brief_summary>This study will examine how to dose Exubera (inhaled insulin) in patients who are not well controlled on two or more diabetes pills. This study should show that a large number of patients enrolled in the study can reach the target Hemoglobin A1C levels (7% or less) that have been set by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). Target goals should be achieved by adjusting the Exubera dose either weekly or twice weekly. Patients will also receive nutritional counseling and diabetes education as part of the study.</brief_summary>
