	<criteria>Chronic neck and shoulder pain for at least 6 months, refractory with other conservative treatments Presents at baseline with pain score greater than 50mm on 100mm length VAS. Pain score will be measured as overall pain over the 7 days preceding the visit during activities Active trigger point (TrP) defined as a tender spot localised in a taut band of muscle fibres associated with tenderness AND referred pain recognised by the patient into welldefined areas that are remote from the TrP area at palpation AND preferably local twitch response at palpation AND/OR jump sign at palpation Disc/bone disease History of surgery on neck Neurological deficits, neuromuscular junction disorder, Motor Neuron disease Patient has received anesthetic injections to the target trigger point within 4 weeks of study enrolment, or corticosteroid injections within 3 months Systemic inflammatory disease Hypersensitivity to Dysport速 Diffuse tender points, or diagnosed with fibromyalgia Previous electrical stimulation Previous injection of Dysport速 within 6 months of study enrolment</criteria>
