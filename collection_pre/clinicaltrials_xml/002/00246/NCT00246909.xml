	<brief_summary>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a medical condition affecting the stomach and esophagus. GERD occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter does not close properly and stomach contents leaks back (refluxes) into the esophagus. GERD is one of the most common medical disorders, with estimates of up to 50% of adults reporting reflux symptoms daily. Proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole can relieve symptoms of GERD in a large proportion of patients. Of particular interest in GERD is the assessment of symptom severity and quality of life, and the response of these parameters to treatment. Therefore, a questionnaire to assess GERD symptoms was developed (ReQuest TradeMark). An important point to consider when using such a questionnaire is to evaluate whether an observed difference in scores after a certain treatment represents a clinical effect. The aim of this study is to determine the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in patients diagnosed with GERD. During the study, the patients will complete a patient-orientated, self-assessed reflux questionnaire (ReQuest TradeMark). Endoscopy will be performed at the start of the study. The study duration consists of a baseline period (1 to 3 weeks) and a treatment period (8 weeks). During the first treatment week, the patients will receive either pantoprazole (tablet) or placebo once daily in the morning; for the following 7 treatment weeks all patients will receive pantoprazole. The study will provide further data on safety and tolerability of pantoprazole.</brief_summary>
