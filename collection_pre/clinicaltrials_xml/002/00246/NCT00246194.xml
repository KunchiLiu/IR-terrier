	<brief_title>Observational Study in Patients With Schizophrenia Treated With Long-Acting Risperidone Injection (RISPERDAL CONSTA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 2-year, prospective (a study in which the patients are identified and then followed forward in time for the outcome of the study), multi-center (at multiple sites), longitudinal (study that involves repeated observations of the same outcomes in the same people over long periods of time), observational study (study in which the investigators/ physicians observe the patients and measure their outcomes) in adults with schizophrenia (mental disorder characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and by poor emotional responsiveness). Physicians will determine the appropriate treatment for their patients, according to their usual practice. Patients starting treatment with long-acting risperidone injection (an antipsychotic medication) and meeting all the study criteria will be enrolled in the study. They will receive a dose of 25, 37.5 or 50 mg of risperidone every 2 weeks by intramuscular injection, and continue their treatment for schizophrenia according to usual care by their physicians. Patients will be asked questions at baseline and every three months for a period of two years to assess: efficacy of the medication, how well the patient is functioning, use of healthcare resources (eg, emergency room visits and hospitalizations) patient work status, quality of life and patient satisfaction with the medicine. Safety will be monitored throughout the study duration of 2 years.</detailed_description>
