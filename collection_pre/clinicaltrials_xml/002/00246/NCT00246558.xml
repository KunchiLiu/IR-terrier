	<brief_title>Tight Achilles Tendon, Hyperpronation and Anterior Knee Pains</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All students (around 300) between 16 and 18 years of age from one Gymnasium, receives a questionnaire. They are asked to answer whether they have had pain in the anterior part of their knee within the last month. If so they are invited to participate in a scientific study. An equivalent group with no pain are invited to participate as a control group. In both groups navicular drop and drift will be measured together with the dorsal flexion. The investigations are made single-blinded as the investigators do not know if the "patient" has pain or not.</detailed_description>
