	<brief_title>ULTRACET (Tramadol Hydrochloride and Acetaminophen) for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ULTRACET® (tramadol 37.5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg) as add-on therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking an NSAID or a COX-2 inhibitor. The patients will be randomized into 2 treatment groups: The first group will receive one ULTRACET® tablet 3 times per day for 7 days. The second group will receive one placebo tablet 3 times per day for 7 days. The primary efficacy measurement will be the patients' average daily pain score. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that ULTRACET® will be well tolerated and the average daily pain relief score for the ULTRACET® treatment group will be better than that of placebo group. Patients will take one ULTRACET® tablet or placebo by mouth 3 times per day, for 7 days.</detailed_description>
