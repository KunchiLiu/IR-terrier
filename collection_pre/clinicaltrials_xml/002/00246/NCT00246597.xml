	<brief_title>A Phase III Clinical Trial of PROCRIT (Epoetin Alfa) Versus Placebo in Women Undergoing Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Stage I, II or III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies of the effect of erythropoietin on rat and mouse brain suggests a neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing effect of this hormone. The objective of this study was to quantify and compare the incidence of chemotherapy-related impairment of cognitive and executive function in breast cancer patients randomized to receive PROCRIT versus placebo while receiving adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without a Taxane and to evaluate the effect of PROCRIT® on the incidence of asthenia (severe fatigue), quality of life (QoL), and mood. Patients received study medication injections (40,000 units) under their skin once every week for 12 to 24 weeks of chemotherapy. Doses were adjusted depending on the patients' hemoglobin level up to a maximum of 60,000 units.</detailed_description>
