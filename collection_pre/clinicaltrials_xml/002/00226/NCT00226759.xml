	<brief_summary>The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is an important stabilizer of the knee. Orthopedic surgeons replace the torn ligament during ACL reconstruction surgery. Surgical trauma initiates an acute inflammatory response, including swelling and pain, that leads to restricted joint motion and loss of function. OMS103HP was designed to deliver targeted therapeutic agents directly to the surgical site during the arthroscopic procedure to inhibit inflammation and pain before they can begin. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of OMS103HP in improving knee function following ACL reconstruction. Secondary benefits being evaluated include reduced postoperative pain, improvement in knee range of motion and earlier return to work.</brief_summary>
