	<brief_title>Efalizumab for Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atopic dermatitis is a common, highly pruritic, inflammatory skin disease that affects up to 17% of school-aged children. Most cases of childhood atopic dermatitis improve or resolve by adulthood. However, the majority of patients retain some features of atopic dermatitis and some continue to have severe disease that continues to adulthood. Moderate to severe atopic dermatitis cannot be adeuately controlled with topical agents. Consequently many patients are treated with systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and other immunosuppressants that carry the risk of severe atopic dermatitis is greatly needed. The chronic use of current immunosuppressive agents is limited by cumulative end-organ toxicities. We propose inhibition of T cell trafficking to the skin with Raptiva will have beneficial effects in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the full duration of the study Age &gt;= 18 years If a female of child bearing potential, a negative pregnancy test and commitment to birth control for the duration of the study are necessary. Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis using the HanifinRajka criteria Disease severity of Moderate or Severe on the RajkaLangeland Severity Score Candidate for, or previously on systemic therapy, including cyclosporine, methotrexate, ultraviolet light or other immunosuppressant. Specifically, patients are considered candidates for systemic therapy when their disease is not adequately controlled using topical therapies or sideeffects prevent the further safe use of topical therapies. Patients must meet the following washout requirements: PreStudy and Concomitant Washout Period Restriction (Baseline Therapy Restrictions Prior to Study Thru End of Study) Investigational Drugs 4 Weeks Disallowed Light Treatments 4 Weeks Disallowed Systemic corticosteroid used 4 Weeks Disallowed for atopic dermatitis flare Topical tacrolimus or 2 Weeks Disallowed pimecrolimus Topical corticosteroids Must be on stable Allowed at stable doses dose for 2 weeks (Triamcinolone ointment 0.1% only) Any systemic 4 Weeks Disallowed immunosuppressive medication Topical and systemic antibiotics Cannot be on Allowed if infection antibiotics at the develops start of study Patient's with known hypersensitivity to Raptiva (efalizumab) or any of its components Pregnant or lactating women Patients receiving immunosuppressive agents Prior enrollment in the study Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated. Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial Subjects known to be immunocompromised(lymphoma, HIV+, WiskottAldrich syndrome) Systemic corticosteroiddependent asthma Active infection of any type at the time of enrollment</criteria>
