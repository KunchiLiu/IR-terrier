	<brief_summary>Patients commonly report that they have been dreaming when they awaken from general anaesthesia. Our hypothesis is that patients who report dreaming are less deeply anaesthetised during anaesthesia than patients who do not report dreaming. Depth of anaesthesia will be determined using a processed electroencephalographic monitor (called the BIS monitor).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dreaming During Anaesthesia and Anaesthetic Depth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, we will record the depth of anaesthesia during surgery with the BIS monitor and then interview patients immediately upon emergence to determine whether they recall dreaming or not. The depth of anaesthesia of dreamers and non-dreamers will be assessed.</detailed_description>
