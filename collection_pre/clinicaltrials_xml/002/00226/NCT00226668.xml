	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of XERECEPT (human Corticotropin-Releasing Factor, or hCRF) compared to dexamethasone in patients with primary malignant glioma who require increased dexamethasone doses to control symptom of peritumoral brain edema.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>XERECEPTÂ® (hCRF) for Primary Glioma Patients Requiring Dexamethasone to Treat Peritumoral Brain Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>XERECEPT is not a potential treatment for cancer, but may reduce the edema associated with tumors and as a result, decrease neurological symptoms.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed diagnosis of a primary malignant glioma. Symptomatic peritumoral brain edema requiring initiation or increase of dexamethasone treatment. If a patient is on dexamethasone for treatment of symptomatic peritumoral brain edema, the dose must be stable and should not exceed 24mg/dl for a minimum of 7 days prior to Baseline. Presence of peritumoral brain edema confirmed by MRI scan or comparable diagnostic technology obtained within 21 days of Baseline. Capable of selfadministration of subcutaneous injections twice daily for 8 weeks or availability of assistance from caregiver. Need for surgery, radiosurgery or radiation therapy or the introduction of new chemotherapeutic regime within 2 weeks of study treatment. Systemic steroid use for any other indication than peritumoral brain edema. Patients on dexamethasone or anticonvulsant therapy. Serious concomitant cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal or endocrine metabolic disease which could put the patient at unusual risk for study participation. Central nervous system (CNS) infection. Conditions that are considered contradictions for patients to receive niacin</criteria>
