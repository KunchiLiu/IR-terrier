	<brief_summary>This is a single institution phase I / II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intratumoral CpG injections combined with local radiation in patients with mycosis fungoides. Patients will receive low-dose radiotherapy to a single tumor site on days 1 and 2 (2 Gy each day). CpG injections will be administered into the same tumor site within 24 hours before or 24 hours after each radiation treatment. Weekly doses of (intratumoral or peritumoral injections) CpG will be then administered subcutaneously in the region of previous injections for 23 additional doses. The total treatment duration is 24 weeks.</brief_summary>

Patients with active infection or with a fever &gt;38.50 C within three days prior to the first scheduled treatment. CNS metastases Prior malignancy (active within 5 years of screening) except basal cell or completely excised noninvasive squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. Prior treatment with CpG. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar composition to CPG 7909 Current anticoagulant therapy (ASA&lt;= 325mg/day allowed).
