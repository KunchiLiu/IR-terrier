	<brief_summary>The purpose of this multicenter study is to examine whether the proposed randomized treatment regime results in a significantly longer survival time and higher quality of life than any additionally applied multiple chemotherapy according to the CVD- scheme. So far neither established treatment regimes nor reliable data exist for the second-line chemotherapy of metastatic malignant melanoma. Patients are therefore mostly treated with single or multiple chemotherapeutics or/and immunomodulatory therapeutics. These regimes however imply often not only a higher toxicity but show rarely a response rate higher than 10%.</brief_summary>
