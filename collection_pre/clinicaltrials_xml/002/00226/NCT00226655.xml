	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the long-term safety and tolerability of human corticotropin-releasing factor (hCRF), XERECEPT®, in patients requiring dexamethasone (Decadron) to treat peritumoral brain edema. This open-label, extended-use study is open to all patients who participate in either of the blinded studies, NTI 0302, NTI 0303, or other designated studies, including patients who may have discontinued blinded study medication early but completed the protocol-stipulated follow-up periods.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>XERECEPT® is not a potential treatment for cancer, but may reduce the edema associated with tumors and as a result, decrease neurological symptoms.</detailed_description>

Have a Karnofsky Performance of &gt; 50 at Baseline Capable of selfadministration of subcutaneous injections twice daily or availability of assistance from caregiver. Ability to provide written informed consent or, if unable to provide, have a legal guardian or representative provide written informed consent. For women of childbearing potential: a negative serum pregnancy test at Baseline Concurrent enrollment in any investigational drug or device study, other than NTI 0302, NTI 0303, or other designated studies. Systemic steroid use for any indication other than peritumoral brain edema. Use or intended use of dexamethasone as an antiemetic during study. Clinical signs and symptoms of cerebral herniation. Serious concomitant cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal or endocrine metabolic disease which could put the patient at unusual risk during study participation. Confounding previous or concurrent neurological disorders that would interfere with adequate clinical evaluation. Clinically significant head injury or chronic seizure disorder, if the condition results in functional impairment or is likely to interfere with evaluations.(Maintenance anticonvulsant therapy is allowed) Central nervous system (CNS) infection.
