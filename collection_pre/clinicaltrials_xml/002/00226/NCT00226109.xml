	<brief_summary>Chronic alcoholics suffer from weak skeletal and cardiac muscle. The investigators have discovered a beneficial effect of spironolactone-treatment in that regard. Therefore, a double blind placebo controlled study is conducted, to examine the effects of spironolactone on cardiac and skeletal muscle-function in chronic alcoholics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Studying the Effects of Spironolactone on Heart and Skeletal Muscle Function in Chronic Alcoholics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our department has done research into skeletal muscle function in patients with liver cirrhosis. Post-hoc analyses of one of these studies suggested that treatment with spironolactone had a positive effect on muscle strength and endurance. This effect was probably caused by an increase in concentration of Na, K-pumps (sodium-potassium pumps) enabling the muscle cell perform better. To verify this finding we have designed a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial with skeletal muscle strength, -endurance, Na, K-pump content, cardiac systolic, and diastolic function as primary endpoints. Spironolactone is tested against placebo in 40 participants included among our admitted and out-clinic patients. Muscle function-tests, muscle biopsy and trans-thoracic echocardiography is performed before and after 12 weeks of treatment.</detailed_description>
