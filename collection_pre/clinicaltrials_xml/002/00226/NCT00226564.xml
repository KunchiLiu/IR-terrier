	<brief_summary>The response to opioids varies greatly among individuals. Some of these variability is accounted for by genetic factors. The present study was designed to evaluate the possibility that genetic polymorphism in the gene encoding for mu opioid receptor may explain variability in the response to alfentanil during lithotripsy.</brief_summary>
