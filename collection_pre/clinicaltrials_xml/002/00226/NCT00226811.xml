	<brief_summary>The study consisted of two parts. In Part 1 the study enrolled 38 patients (Step 1 Simon 2 step design) after which Step 2 was opened and the total enrollment target for the study (n=63) was exceeded due to a rapid enrollment (78 patients were entered). Part 2 of the study did not open due to the final overall insufficiency of efficacy observed in 78 patients. Sunitinib (SU011248) was administered orally daily for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week rest at a starting dose of 50 mg with provision for dose reduction based on tolerability. All patients received repeated cycles of sunitinib until disease progression, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria were met. After discontinuation of treatment, patients were followed up in order to collect information on further antineoplastic therapy and survival.</brief_summary>
