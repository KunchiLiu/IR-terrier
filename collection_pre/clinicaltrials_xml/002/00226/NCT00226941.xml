	<criteria>Patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the rectum: EUS stage T3 or T4 or N1 disease are eligible (includes T3 N0, T3 N1, T4 N0, T4 N1, T14 N1). Rectal cancers will be defined as those whose distal border extends to within 12cm of the anal verge. Age &gt;= 18. Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 70. Creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance &gt; 60mL/min/1.73m2 for patients with serum creatinine levels above institutional normal. Negative urine pregnancy test if a woman of child bearing potential (WOCBP). WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours prior to the start of study medication. WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the treatment. Ability to swallow pills without difficulty. No prior pelvic or whole abdominal radiotherapy. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below: Leukocyte count &gt; 3,500. Platelet count &gt; 100,000. SGOT, SGPT, Alk. Phos: &lt; 2.5x institutional upper limits of normal. Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5x institutional normal institutional limits. Metastatic (M1) or stage IV disease. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Patients with a concurrent malignancy or previous malignancy within 5 years of screening will be excluded from this study; with the exception of patients with concurrent or previous nonmelanoma skin cancer, hematolymphoid malignancy or carcinoma insitu of the cervix, who may be included at the investigator's discretion. WOCBP who is pregnant or breastfeeding. A history of C225 or other therapy that targeted the EGF receptor. A history of prior anticancer murine monoclonal antibody therapy. Inability to sign written consent. WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for up to 4 weeks after the study. Subjects who are men must also agree to use effective contraception.</criteria>
