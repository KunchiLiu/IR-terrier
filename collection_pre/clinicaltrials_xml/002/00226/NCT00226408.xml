	<brief_summary>The study protocol is being conducted to compare intermittent high-dose i.v. administation of interferon alpha-2b with the standard high-dose treatment by Kirkwood with distant metastasis free survival (DMFI) as a primary endpoint.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standard High-Dose Alpha Interferon Versus Intermittent High-Dose Alpha Interferon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arm A: Interferon-alpha-2b 20 MIU/m2 for 4 weeks. 5 days a week i.v followed by 48 weeks of treatment with 3 x 10 MIU/m2 s.c Arm B: Interferon-alpha-2b 20 MIU/m2 for 4 weeks. 5 days a week i.v repeated 3 times with 12 treatment-free-weeks between the cycles Secondary endpoints: Improved overall survival rate, Assess side effects of therapy in both treatment arms, Assess time spent on sick leave, Assess number of treatment-related days in hospital, Assess overall performance status, Assess blood MX protein levels</detailed_description>
