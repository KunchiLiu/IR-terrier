	<brief_summary>The study aims to demonstrate that dexmedetomidine is non-inferior to current best practice sedation with propofol/midazolam and daily sedation stops, in maintaining a target depth of sedation in long-stay intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and that dexmedetomidine, compared with current best practice, reduces the length of ICU stay.</brief_summary>
