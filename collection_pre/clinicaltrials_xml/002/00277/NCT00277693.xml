	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Protective Effect of Spironolactone in Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular complications are common in dialysis patients and comprise up to 50% of deaths in end-stage renal disease population. Hypertension and left ventricle hypertrophy occur in more than 70% of patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis therapy, and both contributes to mortality and morbidity.Recent clinical trials in chronic heart failure and post miocardial infarct heart failure patients have demonstrated a beneficial effect of a mineralocorticoid receptor blocker spironolactone, in adittion to standard therapy (RALES AND EPHESUS studies). The aim of the present study is to evaluate spironolactone treatment in hemodialysis patients.</detailed_description>
