	<detailed_description>In 2004, the Cardiac Cath Lab at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta was asked to conduct a Quality Improvement Review examining radiation exposure. To perform radiological procedures with minimal radiation exposure and to ensure safe care during catheterization procedures, we conducted a chart review of all patients requiring fluoroscopy in the lab during the period of January - June, 2004. â€¢ Based on our Retrospective Review, we were able to present Our New Standards to the Cardiac Cath Lab Committee at the end of June, 2004 with the following: 1. Diagnostic procedure time decreased from 45 minutes standard to 30 minutes standard. 2. Intervention and Electrophysiology procedure time reduced from 90 minutes to 45 minutes.</detailed_description>
