	<brief_summary>Children with HLHS have a history of poor enteral intake and growth. Over the past several years a modification to the Norwood operation was instituted (RV to PA shunt in place of the standard Blalock-Taussig shunt). The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether children who underwent this modification of the Norwood procedure had improved growth compared to those in past years who underwent traditional Norwood.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether children who underwent this modification of the Norwood procedure had improved growth compared to those in past years who underwent traditional Norwood. Also, the standard of care has changed to GT/Nissen operation to facilitate "safe" feeding in those patients who are not able to feed by mouth (po feed). A second aim of this study is to evaluate whether children who are GT fed have improved growth compared to those who are not. We wish to review all patients who underwent Norwood procedure from January 1, 2001 to March 31, 2005.</detailed_description>
