	<brief_summary>Several lipid disorders are without known genetic origin. The scope of this project is to sequence genes superior involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in patients with severe lipid disorders. The resulting mutations will be tested in suitable in vitro systems to detect their part in development of the specific disease.</brief_summary>
