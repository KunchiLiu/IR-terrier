	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study are to determine whether a test dose program for taxanes will reduce the rate and/or severity of hypersensitivity reactions (HSR); and to determine whether a test dose program for taxanes will result in cost reduction due to decreased drug wastage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase III Randomized Trial Assessing the Utility of a Test Dose Program With Taxanes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized on to one of two arms: 1. Test dose arm 1 mg paclitaxel or docetaxel test dose is prepared in 3 ml of normal saline and administered over two to five minutes IV push at least 30 minutes after prescribed IV and PO pre-medications. If no discernable adverse reaction ensues, the balance of the taxane dose is prepared and administered as per standard or specific chemotherapy protocol. 2. Non test dose arm The full taxane dose is prepared and administered as per standard or specific chemotherapy protocol, at least 30 minutes after prescribed IV and PO pre-medications.</detailed_description>
