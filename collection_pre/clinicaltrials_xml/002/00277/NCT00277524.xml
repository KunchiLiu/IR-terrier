	<brief_summary>The purpose of the OMNI study is to characterize therapy and diagnostic utilization in study participants implanted with study devices and to describe Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator(ICD)therapy utilization for life threatening arrhythmias in primary and secondary prevention study participants. This study will assess therapies in Medtronic pacemaker, defibrillator, and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices. The first therapy is for reducing unnecessary pacing in pacemaker patients. The second therapy provides pacing therapy in an attempt to stop fast or life threatening ventricular arrhythmias in lieu of delivering a defibrillation shock. The third therapy is a diagnostic measurement of a patient's fluid status and provides the physician information on the patient's heart failure status. The study will also assess the time to a patient's first defibrillation shock and will verify that the shock was for a fast or life threatening ventricular rhythm.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The OMNI results demonstrate the importance of Medtronic's ongoing efforts to increase adoption of evidence based shock-reduction programming strategies. Longer VF NID (number of intervals to detect in the VF zone) should be utilized with the Anti-tachycardia Pacing (ATP) During Charging Feature. ATP during Charging allows physicians to treat with ATP without delay to shock. Therefore, VF NID may be extended to allow episodes the chance to self-terminate immediately to shock by use of the ATP during the charging feature.</detailed_description>
