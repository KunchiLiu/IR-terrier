	<brief_title>In-Home Weight Loss Program for Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Delivered by Interactive Cable Television Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority of patients with Type 2 Diabetes are obese and weight loss is known to improve diabetes outcomes and reduce the need for anti-diabetic medical. The overall goal of this study is to explore the human engineering issues of a home (non-clinical) telehealth system, Healthium, utilizing an interactive television system over a broadband connection. The study seeks to demonstrate a convenient, intuitive and inexpensive way to conduct large-scale interventions related to obesity and nutrition. This could lead to a viable public health care initiative for prevention of chronic diseases such as diabetes. The specific aims to be addressed are Aim #1: To transfer a successful internet-based weight loss program onto the Healthium interactive platform and further develop the intervention for use in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Aim #2: To conduct focus groups to determine consumer acceptability of the convenience and intuitiveness of the Healthium interface. Aim #3: To perform a pilot study in patients with Type 2 diabetes to determine whether the Healthium interface improves weight loss and diabetes outcomes relative to standard clinic-based treatment over a period of 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
