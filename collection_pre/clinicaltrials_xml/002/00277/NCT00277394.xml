	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to compare the safety of innohep® and Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) in terms of clinically relevant bleedings in elderly patients with impaired renal function for initial treatment of acute Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT). The primary response criterion is the percentage of patients with clinically relevant bleeding events prior to day 90 +/- 5.</brief_summary>
