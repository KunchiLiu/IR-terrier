	<brief_title>A Study of the Prevalence of Headache in Epileptic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Headache is often ignored as a symptom of epileptic seizures. The purpose of this survey is to investigate the prevalence, characteristics and classification of seizure-associated headaches and non-seizure-associated headaches in epileptic patients in Korea, according the criteria of the International Headache Society 2004. In this survey, 577 consecutive patients with a recent diagnosis of epilepsy are interviewed by questionnaire about headaches associated with epileptic seizures. It involves questions about headache in general, localization, severity, duration and frequency, as well as headache associated with seizures, and about patient's family history. This Observational study does not involve the administration of any drugs.</detailed_description>
