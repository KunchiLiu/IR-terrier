	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to assess the impact of minocycline on the progression of symptoms of HD. The study will also assess whether it is reasonable to continue with further study of minocycline in HD. We will measure the effect of minocycline on HD by measuring the change in Huntington's disease symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Minocycline in Huntington's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The DOMINO study is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, futility study of minocycline in patients with HD. Subjects will be randomized (3:1) to one of the two study arms: (1) the group that receives active minocycline (100 mg po b.i.d.), and (2) the group that receives placebo. Subjects will be enrolled over an approximate six-month period and remain on blinded study drug for 18 months. The primary analysis will involve a comparison of the change over time in TFC between the minocycline group and a fixed value determined from historical control data. A placebo group will also be included to facilitate blinding and to permit a descriptive assessment of the validity of the assumed change over time in historical controls.</detailed_description>
