	<brief_summary>This project aims to conduct a unique, community-based intervention consisting of a randomized trial of a culturally-appropriate weight loss intervention for overweight Latino children in Milwaukee. The intervention promotes lifestyle changes through a low weight loss regimen, one or more physical activities ranging from soccer to hip-hop dance, and dietary counseling including cooking classes for parents. In addition to weight reduction for overweight Latino children, the project has the potential to reduce missed school days and improve self-esteem and quality of life.</brief_summary>
