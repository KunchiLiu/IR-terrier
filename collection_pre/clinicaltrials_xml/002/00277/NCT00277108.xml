	<brief_title>Lexapro in the Treatment of Patients With Postpartum Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objectives: Remission of Major Depression: To determine the efficacy of a flexibly titrated dose of Escitalopram (10mg to 20 mg) in the treatment of women with postpartum depression. The primary outcome measure will be remission of major depression, defined as a score of 12 or less on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale. A score of 7 or less on the Hamilton Depression Scale (21 item) will be used as a secondary measure of remission. The null hypothesis is that flexibly dosed Escitalopram does not lead to remission of major depression based on total MADRS scores after 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary objectives: 1. To determine if treatment with Escitalopram is effective in achieving significant reduction in symptoms of postpartum depression as measured on several instruments: HAM-D 21, CGI, Beck Depression Inventory, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Specifically, a response will be defined as a reduction of the total scores of 50% or more from baseline on the MADRS or HAM-D 21. 2. To determine the tolerability, safety and some dosing considerations for Escitalopram in this special subpopulation of depressed patients. Adverse events data (clinical and laboratory), compliance and early termination will be used as outcome measures. 3. To determine in a post-hoc analysis if pre-study anxiety levels as measured with HAM-A correlate with primary and secondary outcomes.</detailed_description>

The subject must be able to comply with instructions and be capable of participating in an 8 week study. 1. Under 18 years of age. 2. Subjects who are breastfeeding. 3. History of Bipolar Disorder, Schizoaffective Disorder, Schizophrenia. 4. History of any DSMIV Axis II diagnosis, which in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with compliance of the protocol. 5. History of alcohol or drug abuse or dependence in the last year. 6.

Current severe psychiatric symptoms requiring psychiatric hospitalization, current psychosis or suicidal, homicidal potential. 8. History of intolerance to or hypersensitivity to Citalopram. 9. Subjects whose depressions are known to be unresponsive to Escitalopram. 10. Subjects who are pregnant or who intend to become pregnant during the course of the study. 11.
