	<brief_summary>Mild valvar pulmonary stenosis can be detected in 1/10,000 live births. Historical data suggested that most of these patients do well. Nonetheless, the majority of these patients is followed periodically by a pediatric cardiologist and may undergo repeated echocardiographic studies to follow the gradient. Such follow-up can be costly and it is not know if there is any benefit to periodic evaluation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Young children (less than or equal to 2 years of age) with mild valvar pulmonary stenosis are unlikely to develop worsening stenosis with age and periodic cardiac evaluation is not warranted. To describe the clinical course of children with mild valvar pulmonary stenosis diagnosed in early childhood. To examine the clinical practice patterns of cardiologists caring for these patients. Retrospective chart review of all children diagnosed with mild valvar pulmonary stenosis born between 1984 and 2003 and followed by Sibley Heart Center Cardiology. Patient variables will include: pulmonary valve gradient, need for catheterization, exercise intolerance and endocarditis. Practice variables will include: frequency of follow-up, number of echocardiographic studies, exercise limitations.</detailed_description>
