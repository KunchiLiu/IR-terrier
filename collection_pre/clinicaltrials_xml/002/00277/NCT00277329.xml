	<brief_summary>This clinical study is being conducted at multiple sites to determine the activity, safety, and tolerability of XL999 when given weekly to patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). XL999 is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple kinases including VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, FLT-3, and Src, which are involved in tumor cell growth, formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), and metastasis.</brief_summary>
