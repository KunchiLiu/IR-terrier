	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, open-label trial of TaxotereÂ® + ZD1839 in elderly patients with Stage III-b or IV NSCLC who have received no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients with prior adjuvant chemotherapy were allowed to enroll on this trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Docetaxel + ZD1839 in Elderly Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial is designed to test the efficacy and tolerability of a standard chemotherapy agent, Docetaxel, in combination with an oral agent, Iressa, in elderly patients with advanced stage lung cancer. Current practices utilize two chemotherapeutic medications that may result in increased toxicities and poor outcomes in the elderly population. Treatment consists of an infusion of docetaxel every 21 days for four doses while taking Iressa every day. A computed tomography (CT) scan will measure disease response after two cycles. Response determines continuation of treatment. Lab work will be collected before every treatment. Side effect information will also be collected at every visit. Once the infusion phase of the study is completed, a maintenance phase of taking just the Iressa begins and disease assessment occurs every two months. This period will last until disease progression is demonstrated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must be greater than or equal to 70 years of age. Patients must have histologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is Stage IIIb (with pleural effusions) or Stage IV. Patients must be previously untreated for metastatic disease but may have received previous adjuvant chemotherapy more than six months prior to registration. Patients may also have received radiation therapy for advanced disease; however there should be measurable disease outside the radiation ports. Disease must be at least unidimensionally measurable. Lesions, which are located within a previously irradiated field, are not considered measurable unless there is a documented growth in its size. Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Laboratory values must be as follows: White blood cell count greater than or equal to 3,000/mm^3; Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm^3; Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3; Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.0 x institutional upper normal limit; Serum creatinine less than or equal to 2 x institutional upper normal limit; aspartic transaminase (AST) or ALANINE TRANSAMINASE (ALT) less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper normal limit; Alkaline Phosphatase less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper normal limit; Serum calcium less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper normal limit (corrected for serum albumin). Patients with combined alkaline phosphatase, AST and/or ALT elevations will not be allowed to enroll on protocol. Patients must have recovered from all acute toxicities from previous therapy, excluding alopecia. In keeping with the policies of the institution, patients must sign an informed consent form indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study Patients with stable brain metastases after completion of radiation will be allowed to enroll in this trial. Patients treated with adjuvant therapy more than six months ago will be allowed to enroll in this trial. Cognitively impaired patients will be allowed to enroll on the trial if the legal guardian signs the consent form after a full informed consent process is completed. Whenever feasible the cognitively impaired person will also give assent to participation in the trial. Patients previously treated with chemotherapy or ZD1839. Patients with known or clinical evidence of active central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. Patients with stable, previously treated brain metastases will be allowed. Male Patients with female sexual partners in the reproductive age group who refuse to use effective methods of contraception will be excluded from the trial. Patients with concurrent serious infections (i.e., receiving an intravenous antibiotic) are not eligible. Patients with an unstable or serious concurrent medical condition are excluded. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, grade 3 neuropathies, spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent. Patients receiving other nonapproved or investigational therapy concurrently or within 30 days of Day 1 of trial treatment. Patients with a history of other cancers except basal cell skin cancers, carcinoma of the cervix in situ, or curativelytreated cancers with &gt; 2 years nonrecurrence prior to entry in the trial. Patients with a history of other cancers must have histological confirmation that current disease is compatible with diagnosis of NSCLC. Peripheral neuropathy &gt;2. (Peripheral neuropathy must be &lt; grade 1) History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Docetaxel, ZD 1839, Polysorbate 80, or other agents used in the study. Patients with combined alkaline phosphatase, AST and/or ALT elevations will be excluded from this protocol. Patients previously treated with radiation therapy.</criteria>
