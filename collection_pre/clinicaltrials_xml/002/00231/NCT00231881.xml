	<brief_summary>This study aims to characterize the permeability as well as some protein involved in the cell junction in the oesophageal epithelium in patients with GORD symptoms. In addition these patients will be characterized for their reflux especially by pH-impedancemetry, Bilitec and oesophageal acid perfusion test. Correlations between the characteristics of the reflux and the biological results will be calculated.</brief_summary>
