	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy (in terms of weight and hemoglobin type A1c [HbA1c]) and safety of topiramate (96 milligrams[mg] or 192 mg daily) with placebo in the treatment of obesity in Type 2 diabetic patients receiving metformin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Topiramate in the Treatment fo Obese, Type 2 Diabetic Patients Treated With Metformin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topiramate is not approved for the treatment of obesity. This double-blind, placebo-controlled study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of topiramate in Type 2 diabetic patients with obesity who are well-controlled on metformin alone. Patients are randomized to receive either topiramate (up to a target dose of 96 or 192 mg per day) or placebo for one year. Assessments of efficacy include weight reduction, levels of HbA1c (shows average blood sugar level over a few months), Body Mass Index (BMI), and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) measures. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, vital signs, hypoglycemic events, electrocardiograms [ECGs], clinical laboratory values) are monitored throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that topiramate, combined with metformin and non-pharmacologic therapy, can effectively achieve significant weight reduction and is well tolerated. During the first 8 weeks, oral doses of matching placebo or topiramate are increased gradually to target dose (96 milligrams[mg] or 192mg daily); the dose will be maintained for 1 year, then gradually reduced and stopped</detailed_description>
