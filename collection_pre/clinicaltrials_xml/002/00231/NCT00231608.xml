	<brief_title>A Study of Safety and Efficacy of Topiramate in Male Patients With Abdominal Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topiramate is not approved for the treatment of obesity. This study is a 6-month randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study, followed by a 6-month open-label extension study to evaluate the effect of Topiramate on abdominal visceral fat accumulation, a clinical surrogate known to be associated with the complications of obesity such as increased incidence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, and their associated morbidities. Patients will be randomized to receive either daily Topiramate or placebo. Effectiveness will be measured by multiple parameters such as abdominal visceral fat (assessed by computed tomography), total and subcutaneous abdominal fat, body composition, body weight, body mass index, glucose tolerance, lipid profile, blood pressure, Topiramate plasma concentration, or 24 hours energy expenditure (selected patients). Safety evaluation (adverse events, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory tests) will be conducted throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that Topiramate is effective in reducing abdominal visceral fat in male patients and well tolerated. After the initial 12-week titration phase, patients will receive either Topiramate (200mg twice daily or the maximum dose tolerated) or placebo by mouth for 6-months. Then, patients will receive Topiramate (200mg twice daily or the maximum tolerated dose) for 6-months during the open-label phase.</detailed_description>
