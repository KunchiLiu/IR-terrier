	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of CryoCorâ„¢ Cryoablation for PAF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this prospective, randomized multi-center clinical study is to establish the benefits of the CryoCor(TM) Cardiac Cryoablation System for treating symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) in comparison to treatment with anti-arrhythmic medications alone. This study also evaluates the safety profile of the CryoCor(TM) Cardiac Cryoablation System when used in this same setting.</detailed_description>
