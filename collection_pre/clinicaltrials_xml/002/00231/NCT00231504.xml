	<brief_summary>The deficit in the total number of antral follicles is associated with a reduction of the ovarian fertility potential in young women. The principal objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between FSH receptor polymorphism and antral follicle count. The investigators have designed a study of FSH receptor polymorphisms P1 and P2 as an association with a low antral follicle count in the ovary.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Receptor in Women With Low Antral Follicle Count</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study will compare the prevalence of FSH receptor polymorphisms P1 and P2 in women having reduced follicle count (1 to 9 antral follicles) or normal follicle count (13 to 20 antral follicles) determined by ultrasound scans.</detailed_description>
