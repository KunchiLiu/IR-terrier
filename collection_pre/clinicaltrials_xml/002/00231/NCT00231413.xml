	<brief_summary>Human Papilloma viruses (HPV) are viruses that cause infections of the skin and genitals in men and women. Several types of HPV infection are transmitted by sexual activity and, in women, can infect the cervix (part of the uterus or womb). This infection, if it persists, can lead over a long period of time to cancer of the cervix in women. In collaboration with MedImmune Inc., GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals has developed a HPV vaccine against the oncogenic types HPV-16 and HPV-18 formulated with the adjuvant AS04. GSK Biologicals is also evaluating novel HPV vaccine formulations.This study will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a novel GSK Biologicals HPV vaccine in women 18-25 years of age at study start. Approximately 376 study subjects will receive the novel HPV vaccine or the control vaccine administered intramuscularly according to a 0-1-6 month schedule</brief_summary>
