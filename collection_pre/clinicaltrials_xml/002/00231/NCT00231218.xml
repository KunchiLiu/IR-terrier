	<brief_title>Echinacea, Propolis and Vitamin C for URI Prevention in Preschoolers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This combination of herbs has been studied only once before in preschoolers. In a study of 430 preschoolers reported in Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine in March of 2004, a similar preparation with a slightly lower dose of Vitamin C decreased upper respiratory infections by 55% (308 to 138). We are repeating this study to see if our results confirm or contradict those of the previous study.</detailed_description>
