	<brief_summary>This is a phase IIIb, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coexisting vascular disease or hypertension. The total duration of the study will be approximately 60 weeks. The aim of this study is to examine the potential beneficial effects of rosiglitazone on carotid atheroma in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coexisting vascular disease or hypertension. It is hypothesised that treatment with rosiglitazone will lead to an decrease in plaque size. In addition, it is hoped that rosiglitazone will have a positive effect on plaque composition and stability.</brief_summary>
