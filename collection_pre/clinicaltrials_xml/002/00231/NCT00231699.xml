	<brief_summary>Hypothermia leads to increased morbidity and mortality. Heat loss mainly occurs during anesthesia and surgery. Therefore prevention of hypothermia in pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia is very important. However, there is very little information about effectiveness of various insulating materials used in the operating room. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of cotton and plastic for prevent intraoperative hypothermia in pediatric patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Prevention of Hypothermia in Pediatric Patient Between Wrapping With Cotton and Plastic.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 42 pediatric patients (age 1 month-3 years, ASA physical status 1-2) who were scheduled for elective maxillofacial or genitourinary surgery. The patients were randomly allocated into 2 groups. The patientâ€™s arms, legs and bodies were wrapped with either plastic (study group) or cotton (control group). All patients received standard general anesthesia with endotracheal tube and control ventilation with a fresh gas flow at 1 l/min. The core temperature (rectal temperature) was recorded every 10 minutes for 60 minutes.</detailed_description>
