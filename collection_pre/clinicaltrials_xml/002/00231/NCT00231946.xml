	<brief_title>ALADDIN Study - Phase III: Antigonadotropin-Leuprolide in Alzheimer's Disease Drug INvestigation (VP-AD-301)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VP4896 is a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist that binds to and inactivates GnRH receptors on the pituitary gland. This decreases the amount of luteinizing hormone released by the pituitary. The hypothesis upon which this trial is designed is that luteinizing hormone is the cause of Alzheimer's disease. VP4896 decreases the amount of luteinizing hormone in the body and, therefore, may decrease or halt the progression of Alzheimer's disease. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of VP4896 (a novel formulation of leuprolide acetate) in the treatment of subjects with mild-to-moderate AD. The study duration is 56 weeks. Approximately 555 participants will be recruited from approximately 80 sites in the United States, Canada, and South America. The study drug will be administered every eight weeks over a 48 week period. Male subjects randomized to active treatment will also receive testosterone replacement gel. The change from baseline in ADAS-Cog (cognitive test) score at Week 50 and ADCS-CGIC (global cognitive and behavioral measure) at Week 50 will be the primary efficacy endpoints. Safety will be assessed at all visits and by phone at Week 1.</detailed_description>
