	<brief_summary>The ASSURE Study will evaluate shock conversion performance when programming the first shock of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillation (ICD) is based on an implant test consisting of either 1) a single induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and subsequent demonstration conversion success at 14 J or 2) an upper limit of vulnerability (ULV) test at 14 J.</brief_summary>
