	<brief_title>Culturally Responsive Person-Centered Care for Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient-centered care is a type of customized mental health care that is based on each individual's needs, values, and preferences. This type of care has become increasingly important, especially for members of ethnic minorities. However, although this type of care is, in theory, more effective than standard, less personalized care in treating psychotic disorders, there is a significant gap between theory and practice. Research has shown that this gap is particularly evident in the treatment of psychotic disorders in individuals of ethnic backgrounds. This study will address these disparities by comparing the effectiveness of standard individualized care versus person-centered care and community-integrating care in treating psychosis in adults of Hispanic and African descents. This open-label study will consist of two phases. In Phase I, interview data on self-management of mental illness and treatment seeking behaviors will be collected and analyzed. In Phase II, participants from two urban mental health centers will be randomly assigned to receive one of three treatment combinations: standard care incorporating illness management recovery (IMR); IMR plus person-centered planning (PCP); or IMR plus PCP and community integration (CI). IMR will focus on nine topic areas: recovery strategies; facts about psychosis; a stress-vulnerability model; building social support; reducing relapses; effective use of medications; coping with stress; coping with problems or symptoms; and meeting health care needs. PCP will aid participants in discovering a vision of a desirable future and developing a plan for achieving that goal. Techniques will include providing direction in the planning process, involving significant others, generating focus on assets and capacities, identifying and providing access to integrated community settings, and promoting acceptance of setbacks as part of the path to success. CI will include recovery group sessions and community integration activities. Recovery groups will consist of 10 to 12 people per group, and will aid participants in asserting the skills they learned in IMR and PCP. Community integration activities will entail a variety of excursions and social and recreational activities in the community to promote community involvement and acquisition of social roles. All treatments will last a total of 6 months. Assessments of psychiatric symptoms, social functioning, quality of life, and community integration will occur at Month 6 and at a follow-up visit at Month 18.</detailed_description>
