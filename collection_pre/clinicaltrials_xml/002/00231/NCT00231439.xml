	<brief_summary>Inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid may contribute to the new muscle weakness, fatigue and pain experienced by patients with post-polio syndrome. Intravenousimmunoglobulin (IvIg) reduces this inflammation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical effect of IvIg in post-polio syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-Poliosyndrome Treated With Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IvIg)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-polio syndrome (PPS) is characterised by new muscle weakness, pain, and fatigue several years after the attack of acute polio. This leads to increased disability, and up to now only supportive therapy is available. Patients with PPS lose more motor neurons than expected and surviving neurons fail to maintain neurogenic supply to enlarged motor units. New data report an increased level of inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immune modulating therapy like IvIg could be an option and this pilot study is the first to investigate the clinical effect of IvIg in PPS. In addition, levels of cytokines in CSF and serum before and after treatment will be investigated.</detailed_description>
