	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing, or coming back. The use of fish oil and/or green tea may prevent prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well a fish oil and/or green tea supplement works in preventing prostate cancer in patients with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or who are at risk for developing prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fish Oil and Green Tea Extract in Preventing Prostate Cancer in Patients Who Are at Risk for Developing Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the cancer preventing effects of fish oil supplementation and green tea extract use on markers of alteration in lipid metabolism in prostate tissue samples. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are stratified according to age (under 65 vs 65 and over). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral fish oil three times daily and oral green tea extract twice daily. - Arm II: Patients receive an oil placebo three times daily and oral green tea extract twice daily. - Arm III: Patients receive oral fish oil three times daily and a placebo twice daily. - Arm IV: Patients receive an oil placebo three times daily and another placebo twice daily. Treatment in one of the above-listed arms continues for up to 20 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients undergo a prostate biopsy on the last day of study treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients receive a follow-up phone call at/around 30 days later. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 144 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Clinician recommends repeat biopsy of the prostate ("Repeat" is defined as any recommended biopsy of the prostate subsequent to an earlier biopsy of the prostate) EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Definitive invasive prostate cancer on initial biopsy Significant active medical illness that in the opinion of the clinician would preclude protocol treatment. History of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation Subject reported use of fish oil (greater than 1 gram per day) or green tea supplement within 30 days before Day 1 of study treatment Subject reported use of fish oil â‰¤ 1 gram per day and unwilling to discontinue use for the duration of the trial Use of warfarin or need for therapeutic anticoagulation at time of biopsy or at anytime during the course of the trial. Subject reported allergy or sensitivity to fish oil, olive oil or green tea Subject reported history of hemophilia, van Willebrands disease or other bleeding disorder, except when the subject is evaluated by a hematologist who determines that fish oil supplementation is not contraindicated. Total bilirubin greater than institutional upper limit of normal Concurrent high risk study participation</criteria>
