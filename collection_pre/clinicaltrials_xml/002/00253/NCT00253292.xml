	<detailed_description>Identifying young adult burned patients at risk for poor outcomes remains an underpublished field of study. The first step to identifying these patients is to review their responses to this burn specific young adult measure, that attempts to quantify aspects of quality of life. We are validating this questionnaire by now collecting information from non burned community based subjects and by having burned patients complete the questionnaire at 4 timepoints. Once we have recruited sufficient subjects we will finalize our testing of this questionnaire and publish the validity and reliability of the instrument. Our questionnaires will help us answer the question of how burn people differ from non burned person's reported quality of life. This will complete our array of burn specific outcomes questionnaires from infancy through young adulthood.</detailed_description>
