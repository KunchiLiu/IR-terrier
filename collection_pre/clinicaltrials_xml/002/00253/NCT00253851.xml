	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to prevent blood clots from forming during surgery and a few days after total knee replacement surgery. This study will help us identify whether using a blood thinner in the operating room will stop blood clots from forming during the operation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Thinning the Blood During Surgery Prevent Blood Clots Following Total Knee Replacement Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venous thromboembolism is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after lower limb orthopaedic surgery in the adult patient. If, as suggested, DVT formation begins intra-operatively then targeting this period to prevent clot formation could substantially reduce DVT rates in the TKA population. The present study aims to determine whether this intra-operative regional heparinization technique is effective in preventing the intra-operative formation of DVT following TKA, as evidenced by venography in the early post-operative period.</detailed_description>
