	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radioactive drugs, such as iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine, may carry radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. An autologous peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplant may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Giving iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine and combination chemotherapy with an autologous peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplant may allow more chemotherapy to be given so that more tumor cells are killed. Giving radiation therapy after an autologous peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplant may kill any remaining tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine together with combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy works in treating patients who are undergoing an autologous peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplant for relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>N2001-02: I-MIBG With Intensive Chemotherapy and Autologous Stem Cell Rescue for High-Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma treated with iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (^131I-MIBG) and combination chemotherapy comprising carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan followed by autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and radiotherapy. Secondary - Determine the hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the tumor self-absorbed radiation dose (TSARD) in patients with measurable soft tissue lesions treated with this regimen. - Correlate the TSARD with tumor response in patients with measurable residual soft tissue disease treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk (poor-risk group [mixed or no response to induction therapy or progression during or after induction therapy] vs good-risk group [partial response after 4 courses of induction therapy]) and kidney function at study entry (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] ≥ 100 mL/min vs GFR 60-99 mL/min) - Stem cell harvest: Patients undergo a peripheral blood stem cell harvest or bone marrow harvest provided they have an adequate number of cells available. At least 2 weeks later, patients proceed to iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (^131I-MIBG) and combination chemotherapy. - 131I-MIBG and combination chemotherapy: Patients receive ^131I-MIBG IV over 2 hours on day -21, carboplatin IV continuously on days -7 to -4, etoposide IV continuously on days -7 to -4, and melphalan IV over 1 hour on days -7 to -5. - Stem cell infusion and filgrastim (G-CSF): Three days after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo transplantation of either stem cells or bone marrow on day 0. Patients also receive G-CSF subcutaneously or IV over 1 hour once daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts return to normal. - Radiotherapy: Once blood counts return to normal, patients undergo radiotherapy to primary and metastatic sites that have not received previous irradiation over 12 days beginning after day 42. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 2 years and then periodically thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients (40 low-risk patients and 8-10 high-risk patients) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
