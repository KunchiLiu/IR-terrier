	<brief_summary>Painful bladder syndrome (PBS)/interstitial cystitis (IC) may be due to the actions of nitric oxide (NO) in the bladder tissue. NO is a gaseous substance with a very short half-life, synthesized by a group of NO-synthase-enzymes in many tissues. The goal of this study is to illuminate bladder tissue production of NO in individuals with PBS and healthy individuals, by quantification of NO and NO-enzyme expression by different molecular biological methods.</brief_summary>
