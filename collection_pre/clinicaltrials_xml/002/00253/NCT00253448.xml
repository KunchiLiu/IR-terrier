	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiosurgery may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving stereotactic radiosurgery together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving stereotactic radiosurgery together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the feasibility and efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery to high-risk tumor regions and conventional radiotherapy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. - Determine overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. Secondary - Determine 6-month progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the absence of tumor growth and/or activity on conventional MR/MR spectroscopy imaging in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the frequency and severity of RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) CNS toxic effects in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the neurologic function and quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery to high-risk areas of active tumor determined by MR-spectroscopy. No more than 2 weeks later, patients undergo conventional radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy, at 1 and 3 months after completion of radiotherapy, and then every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and annually thereafter. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
