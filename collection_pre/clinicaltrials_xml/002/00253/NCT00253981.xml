	<detailed_description>Tibial stress reactions and fractures are often difficult to treat, and therefore, many soldiers proceed to a medical disability/discharge. It is felt that with the use of the MIRE technology, active duty soldiers with tibial stress reactions and fractures will heal more quickly and completely. All soldiers will have a documented bone scintigraph as evidence for tibial stress reaction or fracture prior to enrollment. In addition, pain-pressure goniometric measures and time to complete the Balke protocol will also be used to assess healing with the MIRE technology. Comparison: Soldiers with Active MIRE technology, compared to soldiers with Placebo MIRE technology.</detailed_description>
