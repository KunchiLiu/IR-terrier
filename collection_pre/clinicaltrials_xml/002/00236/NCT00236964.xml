	<brief_title>Comparison of Oral Iron With IV Iron in Patients With Anemia of Chronic Renal Failure Not on Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized open-label multicenter active-controlled study of anemic patients with Chronic Renal Failure who are not yet receiving dialysis. The duration of the study was five months. After screening procedures including multiple hemoglobin values, patients were randomly assigned to either IV Iron Sucrose (200mg X 5) or oral iron sulfate (325mg TID)for 29 days. Safety assessments included the recording of all adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms and clinical laboratory tests. Efficacy parameters included hematologic parameters.</detailed_description>
