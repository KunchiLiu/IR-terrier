	<brief_title>A Study on Efficacy and Safety of Topiramate in the Treatment of Patients With Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topiramate is not approved for the treatment of obesity. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to assess the safety and effectiveness of topiramate in treatment of obese patients. Patients will receive 24 weeks of treatment by topiramate or placebo, followed by 2 week taper and a safety follow-up. Effectiveness will be determined by changes from baseline to week 24 in body weight, body mass index (BMI), anthropometric measurements (waist circumference, hip circumference, waist/hip ration), fasting lipid profiles, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c (shows average blood sugar level over months), fasting uric acid, fasting insulin, and blood pressures. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, physical examinations, 12 lead ECGs, vital signs, Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery) will be performed throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that topiramate will be effective in achieving and maintaining weight reduction in obese patients and is well tolerated. The patients will be randomized to receive either topiramate (64, 96, 192, or 384 mg daily) or placebo daily by mouth for 24 weeks.</detailed_description>
