	<brief_title>An Effectiveness and Safety Study of ELMIRON (Pentosan Polysulfate Sodium) for the Treatment of Chronic Non-Bacterial Inflammation of the Prostate Gland</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of ELMIRON® 100 mg three times per day for 12 weeks, as compared with placebo, in patients with chronic non-bacterial inflammation of the prostate gland. Safety evaluations will be assessed throughout the study. The hypothesis of the study is that ELMIRON® will be more effective than placebo, as based on the change in the total National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) score from baseline to the final visit (Week 12) and is generally well-tolerated. Patients will receive oral ELMIRON® 100 mg three times per day orally or matching placebo three times per day for 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
