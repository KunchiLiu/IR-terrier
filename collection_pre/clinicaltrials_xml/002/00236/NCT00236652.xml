	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Treating Sinus Infection With Levofloxacin 750 mg for 5 Days.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute bacterial sinusitis is a common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed in outpatients. Some types of bacteria that cause sinusitis are resistant to penicillin and certain other classes of antibiotics, but may be treatable with the antibiotic levofloxacin. This will be an open-label, multi-center, non-comparative clinical trial involving outpatients with protocol-defined acute bacterial sinusitis suitable for treatment with oral antibiotics. At the Preliminary Visit, a sinus radiograph will be obtained to confirm the clinical diagnosis of sinusitis, and the Investigator will perform a nasal exam. Sinus puncture and placement of an indwelling sinus catheter into an affected maxillary sinus will be performed on all eligible patients at the first visit. Patients meeting the study criteria will receive 750 milligrams levofloxacin tablets once daily for 5 days. The primary objective is to establish the rate and extent of bacteriological eradication, defined as eradication of pathogens from the maxillary sinus, and to establish the effectiveness and safety of once-daily 750 milligrams levofloxacin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in adults. Levofloxacin 750 milligram tablet orally once a day for 5 days</detailed_description>
