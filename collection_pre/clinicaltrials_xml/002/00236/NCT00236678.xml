	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine fatigue (tiredness) in subjects with chronic Rheumatoid Arthritis with chronic anemia. Fatigue in subjects who get PROCRIT will be compared to fatigue in subjects who get placebo (a medically inactive substance). The study will also evaluate hemoglobin levels (oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells), safety, anemia related health concerns, vitality, arthritis related function and work productivity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Assess Fatigue in Patients With ACD Due to RA Receiving PROCRIT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROCRIT is not approved for the treatment of anemia of chronic disease in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Approximately 270 subjects will be participating in this trial, at approximately 25 centers in the United States. Patients will be eligible to participate in this study if hemoglobin (Hb) is &lt;=11.0 g/dL. The hypothesis is that PROCRIT improves fatigue scores in rheumatoid arthritis patients with anemia of chronic disease. If a patient chooses to participate, he/she will be randomized to receive either PROCRIT or placebo on a weekly basis starting at 20,000 units per injection (up to a maximum of 40,000 units).</detailed_description>
