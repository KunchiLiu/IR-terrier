	<brief_title>PROCRIT and Short-Term Outcomes in Orthopedic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of perioperative administration of PROCRIT to that of preoperative autologous donation on post-operative rehabilitation outcomes in subjects undergoing primary unilateral knee arthroplasty. Secondary objectives are : 1) To compare the effect of perioperative administration of PROCRIT to that of preoperative autologous donation on hemoglobin, change in hemoglobin, number of units transfused and transfusion rate during the study period; and 2) To compare the effect of perioperative administration of PROCRIT to that of preoperative autologous donation on inpatient rehabilitation length of stay. The study will test the hypothesis that perioperative administration of PROCRIT will improve post-operative rehabilitation outcomes, compared with preoperative autologous donation. 40,000U PROCRIT or Placebo SC in relation to surgery date: Days -21, -14, -7, 0 (day of surgery), 7, and 14.</detailed_description>
