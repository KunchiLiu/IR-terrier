	<brief_title>A Long Term Study of Long-acting Injectable Risperidone in the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, long-term study of a flexible dose of a long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone (risperidone LAI) injected into the muscle at 2 week intervals for at least 12 months in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. It is an extension of an open label study of patients with schizophrenia (RIS-USA-259) switching from treatment with an oral antipsychotic medication to long-acting injectable risperidone. Safety evaluations include incidence of adverse events, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), electrocardiograms (ECGs), and Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), a scale for assessing muscle tone, gait, and abnormal movements. Efficacy assessments include measurements using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S). Risperidone (25-50milligrams [mg]) injections, long-acting formulation, every 2 weeks for at least 1 year. Dosages may be increased (50 mgs maximum) or decreased at discretion of the investigator. Supplementary risperidone tablets (1mg) may be administered.</detailed_description>
