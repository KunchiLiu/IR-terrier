	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the pain-relieving effects and safety of two analgesic treatment regimens as compared to placebo in patients experiencing pain after oral surgery. Tramadol hydrochloride/acetaminophen is approved to treat acute pain. This study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tramadol hydrochloride/acetaminophen compared with tramadol hydrochloride alone compared with placebo as a pain medication in the treatment of pain following oral surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of the Effectiveness and Safety of ULTRACET速 (Tramadol Hydrochloride/Acetaminophen) Versus ULTRAM速 (Tramadol Hydrochloride) Versus Placebo in Patients With Pain After Oral Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While other studies have shown the effectiveness and safety of tramadol/acetaminophen and of tramadol alone in treating pain following oral surgery, a direct comparison of the two treatments within the same study at these dose levels has not be performed. This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled, single-dose, parallel-group study of adult patients who undergo oral surgery for removal of two or more impacted third molars. Patients who have at least moderate pain within 5 hours after surgery will be given a single oral dose of 2 capsules of study medication. Patients will be equally assigned to receive a total dose of either tramadol HCl 75 mg/acetaminophen 650 mg or tramadol HCl 100 mg or placebo. Patients will be asked about the intensity of the current pain and pain relief from the starting pain at 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours after taking the study medication. Patients will also be given two stopwatches that will be started once medication has been taken. Patients will stop the first stopwatch when they first notice any pain decrease; they will stop the second stopwatch when they notice meaningful pain relief. The primary efficacy endpoints are summary measures of hourly patient reported pain relief (PAR) and pain intensity scores: total PAR (TOTPAR), sum of hourly pain intensity differences (PIDs) from baseline (SPID), and sum of hourly PAR plus hourly PIDs from baseline (SPRID). The study hypothesis is that pain relief with tramadol HCl/acetaminophen (ULTRACET速) is superior to pain relief from tramadol HCl (ULTRAM速) alone after oral surgery and the combination is well tolerated. 2 capsules, total dose either tramadol HCl 75 milligrams/acetaminophen 650 milligrams, tramadol HCl 100 milligrams, or matching placebo taken one time orally; all study medication is over-capsulated to match.</detailed_description>
