	<brief_summary>This study is based on clinical findings that some patients with fibromyalgia have a tendency towards lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. The hypothesis to be tested in this study is that the administration of a very low-dose of cortisol which has no side effects corrects this deficiency and results in an improvement of symptoms</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Low-Dose Hydrocortisone Treatment for Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia (FMS) is regarded as one of the most important chronic pain syndromes with a high prevalence in the general population. Hypotheses to be tested in this study: - Impaired glucocorticoid signaling is associated in a failure to terminate the chronic stress response seen in patients with FMS. - Low-dose hydrocortisone in patients with FMS results in a reduction in pain and other stress-related symptoms of FMS Intervention: 2 x 5 mg of hydrocortisone given at noon and in the evening Study design: Double-blind, randomized, cross-over, within-subject Presumed mechanism of main hydrocortisone effect: - Improvements in FMS symptoms representing (functional) hypocortisolism - Increased pain threshold Expected results: - Moderate reductions in physical impairment, fatigue, and stiffness - Improvements in sleep quality - Decline in pain intensity Inclusion criteria - FMS diagnosis according to the American College of Rheumatology 1990 Criteria - Age between 18 and 60 years Exclusion criteria - Disease states representing contraindications to the administration of glucocorticoids (tuberculosis, gastric- and duodenal ulcers, Cushing's disease, osteoporosis, hypertension, pregnancy and lactation, psychosis, glaucoma, diabetes mellitus, thrombophilia, active or chronic bacterial or viral infections, hypothyreosis, cirrhosis). - Severe or chronic somatic diseases. - Psychiatric diseases according to DSM-IV (except PTSD, minor depressive episodes, minor personality disorders). - Body weight &gt;20% above or below normal. - Changes in pharmacologic or psychotherapeutic management less than 3 months ago. - Age &lt; 18 years Proposed outcome measures - Primary: FMS symptoms, pain scores, tenderness at tender points - Secondary: Chronic stress symptoms, health-related quality of life Possible benefit and use of data from the trial This trial could help to identify glucocorticoid resistance as a major mechanism underlying the sustained stress - reactions seen in FMS and establish low-dose hydrocortisone as a useful drug for treatment of stress-related disorders.</detailed_description>
