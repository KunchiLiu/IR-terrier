	<brief_summary>Overweight increases the risk to develop chronic diseases including type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The low-grade inflammatory status often seen in overweight subjects is thought to play an important role in disease development. The purpose of this study is to determine the role of inflammation on glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. In this study the effect of the anti-inflammatory treatment diclofenac on markers of inflammation and on parameters of glucose metabolism will be studied.</brief_summary>
