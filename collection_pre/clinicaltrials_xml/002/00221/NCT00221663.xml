	<brief_summary>Minimally-invasive operative techniques have been introduced in cardiac surgery. These techniques may have several advantages such as a decrease in post operative pain, lower morbidity and mortality, faster recovery, and a shorter hospital stay. However, these advantages have rarely been documented in the setting of a formal randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conventional Versus Mini-Sternotomy for Aortic Valve Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Minimally invasive techniques for cardiac surgery should be formally evaluated. Design: Randomized, single-blind, monocentric trial. Interventions Compared: Median sternotomy versus minimally invasive technique. Eligibility Criteria: Indication of isolated aortic valvular replacement, preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class &lt; = 3, left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; = 40%. Primary Outcome: Forced expiratory volume and peak expiratory volume/second at 48 hours.</detailed_description>
