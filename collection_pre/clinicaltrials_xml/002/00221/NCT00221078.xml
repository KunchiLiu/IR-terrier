	<brief_summary>Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a process that uses low intensity electrical pulses generated by an electric stimulator to create muscle contractions. By contracting muscles in a specific sequence, one can generate various body functions such as grasping, walking, and standing. Final goal of the study is to evaluate if FES training when applied early during rehabilitation will help stroke patients to use their hands more effectively after discharge from a rehabilitation facility, compared to those patients who have not received FES training.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benefits of Applying Neuroprosthesis for Improving Reaching and Grasping Functions in Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuroprosthesis are systems that apply functional electrical stimulation to cause muscle contractions. If the muscle contractions are sequenced properly one can generate various functions such as grasping, standing, and walking. Recent studies of others and our pilot study indicate that a neuroprosthesis can be successfully applied as a training device to help stroke patients who have hemiplegic arm to relearn how to reach and grasp various objects. The objective of this research program is to confirm these preliminary results with the broader population of stroke patients, and if successful to propose a method to introduce this rehabilitation treatment into Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Stroke Unit as a primary intervention for hand function recovery. Specifically, our aim is to1)develop an exercise protocol that uses a neuroprosthesis for reaching and grasping developed by our team in combination with the standard physiotherapy treatments to enhance recovery of hemiplegic arm and hand; and 2) assess qualitatively and quantitatively improvements in the reaching and grasping functions achieved with standard rehabilitation treatment.</detailed_description>
