	<brief_summary>Surgical treatment of multiple or recurrent renal tumors may be complicated by renal function impairment. Mini-invasive thermotherapy as radiofrequency (RF), induces necrosis of tumoral tissue while sparing normal renal parenchyma. The purpose of the study is to compare, in patients at risk of renal insufficiency, a strategy based on surgical approach and a strategy based on RF approach. 180 patients from 9 centers will be randomized in two groups (surgical vs. RF, delivered either percutaneously or under laparoscopy). The proportion of patients with a local carcinologic efficacy at 5 years and the general and renal tolerance will be analysed and compared between both strategies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Surgery and Radiofrequency for Treatment of Renal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background. Surgical treatment of multiple or recurrent renal tumors may be complicated by renal function impairment. Mini-invasive thermotherapy as radiofrequency (RF), induces necrosis of tumoral tissue while sparing normal renal parenchyma. Objectives. The main objective is to assess the 5-year local carcinologic efficacy (no residual tumor tissue and no recurrence at the site of treatment) of the radiofrequency treatment. Secondary objectives are to assess 5-year overall carcinologic efficacy, predictive factors of technical success of RF procedures, and the general and renal tolerance 5 years after treatment. Study design. Open label, randomized, parallel-group, multicentric clinical trial (9 centers). Eligibility criteria. Patients with renal tumor in whom a surgical treatment may result in renal function impairment. Intervention. Experimental group: radiofrequency treatment, percutaneous or under laparoscopy, using RF 3000â„¢ generator (Radiotherapeutics, Boston scientific) under a standardized heating protocol. A second procedure is allowed in case of residual tumoral tissue or tumor recurrence. Control group: conservative kidney surgery. Outcomes. The principal outcome is the 5-year local carcinologic efficacy (no residual tumor tissue and no recurrence at the site of treatment, as assessed by tomodensitometry or MRI after injection). Secondary outcomes are 5-year overall carcinologic efficacy (local efficacy and no metastases), renal function, technical success of RF procedures (no residual tumor tissue 2 months after procedure) and tolerance. Follow-up. Clinical, biological and imaging follow-ups are scheduled 2 months, 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years after the first treatment.</detailed_description>
