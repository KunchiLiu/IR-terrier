	<brief_summary>Adult periodontitis is a chronic infective disease affecting the periodontium. Periodontitis induce the destruction of attachment apparatus of teeth, resulting in periodontal pocket formation and teeth loss. This study will test the safety and efficacy of alveolous bone reproduction by the transplantation of mixture named periodontium injectable gel for the adult periodontitis patients. Injectable gel is the mixture of ex-vivo cultured mesenchymal stem stem cells, ex-vivo cultured osteoblast-like cells differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells and scaffold (include, platelet rich plasma, human thrombin and calcium chloride).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Periodontal disease is an infectious disease. Gingivitis and periodontitis are the 2 major forms of this. Their primary etiology is bacterial plaque, which can induce destruction of the periodontal apparatus. Gingivitis is inflammation of the gingival that does not result in clinical attachment loss. Periodontitis is inflammation of the gingival and is characterized by loss of connective tissue attachment and alveolar bone. Therapeutic approaches for periodontitis are divided into two categories: 1) anti-infective treatment; 2) regenerative therapy. Several surgical techniques have been developed to regenerate periodontal tissues including guided tissue regeneration, bone grafting, the use of enamel matrix derivative. However, these techniques are not reached for complete regeneration of the periodontium. This study will test the safety and efficacy of alveolous bone reproduction by the transplantation of mixture named periodontium injectable gel for the adult periodontitis patients. Injectable gel is the mixture of ex-vivo cultured mesenchymal stem stem cells, ex-vivo cultured osteoblast-like cells differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells and scaffold (include, platelet rich plasma, human thrombin and calcium chloride).</detailed_description>
