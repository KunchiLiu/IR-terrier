	<brief_summary>Ketamine added to Lidocaine can increase duration of pain relief following intraveonous regional anesthesia (IVRA). The purpose of this dose response study is to determine the minimum effective dosage of intravenous Ketamine, added to 3 mg/kg of Lidocaine. We anticipate that one dosage will provide us with the proper balance between sufficient anesthesia and minimal side effects.</brief_summary>
