	<brief_title>Home Based Resistance Training For Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obese individuals with type 2 diabetes will be randomly assigned to either an experimental group where they will perform moderate to high intensity resistance training (50-60% 1RM weeks 1-3 and 70-85% 1RM in weeks 4-16) three times per week for 16 weeks or to a non-training control group. All resistance training will be performed at home using a multigym apparatus. A personal trainer (PT) will come to the homes of each participant in the experimental group to make sure that exercises are being performed safely with the correct technique, and at the prescribed intensity. In the first two weeks, the PT will come to all 3 sessions per week. In weeks 3-4 this will be reduced to 2 times per week, in weeks 5-8 the PT will come once per week and in the last 8 weeks once bi-weekly.</detailed_description>
