	<brief_summary>This project will assess the incremental and cumulative impact of three behavioural intervention strategies for the promotion of physical activity in the adult general population with Type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alberta Diabetes and Physical Activity Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An increasing prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes is associated with the aging population, a significant rise in the prevalence of obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle. In Canada, 4.9-7.0% over the age of 12 and 17% over the age of 64 are estimated to have diabetes, 90-95% of which will be Type 2. Strong evidence supports the importance of physical activity in the management of Type 2 Diabetes. However, current literature lacks clear understanding of best strategies for physical activity behaviour change in this target population. Existing studies employ resource intensive, one-to-one individual and clinically-based approaches with limited theoretical grounding for recommended health behaviour change. Most fail to offer practical, sustainable, economically viable solutions, with documented long-term intervention efficacy. The call to move beyond the clinical focus by including theoretically population-based and "real-life" approaches for the management Type 2 Diabetes remains largely unheeded. The three interventions are: (1) standard print-based physical activity educational materials provided by the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA); (2) CDA materials + pedometers and a log book + theoretical stage-matched print-based physical activity materials; and, (3) the same as intervention 2 with the addition of a 12-month physical activity telephone counseling protocol.</detailed_description>
