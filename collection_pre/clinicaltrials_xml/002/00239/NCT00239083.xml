	<criteria>De NovoInclusion criteria 1. Males and females aged 6 years or over. 2. Recipients of cadaveric, living unrelated or living related kidney transplant, treated with CsAMe, with or without corticosteroids, as primary immunosuppression. MaintenanceInclusion criteria 1. Males and females aged 6 years or over. 2. Recipients of first or secondary cadaveric, living related or unrelated donor kidney transplant. 3. Patients currently receiving CsAME with or without Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine, with or without corticosteroids as part of their immunosuppressive regimen for at least 3 months prior to Screening. 4. Patients in a stable condition in terms of graft function (serum creatinine not above 2.3 mg/dL (=204 Âµmol/L) at screening and at baseline, or not increased by more than 20% at baseline compared to values obtained at screening), no change of immune suppressive regimen due to graft malfunction, and any known clinically significant physical and/or laboratory changes for at least 2 months prior to enrollment. De Novo and MaintenanceExclusion Criteria 1. Multiorgan recipients (e.g. kidney and pancreas) or previous transplant with any organ other than kidney. 2. Patients with any known hypersensitivity to MPA, ECMPS or other components of the formulation (e.g. lactose). 3. Patients with thrombocytopenia (&lt; 75,000/mm3), with an absolute neutrophil count of &lt; 1,500/mm3, and/or leukocytopenia (&lt; 2,500/mm3), and/or hemoglobin &lt; 6 g/dL at Screening or Baseline. 4. Patients with a history of malignancy within the last five years, except excised squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
