	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of SR147778 on weight loss over a period of 24 weeks when prescribed with a hypocaloric diet in obese patients. The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of SR147778 and to assess the effect of SR147778 on several secondary parameters (such as waist, metabolic parameters) over a period of 24 weeks when prescribed with a hypocaloric diet in obese patients.</brief_summary>
