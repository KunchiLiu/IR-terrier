	<brief_summary>This project will systematically apply a specialist version of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), known as Recovery Therapy, to a random sample of patients with psychotic disorders. Previously, the therapy has been developed and efficacy established, but the extent of applicability to (unselected) mental health service patients is unknown. The main aim is to establish the extent to which this therapy is acceptable and effective for mental health service clients. A secondary aim is to develop guidelines for the conduct of such therapy in public mental health settings.</brief_summary>
