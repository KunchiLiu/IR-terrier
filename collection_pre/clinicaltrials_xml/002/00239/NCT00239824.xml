	<brief_title>Pelvic Floor Muscle Training to Treat Urinary Incontinence After Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary incontinence is a well known side effect of radical prostatectomy. The prevalence differs according to time period after the operation and the definition of incontinence used. However, a prevalence of 10-20% have been reported one year after the operation. Pelvic floor muscle training has been suggested as a treatment of urinary incontinence. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of pelvic floor muscle training in the treatment of urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.We conduct a randomized clinical trial, comparing one group(n=40) following a pelvic floor muscle training program after prostatectomy and one group (n=40) receiving only standard information.Primary outcome variable is self registration of urinary incontinence.</detailed_description>
