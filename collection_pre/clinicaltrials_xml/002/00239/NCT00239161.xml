	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of the Treatment of Kidney Infections With Short Course Levofloxacin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal is to complete a pilot study of short course (5 days), high dose, levofloxacin treatment for women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Specific study objectives include: 1. To assess the efficacy and tolerability of levofloxacin 750 mg once daily for treatment of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in 25 women. 2. To describe the population pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin 750 mg once daily in treatment of young women with acute pyelonephritis. 3. To identify urine proteins associated with the inflammatory response of acute pyelonephritis, and characterize the time course of resolution of these proteins following initiation of treatment.</detailed_description>
