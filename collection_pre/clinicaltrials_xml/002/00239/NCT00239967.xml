	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of rimonabant 20 mg on HDL (high density lipoprotein) cholesterol and on TG (triglycerides) plasma levels over a period of one year when prescribed with a hypocaloric diet (600 kcal deficit per day) in abdominally obese patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia (low HDL and/or high TG plasma levels). The secondary objectives are to evaluate specific metabolic parameters, visceral fat (in selected sites), safety and tolerability of rimonabant 20 mg.</brief_summary>
