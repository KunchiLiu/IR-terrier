	<detailed_description>The hypothesis to be tested is that the possible role of ibuprofen in preventing AD can be detected in changes in biomarkers of AD. Eligible participants will complete an enrollment visit to include: a physical exam, a neurological exam, neuropsychological testing, and a minor blood draw. At the second visit, approximately 2 weeks later, participants will undergo a baseline lumbar puncture, and will be issued either ibuprofen or placebo to take once daily for 6-12 weeks. Both the participants and the clinicians will be masked to treatment assignment. After 6-12 weeks, the participants will undergo a second, and final, lumbar puncture. This will complete participant involvement in the study.</detailed_description>
