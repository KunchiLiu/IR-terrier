	<brief_summary>All patients of the core study who are interested of being treated with EC-MPS will be included in an open-label extension study to collect further information on the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of this drug. The aim of this study is to compare the renal function, 6 months after transplant, in de novo old-age renal transplant recipients treated with EC-MPS plus reduced dose CsA-ME or with EC-MPS plus standard dose CsA-ME, both in combination with basiliximab and short-term oral steroids.</brief_summary>
