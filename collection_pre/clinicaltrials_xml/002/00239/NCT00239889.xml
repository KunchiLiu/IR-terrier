	<brief_summary>Calcitonin has been used for many years for treating osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, and it has been shown that calcitonin reduces pain after spine and hip fracture in women with osteoporosis. Therefore, this study assesses the safety and efficacy of salmon calcitonin nasal spray on muscle strength after a forearm fracture, pain, quality of life and fracture healing in postmenopausal women.</brief_summary>
