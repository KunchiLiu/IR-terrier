	<brief_summary>The objective is to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IPX054 and carbidopa-levodopa immediate-release tablets in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who are currently being treated with a stable regimen of carbidopa-levodopa immediate-release tablets.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of IPX054 in Subjects With Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IPX054 contains two different drugs called levodopa and carbidopa in one tablet. - levodopa turns into a material called 'dopamine' in your brain. The dopamine helps to improve the symptoms of your Parkinson's disease. - carbidopa belongs to a group of medicines called 'aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitors'. It helps levodopa work more effectively by slowing the speed at which levodopa is broken down in your body.</detailed_description>
