	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosed Bcell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) defined by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Group criteria Meets 1 of the following criteria: Binet stage C disease Binet stage B disease AND ≥ 1 of the following signs or symptoms*: B symptoms (night sweats, weight loss ≥ 10% within the previous 6 months, fevers &gt; 38°C or 100.4°F for ≥ 2 weeks without evidence of infection), or constitutional symptoms (fatigue) Continuous progression (doubling of peripheral lymphocyte count within the past 6 months and absolute lymphocyte count &gt; 50 G/I) Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development/worsening of anemia and/or thrombocytopenia Massive, progressive or painful splenomegaly or hypersplenism Massive lymph nodes or lymph node clusters (&gt; 10 cm in longest diameter), danger of organ complications through large lymphoma (e.g., vascular compression or tracheal narrowing), or progressive lymphadenopathy Occurrence of symptomatic hyperviscosity problems at leukocyte counts &gt; 200 G/I (symptomatic leukostasis) NOTE: * Marked hypogammaglobulinemia or the development of a monoclonal protein in the absence of any of the above criteria for active disease is not sufficient for eligibility No Binet stage A disease No transformation to an aggressive Bcell malignancy (e.g., diffuse large cell lymphoma, Richter's syndrome, or prolymphocytic leukemia) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 01 Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) score &gt; 6 Life expectancy &gt; 6 months Bilirubin ≤ 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Alkaline phosphatase and transaminases ≤ 2 times ULN Creatinine clearance ≥ 70 mL/min Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 2 months after study treatment No known hypersensitivity with anaphylactic reaction to humanized monoclonal antibodies or any of the study drugs No cerebral dysfunction that precludes chemotherapy No active bacterial, viral, or fungal infection No clinically significant autoimmune cytopenia or Coombspositive hemolytic anemia No other active malignancy requiring concurrent treatment except basal cell carcinoma or tumors treated curatively by surgery No medical or psychological condition that would preclude study therapy No concurrent disease that requires prolonged (&gt; 1 month) therapy involving glucocorticoids PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No previous treatment of CLL by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy</criteria>
