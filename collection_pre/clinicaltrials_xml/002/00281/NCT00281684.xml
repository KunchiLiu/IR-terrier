However, if indicated this should be confirmed by oestradiol and FSH levels consistent with menopause (according to local laboratory ranges). Premenopausal females with a documented hysterectomy (medical report verification) and/or bilateral oophorectomy. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment. Subject is healthy. Healthy subjects are defined as individuals who are not taking any regular medication and are free from clinically significant illness or disease as determined by their medical history (including family history), physical examination, 12lead ECG, Holter monitor, laboratory studies, and other tests specified in this protocol. Subject is scheduled for outpatient surgical removal of up to four third molar teeth under local anesthesia.

One unit is equivalent to a halfpint (220 mL) of beer or one (25 mL) measure of spirits or one glass (125 mL) of wine.

Male subjects only: An unwillingness of male subjects to abstain from sexual intercourse with pregnant or lactating women from the time of the first dose of study medication until five halflives following administration of the last dose of study medication. An unwillingness of the male subject to use a condom/spermicide in addition to having their female partner use another form of contraception such as IUD, diaphragm with spermicide, oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone, subdermal implants or a tubal ligation if the woman could become pregnant from the time of the first dose of study medication until 84 days following administration of the last dose of study medication.

An unwillingness of the female subject to use an appropriate form of contraception. Appropriate forms of contraception are defined as: Abstinence The lifestyle of the female should be such that there is complete abstinence from intercourse from at least the commencement of their last normal period prior to the first dose of study medication and to continue until the first normal period (defined as normal for the woman, both in terms of duration and quantity of menses) after treatment or 15 days after the last dose of medication, whichever is the longest. One of the following methods is acceptable as the sole method of contraception if there is indisputable data that it is &gt;99% effective otherwise it should be used with a barrier method (condom or occlusive cap {diaphragm or cervical/vault caps} used with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository): Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception from at least the commencement of their last normal period prior to the first dose of study medication. Subjects using hormonal contraception should use a barrier method in addition from the first dose of study medication until their next normal period following the end of the study. Documented tubal ligation. Documented placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).
