	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of Paclitaxel/Carboplatin and Lonafarnib to those of Paclitaxel/Carboplatin in primary treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Paclitaxel/Carboplatin and Lonafarnib to Paclitaxel/Carboplatin for First-line Treatment of Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Today the standard therapy for patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma is paclitaxel and carboplatin. Lonafarnib is a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) that is active against a broad spectrum of tumor cell lines in vitro and tumor xenografts in nude mice. Lonafarnib has single-agent antitumor activity as well as enhanced activity in combination with taxanes in a number of tumor cell lines and in vivo models.</detailed_description>
