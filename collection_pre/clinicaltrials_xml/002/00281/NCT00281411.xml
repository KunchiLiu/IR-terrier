	<brief_summary>After endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, life-long follow-up is needed to monitor the effectiveness of exclusion of the aneurysm sac from blood flow. For this reason, aneurysm diameter and the presence of endoleaks is evaluated with CT angiography yearly after Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR). The aim of this study is to investigate the value of MRA examinations for the follow-up of these patients. The advantages of MRA with respect to CTA are no use of ionizing radiation, use of less nephrotoxic contrast agents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Follow-up of Endovascular Aneurysm Treatment - The FEAT Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FEAT trial (Follow-up of Endovascular Aneurysm Treatment) is designed as a prospective, single-center, follow-up study. 100 Patients will be enrolled in this study. These patients will undergo additional MRA-examinations the day before EVAR, the day after EVAR, 6 months and 1 year after EVAR. These patients also participate in the conventional CTA follow-up scheme which comprises a pre- and post-operative CTA and a CTA yearly thereafter. Coagulation parameters in the blood will be measured before and 1 year after EVAR.</detailed_description>
