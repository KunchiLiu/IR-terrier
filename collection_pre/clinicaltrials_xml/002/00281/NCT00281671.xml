	<brief_title>Nesiritide Use Following Cardiac Surgery in Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nesiritide, a recombinant human B-type natriuretic peptide, has vasodilatory, lusitropic and diuretic properties in healthy humans, and improves hemodynamics and symptoms in adults with decompensated congestive heart failure. Several retrospective case series suggest that nesiritide has beneficial effects on hemodynamics and urine output in adults and children following cardiac surgery. The purpose of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study is to evaluate the effects of a continuous infusion of nesiritide on postoperative hemodynamics and urine output in infants with congenital heart disease who undergo cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Patients less than 1 year of age following cardiac surgery will be eligible for the study if they have received two conventional diuretics (furosemide and chlorothiazide) for at least 12 hours, yet are not effectively achieving a negative fluid balance, thus prohibiting sternal closure or tracheal extubation. Patients will be randomized to receive either a 10-hour infusion of nesiritide, a two hour washout period, followed by a 10-hour infusion of placebo, or this study drug sequence in reverse order. During the 24-hour study period, serial cardiac output measurements and BNP levels will be obtained, vital signs and intracardiac filling pressures will be recorded, and urine output will be measured.</detailed_description>
