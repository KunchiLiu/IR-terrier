	<brief_summary>A study to investigate ropinirole for treatment of the symptoms of fibromyalgia and in particular the widespread pain associated with this condition. A total 160 subjects (80 per treatment arm) are being recruited from approximately 25 centres in 9 European countries. Male and female subjects greater than 18 years of age with a diagnosis of primary fibromyalgia, as defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, are eligible for study entry. Subjects will receive either ropinirole (1-24mg) or placebo, depending upon a statistically defined allocation to treatment. The primary endpoint is improvement in pain score by 12 weeks of treatment. An 11 point numerical rating scale for the assessment of the subject's pain is being collected on a daily diary. In addition, the overall improvement in quality of life for the subject will be assessed by means of a number of subject-completed questionnaires during the treatment period. Safety of the treatment regimen will be assessed throughout the study.</brief_summary>

Only subjects experiencing moderate/severe pain (pain intensity score &gt;= 4 on the pain numerical rating scale) will be eligible for this study. Subjects that are generally well. Have the ability to discontinue prohibited medications for the duration of the study. Exclusion criteria: Subjects with 'flare' of arthritic conditions. Evidence of clinically significant medical conditions including cardiovascular conditions (e.g. postural hypotension, and raised blood pressure, ECG abnormalities).
