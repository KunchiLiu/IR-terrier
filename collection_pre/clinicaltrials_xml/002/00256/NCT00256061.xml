	<brief_title>Assessment of Electrolyte Values in the Intensive Care Unit:Comparison Between Arterial and Venous Blood Gas Analysis and Formal Laboratory Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sudy hypothesis is that in critically ill patients there is a significant difference between electrolyte levels measured using blood gas analysers and by laboratory techniques, and between levels measured on arterial and venous blood samples. The study aim is determine the agreement between electrolyte levels measure by formal laboratory serum analysis and point-of-care blood gas analysis. Also, to determine the agreement between electrolyte levels measured on simultaneous arterial and venous blood samples, using both serum and whole blood samples.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Adult patients 18 years or older admitted to the intensive care unit 2. Patients who have arterial and central venous access insitu for clinical management purposes. 3. Patients who consent to inclusion in the study, or if the patient is not competent, the next of kins' consent.</criteria>
