	<brief_summary>The combination of cisplatin and irinotecan has significant anti-tumor activity in esophageal cancer. Oxaliplatin has been shown to have activity in combination with 5 FU and radiation in treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer. Oxaliplatin also has better side effects profile than cisplatin and may be able to overcome tumors that have developed cisplatin resistance. The standard treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer has been cisplatin, 5FU and radiation followed by possible esophagectomy. However, a large portion of these patients will relapse and the tumor may develop resistance to cisplatin and/or the cumulative toxicity from previous treatment forbids the use of cisplatin again. Weekly combination of oxaliplatin and irinotecan has been shown to be active and well tolerated in elderly population with refractory colorectal cancer. Therefore, we propose this phase II trial of a weekly oxaliplatin and irinotecan to test the effectiveness and the tolerability of this regimen in metastatic and/or recurrent esophageal cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Patients with tumors of the gastroesophageal junction were eligible if at least 50% of the tumor involved the esophagus. Patients must have locally advanced (i.e. unresectable) or metastatic disease All sites of disease must be assessed and designated as measurable or nonmeasurable disease as documented by CT, MRI, Xray physical Each of the criteria in the following section must be met in order for a patient to be eligible for registration. Patients must not have received prior chemotherapy for chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer. Chemotherapy given adjuvantly or as a radiosensitizer is allowed if more than 8 weeks have elapsed since the treatment was completed and they have recovered from any treatment related toxicity. Patients may have received prior radiotherapy if there has been complete recovery from all radiationinduced toxicities. At least 4 weeks must have been elapsed from the completion of radiation therapy to the time of registration. If lesions within the radiation port are to be used to assess response to therapy, those lesions must have demonstrated clear progression by the criteria outlined in Section 10.2d following completion of radiation therapy. Patients must not have a surgical procedure for esophageal cancer within 4 weeks prior to registration. Patients must have completely recovered from all surgery prior to registration. All patients must be 18 years of age or older Patients must have a Zubrod performance of 02 Patients with any evidence of active or uncontrolled infection, recent myocardial infection, unstable angina, or lifethreatening arrhythmia are not eligible. Patients with severe psychiatric disorder are not eligible. Patients with known brain metastasis are not eligible. However, brainimaging studies are not required for eligibility if the patient has no neurological signs or symptoms. If brainimaging studies are performed, they must be negative for disease. No other prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma, in situ cervical cancer, or adequately treated Stage I and II cancer from which the patient is in complete remission, or any other malignancy from which the patient has been diseasefree for 5 years. Patients should not have active infection. Patients should not have psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit medical followup and compliance with study protocol. Except for cancerrelated abnormalities, patients should not have unstable or preexisting major medical conditions. Patients should not have any immediate lifethreatening complications of their malignancies.</criteria>
