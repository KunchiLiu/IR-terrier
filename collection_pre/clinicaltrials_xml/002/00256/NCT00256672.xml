	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether full-time high dose prophylactic bracing (23 hours or more per day) is more effective than low dose bracing (12 hours or less per day) in preventing or delaying spinal curve progression in children with scoliosis after spinal cord injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Bracing in Preventing Scoliosis in Children With Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized control trial to determine the effectiveness of high dose bracing (≥ 23 hours per day) and low dose bracing (≤ 12 hours per day) in skeletally immature children with Spinal Cord Injury. Subjects will be randomized into either a prophylactic high dose-bracing group (≥ 23 hours per day) or low dose-bracing group (≤ 12 hours per day). Subjects will be stratified by age (younger than age 10 and older than age 10), and curve severity (&lt; 20 degrees and 20-40 degrees) using a matching random blocks design.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Children with C5 to L2 SCI. 2. ASIA impairment levels A, B, or C. 3. Age greater than 5 up to one year before end of growth (14 in girls, 16 in boys) 4. A single structural curve &lt;40 degrees or a double curve &lt;40 degrees where the largest compensatory curve is &lt;25 degrees on bending film. 5. Children at risk for Paralytic Scoliosis 6. Ability to follow simple instructions. 1. Curve magnitude &gt;40 degrees, pressure sores over the trunk. 2. Inability to tolerate TLSO wears. 3. Structural compensatory curves of 25 degrees or greater (double structural curves). 4. Severe Traumatic Brain Injury, TBI (8 and below on Glasgow Coma Scale). 5. Cognitive Impairment 6.
