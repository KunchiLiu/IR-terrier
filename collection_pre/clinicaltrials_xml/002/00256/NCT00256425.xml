	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether cognitive rehabilitation is effective in patients with gliomas (brain tumour), by comparing direct and follow-up neuropsychological functioning and quality of life of the experimental group to the control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Rehabilitation of Glioma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority of patients with (low-grade) glioma exhibit cognitive symptoms and objective deficits, which have a sustained, negative impact on daily functioning and quality of life. Adult patients with a low-grade glioma, either histologically proven, or suspected (1), as well as adult anaplastic glioma patients with favorable prognostic factors (2), who are clinically stable for at least 6 months, will be recruited from 9 hospitals in the Netherlands. Consenting patients with both subjective cognitive symptoms and objective deficits will be randomized to either the cognitive rehabilitation program (N = 75) or a "waiting-list" control group (N = 75). Upon completion of the study, those patients assigned to the control group will be given the opportunity to undergo the cognitive rehabilitation program. The cognitive rehabilitation program incorporates both retraining of impaired cognitive functions, and teaching of compensatory strategies. Rehabilitation will be directed towards attention, memory and executive functioning. The intervention will consist of 6 weekly, individual, 2-hour sessions plus two hours of homework. To evaluate the efficacy of the rehabilitation program, objective neuropsychological functioning, self-reported cognitive symptoms and health-related quality of life will be assessed before rehabilitation, directly following rehabilitation, and at 6-month follow-up.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>adult patients with a histologically proven lowgrade glioma or presumed (i.e., suspected) lowgrade glioma based on both clinical and MR imaging feature, and adult patients with an anaplastic glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma) under age 50 and with good performance status (KPS &gt; 70); who are clinically stable for a minimum of 6 months prior to study entry (as determined by recent CT or MRI imaging) and no antitumor treatment during that period of time (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, corticosteroids); who report at least one symptom of impaired cognitive functioning based on a standardized selfreport questionnaire, administered by researcher; and who meet criteria for neuropsychological impairment based on objective test results (assessed by researcher). lack of basic proficiency in Dutch; IQ below 85; severe reading problems; an additional (history of) neurological or psychiatric disorder; participating in a concurrent study in which neuropsychological testing and/or healthrelated quality of life assessments are involved</criteria>
