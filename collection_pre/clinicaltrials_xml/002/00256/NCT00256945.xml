	<brief_summary>In this study we intend to find out the pattern of biofilm accumulation in vivo on various surface finishings. Our intention is to prepare Polymethylmetacrylate squers on orthodontical brackets,then prepare the surface of the sample and measure the surface roughness with a profilimeter and get the mean value in Ra units, then place the brackets on lower premolars and molars for 12 hours, remove them and examine the biofilm formed with confocal scanning microscope.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surface Roughness of a Dental Restorative Material and Biofilm Formation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies in the past to assess the effects of surface roughness on the amount of plaque accumulation in vitro, whereas only few performed a modern in vitro assessment of the plaque accumulation. In this study we intend to find out the pattern of biofilm accumulation in vivo on various surface finishings. Our intention is to prepare Polymethylmetacrylate squers on orthodontical brackets,then prepare the surface of the sample and measure the surface roughness with a profilimeter and get the mean value in Ra units, then place the brackets on lower premolars and molars for 12 hours, remove them and examine the biofilm formed with confocal scanning microscope. Statistical evaluation of pilot study determined the need to perform this research on twelve(12) candidates. It is our intention to check two materials in each candidate: composite resin and polymethylmetacrylate.</detailed_description>
