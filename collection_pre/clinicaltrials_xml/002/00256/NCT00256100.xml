	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to assess the safety and effectiveness of fondaparinux, a new drug to prevent blood clotting in the continuous dialysis machine used in intensive care patients who have kidney failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fondaparinux as an Anticoagulant in Haemofiltration in Patients With Acute Kidney Failure.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study hypothesis is that when used as an anticoagulant in haemofiltration, fondaparinux prolongs the filter life when compared to enoxaparin. Fondaparinux is the first compound of a new class of synthetic oligosaccharides with antithrombotic effects. It represents the active portion of the natural heparin molecule. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in filter life when using fondaparinux or enoxaparin as anticoagulation for haemofiltration.</detailed_description>
