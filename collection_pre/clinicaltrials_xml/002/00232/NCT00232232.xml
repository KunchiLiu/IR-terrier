	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether fish oils may be of benefit to patients with certain heart rhythm disturbances called atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are two heart conditions that can be successfully treated in the hospital by an ablation (in the case of atrial flutter) or a cardioversion (in the case of atrial fibrillation). Ablation involves the application of high frequency energy waves to a particular spot in the heart. Cardioversion involves resetting the heart back to a normal rhythm with the use of an electric current. Fish oil supplements may be of benefit to patients with heart problems. Recent evidence suggests that fish oils may benefit those with rhythm disturbances.</brief_summary>
