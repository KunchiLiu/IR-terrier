	<brief_title>Quetiapine for Cocaine Use and Cravings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems are involved in cocaine use and cravings. Atypical antipsychotics act on these neurotransmitter systems, and therefore, may be beneficial in the treatment of cocaine addiction. This open label study assessed the efficacy of quetiapine for the treatment of cocaine use and craving in non-psychotic, cocaine dependent participants over 6 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome measures included self-report of cocaine use and self-report of cocaine cravings. This study also evaluated whether the severity of addiction predicts quetiapine efficacy. Males and females, ages 18 - 65, with a DSM IV diagnosis of cocaine dependence were recruited for an open label trial of quetiapine dosed at 300-600 mg/day, with a target dose of 600 mg/day. Subjects were followed at weekly study visits to monitor general psychiatric and physical status, medication compliance, efficacy, and adverse events. Study participation included psychiatric and medical examinations, an electrocardiogram, an eye exam, laboratory tests, urine drug screens, electrocardiograms, and psychiatric and substance abuse interviews. Twenty-three males were initiated on quetiapine treatment, the following results include the first twenty-two study completers. Twenty-two males (36-56 years) diagnosed with cocaine dependence without a psychotic disorder, were initiated on a six-week, open-label trial of quetiapine, 300-600 mg/day (QHS). Five participants discontinued prior to completing the first week of treatment, and 14 of 22 subjects completed the study. The mean dose of quetiapine was 429 mg/day. An intent-to-treat analysis found a significant decrease in cravings on the Brief Substance Craving Scale after six weeks (p &lt; 0.01, Cohen's d = 1.23; repeated measures mixed effects random regression). Cocaine use, addiction severity, and psychopathology also decreased numerically, but not statistically, from baseline to end of study. Adverse effects were generally mild. Addiction severity did not predict quetiapine efficacy. Four subjects withdrew due to sedation; 2 were discontinued by the investigators, and 2 were lost to follow up. Study completers experienced a statistically significant mean weight gain of approximately 4.60 (95% CI, -6.05 - 3.17 kg)(mean baseline weight 86.9 (SD 18.38) kg). Quetiapine treatment appears to have improved cocaine dependence, specifically cocaine cravings, in non-psychotic individuals. The observed weight change may reflect both weight gain associated with cocaine dependence and medication side effect. Controlled research is warranted to better define the potential role for quetiapine in the treatment of cocaine dependence.</detailed_description>
