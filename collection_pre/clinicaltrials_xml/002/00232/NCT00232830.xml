	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of the CYPHER™ (CYPHER SELECT™) (Sirolimus-eluting) stent in reducing the occurrence of a composite endpoint of target vessel failure (TVF) in subjects treated for acute myocardial infarction as compared to a bare metal stent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study to Assess AMI Treated With Balloon Angioplasty.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an international, multicenter (up to 52 sites), randomized, single-blind study in patients with an acute myocardial infarction treated with the CYPHER™ (Sirolimus-eluting) stent as compared to the bare stents. Patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions will be treated with the CYPHER™ (Sirolimus-eluting) stent or a bare stent. Subjects will be followed at 30 days, 6 months and at 1, 3, 4 and 5 years post-procedure. 200 subjects will have an angiographic follow-up at 8 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Have prolonged, continuous (lasting at least 20 minutes) chest pain despite administration of nitrates and onset within 12 hours of randomization, and one of the following: 1. ST segment elevation &gt;=1mm in standard leads and &gt;=2mm in 2 or more contiguous precordial leads with reciprocal ST depression 2. New or presumably new left bundle branch block (LBBB) 2. The culprit lesion must be identified on a de novo native coronary artery and an emergency angioplasty must be possible. The culprit site must be visualized before the stent implantation; 1. Killip class &gt; 2 upon arrival to the cathlab; 2. Significant (&gt;50%) stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion that might require revascularization or impede inflow or runoff; 3. Evidence of massive thrombus in the infarct related artery distally to the culprit lesion; 4. Documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;=30%; 5. Target lesion is located in an arterial or venous bypass graft; 6. ECG documented evidence of prior myocardial infarction; 7. Patient who received thrombolytic therapy for the current AMI before enrollment in this study.</criteria>
