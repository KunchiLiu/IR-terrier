	<detailed_description>Specific Aims and Research Questions Aim 1: To compare adolescents’ levels of reporting of their own reproductive health knowledge, attitudes and behaviors using three survey methodologies: (1) Face-to-face interview (2) Audio-CASI (Computer Assisted Self Interview) and (3) a culturally appropriate interactive methodology. The following hypothesis will be tested: • Overall, adolescents will be more likely to divulge their own reproductive knowledge, attitudes and behaviors with Audio-CASI and the interactive method as compared to face-to-face interviews. Levels of knowledge, attitudes and behaviors will vary by education, age and gender. Aim 2: To compare respondents’ levels of comfort, accuracy and honesty with the survey methodologies (i.e. face to face, audio-CASI and interactive methodology) to their reporting of knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to sexual and reproductive health.</detailed_description>
