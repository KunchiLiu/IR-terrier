	<detailed_description>Abnormality of diastolic function, particularly a more advanced form known as restrictive tilling pattern, has been correlated with worse outcome in patients with systolic dysfunction associated with chronic heart failure or following an acute myocardial infarction. Recently, the severity of diastolic dysfunction has also been shown to predict the response to cardiac synchronization therapy for refractory heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. Varying degree of diastolic dysfunction has been reported among patients with comparable severity of systolic dysfunction. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed discordance between systolic and diastolic dysfunction in these patients remains incompletely understood. The carboxy-terminal of procollagen type I (PICP), a peptide that is cleaved from procollagen type I during the synthesis of fibril-forming collagen type I, has been associated with myocardial fibrosis. Myocardial fibrosis is a major determinant of both systolic and diastolic function of the heart. We hypothesize that differential degrees of myocardial fibrosis may be responsible for these discrepancies.</detailed_description>
