	<brief_summary>Dose dense therapy has been shown to increase survival in the adjuvant setting of breast cancer. It is unknown if dose dense therapy will improve survival in tumors that express her-2. This study evaluates a neoadjuvant regimen containing carboplatin, taxotere and herceptin when used in a dose dense manner in patients with large breast cancers. The endpoint of pathologic complete response is used as a surrogate marker for survival.</brief_summary>
