	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to assess the safety and performance of the sirolimus coated Cordis SMART™ nitinol self expandable stent device and its delivery system in the treatment of obstructive superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease in reducing percent in-stent mean lumen diameter stenosis in de novo or restenotic native lesions as compared to the uncoated SMART™ stent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the SMART Stent in the Treatment SFA Disease.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, double blind, two-arm feasibility study evaluating the safety and performance of the sirolimus coated Cordis SMART™ nitinol self-expanding stent and delivery system as compared to the uncoated SMART™ stent and delivery system. It is anticipated that a total of 90 patients will be entered into the study. Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis of coated to uncoated stents. Ninety (90) patients with de novo or restenotic native SFA lesions will be randomized to the Sirolimus Coated SMART™ nitinol self-expanding stent or to the uncoated (bare) SMART™ stent. Patients will be followed for 24 months post-procedure, with all patients having duplex ultrasound and clinical assessments at discharge, 1, 6, 9, 18 and 24 months, angiography at 6 six months and plain X-ray at 18 months. This study will be conducted at nine investigational sites. (Protocol was amended where 56 additional patients were recruited and followed for up to 5 years.)</detailed_description>
