	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether fish oil supplements may reduce the frequency and duration of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation episodes. Atrial fibrillation is a heart condition which effects a large percentage of the population . Atrial fibrillation is a condition frequently experienced by people who have had pacemakers inserted . Certain Pacemakers have sophisticated monitoring features that are able to recognise episodes of atrial fibrillation. Fish oil supplements may be of benefit to patients with heart problems.Recent evidence suggests that fish oils may be beneficial to patients with rhythm disturbances. By interrogating pacemakers this study will investigate the effect of fish oil supplements on the frequency and duration of episodes of atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
