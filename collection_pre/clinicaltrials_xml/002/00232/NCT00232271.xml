	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of the anticoagulant(blood thinner) Clexane on the development of leg clots following electrophysiology studies (EPS) and or radiofrequency ablation (RFA). People who suffer heart palpitations will sometimes need hospital admission to undergo an electrophysiology study ( and or a Radiofrequency Ablation)in order to diagnose and or treat their condition. Radiofrequency ablation is a procedure to stop abnormal heart rhythms. EPS/RFA studies require the puncture of the leg veins . Previous experience has shown that following the puncture of leg veins there is a small risk of developing a blood clot in the leg. It is not known whether giving blood thinners (anticoagulants) after the procedure will decrease this risk Enoxaparin Sodium (Clexane) is an anticoagulant used extensively and safely following bone (Orthopaedic) surgery to prevent blood clots from developing in the legs</brief_summary>
