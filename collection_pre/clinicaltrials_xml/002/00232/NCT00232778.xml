	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are: 1. To show a reduction in the late thrombosis (LT) rate following percutaneous revascularization using current interventional techniques with new stent placement and intravascular radiation therapy (IRT) with a long-term antiplatelet regimen (12 months) compared to the stented patients on short-term antiplatelet regimen (2 months) from the IRT arm of GAMMA I Trial. 2. To show equivalence in the LT rate following percutaneous revascularization using current interventional techniques without new stent placement and IRT with a long-term antiplatelet regimen (6 months) compared to non-stented patients on short term antiplatelet therapy (2 months or less) from a pooling of the IRT arms of the GAMMA I, SCRIPPS, and WRIST Trials.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. The patient has a restenosis of &gt;60% (by subjective angiographic determination of the minimal luminal diameter compared to the distal reference diameter) within a native coronary artery which has previously undergone stent placement. 2. The patient has a history, signs of, or laboratory studies that suggest coronary ischemia attributable to the target stenosis. 3. The study target lesion must be located in a restenotic native coronary artery measuring &gt;2.75 and &lt;4.0 mm in diameter and 45 mm in length. The target lesion must have undergone coronary interventional treatment &gt;4 weeks previously. 4. The vessel 1 cm distal to the target lesion is &gt;2.5 mm in diameter. 5 Patients age must be &gt;18 years and &lt;85 years. 1. Attempts to treat lesions in other vessels during the procedure were unsuccessful. 2. The patient sustained a recent (&lt;72 hours) myocardial infarction defined as a serum CK 2x the upper limit of normal and elevated MB. 3. Serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dl. 4. The left ventricular ejection fraction is &lt;40%.</criteria>
