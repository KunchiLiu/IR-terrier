	<brief_title>Investigation of a Combination Treatment of Escitalopram and rTMS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We intend to test in a randomized, rater blinded, placebo controlled, prospective study the primary hypothesis that an escitalopram-rTMS-combination treatment is more efficacious in the treatment of refractory major depression assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale compared to placebo. A second hypothesis is that the treatment of MDE with escitalopram (that means in the "Placebo group") alone lead to typical changes like - An increase in neurotrophic factors concentration (measured by blood concentrations of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived nerve growth factor (BDNF), - An increase in hippocampal metabolites (measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS - An increase in motor cortical inhibitory activity (measured with motor evoked potentials (MEP - An increase in serotonergic activity (measured with EEG parameters, Moreover, it is hypothesized that similar but pronounced changes occur in the group treated with the combination treatment.</detailed_description>
