	<brief_title>Melphalan, Prednisone and Thalidomide Versus Melphalan and Prednisone in Elderly Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intermittent courses of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) have been the first line therapy in multiple myeloma, for many years. Advances in systemic and supportive therapy increased remission rates and overall survival, but multiple myeloma still remains an incurable haematological malignancy. Several preliminary studies demonstrate the efficacy of thalidomide in refractory and relapsed multiple myeloma with an overall response rate of 30 to 60%. Due to its activity, Thalidomide will be evaluated in association with MP in a randomized study for newly diagnosed myeloma patients not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
