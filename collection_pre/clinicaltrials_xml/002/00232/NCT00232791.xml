	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the CYPHER SELECT™ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent in reducing angiographic in-stent late loss in de novo native coronary lesions as compared to the CYPHER ™ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study to Compare Cypher Versus Cypher Select in Treating Cornary Artery Lesions.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter (up to 10 sites), open, prospective, 2-arm, unbalanced, randomized study designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the CYPHER SELECT™ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent as compared to the CYPHER™ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent. A total of 100 patients will be entered in the study and will be randomized on a 2:1 basis to the CYPHER SELECT™ stent or the CYPHER™ stent. 100 patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions &lt;23 mm in length and more than 2.5 to less than 3.5 mm in diameter by visual estimate who meet all eligibility criteria will be either randomized.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald Classification B&amp;C, IIIIII) OR patients with documented silent ischemia; 2. Single treatment of de novo lesion in a coronary artery which can be appropriately covered by a study stent up to 23mm in length in patients with single or multivessel disease; patients with multiple lesions can be included only if the other lesions are successfully treated before the target lesion; 3. Target lesion is more than 2.5 and less than 3.5mm in diameter (visual estimate); 4. Target lesion is located in a native coronary artery with a maximum lesion length that can be adequately covered by a single 23 mm stent; 5. Target lesion stenosis is &gt; 50% and &lt; 100% (visual estimate). 1. A Qwave or nonQwave myocardial infarction within the preceding 72 hours unless the CK and CKMB enzymes are back to normal; 2. Unprotected left main coronary disease with more than 50% stenosis; 3. Significant (&gt;50%) stenoses proximal or distal to the target lesion that might require revascularization or impede runoff; 4. Have an ostial target lesion; 5. Angiographic evidence of thrombus within target lesion; 6. Calcified lesions which cannot be successfully predilated; 7. Ejection fraction less than 30%; 8. Totally occluded vessel (TIMI 0 level); 9. Direct Stenting;</criteria>
