	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is an important chronic disease of adults, affecting an estimated 4% of men and 2% of women in the United States. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been demonstrated to ameliorate the symptoms and neurobehavioral consequences of OSAS. Unfortunately, patient adherence with prescribed CPAP is low, diminishing the benefits obtained from this expensive therapy. Nurse-administered patient education and monitoring of CPAP use through home visits has been shown to be effective in significantly improving CPAP adherence. Given the logistic complexity of delivering this service and its costs, it is unlikely to be disseminated widely into clinical practice. An alternative, using advanced telecommunications technology to deliver similar adherence improvement services, is proposed for study. Objective(s): Use of telecommunications systems with other important health-related behaviors such as medication-taking, diet, and exercise have demonstrated significant improvements in therapy adherence. Methods: This research project represents a randomized controlled trial of a Telephone-Linked Communications (TLC) system designed to improve CPAP adherence (TLC-CPAP). The study will enroll adults with OSAS who are being started on nasal CPAP therapy. Subjects will be randomized to TLC-CPAP or an attention placebo control group. The effect of TLC on CPAP use and on disease-specific quality of life (QOL), OSAS-related symptoms, depression, and vigilance over a 12-month interval will be assessed. The intervention and control groups will be compared to assess differences in potential confounders including age, sex, OSAS severity, CPAP pressure level, comorbid illness, physician specialty status, BMI, socioeconomic status, and marital status. Each of the outcome variables (all of which are continuous variables) will be compared between intervention and control groups using multivariate analyses to adjust for any potential confounders that differ between groups. Multivariate models will include appropriate tests of interactions. All analyses will be performed using an intent-to-treat approach. Status: Completed Impact: This Telephone-Linked Communications (TLC) technology offers an effective, low-cost, and easy-to-use means of providing disease-specific education, monitoring, and counseling to improve adherence with therapy.</detailed_description>
