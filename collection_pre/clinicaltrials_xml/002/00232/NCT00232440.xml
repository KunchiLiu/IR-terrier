	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy has a well-established role in the treatment of Hodgkin's Disease and non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. With technological developments, 3-D Dimensional (3D) planning has evolved as a highly precise treatment planning option. High-precision radiation therapy has the potential for more accurate dose delivery to the tumour volume and can result in a greater sparing of normal tissue. An important component of safe radiotherapy delivery is the feasibility and reproducibility of current and new immobilization devices for highly conformal treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine the reproducibility of an immobilization device known as BodyFIX(TM) using conventional treatment techniques.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients undergoing curative or palliative treatment in whom it is considered that immobilization of part or all of an anatomical region would be of benefit to their care. Any case where ideal treatment may be compromised with use of immobilization method. If the patient has any social issues, language barriers resulting in difficulties comprehending the nature of the study, or poor performance status, that could compromise compliance with the study guidelines.</criteria>
