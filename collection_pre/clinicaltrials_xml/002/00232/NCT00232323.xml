	<brief_title>Simulation Training as a Tool to Decrease Occupational Stress in ICU Personnel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient safety and the prevention of medical error are primary goals of healthcare organizations. Stress reduction may reduce or ameliorate such errors. Simulation training, using advanced patient simulators, has been shown to improve diagnostic, resuscitation and technical skills amongst physicians and nurses.We intend to check wether stress during ICU shifts may be reduced by using specifically designed scenarios based on real life experience,in integrative multidisciplinary ICU teams.</detailed_description>
