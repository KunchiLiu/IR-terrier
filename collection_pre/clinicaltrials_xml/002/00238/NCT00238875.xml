	<brief_title>A Phase II Study of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Patients With T1N0M0 Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (JCOG0403)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of SBRT for T1N0M0 non-small cell lung cancer，the following questions should be answered. Can SRT be an alternative standard treatment modality for inoperable patients? Can SRT can be a comparable standard treatment modality with lobectomy for operable patients? 12 Gy is the daily dose at the isocenter，and 48 Gy in total by 4 fractions will be irradiated by stereotactic irradiation over 4 to 8 days.</detailed_description>
