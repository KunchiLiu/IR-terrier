	<brief_summary>This is an investigator-sponsored research study to evaluate if treatment with HFA-134a beclomethasone (QVAR) has an effect on peripheral (or outer) airway inflammation and airway "remodeling" or scarring in subjects with COPD. Approximately 20 subjects with COPD will participate for approximately 7 weeks, with 10 receiving an active (BDP) inhaler with HFA-134a and 10 receiving a placebo.</brief_summary>
