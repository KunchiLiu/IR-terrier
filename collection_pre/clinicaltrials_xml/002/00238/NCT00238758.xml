Participants will be followed up weekly and will be asked to rate their mood daily for the 6 week study period. Blood samples will be taken pre and post treatment to measure change in omega-3 levels. At the end of 6 weeks all participants will receive a further 8 weeks supply of omega-3.</detailed_description>
