	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well vorinostat works in treating patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vorinostat, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Vorinostat may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving vorinostat before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving it after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of vorinostat (SAHA), in terms of 6-month progression-free survival, in patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this drug in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. II. Determine the biologic effect of this drug in target tissues, including primary tumor tissue, in these patients. III. Correlate genetic alteration of tumors with response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to planned surgery (yes [stratum 1] vs no [stratum 2]) and number of prior chemotherapy regimens for progressive/recurrent disease (≤ 1 [stratum 1A] vs ≥ 2 [stratum 1B]). STRATUM 1: Patients receive oral vorinostat (SAHA) twice daily for 2 weeks. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (not undergoing surgery) STRATUM 2: Beginning 3 days prior to surgery, patients receive oral SAHA once or twice daily for a total of 6 doses. Patients then undergo surgery to remove the tumor. Beginning within 1-4 weeks after surgery, patients receive oral SAHA twice daily for 2 weeks. (undergoing surgery) Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
