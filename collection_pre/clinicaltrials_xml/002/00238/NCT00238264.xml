	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy works in treating young patients with gliomas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Young Patients With Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the marginal-failure rate in young patients with low-grade gliomas treated with reduced-field conformal radiotherapy. Secondary - Determine the progression-free survival, event-free survival, and overall survival rates of young patients treated with this regimen. - Determine quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate MIB-1 labeling index with progression-free survival and overall survival of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo reduced-field conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline or 6 weeks after completion of study treatment and then at 2 and 5 years (closed as of 10/27/2010). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
