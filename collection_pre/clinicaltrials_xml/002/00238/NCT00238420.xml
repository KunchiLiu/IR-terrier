	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving paclitaxel together with radiation therapy with or without trastuzumab and to see how well it works to kill any remaining tumor cells in patients who have undergone surgery for bladder cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Paclitaxel may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving paclitaxel together with radiation therapy and trastuzumab may kill more tumor cells. Giving these treatments after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel and Radiation Therapy With or Without Trastuzumab in Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery for Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To determine the acute toxicity (=&lt; 90 days from protocol treatment start) from chemoradiotherapy including paclitaxel +/- trastuzumab and irradiation in non-cystectomy patients with or without her2/neu overexpression, abbreviated as HER2+ and HER2-, respectively. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the ability of patients with bladder cancer who are non-cystectomy candidates to complete this treatment program. II. To evaluate the efficacy of this treatment program in achieving a complete response of the primary tumor. III. To measure the 5-year disease-free and overall survival of patients with bladder cancer treated with transurethral resection of the bladder followed by chemoradiotherapy. IV. To estimate the value of tumor and/or serum biomarkers as predictors of initial tumor response and recurrence-free survival. OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups according to HER2/neu status (HER2/neu 2+ or 3+ staining [group 1] vs HER2/neu 0 or 1+ staining [group 2]). GROUP I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 and trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and then over 30 minutes on days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43. Patients also undergo radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, 43-47, and 50. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. GROUP II: Patients receive paclitaxel and undergo radiotherapy as in group 1. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4-5 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
