	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Voriconazole and caspofungin acetate may control invasive fungal infections in patients who have weakened immune systems. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving voriconazole together with caspofungin acetate works in treating invasive fungal infections in patients with weakened immune systems.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Voriconazole and Caspofungin Acetate in Treating Invasive Fungal Infections in Patients With Weakened Immune Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the 12-week complete and partial response rate in immunocompromised patients with invasive fungal infections treated with voriconazole and caspofungin acetate. Secondary - Determine the 12-week survival rate in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive voriconazole orally or IV over 1 hour twice daily and caspofungin acetate IV over 1 hour once daily on days 1-84. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
