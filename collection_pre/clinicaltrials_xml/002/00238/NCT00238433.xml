	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemotherapy, such as busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa, may destroy cancerous blood-forming cells (stem cells) in the blood and bone marrow. Giving the patient their healthy stem cells will help their bone marrow make new stem cells that become red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa work in treating patients who are undergoing an autologous stem cell transplant for Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Busulfan, Melphalan, and Thiotepa in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant for Hodgkin's or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the therapeutic efficacy of a myeloablative preparative regimen comprising busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation in patients with Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Determine the toxic effects of this preparative regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: - Myeloablative preparative regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -8 to -6, melphalan IV over 15-30 minutes on days -5 and -4, and thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2. - Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation: Patients undergo PBSC transplantation on day 0 followed by filgrastim (G-CSF) IV over 30 minutes beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover. - Intrathecal chemotherapy: Patients with a history of treated CNS disease or at high-risk for CNS relapse receive methotrexate and cytarabine intrathecally (IT) for 2 doses each within 10 days prior to transplantation and 4-6 doses each beginning on day 32 post-transplantation. - Consolidation therapy: Patients with residual bulk disease at 80-100 days post-transplantation that is &gt; 2.5 cm by CT scan may undergo local radiotherapy to residual scar/disease provided it can be encompassed in a single radiation port and the volume of lung to be irradiated is ≤ 20%. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed weekly for 1 month, monthly for 6 months, every 3 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of 1 of the following: Intermediate or highgrade nonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), meeting 1 of the following criteria: In first complete remission (CR) AND at highrisk for relapse, as defined by all of the following criteria: High ageadjusted International Prognostic Index category AND meets the following criteria at diagnosis: Stage III or IV disease Lactic dehydrogenase abnormal ECOG 02 Mantle cell histology Primary refractory disease Beyond first CR Lowgrade NHL Beyond second relapse Hodgkin's lymphoma Primary refractory disease OR beyond first CR Must have an adequate number of stored autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) (i.e., 2.0 x 10^6 CD34positive cells/kg) Patients who are not able to mobilize a sufficient number of PBSCs may use bone marrow instead No active CNS disease NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
