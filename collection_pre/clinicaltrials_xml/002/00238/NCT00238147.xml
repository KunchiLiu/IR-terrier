	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, carboplatin, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Capecitabine may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of docetaxel when given together with carboplatin and capecitabine followed by chemoradiotherapy in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for locally advanced esophageal cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of docetaxel when administered with carboplatin and capecitabine as neoadjuvant induction therapy in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. Secondary - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the clinical and pathological response in these patients treated with neoadjuvant induction therapy comprising docetaxel, carboplatin, and capecitabine followed by chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of docetaxel. - Induction therapy: Patients receive docetaxel IV and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Approximately 7 days after completion of induction therapy, patients proceed to chemoradiotherapy. - Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-42 and undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, on days 1-40. - Surgery: Approximately 4-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo surgery. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
