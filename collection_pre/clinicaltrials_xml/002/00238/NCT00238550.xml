	<brief_summary>The study is designed to investigate the benefit of adding CBME to the existing treatment regime in the management of painful neuropathy. Hypothesis: 1. The addition of CBME to the existing treatment regime will result in a significant improvement in both primary and secondary outcome measures. 2. The side effect profile and tolerability of CBME will be minimal and comparable to placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. To investigate the benefit of adding CBME to the existing treatment regime in the management of painful neuropathy. 2. To study the tolerability and side effect profile of CBME. 3. To study the effects of CBME treatment on vibration perception thresholds (VPT) and nerve conduction study parameters. 4. To evaluate the effects of CBME on central nervous system deep nuclei using MR Spectroscopy.</detailed_description>

Anticipated foreign travel within the first 15 weeks of the trial. Participants in other research studies currently or within the previous three months. Current or past history of substance abuse. Previous or current history of consuming more than 20 units of alcohol a week. Neuropathy due to other aetiologies. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any of the excipients of the study medications. Known or suspected adverse reaction to cannabinoids.
