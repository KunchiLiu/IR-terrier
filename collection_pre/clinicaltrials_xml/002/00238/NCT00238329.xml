	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: PEG-interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells. Biological therapies, such as thalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. PEG-interferon alfa-2b and thalidomide may also stop the growth of melanoma by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving PEG-interferon alfa-2b together with thalidomide may be an effective treatment for melanoma. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving PEG-interferon alfa-2b together with thalidomide works in treating patients with recurrent or metastatic melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PEG-Interferon Alfa-2b and Thalidomide in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent or metastatic malignant melanoma treated with PEG-interferon alfa-2b and thalidomide. - Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously once weekly and oral thalidomide once daily. Treatment continues for at least 2 weeks but no more than 8 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b and thalidomide for 2 months beyond documentation of CR. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 14-38 months.</detailed_description>
