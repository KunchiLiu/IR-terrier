	<brief_summary>This project will expand current knowledge of reproductive biology in women with bipolar disorder as well as assessing the impact of lamotrigine use for the treatment of bipolar disorder on reproductive function. Specifically, this study examines mood over the menstrual cycle and ovulation for three consecutive menstrual cycles in women treated for bipolar I, II, or NOS (not otherwise specified) with lamotrigine. In addition, testosterone and lipid concentrations will be measured before the participant starts receiving lamotrigine, as well as six months after receiving lamotrigine.</brief_summary>
