	<brief_summary>The University of Ottawa and Élisabeth Bruyère Research Institute are conducting a study of preventive care for frail patients at risk of functional decline. At risk patients are assigned by chance to continue receiving their standard care from their family physician or receive additional care from a nurse practitioners and a pharmacist. In collaboration with the family physician, they develop an individualized care plan, a treatment and management road plan, for each patient, which they implement over the study period of one approximately year. The objective of the study is to compare the effectiveness of the model of care that includes the nurse practitioners and pharmacist against standard care in preventing functional decline, to determine the acceptability of this model of care to patients, their caregivers and the medical team, and to evaluate the cost implication of the program.</brief_summary>
