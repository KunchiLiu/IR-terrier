	<detailed_description>Postoperative sub-Tenon Triamcinolone Acetonide in glaucoma filtering surgery Objectives: Trabeculectomy is a surgical procedure designed to reduce internal eye pressure by draining fluid from within the eye to the sub-conjunctival (superficial eye lining) space. Scar formation from conjunctival and Tenon's capsule fibroblast proliferation represents the most common cause of failure of trabeculectomies. A number of drugs have been use to prevent failure of trabeculectomies from the scarring process including intraoperative mitomycin C (MMC) and preoperative Triamcinalone Acetonide (TA). Over the past several years, intraoperative MMC has become a preferred method of preventing scar formation. This study looks to determine in a prospective, double-blind, randomized method the long-term efficacy and safety of MMC with postoperative TA compared to the standard practice of intraoperative MMC with postoperative prednisolone acetate drops in preventing scar related failures of trabeculectomies.</detailed_description>
