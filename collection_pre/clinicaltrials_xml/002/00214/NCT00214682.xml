	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether folate and vitamin B12, physical activity and mental health literacy can prevent depression, and folate and vitamin B12 and physical activity can prevent cognitive impairment in older people. Also the study aims to assess the benefits for older people in improving their knowledge about mental health in relation to depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Beyond Ageing Project: A Study for the Prevention of Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While preventive efforts for depression have tended to focus on adolescent and young adult populations, other stages of the lifespan also provide opportunities for prevention. With older people, there are certain risk and aetiological factors, which become more prominent and require preventive action at that point in the lifespan. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of various interventions in preventing depression and cognitive decline among older people who are at high risk of developing major depression because they are currently suffering from depressive symptoms. The study has three interventions; i) folate and vitamin B12, ii) physical activity; and iii) mental health literacy. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive each combination of the interventions (folate and vitamin B12 or placebo, physical activity intervention programme or physical activity no-intervention control, mental health literacy intervention [containing written modules with information about depression that is relevant to older people] or mental health literacy no-intervention control group). Participants will receive these interventions over a two-year period with regular assessments across that time period.</detailed_description>
