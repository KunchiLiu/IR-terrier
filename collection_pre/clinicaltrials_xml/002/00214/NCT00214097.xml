	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the clinical feasibility of using IMRT combined with daily pretreatment prostate localization to deliver increasingly hypofractionated treatment courses. Progressively larger fraction sizes will be delivered in a phase I design based on both acute and long-term tolerances to the treatment. The dose-per-fraction escalation design utilizes schemas that maintain an isoeffective dose for late effects, while predicting that tumor control will actually improve. The delivery of fewer, larger fractions of radiation, if proven effective and safe, would result in significant cost saving and more efficient use of resources.</brief_summary>
