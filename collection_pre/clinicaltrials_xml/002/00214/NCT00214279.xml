	<brief_summary>Part 1 of the study is to gradually withdraw steroids in a group of 50 older renal transplant recipients, converting then from the 3 drug regimen to a 2 drug regimen (cyclosporine and MMF), while carefully monitoring their graft function. 25 subjects would serve as control patients in the study and would remain on the 3 drug regimen (steroids, cyclosporine and MMF). Immunologic status will be determined before and after IS withdrawal using a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) transfer test previously described in the original submission. Both the steroid withdrawal subjects and the control subjects will undergo the DTH testing throughout the 3 years of study participation.</brief_summary>
