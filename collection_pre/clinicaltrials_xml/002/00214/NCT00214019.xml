	<brief_summary>This study is designed to test the hypothesis that salmeterol use, and not fluticasone use or the combination treatment with fluticasone and salmeterol, is associated with a greater number of sputum eosinophils following antigen challenge and, under these circumstances, the migrating peripheral blood eosinophils are less adherent.</brief_summary>
