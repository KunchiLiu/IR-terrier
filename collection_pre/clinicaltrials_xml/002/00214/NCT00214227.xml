	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the baseline incidence of variant alleles in the ATM and/or other DNA repair genes present in the Native American population versus the non-Native American population. It is thought that a higher baseline incidence of the variant alleles in the ATM gene may correlate to higher rates and higher grades of radiation toxicities noted in the Native American population.</brief_summary>
