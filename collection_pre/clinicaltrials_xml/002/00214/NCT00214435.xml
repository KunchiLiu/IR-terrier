	<brief_summary>Poor compliance is thought to be a major cause of treatment failure. The TEddI study is a randomised, multi-centre, open-label study in well-controlled treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients to assess compliance with a once-daily regimen of antiretroviral therapy versus continuation of current anti-retroviral regimen delivered at least twice daily.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale: ‘TEddI’ will enable a once-daily treatment strategy to be studied and provide information on effectiveness, patient adherence and quality of life and the tolerability of such regimens. Hypothesis: The study hypothesis is that an antiretroviral regimen comprising of three agents taken once daily will have higher levels of adherence than a regimen requiring more frequent dosing. Primary objective: To determine over 24 weeks the levels of adherence in two groups of HIV-infected subjects randomised to receive either a once daily minimum 3-drug regimen or to continue a minimum 3-drug regimen requiring more frequent dosing. Secondary objectives: The secondary objectives of the study will include: - To estimate the proportion of patients with treatment failure where treatment failure is defined as: - HIV-1 RNA viral load of &gt;400 copies/ml on two consecutive occasions more than one month apart, OR - Discontinuation of treatment for any reason (where subsequent therapy does not comply with the study regimen change guidelines outlined in section 3.3.3) - Proportion of patients with plasma HIV-RNA less than 50 copies/ml (using an ultrasensitive assay) at 24 and 48 weeks - Change from baseline in CD4 cell count at 24 and 48 weeks - Changes from baseline in subjects’ quality of life at 24 and 48 weeks - Changes from baseline based on DASS 21 scores at 24 and 48 weeks - Incidence and severity of adverse events and abnormal laboratory values (grade 3 &amp; 4) at 24 and 48 weeks - Proportion of patients remaining on assigned treatment Study Design This is a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, prospective, 48-week study comparing a 3 (or more) drug once-daily antiretroviral regimen with any 3 (or more) drug regimen in which at least 1 drug must be taken at least twice daily. One hundred and twenty (120) subjects will be recruited and randomised in a 1:1 ratio to one of two open-label treatment regimens and will continue to receive randomised treatment until week 24: Arm 1: (Once daily arm) commence treatment with a once-a-day combination of licensed antiviral medications (such as EFV/ddI/3TC, EFV/3TC/TDF or ATV/3TC/TDF). Arm 2: (Continuation arm) continue current ART (minimum 3-drugs) dosed twice daily or more frequently Following week 24, patients will have the option to continue randomised treatment for a further 24 weeks or switch to the once daily treatment arm. In all cases, patients will be followed up for 48 weeks from the baseline visit.</detailed_description>
