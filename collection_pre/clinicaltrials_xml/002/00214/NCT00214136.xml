	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the clinical feasibility and efficacy of uing IMRT to escalate the biologically effective dose to the pelvic lymph nodes in a short course of radiation therapy. An increased total and biologically effective dose will be delivered to the pelvic lymph nodes (56 Gy at 2 Gy/fraction). The prostate will receive standard "short course" IMRT of radiation (70 Gy at 2.5 Gy/fraction).</brief_summary>
