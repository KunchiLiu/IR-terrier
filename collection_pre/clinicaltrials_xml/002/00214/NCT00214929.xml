	<brief_summary>The best management in selected patients of pulmonary Embolism (PE) should be at home. The efficacy and safety treatmentÂ´s at home versus at hospital should be similar and quality of life should be better. Our purpose is to demostrate that Low weight molecular heparin (LWMH) at home for PE is at least as effective and safe at home as at hospital</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Home Treatment of Pulmonary Embolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to carry out the Cooperative Investigation Plan for home treatment of pulmonary embolism, a network of multidisciplinary groups was built with the participation of 10 groups, distributed in 6 different regions and integrated within the Spanish Society of Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR). Those groups will share a database integrated in the Spanish Registry on Thromboembolic Disease (RIETE), which is a project already being carried out and in which many of the groups of the network already participate. The research project will be a study developed in two phases. In the first phase, predictive profiles for a favourable progression of the disease in patients with pulmonary embolism will be studied using the actual management of the disease with the current assistance model. In the second phase, a randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of two models of home treatment ( discharge from hospital during the first 72 hours after the diagnosis of PE and discharge from hospital during the first 5 days) in patients previously selected, according to predefined criteria which were modified on the basis of the results of phase I versus the current assistance model will be developed The results will be measured in terms of efficacy, safety, economic burden, and quality of life in both models (at home and at hospital).</detailed_description>
