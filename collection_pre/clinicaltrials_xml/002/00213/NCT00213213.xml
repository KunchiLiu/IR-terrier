	<brief_summary>This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of sugar water to relieve pain in newborn infants during painful blood tests and injections. Infants of diabetic mothers who receive repeated blood tests will be compared to infants of healthy mothers who receive routine painful procedures. We believe that administration of sucrose analgesia for every painful cutaneous procedure performed after delivery will result in less pain during the newborn infant screening test.</brief_summary>
