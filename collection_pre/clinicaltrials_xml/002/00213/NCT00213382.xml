	<brief_summary>The aims of this study are in four experimental sessions. The aims are: - to characterize the excitability of the cortical pharyngeal area with pharyngeal pressure and electromyograms (EMGs), at rest, in awake healthy subjects; - to study its facilitation by inspiration and deglutition; and - to study its plasticity by respiration and swallowing.</brief_summary>
