	<brief_summary>This trial will study the reconstruction of the anterior part of the mandible and the adjacent soft tissue parts by a mandibular prosthesis made in porous titanium, associated or not, to a latissimus dorsi or pectoral flap, to avoid reconstruction with free microanastomosed bone flaps that are often associated with important morbidity. The implant is consolidated by two prolonged parallel plates of titanium, allowing their fixation to the bone, easy to fix in a short time.</brief_summary>
