	<brief_summary>Gut barrier plays a major role in defence of the organism. During catabolic states, like major surgery or inflammation, gut barrier could be altered. It has been reported that preoperative nutritional support may have beneficial effects on clinical outcome in patients with surgery on gastrointestinal tract. Glutamine, which is a conditionally essential amino, have been reported to modulate inflammatory, antioxidant responses and protein metabolism in intestine. In addition, glutamine supply improves clinical outcome in critically ill patients. Antioxidant micronutrients may also have some beneficial effects in intestine by improving antioxidant response and might also regulate protein expression. Nevertheless, effects of glutamine combined to antioxidant micronutrients have not been evaluated. Thus, the aim of this study will be to assess the influence of glutamine and glutamine-antioxidant micronutrients-containing solutions on intestinal response in humans.</brief_summary>
