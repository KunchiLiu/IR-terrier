	<brief_summary>This study investigates the effects of enterally supplied glutamine on gastric emptying, intestinal transit, age of total enteral nutrition and age at the end of hospitalisation. Forty neonates, aged at least 2 days and free of acute illness participate in a prospective, randomised, double-blind study. All are fed with parenteral and enteral nutrition enriched with glutamine (0.7 g/kg/per day, group 1) or isonitrogenous control (group 2). Gastric emptying is analysed by sequential measure of intragastric residue by diluted polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000. Intestinal transit is analysed by Rouge Carmin test.</brief_summary>
