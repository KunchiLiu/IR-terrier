	<brief_summary>The diagnosis of the different forms of inflammatory myopathies (polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inclusion-body myositis...) remains difficult which may lead to unappropriate patient care. Objective 1 : to develop and evaluate the diagnostic value of a dedicated DNA-array (myoARRAY) for adult-onset muscular diseases with focus on inflammatory myopathies. Objective 2 : to evaluate the diagnostic value of T cell repertoire (TcLand) analysis to distinguish different forms of inflammatory myopathies.</brief_summary>
