	<brief_title>Bone Mineral Density Effects of Zoledronate in Postmenopausal Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two arm, double-blind randomized study looking at the effect of zoledronate, a bisphosphonate, on the bone mineral density (BMD) of postmenopausal women with breast cancer. An approved bisphosphonate, alendronate, is of benefit in patients with osteoporosis, however, this agent has a roughly 30% incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms and up to 50% of patients may take the drug improperly, compromising absorption and potentially efficacy. Zoledronate is a heterocyclic imidazole third generation bisphosphonate, which is administered intravenously (IV) and has little toxicity. Zoledronate is more potent than alendronate, and because of its route of administration it does not have the problems of poor oral bioavailability and non-compliance.</detailed_description>
