	<brief_summary>The standard non surgical therapy of locally advanced esophageal cancer is based on a definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen with fluorouracil and cisplatin. One of the alternative regimen which is being studied is the combination of a weekly cisplatin and irinotecan schedule with radiotherapy. This multicentric phase II clinical trial primarily aimed to evaluate the clinical complete response rate and secondary objectives were toxicity profile and survival.</brief_summary>
