	<brief_summary>Scleroderma is an autoimmune disease of unknown origin. Recently, the role of environmental factors, and particularly toxic drug exposure, in the genesis of scleroderma has been suggested. This prompted us to conduct this prospective, case-control, multicentric study, including 2 groups of subjects: - 100 patients with scleroderma - 300 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. The aim of our study is to determine whether exposure to toxics is higher in patients with scleroderma compared with healthy controls.</brief_summary>
