	<brief_summary>The study objectives were to assess the mucosal safety of Carraguard® gel when applied vaginally once per day for 14 days by sexually abstinent and sexually active, HIV-positive women; to evaluate the effect of Carraguard® gel on the vaginal flora in these women; to evaluate the effect of Carraguard® gel on shedding of HIV-1 in the genital tract of these women; to evaluate the safety of Carraguard® gel when applied directly to the penis once per day for 7 days by sexually abstinent, HIV-positive men; to assess whether symptoms reported by female and male participants during the study may be related to the use of Carraguard® gel; and to examine dimensions of the acceptability of, and compliance with, the study and placebo products.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Acceptability of Carraguard® in HIV Positive Women and Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We proposed a safety study of the Council’s lead candidate microbicide, Carraguard® in three cohorts in Durban, South Africa: sexually abstinent HIV-positive women, sexually abstinent HIV-positive men, and sexually active HIV-positive women. Sexually active women must be in an HIV-positive seroconcordant relationship (confirmed by HIV testing of the woman and her male partner) and written informed consent was obtained from the male partners. Women and men in each cohort were randomized to one of three study groups: Carraguard® gel, its matching placebo methyl-cellulose gel, or no product. The main objectives of this study were to investigate changes in the vulvar, vaginal, and cervical epithelia, the vaginal flora, and HIV-1 shedding in the genital tract of female participants, and changes of the penile skin and epithelia of male participants. We also evaluated symptoms reported by participants, and several dimensions of the acceptability of and compliance with the study or placebo gel. Reactions to a non-contraceptive microbicide were assessed, as well as reasons for voluntary discontinuation and non-use of Carraguard® or the placebo (determined by review of daily diary) was recorded. Exit focus group discussions were held with male and female participants to discuss aspects of acceptability and compliance. Self-reported symptoms were also investigated by clinical examination as needed and study endpoints included genital itching or burning, frequent urination, burning while urinating, genital pain, pain during sex, and abnormal vaginal or penile discharge.</detailed_description>

Currently pregnant, menopausal or lactating, or desire to become pregnant at the time of study participation Current or recent participation (within past 30 days) in any other clinical trial, including trials of HIV therapeutics and trials of vaginal products (this does not include the ongoing study in the Department of Paediatrics of King Edward VIII Hospital) Delivery, miscarriage or abortion within the last six weeks Gynecological surgery or instrumentation in the last three months History of nonmenstrual vaginal bleeding with intercourse in the last month Presence of a clinically detectable genital abnormality (i.e. vulvar, vaginal, cervical and/or perianal ulcer and/or lesion) on which the epithelium is currently disrupted or is likely to disrupt (e.g. herpes blister). Women with healed/driedup lesions from a past infection, or with a lesion on which the epithelium is currently intact or unlikely to disrupt, will be eligible for enrollment. Presence of a sexually transmitted infection (STI), symptomatic yeast infection, or bacterial vaginosis (BV), as diagnosed by clinical exam or laboratory testing at screening. Women with asymptomatic yeast infection or BV may be enrolled. Abnormal Pap smear (CIN I or higher) at screening Use of any spermicide or spermicidally lubricated condom within the week prior to enrollment.</criteria>
