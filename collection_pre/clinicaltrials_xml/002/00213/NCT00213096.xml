	<brief_summary>The purpose of this 3-month (cycle) study was to evaluate the effects of hormonal contraceptives containing a progestin and an estrogen on liver proteins and coagulation factors that are sensitive to estrogen. In this study, a contraceptive vaginal ring containing Nestorone® (a progestin with no androgenic properties) and ethinyl estradiol was compared to an oral contraceptive containing levonorgestrel (an androgenic progestin) and ethinyl estradiol.</brief_summary>
