	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide in Treating Young Patients With Severe Autoimmune Enteropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the rate of treatment-free remission in young patients with severe autoimmune enteropathy treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide. Secondary - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-4. Patients then receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 10 and continuing for 3 days or until blood counts recover. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 1½ years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 7-11 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
