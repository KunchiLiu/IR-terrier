	<brief_title>A 36-Week Extension to Protocol ISA04-03</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that can have a significant impact on patient's physical and mental well being. The most common form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis. Targeted treatments in psoriasis have been reported recently, yet cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor (CNi) remains one of the treatments which has the greatest efficacy. Voclosporin represents the possibility of a calcineurin inhibitor which is not only as efficacious as cyclosporine A, but also has an improved toxicity profile.</detailed_description>

A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly and will include implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, doublebarrier method, sexual abstinence, or a sterile partner. Sexuallyactive men and women of childbearing potential should continue to practice contraception as outlined above during treatment and for ≥ 3 months after the last dose of voclosporin. Written informed consent prior to any study related procedures. Able to keep study appointments and cooperate with all study requirements, in the opinion of the investigator. Has generalized erythrodermic, guttate, or pustular psoriasis. Have other dermatoses that would interfere with the evaluation of psoriasis, at the discretion of the investigator. A current malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years or a history of lymphoma at any time. Subjects can be enrolled with a history of squamous or basal cell carcinoma that has been surgically excised or removed with curettage and electrodesiccation. Has current, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that requires intravenous antibiotics or antifungals. Has a current streptococcal infection that required oral antibiotics. A known history of tuberculosis. Serologic evidence or known latent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) virus. Uncontrolled hypertension as defined as 3 readings of systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg. MDRD GFR ≤ 60 mL/min. Unstable renal function (variation in GFR ≥ 30%). Alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, or gammaglutamyl transferase ≥ 3x upper limit of normal(ULN). White blood cell count ≤ 2.8x10 to the ninth power/L. Triglycerides ≥ 3x ULN. Is currently taking or requires the following prohibited medications or treatments during the treatment period: drugs potentiating the nephrotoxicity of voclosporin such as chronic NSAID's or ACE inhibitors, drugs interfering with it's pharmacokinetics; drugs considered to contribute to psoriasis flare; or, systemic and topical psoriasis medication (including psoralen/ultraviolet A light treatment) that may interfere with assessment of study drug efficacy. Has taken biological agent(s), except flu shots, tetanus shots, or boosters, within 3 months of the start of treatment. Biological agents include any virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, or analogous product applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of diseases or injuries of man. A history of clinically defined allergy to cyclosporine or any of the constituents of the voclosporin formulation (vitamin E, medium chain triglyceride oil, Tween 40, ethanol). A history of alcoholism or drug addiction within 1 year prior to study entry. Weighs &lt; 45 kg (99 lbs) or &gt; 140 kg (308 lbs). A history of disease, including mental/emotional disorder that would interfere with the subject's participation in the study, or that might cause the administration of ISA247 to pose a significant risk to the subject, in the opinion of the investigator.</criteria>
