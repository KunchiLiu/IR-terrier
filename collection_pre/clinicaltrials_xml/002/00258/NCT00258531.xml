	<brief_summary>- A commercial 3-dimentional magnetic imaging system (Olympus ScopeGuide) is available for routine use during colonoscopy. - No randomised trials have been performed to evaluate if, and to what extent, the use of this technology may improve the coecal intubation rate and reduce the patient's experience of discomfort and pain by making the insertion of the endoscope easier</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of 3-Dimensional Magnetic Imaging During Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopist at different level of experience are to participate. Patients routinely referred to the outpatients department for colonoscopy are asked to participate in a randomised trial where coecal intubation rate and pain experienced by the patient are end-point. Written informed consent is obtained. For each endoscopist, allocated patients are randomised to colonoscopy with no imaging technique (usual care) or using the 3-dimentional imager.</detailed_description>
