	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to determine: 1. Inter-site variability in CIMT image measurement using SonoCalcTM. 2. If non-sonographer health care professionals working in an office practice setting can be trained to follow a carotid scanning protocol that permits (a) accurate measurement of CIMT and (b) determination of plaque presence. 3. If (a) CIMT measurements and (b) determination of plaque presence by non-sonographer health care professionals are bioequivalent to those made by a core laboratory. 4. If CIMT measurements and plaque assessment performed in office practices lead to meaningful changes in patient and physician behavior related to cardiovascular disease prevention.</brief_summary>
