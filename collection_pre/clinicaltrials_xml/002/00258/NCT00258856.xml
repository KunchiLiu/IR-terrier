	<brief_summary>The study is designed to evaluate the persistence of bactericidal antibodies in subjects aged 7 to 15 years (not yet 16 years) who had been vaccinated five years previously in Study 603-02. In addition, the kinetics of the antibody response will be evaluated in a subset of participants who will receive a booster dose of Menactra® vaccine and children in the same age group not previously vaccinated with a meningococcal vaccine or had meningitis disease who will receive a dose of Menactra® vaccine.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject is healthy, as determined by medical history. Subject is between the ages of 7 and 15 years (not yet 16 years). For subjects who participated in Study 60302, subject previously received one dose of Menactra® vaccine or Menomune®A/C/Y/W135 vaccine. The date of vaccination during Study 60302 will have occurred 5 years ± 6 months before the collection of the blood sample obtained for Study MTA23. A negative urine pregnancy test is required for menstruating female subjects. Parent/legal guardian has signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)approved informed consent form and subject has signed an IRBapproved assent form. Subjects who participated in sanofi pasteur Study MTA17 Stage I (a subset of subjects from Study 60302 who had been recruited for the followup challenge study) History of documented invasive meningococcal disease Received any other meningococcal vaccine Received any vaccine in the 28day period prior to enrollment Received antibiotic therapy within the 72 hours prior to collection of a blood sample Actively enrolled or scheduled to be enrolled in another clinical study Serious chronic disease (i.e., cardiac, renal, neurologic, rheumatologic, metabolic, gastrointestinal, psychiatric, or other organ system) Known or suspected impairment of immunologic function Acute medical illness with or without fever within 72 hours or an oral temperature ≥ 100.4°F (≥ 38.0°C) at the time of inclusion Scheduled to receive any vaccination in the 7day or 14day period after enrollment Administration of immune globulin, other blood products, or corticosteroid within 8 weeks (56 days) of the study vaccine. Individuals on a tapering dose schedule of oral steroids lasting &lt; 7 days may be included in the trial as long as they have not received more than one course within the last two weeks prior to enrollment. Personal of family history of GuillainBarres Syndrome Suspected or known hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components Unavailable for the entire study period or unable to attend the scheduled visits or to comply with the study procedures Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would pose a health risk to the participant.</criteria>
