	<brief_summary>We believe that diet induced obesity leads to activation of the IKK/NF-kB inflamatory pathway and that chronic inflammation leads to insulin resistance and diabetes. In rodents, salicylates inhibit IKK/NF-kB and may improve insulin sensitivity. We will study if this is true in people.</brief_summary>
