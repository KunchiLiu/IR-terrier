	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. OGX-011 may help docetaxel kill more tumor cells by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving OGX-011 together with docetaxel works in treating women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OGX-011 and Docetaxel in Treating Women With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of OGX-011 and docetaxel, in terms of objective tumor response rate, in women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Secondary - Determine the tolerability and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study. Patients receive OGX-011 IV over 2 hours on days -7, -5, -3, 1, 8, and 15 of course 1 and on days 1, 8, and 15 of all subsequent courses. Patients also receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8 of all courses. Treatment repeats every 21 days* for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *Course 1 is 28 days in length and all subsequent courses (courses 2-10) are 21 days in length. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then periodically until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 42 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
