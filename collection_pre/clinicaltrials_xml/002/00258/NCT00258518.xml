	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to compare the respiratory mechanics in acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory diseases syndrome (ARDS) patients with and without pleural effusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Respiratory Mechanics and Pleural Effusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In ALI/ARDS we evaluated the respiratory mechanics (respiratory system, chest wall and lung elastance) at the bedside while pleural effusion was evaluated with CT scan. Thus we will be able to estimate any possible role of pleural effusion on the respiratory mechanics.</detailed_description>
