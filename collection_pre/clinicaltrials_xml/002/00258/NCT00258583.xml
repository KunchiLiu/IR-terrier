	<detailed_description>This study gives participant's permission to allow the staff at the Dorothy P. and Richard P. Simmons Center for Interstitial Lung Disease to to place past, current, and future medical record information into a UPMC Simmons Center for Interstitial Lung Disease Research Registry. By placing the medical record information of many patients into a research registry, researchers will be able to conduct research studies directed at increasing our knowledge about interstitial lung disease. It is anticipated that the research registry will assist out investigators by allowing researchers to review and study the medical records of many individuals to answer questions about interstitial lung disease and its treatment. In addition, it will help researchers identify and recruit patients for participation in future research studies.</detailed_description>
