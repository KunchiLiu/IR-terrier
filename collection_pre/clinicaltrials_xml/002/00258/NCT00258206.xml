	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving rituximab together with cyclophosphamide may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving rituximab together with cyclophosphamide works in treating patients with high risk, refractory, or relapsed multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab and Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With High Risk, Refractory, or Relapsed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effect of rituximab and high-dose cyclophosphamide on the growth of myeloma stem cells in patients with high-risk, refractory, or relapsed multiple myeloma. OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV on days -10 and -7; once weekly for 4 weeks (after completion of high-dose cyclophosphamide); and then once in months 3, 6, 9, and 12. Patients also receive high-dose cyclophosphamide on days -3 to 0. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified.</detailed_description>
