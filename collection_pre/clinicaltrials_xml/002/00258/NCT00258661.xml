	<brief_summary>Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) were used in the 1800s and 1900s to treat pneumonia before the introduction of antibiotics in the mid-1900s. The purpose of this study is to determine if OMT, when used in conjunction with antibiotics and other usual care, will improve the recovery of elderly pneumonia patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) Beneficial for Elderly Patients Hospitalized With Pneumonia?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multi-center study conducted across five sites in the United States to determine the efficacy of combining Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment(OMT)with antibiotics as a treatment regimen for elderly patients with pneumonia. The study is a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial, in which 360 subjects will be randomly assigned to three different groups to test the primary hypothesis that the combination of OMT and antibiotics will decrease the length of hospital stay for elderly patients with pneumonia. The first group (OMT Group) will receive a series of eight osteopathic manipulative techniques in combination with conventional antibiotic care. The second group (Light Touch Control Group) will receive a light touch mimic treatment in combination with conventional antibiotic care to control for the doctor-patient interaction. The third group (Conventional Care Only Group) will receive only the conventional antibiotic care normally given to elderly patients with pneumonia. The first two groups will receive two 15-20 minute treatments per day, at least six hours apart, for the duration of their stay in the acute care facility. The primary outcomes for measuring efficacy are: Length of Hospital Stay, Time to Clinical Stability, and Rate of Symptomatic and Functional Recovery. The secondary outcomes are: duration of IV and oral antibiotic usage in the hospital, number of complications and deaths secondary to pneumonia, re-admission rate within 60 days of hospitalization admission date, duration and severity of fever, duration and severity of leukocytosis, and patient satisfaction.</detailed_description>
