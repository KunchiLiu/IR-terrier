ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status 0 to 2. Provided written informed consent. Adequate bone marrow function. Serum creatinine is less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL. Calculated creatinine clearance is greater than or equal to 60 ml/min based on Cockcroft and Gault. Total bilirubin is greater than or equal to the upper limit of normal of institutional values. Aspartate and alanine transaminase is less than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of the institutional values. Have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to 40% based on electrocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA). Resting oxygen saturations of greater than 90%. Exclusion criteria: Pregnant or lactating female. Have malabsorption syndrome, a disease affecting gastrointestinal function. Resection of the stomach or small bowel. Evidence of symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease. Is considered medically unfit for the study by the investigator as a result of the medical interview, physical exam, or screening investigations. Have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to the investigational product. Use of anilinoquinazolines, such as gefitinib [Iressa™], erlotinib [Tarceva™]. Immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction to midazolam or any component of the formulation, including benzyl alcohol (crosssensitivity with other benzodiazepines may exist). Has narrowangle glaucoma which is a contraindication to midazolam use. Has received treatment with any investigational drug in the previous 4 weeks. Received chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy or hormonal therapy within the past 14 days, with the exception of mitomycin C within the past 6 weeks. Currently receiving amiodarone or has received amiodarone in the 6 months prior to screening. Is taking regular doses of opiates that in the opinion of the investigator would put the patient at risk of clinically significant respiratory compromise when midazolam is administered. Physiological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit compliance with the protocol. Has Class II to IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system. Clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality. Clinically assessed to have inadequate venous access for protocolrelated blood draws.</criteria>
