	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease is a complex multifactorial and polygenic disorder that is thought to result from an interaction between a person's genetic make up and various environmental factors. Although many studies have revealed that several genetic variants increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, the results of these studies remain controversial. The purpose of this study is to identify polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to cardiovascular disease and to clarify the adequacy of reported susceptibility gene polymorphisms. To complete this purpose, we will prospectively study over 5,000 local residents in whom relationship between these polymorphisms and occurrence of cardiovascular disease over 5 years.</brief_summary>
