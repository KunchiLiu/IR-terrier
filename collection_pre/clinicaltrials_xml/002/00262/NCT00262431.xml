	<brief_title>Efficacy of Early Tracheostomy to Reduce Incidence of Ventilator Acquired Pneumonia (VAP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tracheostomy is an essential and irreplaceable procedure for critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilatory support and adequate airway control. The therapeutical choice of performing a tracheostomy is supported by a number of clinical benefits, such as less use of drugs for sedation, fewer days of mechanical ventilation and hence shorter Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay, as well as better resource rationalization. Actually there is no agreement on the best timing for tracheostomy. The aim of this study is to verify if an early tracheostomy (one to three days after intubation) increases ventilator associated pneumonia-free days. Secondary endpoints are: increase of ventilator free-days and mortality reduction.</detailed_description>
