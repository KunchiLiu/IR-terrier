	<brief_summary>Open label trial of zileuton compared to azathioprine/prednisone for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Study subjects will undergo a detailed clinical, radiographic, and physiologic assessment at baseline. Subjects will be monitored off treatment for three months for changes in symptoms and physiology. Subjects will then be randomized to six months of treatment with zileuton or azathioprine/prednisone. The primary endpoint of this trial is change in LTB4 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid following six months of treatment. Secondary endpoints are progression free survival, change in dyspnea, change in quality of life, and change in physiology.</brief_summary>
