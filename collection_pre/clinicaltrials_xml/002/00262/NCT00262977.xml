	<brief_title>Improving Aspirin Use in Diabetes: A Cluster Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many patients with diabetes do not use aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events. Quality improvement initiatives involving both patients and physicians may be more effective than physician-directed approaches alone. In a large urban primary care internal medicine practice, this study seeks to test if a patient-directed intervention is more effective than computerized clinician reminders alone for improving the appropriate use of aspirin in adults with diabetes. The study design is a cluster-randomized trial by physician. The frequency of self-reported regular aspirin use will be compared between patients cared for by physicians in the computerized reminder alone group and the computerized reminder plus physician-supervised, nurse practitioner intervention group.</detailed_description>
