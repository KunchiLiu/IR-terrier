	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Biological therapies, such as poly ICLC, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Giving poly ICLC after radiation therapy and temozolomide may stop any remaining tumor cells from growing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving radiation therapy together with temozolomide followed by temozolomide and poly ICLC works in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy and Temozolomide Followed by Temozolomide and Poly ICLC in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the safety and efficacy of radiation plus low-dose temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide and intramuscular poly ICLC for adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Secondary - Estimate the frequency of toxicity associated with this treatment regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. - Induction chemoradiotherapy: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. During the same 6 weeks, patients also receive oral temozolomide once daily. Four weeks later, patients are evaluated for disease progression. Patients with progressive disease are removed from the study. Patients with no progressive disease proceed to maintenance therapy. - Maintenance therapy: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5 (week 1). Patients also receive poly ICLC intramuscularly three times a week in weeks 2-8. Courses repeat every 9 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2 months for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
