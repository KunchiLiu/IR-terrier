	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab to see how well they work compared to carboplatin, paclitaxel, and placebo in treating patients with stage III or stage IV ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab are more effective than carboplatin, paclitaxel, and placebo in treating ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin and Paclitaxel With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To determine if the addition of 5 concurrent cycles of bevacizumab to 6 cycles of standard therapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) (Arm II) increases the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) when compared to 6 cycles of standard therapy alone (Arm I) in women with newly diagnosed stage III (with any gross residual disease) and stage IV, epithelial ovarian, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer. II. To determine if the addition of 5 concurrent cycles of bevacizumab plus extended bevacizumab for 16 cycles beyond the 6 cycles of standard therapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) (Arm III) increases progression-free survival when compared to 6 cycles of standard therapy (Arm I) in women with newly diagnosed stage III (with any gross residual disease) and stage IV, epithelial ovarian, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. In the event that both Arm II and Arm III regimens are superior to the Arm I regimen with respect to progression-free survival, to determine whether the Arm III regimen prolongs progression-free survival when compared to the Arm II regimen. II. To determine whether the Arm II or Arm III regimen increases the duration of overall survival when compared with the Arm I regimen. III. To compare each of the experimental regimens to the Arm I regimen with respect to the incidence of severe toxicities or serious adverse events. IV. To determine the impact on Quality of Life (QOL, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian [FACT-O] trial outcome index [TOI]) following treatment with the above regimens. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the relationship between angiogenic markers and clinical outcome including tumor response, progression-free survival and overall survival in patients randomized to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) without bevacizumab, with concurrent bevacizumab or with extended bevacizumab. II. To assess the predictive value of a set of genes whose expression correlates with survival of patients with stage III (with any gross residual disease) and stage IV, epithelial ovarian, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer. III. To bank whole blood for research. IV. To determine if genetic variations in genes associated with essential hypertension including WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 1 (WNK1), G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4 (GRK4) and kallikrein B (KLKB1) predict which patients are likely to develop bevacizumab-induced hypertension. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive placebo IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses. Beginning in course 7, patients receive placebo alone IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment with placebo repeats every 21 days for up to 22 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm I. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses. Beginning in course 7, patients receive placebo alone IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment with placebo repeats every 21 days for up to 22 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM III: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm I. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses. Beginning in course 7, patients receive bevacizumab alone IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment with bevacizumab repeats every 21 days for up to 22 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

the minimum surgery required was an abdominal surgery providing tissue for histologic evaluation and establishing and documenting the primary site and stage, as well as a maximal effort at tumor debulking; if additional surgery was performed, it should have been in accordance with appropriate surgery for ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma described in the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) Surgical Procedures Manual; however, the surgeon is not required to have performed all of the items contained in this section of the GOG Surgical Procedures Manual; those patients with stage III cancer in which the largest maximal diameter of any residual tumor implant at the completion of this initial surgery is no greater than 1 cm will be defined as "optimal;" all others will be defined as "suboptimal;" measurable disease on postoperative imaging studies is not required for eligibility Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: serous adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, malignant Brenner's Tumor, or adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (N.O.S.); however, the histologic features of the tumor must be compatible with a primary Müllerian epithelial adenocarcinoma; if doubt exists, it is recommended that the investigator should have the slides reviewed by an independent pathologist or, if necessary, the Pathology CoChair, prior to entry; patients may have coexisting fallopian tube carcinoma insitu so long as the primary origin of invasive tumor is ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/µl equivalent to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version (v)3.0 (CTCAE) grade 1;

1.5 (or an inrange INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin for management of venous thrombosis including pulmonary thromboembolus) and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 1.2 times the upper limit of normal Patients with a GOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2 Patients must be entered between 1 and 12 weeks after initial surgery performed for the combined purpose of diagnosis, staging and cytoreduction Patients with measurable and nonmeasurable disease are eligible; patients may or may not have cancerrelated symptoms Patients who have met the preentry requirements An approved informed consent and authorization permitting release of personal health information must be signed by the patient or guardian Patients in this trial may receive ovarian estrogen +/ progestin replacement therapy as indicated at the lowest effective dose(s) for control of menopausal symptoms at any time, but not progestins for management of anorexia while on protocol directed therapy or prior to disease progression Patients with a current diagnosis of borderline epithelial ovarian tumor (formerly "tumors of low malignant potential") or recurrent invasive epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer treated with surgery only (such as patients with stage Ia or Ib low grade epithelial ovarian or fallopian tube cancers) are not eligible; patients with a prior diagnosis of a borderline tumor that was surgically resected and who subsequently develop an unrelated, new invasive epithelial ovarian, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer are eligible, provided that they have not received prior chemotherapy for any ovarian tumor Patients who have received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis are excluded; prior radiation for localized cancer of the breast, head and neck, or skin is permitted, provided that it was completed more than three years prior to registration, and the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor including neoadjuvant chemotherapy for their ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer are excluded; patients may have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy for localized breast cancer, provided that it was completed more than three years prior to registration, and that the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease Patients who have received any targeted therapy (including but not limited to vaccines, antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors) or hormonal therapy for management of their epithelial ovarian or peritoneal primary cancer Patients with synchronous primary endometrial cancer, or a past history of primary endometrial cancer, are excluded, unless all of the following conditions are met: stage not greater than IB; no more than superficial myometrial invasion, without vascular or lymphatic invasion; no poorly differentiated subtypes, including papillary serous, clear cell or other FIGO grade 3 lesions With the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer and other specific malignancies as noted above, patients with other invasive malignancies who had (or have) any evidence of the other cancer present within the last five years or whose previous cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy are excluded Patients with acute hepatitis or active infection that requires parenteral antibiotics Patients with serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture;

urine protein should be screened by urine proteincreatinine ratio (UPCR); the UPCR has been found to correlate directly with the amount of protein excreted in a 24 hour urine collection; specifically, a UPCR of 1.0 is equivalent to 1.0 gram of protein in a 24 hour urine collection; obtain at least 4 ml of a random urine sample in a sterile container (does not have to be a 24 hour urine); send sample to lab with request for urine protein and creatinine levels [separate requests]; the lab will measure protein concentration (mg/dL) and creatinine concentration (mg/dL); the UPCR is derived as follows: protein concentration (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL); patients must have a UPCR &lt;
