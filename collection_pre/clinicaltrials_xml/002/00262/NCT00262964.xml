	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to provide a better understanding of: 1) the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in obese subjects, and 2) the effect of marked weight loss on the histologic and metabolic abnormalities associated with NAFLD. The following hypotheses will be tested: 1. obesity causes hepatic fat accumulation because of excessive fatty acid release from fat tissue and increased free fatty acid availability, 2. increased hepatic (liver) fat content causes insulin-resistant glucose (sugar) production by the liver and altered liver protein synthesis, 3. increased hepatic fat content causes increased lipid (fat) peroxidation, hepatic inflammation, necrosis and fibrosis, and 4. marked weight loss improves NAFLD once patients are weight stable.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity is a major risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which represents a spectrum of liver diseases. NAFLD is a major health problem in the US because of its high prevalence and causal relationship with serious liver abnormalities. However, the mechanism(s)responsible for developing NAFLD in obese persons and the effects on liver function are not known. This gap in knowledge has made it difficult to identify effective therapy. The results from these studies will lay the groundwork for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for NAFLD in obese patients.</detailed_description>
