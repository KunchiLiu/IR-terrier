	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and tolerability of the to-be-marketed lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) tablet formulation with the marketed soft gel capsule (SGC) formulation and to compare the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of once daily (QD) and twice daily (BID) dosing of the LPV/r tablet formulation in combination with select nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in patients who have not previously received antiretroviral treatment.</brief_summary>
