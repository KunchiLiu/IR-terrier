	<detailed_description>This study is a randomised, placebocontrolled, doubleblind study on the effect of the antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, in patients suffering from PMPS. The treatment periods are 1 month each and the periods are separated by a 1-week washout period. The daily dose of levetiracetam is increased over a 2-week period to 3.000 mg/day. The primary effect variable is pain relief by the use of numeric rating scale. Secondary parameters are daily registration of pain performed by the patients during the treatment periods and the amount of escape medicine used (paracetamol and tramadol). Sensory testing is performed at baseline and after each treatment period.</detailed_description>
