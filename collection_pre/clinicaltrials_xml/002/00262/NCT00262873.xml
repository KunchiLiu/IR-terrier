	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well bortezomib works in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of bortezomib, in terms of reduced cytopenia, in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. - Determine the safety and toxic effects of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Determine changes in marrow blast percentage or karyotypic profile in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) Requires treatment or transfusion support for MDS, as indicated by 1 of the following: Demonstrates transfusion or epoetin alfa dependence Transfusion dependence is defined as requiring ≥ 2 units of packed RBCs within an 8week period prior to study entry Hemoglobin &lt; 11g/dL on 2 separate occasions 2 weeks apart No iron, cyanocobalamin (vitamin B_12), or folic acid deficiency or other causes of anemia Must have 1 of the following FAB subtypes: Refractory anemia Refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts Refractory anemia with excess blasts Secondary MDS (if ≥ 3 years since active primary cancer) No chronic myelomonocytic leukemia Not refractory to platelet transfusion support (i.e., inability to maintain platelet count &gt; 20,000/mm^3 with transfusion) No current acute myelogenous leukemia (e.g., &gt; 30% blasts) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Performance status Karnofsky 50100% Life expectancy At least 6 months Hematopoietic See Disease Characteristics Hepatic Bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL AST and ALT &lt; 2 times upper limit of normal Renal Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min Cardiovascular No significant cardiovascular condition that would preclude study participation No uncontrolled hypertension Pulmonary No significant pulmonary condition that would preclude study participation Immunologic No serious concurrent infection Active infections must be adequately treated with antibiotics prior to study entry No hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron, or mannitol Other Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for up to 4 weeks after completion of study treatment No peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 2 No uncontrolled seizure activity, as defined by no activity within the past year on stable anticonvulsant medications No other malignancy within the past 3 years except adequately treated basal cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix No endocrine, neurologic, or other systemic disease that would preclude study entry PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy See Disease Characteristics No prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation Concurrent transfusion support allowed Concurrent epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa allowed if initiated before start of study therapy, dose is stable for ≥ 4 weeks, and dose is stable during study participation No concurrent platelet growth factor support No concurrent thalidomide Chemotherapy No concurrent chemotherapy No concurrent hydroxyurea Endocrine therapy Concurrent corticosteroids for chronic autoimmune or inflammatory condition allowed if initiated before start of study therapy and maintained on a stable or decreasing dose Other Recovered from all prior therapies At least 4 weeks since prior MDS therapy, except epoetin alfa, darbepoetin alfa, filgrastim (GCSF), pegfilgrastim (GCSF), or transfusion support At least 30 days since prior investigational agents No prior bortezomib No other concurrent investigational agents No other concurrent therapy for MDS</criteria>
