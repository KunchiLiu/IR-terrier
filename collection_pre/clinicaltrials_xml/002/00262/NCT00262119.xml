	<brief_title>MINERVA: MINimizE Right Ventricular Pacing to Prevent Atrial Fibrillation and Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kristensen et al. reported that AAIR pacing reduces atrial fibrillation (AF) development compared to DDDR pacing in sinus node disfunction patients. Several authors have shown that, in patients with intact AV conduction, unnecessary chronic RV pacing can cause detrimental effects such as AF, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and congestive heart failure. These findings arose the hypothesis that the non-physiologic nature of ventricular pacing may result in electrophysiological and LV remodeling changes that have potentially deleterious long-term effects. The MVP mode, present in the Medtronic pacemaker EnRhythm, provides atrial based pacing with ventricular backup. It operates in true AAI(R) mode, it provides ventricular backup in case of a single conduction loss and converts to DDD(R) mode in case of persistent loss of AV conduction. Aim of this study is to test the impact of the MVP pacing mode and atrial preventive and antitachycardia pacing therapies on the reduction of a composite clinical outcome composed by any death, permanent AF, cardiovascular hospitalizations.</detailed_description>
