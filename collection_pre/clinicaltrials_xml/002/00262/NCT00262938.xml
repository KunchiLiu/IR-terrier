	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the combined effect of exercise and dietary counseling on the weight loss and quality of life of obese patients with stage I or II endometrial cancer in remission. Secondary - Determine the feasibility and acceptability of lifestyle interventions in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study. Patients are stratified according to age and body mass index (25-29.9 vs ≥ 30). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo weekly contact with a dietitian; exercise intervention for 6 months; and physician counseling at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients undergo quality of life assessments and clinical assessments at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. - Arm II: Patients undergo quality of life, exercise, and clinical assessments at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
