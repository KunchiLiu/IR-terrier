	<brief_summary>The purpose is to demonstrate a correction of anemia in hepatitis C virus treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use or Non-use of Epoetin Beta in Patients Infected by Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Show that the correction of anemia by epoetin beta (NeoRecormon®) able to maintain a optimal dose of ribavirin (Copegus®). The study compares two therapeutic strategies : use or non-use of epoetin beta (NeoRecormon®) in patients infected by chronic hepatitis C and treated by combination therapy Peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys®) plus ribavirin (Copegus®). The main judgement criteria are : - Sustained Viral Response (Week 72) - Viral Response at the End of Treatment (Week 48) - Quality of life - Cumulative dose of ribavirin from D0-W24 and from W24-W48 periods - Clinical and biological tolerance</detailed_description>
