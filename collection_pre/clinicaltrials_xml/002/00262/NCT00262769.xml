	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine is more effective with or without cisplatin in treating cholangiocarcinoma or biliary tract tumors. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying gemcitabine and cisplatin to see how well they work compared to gemcitabine alone in treating patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma or other biliary tract tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine With or Without Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma or Other Biliary Tract Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the overall survival of patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma or other biliary tract tumors treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride with vs without cisplatin. Secondary - Compare the progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. - Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, primary site of disease (gallbladder vs bile ducts vs ampulla), prior therapy (photodynamic therapy [PDT] vs non-PDT therapy vs none), ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), and disease status (locally advanced vs metastatic). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV over 1½ hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and after finishing treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 3 years. Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
