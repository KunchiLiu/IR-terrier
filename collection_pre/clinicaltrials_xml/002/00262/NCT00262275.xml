	<criteria>We intend to invite patients aged 18 to 80 proceeding to primary elective coronary artery bypass surgery, able to give informed consent. Preoperative exclusion criteria: patients who are have not stopped aspirin 7 days prior to surgery patients on concomitant NSAIDS patients with a previous history platelet disorders, splenectomy or haematological disorders patients with aspirin induced asthma patients with any contraindications to aspirin (GI bleed) patients who are on any medication that may result in a serious drug interaction with aspirin (warfarin) Women of childbearing potential Patients of less than 18 years If informed consent cannot be obtained If for any reason the consultant surgeon or anaesthetist deems it to be appropriate Operative exclusion criteria: â€¢ Concomitant procedures Postoperative exclusion criteria: patients who receive platelet transfusion patients who receive NSAIDS requirement for intra aortic balloon pump support failure of extubation within 24 hours</criteria>
