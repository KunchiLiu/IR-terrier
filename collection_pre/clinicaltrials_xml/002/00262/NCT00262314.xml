	<brief_title>Prospective, Open-label Tolerability and Safety Monitoring Study of Novantrone in a Selected Cohort of Multiple Sclerosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase IV, multicenter, prospective, open-label tolerability and safety monitoring study will enroll a select cohort of 500 multiple sclerosis patients receiving commercially available Novantrone®. The patients will be assessed every 3 months during treatment followed by annual assessment for a total of five (5) years. The select cohort of MS patients enrolled will have secondary (chronic) progressive, progressive relapsing, or worsening relapsing-remitting disease (i.e., patients whose neurological status is significantly abnormal between relapses). The overall objective of this study is to collect data relevant to the tolerability of Novantrone® therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using dosing and monitoring recommendations specified in the package insert.</detailed_description>
