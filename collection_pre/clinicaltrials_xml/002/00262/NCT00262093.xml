	<brief_title>Angiogenesis Markers in Primiparas Versus Multiparas: Relevance to Preeclampsia Incidence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primiparity is one of the main risk factors for having preeclampsia during pregnancy. Recently, sFlt-1, soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1, has been shown to be a major molecule involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Higher sFlt-1 mRNA, higher serum levels of sFlt-1 as well as lower PlGF, placental growth factor, have been found in preeclamptic patients. We intend to check the angiogenesis profile of primiparas as compared to multiparas.</detailed_description>
