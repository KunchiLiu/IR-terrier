	<brief_summary>International studies have shown that elite athletes have a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and asthma as compared to normal subjects. It is unclear whether the increased prevalence of asthma in elite athletes reflects "traditional asthma" or whether it is a special form of "sports asthma". The treatment of elite athletes with asthma seems to vary widely, and only a few studies have focused on the treatment of elite athletes with asthma. Further knowledge of the pathogenesis of sports asthma would lead to a greater understanding and better treatment of the condition. This study will investigate the type of airway inflammation in elite athletes and examine the effect of treatment with inhaled steroids in combination with long-acting beta-agonists versus placebo in the same group.</brief_summary>
