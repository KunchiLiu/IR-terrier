	<brief_summary>Patients receiving BNP or nitroglycerin (IV) during the angioplasty procedure. 24 h after the procedure, vascular reactivity will be re-examined using the brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation study. Blood assays for ET-1, pro-BNP, and various inflammatory markers will be checked before and 24 h after the procedure. It is our hypothesis that endothelial function will be better in the BNP treated patients compared to the NTG treated patients</brief_summary>
