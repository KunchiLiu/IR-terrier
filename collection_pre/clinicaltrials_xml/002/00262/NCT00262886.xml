	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: A peripheral stem cell transplant or bone marrow transplant from a brother or sister may be an effective treatment for kidney cancer. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well a donor peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplant works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donor Peripheral Stem Cell or Bone Marrow Transplant in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of nonmyeloablative sibling allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. - Conditioning regimen: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 and -6 and fludarabine IV on days -5 to -1. Patients receiving 5/6-mismatched cells also receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -5 to -3. - Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) infusion: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSC or bone marrow transplantation on day 0. - Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive oral mycophenolate mofetil twice daily on days 0-30. Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally twice daily beginning on day -2 and continuing up to day 44-100 in the absence of GVHD. - Donor lymphocyte infusion: Patients with partial or complete T-cell chimerism receive up to 3 donor lymphocyte infusions in the absence of GVHD or progressive disease. After completion of study treatment, patients are evaluated periodically for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
