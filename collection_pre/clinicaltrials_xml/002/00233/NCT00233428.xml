	<brief_title>Study to Determine Racial and Gender Differences in Platelet Aggregation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Genetic variability of various components of the coagulation system has been reported. Data on racial and gender differences in platelet aggregation are lacking. We hypothesize that there are significant racial and gender differences on aggregatory response of platelets to commonly used agonists to evaluate platelet function such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), epinephrine, collagen and arachidonic acid.</detailed_description>
