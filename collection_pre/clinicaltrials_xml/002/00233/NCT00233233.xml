	<brief_title>Influence of Data Collection Mode on Self-Report Validity of Asthma Therapy Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Self-reports are a primary source of behavioral data. Studies have highlighted the variable validity and reliability of self-report measures of health behaviors such as adherence to therapy. Research on self-reports of sensitive information, such as sexual behavior and drug use, suggests that the mode of data collection may enhance validity of self-reports. However, no studies have determined how the mode of data collection influences self-reports when an objective measure of the behavior is available. DESIGN NARRATIVE: The primary aim of this study is to examine the influence of the mode of data collection on the validity of self-reports of inhaled anti-inflammatory medication adherence. The key secondary outcomes of the study will attempt to answer the following questions: 1) does the assessment mode influence self-reports of commonly used asthma outcome measures of disease-related symptoms, self-management behaviors, and quality of life?; 2) does the relationship between the assessment mode, the validity of self-reports of adherence, and other measures (i.e., asthma symptoms, self-management behaviors, and quality of life) change over time?; and 3) does the assessment mode interact with baseline personality characteristics and mood to influence the validity of self-reports of adherence and other outcome measures (i.e., asthma symptoms, self-management behaviors, and quality of life)?</detailed_description>
