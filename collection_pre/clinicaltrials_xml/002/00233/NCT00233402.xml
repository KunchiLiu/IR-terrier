	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to document the additional detection of papillary bladder cancer and the reduced early recurrence due to the improved detection and resection of these tumors after Hexvix cystoscopy compared to standard cystoscopy in patients with papillary bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Improve Detection and Early Recurrence Rate in Bladder Cancer Patients Using Hexvix Fluorescence Cystoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In superficial bladder cancer macroscopic tumors including non-invasive papillary tumors (Ta) in the bladder are relatively easy to visualize by cystoscopic examination under white light. However, dysplasia, carcinoma in situ (CIS) or small exophytic tumors are easily overlooked. These lesions are predictive of recurrence and progression of disease, and the identification of these lesions is a crucial factor for the prognosis of the patient. The present situation with 50-75% recurrence rate show the inadequacy of white light cystoscopy for detection and resection of the lesions. A better detection of papillary bladder cancer and early detection of CIS lesions will provide the patient with a more complete TURB, a more optimal pharmacological treatment when needed, may reduce the need for follow up cystoscopies and hopefully result in a better prognosis for the patient. The aim of the present study is to compare Hexvix cystoscopy with white light cystoscopy in the detection of histology confirmed papillary bladder cancer in patients with papillary bladder cancer and to compare early recurrence rate after Hexvix and white light transurethral resection (TURB) with white light TURB in patients with superficial bladder cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patients should be indicated for a cystoscopic examination for suspected or verified papillary bladder cancer and fulfill one or more of the following criteria: Patients with more than one initial bladder tumor confirmed on an outpatient cystoscopy. Patients having recurrence within 12 months confirmed on an outpatient cystoscopy Patients with more than one papillary lesion at recurrence independently of the time of the recurrence confirmed on an outpatient cystoscopy Patients with known tumors in the prostatic urethra or distal urethra Gross hematuria. (Note: Gross hematuria is defined as a heavy bladder bleed resulting in marked amounts of blood in the urine, which may interfere with fluorescence cystoscopy. Where the bleed is light, the patient should not be excluded if in the investigator's opinion, rinsing during cystoscopy will alleviate the possible interference with fluorescence cystoscopy). Patient with porphyria. Known allergy to hexyl aminolevulinate hydrochloride or a similar compound. Participation in other clinical studies with investigational drugs either concurrently or within the last 30 days. Pregnant or breastfeeding (all women of childbearing potential must document a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening and use the contraceptive pill or intrauterine device (IUD) during the treatments and for at least one month thereafter). Patients who have received BCG or chemotherapy within three months prior to the initial cystoscopy/TURB, except for a single dose of chemotherapy for prevention of seeding after resection. Conditions associated with a risk of poor protocol compliance.</criteria>
