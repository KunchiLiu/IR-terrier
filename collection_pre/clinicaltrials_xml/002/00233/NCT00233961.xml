	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, helps stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored until transplant. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of G-CSF in stimulating peripheral stem cells for autologous stem cell transplant in treating patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia in remission.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>G-CSF in Stimulating Peripheral Stem Cells for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Complete Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility and safety of harvesting adequate numbers of CD34-positive peripheral blood stem cells using filgrastim (G-CSF) in patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia in complete cytogenetic remission. - Determine the safety of temporarily discontinuing treatment with imatinib mesylate and using G-CSF during the harvesting procedure, in terms of the percentage of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive cells before and after stem cell harvest, in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) and then undergo apheresis for up to 5 days. After completion of apheresis, patients resume treatment with imatinib mesylate off study. Patients may later undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, when deemed necessary. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
