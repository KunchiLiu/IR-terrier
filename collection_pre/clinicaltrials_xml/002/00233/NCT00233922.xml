	<brief_summary>Patients with orbital injuries are entered into the trial. Age: 20 - 70. After obtaining appropriate consent, they are entered into either a control arm where reconstruction of the orbit is done with a titanium mesh (established practice) or the experimental arm where reconstruction is by a bioresorbable implant made of polycaprolactone. Patients are followuped at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months &amp; 12 months. CT scan of the orbits are performed preop, 6 months &amp; 12 months. End point is the 12 month follow-up appointment. Visual acuity, range of motion, enophthalmos &amp; diplopia are assessed in follow-up.</brief_summary>
