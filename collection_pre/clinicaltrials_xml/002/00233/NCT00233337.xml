	<criteria>Patients were eligible for inclusion if they met all of the following criteria: Male or female aged 18 or older (prior to Amendment 1: more than 2 years old) Nonimmune patients suffering from acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, or mixed infection including P. falciparum, with parasitemia of less than or equal to 2% asexual P.falciparum parasites, confirmed by microscopy using Giemsastained thick film. Nonimmune patients were regarded as those who had not spent the first five years of their life, nor the last five years in a malaria endemic area, and did not have acute P. falciparum malaria diagnosed during those past five years. Nonimmune patients who had received prophylaxis with antimalarials (excluding halofantrine) were included only if clear progression of acute P. falciparum infection was documented. Female patients were eligible to participate in the study if they were of nonchildbearing potential or had a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) at screening, and using an acceptable contraceptive method Patients, who had been informed of the study procedures and medication, and had given written informed consent and were willing to comply with the study protocol. Patients were to be excluded from participation if they met any of the following criteria: Known hypersensitivity to artemether or lumefantrine Signs/symptoms indicative of severe/complicated malaria according to the WHO classification (e.g. cerebral malaria, see Posttext supplement 1) Treatment with artemisinin derivatives within the previous 7 days Concurrent administration of other treatment / prophylaxis for malaria Concurrent administration of medications with potential hemolytic effects Patients taking any drug metabolized by cytochrome isoenzymes CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Received any other investigational drugs in the last 4 weeks before entry into the study Severe cardiac impairment (i.e. evidence of existing cardiac conduction defect or overt symptoms of cardiac dysfunction or abnormalities of baseline ECG not associated with acute malaria); clinically relevant bradycardia or congestive cardiac failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction; preexisting prolongation of the QT interval; history of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias Having received halofantrine or any other drug known to influence cardiac function within 4 weeks prior to Screening visit or taking other drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval, including class IA and III antiarrhythmics, neuroleptics, antidepressive agents, certain antibiotics (including some macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents), certain nonsedating antihistaminics (terfenadine, astemizole) and cisapride History of splenectomy Clinically significant abnormal baseline hematology (not associated with acute malaria) or clinical chemistry parameters, including evidence of hepatic or renal impairment, known disturbances of electrolyte balance e.g. hypokalemia or hypomagnesaemia Serious, uncontrolled disease (including serious psychological disorders) likely to interfere with the study, or concomitant disease which could mask the response to treatment Unlikely, in the opinion of the investigator, to complete the dosing or followup periods, or who have evidence of alcohol, drug or solvent abuse. Women who are pregnant, lactating or of childbearing potential and not using an acceptable contraceptive method were also excluded. Other protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
