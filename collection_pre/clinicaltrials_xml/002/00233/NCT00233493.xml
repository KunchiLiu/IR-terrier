	<brief_summary>The objective is to demonstrate person-to-person spread of dermatophytes of the skin and nails among family members, as measured by fungal culture and DNA typing of the dermatophytes isolated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Spread of Dermatophytes Among Families</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enrolled families consist of at least two members over the age of 14. Once the index person is examined and a dermatophyte is isolated from either toenail or foot scale, other family members are examined and cultured. All dermatophyte isolates obtained from each family unit are compared using DNA typing and restriction length polymorphism (RFLP) to determine whether family members share the same organism or were infected by an outside source.</detailed_description>
