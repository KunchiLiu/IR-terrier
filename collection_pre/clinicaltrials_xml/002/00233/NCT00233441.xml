	<brief_title>Placebo Controlled Double-blind Dose Ranging Study of the Efficacy and Safety of SSR149744C 50, 100, 200 or 300 mg OD With Amiodarone as Calibrator for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm in Patients With Recent Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a dose-ranging multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm study with 4 SSR149744C dose regimens and amiodarone as a calibrator.To be eligible, patients must be in normal sinus rhythm for at least one hour at randomization and must have an electrocardiogram documented history of recent AF/AFL reverted to normal sinus rhythm by electrical, pharmacological or spontaneous conversion.</detailed_description>
