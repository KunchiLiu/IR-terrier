	<brief_title>Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, observational database to collect data on the characteristics, management practices, and patient outcomes of NPH patients. It will be offered to a geographically representative group of U.S. physicians who will enroll NPH patients. The physician makes his/her own clinical decisions; thus, the data captured provides current practice patterns related to diagnosis, management, and results. The registry may also assist physicians in patient follow-up and certain practice management tasks. The data collected will serve to inform the medical community on optimal care for this patient population</detailed_description>
