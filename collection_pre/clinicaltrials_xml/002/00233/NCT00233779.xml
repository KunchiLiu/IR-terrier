	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the performance and safety of a sirolimus-eluting, heparin-coated, cobalt chromium balloon-expandable stent (Small Vessel Stent) in patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions in small vessels as compared to historical data from small vessel patients in the RAVEL trial receiving the Sirolimus-eluting Bx VELOCITYâ„¢ stent.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. The patient must be minimum 18 years of age; 2. Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald Classification B&amp;C, IIIIII) OR patients with documented silent ischemia; 3 Treatment of one lesion in a native coronary artery. The treated lesion will be the one with the highest % diameter stenosis by visual estimate. Additional study stents may be used for procedural complications such as dissections. Multivessel treatment is permissible in nontarget vessels; however, additional lesions may only be treated with commercial stents. If other nontarget vessels are treated with commercial stents during the index procedure, they must be successfully treated prior to the study lesion; 4. The target lesion is &gt;/=2.0 mm and &lt;/=2.5mm in diameter (visual estimate); 5. The target lesion can be covered with a single 18mm stent; 6. Target lesion stenosis is &gt;50% and &lt;100% (TIMI I) (visual estimate); 1. Patient has experienced a Qwave or nonQwave myocardial infarction with documented total CK&gt;2 times normal within the preceding 24 hours and the CK and CKMB enzymes remain above normal at the time of treatment; 2. Target lesion is due to instent restenosis; 3. Ejection fraction 30%; 4. Totally occluded vessel (TIMI 0 level); 5. Impaired renal function (creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL);</criteria>
