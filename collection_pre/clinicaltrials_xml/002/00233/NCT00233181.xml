	<brief_title>Adherence Intervention for Minority Children With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: While increased asthma morbidity and mortality have been observed across all ethnicities, results from several studies have found that asthma morbidity has increased disproportionately in low-income African American children. Elementary school-based asthma education programs have shown promise in improving asthma management, and reducing asthma morbidity in this high-risk population, however, the fastest growing asthma risk is associated with children young than six. By elementary age many parents and children with asthma have well-established patterns of inappropriate asthma management that may be difficult to change. To date, no research has examined the impact of early intervention for asthma management in low-income, high-risk children. DESIGN NARRATIVE: The primary outcome that the study was designed to evaluate medical record documented emergency care for asthma at the JHPED over the eighteen-month follow-up period. The secondary outcomes Adherence with asthma therapy based on Medicaid pharmacy claims for asthma medications, other asthma health care (urgent and primary), self-reported medication adherence, barriers to health care, restricted activity, nighttime symptoms, asthma medications, self and family asthma management behaviors, asthma management self-efficacy, functional status, and quality of life. The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.</detailed_description>
