	<brief_title>FIM-BR - First-in-Man Study (Brazil Part) With Sirolimus-Coated BX VELOCITY Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, non-randomized study of the Bx VELOCITY Balloon-Expandable Stent coated with sirolimus (140Âµg/cm2) and formulated for fast or slow release. The sirolimus coated stent is mounted on the Raptor OTW SDS. Approximately 30 patients with de novo or restenotic native coronary artery lesions &lt;=18mm in length and &gt;=3.0 to &gt;=3.5 mm in diameter by visual estimate who meet all eligibility criteria will be treated with the sirolimus coated Bx VELOCITY stent(s). Patients will be followed for five years post-procedure and will have a repeat angiography at 4 months, 12 months, 24 months, and 48 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification (CCS) or a positive ischemia study; 2. Single de novo or restenotic lesion requiring treatment in a major native coronary artery; 3. Target lesion is &lt;=18mm in length (visual estimate); 4. Target lesion is &gt;=3.0mm and &lt;=3.5mm in diameter (visual estimate); 5. Target lesion stenosis is &gt;50% and &lt;100% (visual estimate); 1. A Qwave or nonQwave myocardial infarction within the preceding 72 hours unless the CK and CKMB enzymes are back to normal; 2. Unprotected left main coronary disease with &gt;=50% stenosis; 3. Have an ostial target lesion; 4. Angiographic evidence of thrombus within target lesion; 5. Calcified lesions which cannot be successfully predilated; 6. Ejection fraction &lt;=30%; 7. Target lesion involves bifurcation (either stenosis of both main vessel and major branch or stenosis of just major branch); 8. Totally occluded vessel;</criteria>
