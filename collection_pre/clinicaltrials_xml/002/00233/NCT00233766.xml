	<criteria>1. Male or nonpregnant female patient minimum 18 years of age 2. No significant (&gt;50%) untreated stenoses proximal or distal to the target lesion that will not be treated during the procedure and may require revascularization or impede runoff; 3. Target lesion is 18mm in length (visual estimate); 4. Target lesion is 3.0mm and 3.5mm in diameter (visual estimate); 5. Target lesion stenosis is &gt;50% and &lt;100% (visual estimate); 1. A Qwave or nonQwave myocardial infarction within the preceding 72 hours unless the CK and CKMB enzymes are back to normal; 2. Ejection fraction 30%; 3. Stent placement of target lesion covers a side branch &gt;2.0mm in diameter;</criteria>
