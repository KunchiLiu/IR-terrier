	<brief_summary>The purpose of this survey is to identify any concerns regarding the following efficacy and safety-related issues in clinical practice with the new drugs "Fabrazyme for intravenous infusion 5mg" and "Fabrazyme for intravenous infusion 35mg" and to confirm the safety of these products in long-term use in the clinical setting. 1. New adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that cannot be predicted from the Precautions (in particular, clinically significant ADRs) 2. The incidence of ADRs under the actual conditions of use of the drug 3. Causal factors that might potentially affect safety 4. Efficacy evaluation in long-term use This survey will be conducted in accordance with the approval condition established for Fabrazyme: "To conduct a special surveillance of Efficacy and Safety in long term treatment and Pediatric with the drug."</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Long Term Safety and Efficacy Study of Fabrazyme Replacement Therapy in Japanese Patients With Fabry Disease.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical institutions or physicians will be asked to periodically complete the survey forms for all patients registered. Survey forms include baseline information available, and then data collected every 6 months, as available including: demographic information, concomitant medications/therapy, treatment record, ECG, Echocardiogram, computed tomography scan / magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI), Fabry symptoms, labs, functional disorder, blood concentration of GL-3, and anti-agalsidase beta antibody test (IgE testing) to survey whether the productions of antibodies to agalsidase beta is a causal factor of treatment-related reactions. The survey period shall be approximately 7 years from June 1, 2004 during which survey shall be undertaken as follows: - The observation period for each patient shall range from 1 to about 7 years after starting treatment - Registration period: June 1, 2004 to March 31, 2010 - Survey period: June 1, 2004 to March 31, 2011 In institutions for which retrospective surveys are feasible, the survey period will trace back to the date of approval (January 29, 2004), as far as possible.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients in Japan with the indication of "Fabry Disease" and for whom the usual dosage and administration is 1mg of agalsidase beta (recombinant) per 1 kg body weight each time, administered by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks Because the efficacy evaluation of enzyme replacement therapy with Fabrazyme [agalsidase beta (recombinant form)] will require the comparison of findings before and after the start of enzyme replacement therapy, the efficacy evaluation set will be defined as including patients using Fabrazyme [agalsidase beta (recombinant form)] for the first time in the postmarketing setting and those for whom it is possible to obtain retrospective data for before the start of enzyme replacement therapy. Patients registered in the postmarketing trials during the postmarketing clinical trial period.</criteria>
