Patient meets all inclusion criteria for surgical candidate 2. Aneurysm starts &gt;/= 10 mm below the most distal main renal artery and the diameter of aorta within that aortic neck segment is not variable 3. Diameter of aortic fixation zone (neck) &gt;/= 22mm and &lt;/= 30 mm 4. Supra renal aortic diameter &lt;/= 34 mm 5. The required device coverage length &gt;/= 13 cm extending from most distal main renal artery ostium to the distal anchoring site within the common iliac artery (or external iliac artery if planned occlusion of internal iliac artery) 6. Aortic neck angulation &lt; 60° as estimated from CT scan images or angiogram 7. Iliac artery attachment zone diameter &lt;/= 20 mm 8. Iliac arteries with a length of &gt;/= 10 mm of nonaneurysmal vessel located at the iliac graft attachment sites 9. Iliac arteries with adequate peripheral access to accommodate a 22 Fr catheter delivery system 10. Aortic bifurcation &gt; 18 mm in diameter 11. Creatinine level &lt; 2.5 mg/dl Exclusion Criteria (Surgical and Stent Graft Patients): 1. Weight &gt; 350 lbs. (159 Kg) 2. Mycotic, ruptured or traumatic aneurysm 3. Life expectancy &lt; 2 years 4. MI, cerebral vascular accident or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months 5. Expected occlusion or the need for reimplantation of significant mesenteric or renal arteries originating from the AAA Exclusion Criteria (Stent Graft Patients only) 1. Aneurysm is symptomatic or tender 2. Creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl or patient on dialysis 3. Thrombus in proximal and distal attachment area covering greater than 50% of the endoluminal surface</criteria>
