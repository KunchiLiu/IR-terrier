	<brief_summary>The main purpose is to show the percentage of patients taking antipsychotics with PTSD by looking at approximately ten year’s worth of data from 1994 through 2004. We will also determine the type and dose of antipsychotics the patients received, and to determine how many of those patients had psychotic versus nonpsychotic symptoms. We will be obtaining this data from the VISN 7 Corporate Data Warehouse. We hypothesize that there has been an overall increase in antipsychotic use in patient’s with PTSD over the last 10 years.</brief_summary>
