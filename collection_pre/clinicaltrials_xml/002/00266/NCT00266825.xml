	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if increasing DHA intake during pregnancy can increase gestation duration and enhance infant and childhood outcomes related to visual acuity, stereoacuity, attention, and distractibility.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DHA Supplementation and Pregnancy Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although numerous trials show benefits of postnatal DHA supplementation for visual acuity and others show benefits for cognitive function and/or attention, studies of increased DHA exposure during fetal life are needed, especially in the US. Women in the US consume low amounts of DHA compared to other world populations, and this likely means less DHA transfer to the fetus than in many other populations. Prenatal DHA exposure may be more important than postnatal exposure, because animal studies show critical windows for brain DHA accumulation in relation to effects on neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine and GABA.</detailed_description>
