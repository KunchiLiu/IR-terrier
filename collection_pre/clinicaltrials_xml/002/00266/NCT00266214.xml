	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Lidoderm (Lidocaine Patch 5%) in Treating Moderate to Severe Pain Associated With Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)as determined by electrodiagnostic testing and moderate to severe pain will be randomized to receive either the lidocaine patch 5% or placebo patch q24h. The total duration of the double-blind treatment phase of the study will be 8 weeks. At baseline and at periodic visits to the clinic, patients will perform pain and functionality assessments. Patients with bilateral CTS will identify the "index" wrist (i.e., the more painful wrist), which will subsequently be the wrist used for all efficacy assessments throughout the study. Treatment Regimen and Route of Administration: Patients will apply one patch (either a lidocaine patch 5% or a matching placebo patch) to the volar aspect of each affected wrist once every 24 hours.</detailed_description>

Have a history of alcohol or substance abuse within the last 3 years Have received an investigational drug or product or participated in an investigational drug study within a period of 30 days or 5 halflives prior to receiving study drug</criteria>
