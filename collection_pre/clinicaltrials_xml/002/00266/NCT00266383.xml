	<brief_summary>The human homologue of mice natural-resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp 1) gene, NRAMP 1, has been reported to play a role in the susceptibility to tuberculosis in humans. The aboriginal population in Taiwan has a 5-fold higher prevalence of tuberculosis than the Han Chinese. Whether genetic factors such as NRAMP 1 polymorphisms play a role in the prevalence of tuberculosis in Taiwanese aboriginals should be clarified.</brief_summary>
