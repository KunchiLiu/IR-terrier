	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to compare the sensitivity and specificity of a new system for analyzing the electrocardiogram (ECG) to the sensitivity and specificity of a conservative treadmill test in asymptomatic subjects, classified by Framingham score as moderate to high risk. Subjects will perform a routine exercise test with the addition of another set of electrodes to record high resolution ECG. All subjects will perform a stress echocardiography. The result of the routine ECG analysis will be compared to the new system and to the echocardiography results.</brief_summary>
