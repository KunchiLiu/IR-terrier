	<brief_title>Whole Body Washing With Chlorhexidine for the Eradication of MRSA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number and rate of infections due to meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)is increasing world wide. Patients who are colonized with MRSA are the main source for further distribution. In addition colonization with MRSA is a precondition for infection. Whole body washing with antiseptic solutions as part of eradication strategies for MRSA has been widely used. However, there is insufficient evidence to support use of topical antimicrobial therapy for eradicating of MRSA because treatment with antiseptic solution has never been compared to placebo. Comparison: The efficacy of whole body washing in the control of MRSA was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. The study treatment consisted of five days of whole body washing either with 4% chlorhexidine solution (verum) or with placebo. All patients received mupirocin nasal ointment and chlorhexidine mouth rinse. The outcome was evaluated 3, 4, 5, 9 and 30 days after treatment by swabs taken from several body site.</detailed_description>
