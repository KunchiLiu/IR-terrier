	<brief_title>Eisenmenger's Syndrome in Adults With CHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to examine medical records of patients with Eisenmenger's Syndrome in order to determine the effect of endothelin receptor antagonists, alone or in combination, with Sildenafil, on symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. This review will be conducted on Standard of Care procedures such as New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, six-minute walk exercise capacity, pulmonary pressures and oxygens saturations. Pulmonary pressures determined by echo or cardiac catheterization will be analyzed where available. We hypothesize that patients with congenital heart defects who develop ES will have an improved six-minute walk distance, improved pulmonary arterial pressures and improved oxygenation after treatment with endothelin receptor antagonists and other pulmonary vasodilators.</detailed_description>
