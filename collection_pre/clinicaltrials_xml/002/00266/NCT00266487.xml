	<brief_title>The Norwegian Vitamin Trial (NORVIT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observational studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of plasma total homocysteine is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of homocysteine lowering treatment with B vitamins for secondary prevention in patients who have experienced an acute myocardial infarction. This controlled, double-blind, multi-centre trial will include 3750 men and women aged 30-85 who have experienced an acute myocardial infarction within 7 days prior to randomization. Participants will be randomized, in a two-by-two factorial design, to receive one of the following four treatments: A, folic acid 0.8 mg plus vitamin B12 0.4 mg and vitamin B6 40 mg per day; B, folic acid 0.8 mg plus vitamin B12 0.4 mg per day; C, vitamin B6 40 mg per day; D, placebo. The primary end point during 3.5 years of follow-up is a composite of recurrent myocardial infarction and stroke and sudden death attributed to coronary artery disease.</detailed_description>
