	<brief_title>Treatment of Myocardial Infarction With Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary coronary intervention within a few hours of a myocardial infarction has greatly reduced mortality as well as the risk of developing chronic heart failure. There are though still a large number of patients that develop symptoms of heart failure in the form of fatigue and breathlessness with physical exertion in spite of medical treatment. With the advance in stem cell technology there is now hope for the possibility of regenerating/repairing dead myocardial tissue, hence improving cardiac function. The current study is a pilot study that is going to precede a later double blinded randomized study. The aim of the study is to evaluate patient safety, optimize procedures, and to be used in power calculation in the design of the following study.</detailed_description>
