	<brief_title>Pramipexole Conversion to Ropinirole Controlled Release (CR)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three different arms will be used in this study. Each of the three cohorts will be treated sequentially. Each participant will be taking Mirapex for PD and will be converted to Requip CR by 1 of 3 conversion factors (mg:mg): 1:3, 1:4 and 1:5 from Mirapex to once a day Requip CR. The first five subjects of each cohort will have their initial dose administered in the clinic and be monitored for orthostatic changes. Assessments of motor function before and after conversion will be done.</detailed_description>
