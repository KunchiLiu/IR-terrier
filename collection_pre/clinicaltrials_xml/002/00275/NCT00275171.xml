	<brief_summary>The study aims at clarifying (in a randomized, double-blinded design): 1. Whether stimulation with 0.1 mg rhTSH 24, 48 or 72 hours before induction of a 131I-tracer dosis increases the 131I uptake in patients with atoxic multinodular goitre and to study which time interval is the most optimal (Part I) 2. Whether patients suffering from atoxic multinodular goitre obtains a corresponding goitre reduction compared with a control group when stimulating with 0.1 mg rh TSH 24, 48 or 72 hours before 131I therapy and when reducing the thyroid radiation dose to 50 Gy (Part II) The two studies will be carried out successively on the same patient population. The 131I uptake will be carried out first followed by the I therapy itself. The patients are compared with a placebo-treated control group going through the same course of treatment, but the 131I dosis will be 100 Gy (standard treatment). After the 131I therapy, all patients are followed during one year with a regular ultrasound scan of the thyroid gland and control of the metabolic status. The patient satisfaction is monitored by the use of a visual-analogue-scale.</brief_summary>
