	<brief_summary>This study is being done to test new way of measuring the relaxation of the stomach after a meal (called gastric accommodation) by using a MRI scan. This new test will be compared with the standard test of measuring stomach relaxation that uses radioactive tracers. These tests will be compared in healthy volunteers and people with upper abdominal symptoms (known as dyspepsia).</brief_summary>
