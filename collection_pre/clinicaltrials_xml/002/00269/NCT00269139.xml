	<brief_summary>Dr. Laddis will test a hypothesis about the nature and the management of behavioral crises in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The term "behavioral crisis" is used strictly for periods of uncontrollable urges to repeat mental or outward activity, e.g., flashbacks, cutting, binging on food, drugs or sex, with no intervals to rethink one's priorities or to consider others' direction. The clinical hypothesis states, in two steps, that: 1. the perception of a life crisis precedes and then underlies every behavioral crisis; 2. the behavioral crisis resolves promptly and all symptoms end if the clinicians engage the patient about his management of the life crisis that underlies the symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcome of Crisis Intervention for Subjects With Borderline Personality Disorder or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects in the experimental group will be treated by Dr. Laddis after their admission to a crisis stabilization unit (CSU) or to an inpatient unit (IPU) for a behavioral crisis. Subjects will be included at random, as assigned to Dr. Laddis according to his routine duties at those units. Subjects in the control group will receive treatment for behavioral crisis according to the preference of the clinical staff at other comparable units. That treatment will constitute "treatment as usual". Clinicians in the control settings will not be informed about the experimental hypothesis, the clinical intervention and the contingent outcomes. The subjects will be tested for the results of treatment 12-24 hours after composition of a treatment plan. The testing will be done with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), as well as with a set of criteria devised by Dr. Laddis to measure the outward behavior and the mental events during behavioral crisis. The patients and the attending frontline staff will be interviewed also about their beliefs in regard to what, among the clinicians' interventions, made a difference for the course of the behavioral crisis, for better or for worse. The raters will be trained for interrater reliability and they will not be informed about the hypothesis.</detailed_description>
