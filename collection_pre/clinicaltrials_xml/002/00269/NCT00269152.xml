	<brief_summary>This study is a multicenter, open-label, two-arm, randomized, parallel Phase 2 feasibility study of pemetrexed in combination with either cisplatin (Arm A) or carboplatin (Arm B) as adjuvant combination-chemotherapy in participants with completely resected, stage Ib or IIa/IIb non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A two-stage design will be employed independently for both treatment arms, with the possibility of stopping each treatment early for lack of feasibility.</brief_summary>
