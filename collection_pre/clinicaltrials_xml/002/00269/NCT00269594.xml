	<brief_summary>The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lamictal in neurotic excoriation. Twenty subjects with neurotic excoriation will receive 12 weeks of open-label treatment with Lamictal. The hypothesis to be tested is that Lamictal will be effective and well tolerated in patients with neurotic excoriation. The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.</brief_summary>
