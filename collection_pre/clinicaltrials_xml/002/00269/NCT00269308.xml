	<brief_title>Chiropractic and Exercise for Seniors With Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neck pain (NP) is a considerable health problem, affecting both young and elderly individuals. Of particular concern is the negative impact NP may have on the functional ability of the geriatric population, already challenged by decreased mobility and balance associated with ageing. Chiropractic manual treatment and rehabilitative exercise have demonstrated potential for the treatment of NP in younger individuals, but have yet to be rigorously tested in the elderly. The broad, long-term objective of this research is to identify effective therapies for patients, 65 years and older, who suffer with chronic neck pain and to enhance their functional capacity. Primary Aims â€¢ To determine the relative clinical effectiveness of 1) chiropractic manual treatment and home exercise, 2) supervised rehabilitative exercise and home exercise, and 3) home exercise alone in both the short-term (after 12 weeks) and long-term (after 52 weeks), using patient-rated neck pain as the main outcome measure. Secondary Aims - To estimate the short- and long-term relative effectiveness of the three interventions using: - Patient-rated outcomes: neck related disability, general health status, patient satisfaction, improvement, and medication use measured by self-report questionnaires; - Objective functional performance outcomes: neck motion, strength and endurance, and functional ability measured by examiners masked to treatment group assignment; - Cost measures: direct and indirect costs, and cost utility of treatment measured by questionnaires, phone interviews, and medical records. - To describe patients' perceptions of treatment and the issues they consider when determining their satisfaction with care. This project is a collective effort by a multidisciplinary team, with an established record of collaborative research in the area of neck and back pain. The results of this study will provide valuable information for elderly neck pain sufferers and the clinicians who treat them.</detailed_description>
