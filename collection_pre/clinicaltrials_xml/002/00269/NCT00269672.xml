	<brief_summary>There is evidence that aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) contained as an adjuvant in conjugate vaccines enhances the immune response in infants. There is no data so far evaluating whether this also applies to adults. The objective of this study is to compare the immune response of 2 different 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate (13vPnC) formulations with and without AlPO4 to select a formulation and to compare the immune response to the chosen 13vPnC formulation relative to the immune response to 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS).</brief_summary>
