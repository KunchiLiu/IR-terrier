	<brief_title>New Tablet Formulation and Dosing Regimen of Balsalazide Disodium in Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects that achieve clinical improvement and improvement in the rectal bleeding subscale of the MMDAI at the end of eight weeks of therapy, where clinical improvement is defined as a greater than or equal to 3 point improvement from baseline in the MMDAI. The secondary endpoints are as follows: 1. The change from baseline over the duration of treatment in total MMDAI score and in the individual MMDAI subscales. 2. The change from baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8 in total MMDAI score and in each individual MMDAI subscale (endoscopy/sigmoidoscopy at Weeks 2 and 8 only). 3. The proportion of subjects with treatment failure, defined as withdrawal due to significant disease progression or lack of significant improvement, as determined by the Investigator. 4. The proportion of subjects with mucosal healing at Weeks 2 and 8, where mucosal healing is defined as an endoscopy/sigmoidoscopy score of 0 or 1 5. The proportion of subjects achieving complete remission at Week 2 and Week 8, where complete remission is defined as a MMDAI score of less than or equal to 1. 6. The proportion of subjects with improvement from baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8 in total MMDAI score and in each individual MMDAI subscale (endoscopy/sigmoidoscopy at Weeks 2 and 8 only). 7. Change from baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8 in diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and subjective sense of well being, as recorded in the subjects' diaries. 8. The proportion of subjects achieving clinical remission at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8, where clinical remission is defined as a score of 0 for rectal bleeding and a combined score of less than or equal to 2 for bowel frequency and physician assessment using the MMDAI. 9. Time to clinical remission, where clinical remission is defined as in secondary endpoint number eight. Safety endpoints are as follows: - incidence of treatment-emergent AEs grouped by body system and evaluated by treatment group; - changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters at each treatment visit by treatment group; and - changes from baseline in vital sign measurements at each treatment visit by treatment group.</detailed_description>

Oral contraceptives administered for at least 2 monthly cycles prior to study drug administration during all 6 months of study drug administration and administered for 1 monthly cycle following completion of the study. An intrauterine device (IUD), inserted by a qualified clinician, with published data showing that the lowest expected failure rate is less than or equal to 1% per year (not all IUDs meet this criterion). Medroxyprogesterone acetate (DEPOPROVERA) administered for a minimum of 1 monthly cycle prior to the study drug administration, during all 6 months of study drug administration, and administered for 1 monthly cycle following study completion. Norelgestromin/ ethinyl estradiol transdermal system (Ortho Evra patch) administered for at least 2 monthly cycles prior to study drug administration and administered for 2 monthly cycles following study completion Partner has undergone vasectomy and subject is in a monogamous relationship. The investigator is responsible for determining whether the subject is using appropriate birth control for study participation. Subject is greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Subjects with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis experiencing symptoms of an acute flare within the past 4 weeks. 3. Subject has not taken more than 2.4 grams of mesalamine or equivalent for a continuous period of 4 weeks preceding the screening visit 4. Subjects must have a baseline Modified Mayo Disease Activity Index (MMDAI) score between 6 and 10, inclusive. Additionally, subjects must score greater than or equal to 2 on Bleeding and greater than or equal to 2 on Endoscopy/Sigmoidoscopy. 5. Subject is capable and willing to comply with all study procedures. 6. Disease extends at least 20 cm from the rectum on screening sigmoidoscopy. A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply (Note: Development of any of the following exclusion criteria onstudy will be considered a basis for subject discontinuation.): 1. Subject has a significant medical, including psychiatric, condition which in the opinion of the investigator precludes participation in the study. 2. Subject has a history of allergy or intolerance to aspirin, mesalamine, or other salicylates. 3. Subject has recently (within the past 30 days) failed therapy with balsalazide disodium 4. Subject has received immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. azothioprine, 6 mercaptopurine) within 30 days, or corticosteroids (oral, intravenous [IV] or topical rectal) within 30 days prior to screening. 5. Subject has received intrarectal aminosalicylates within 14 days of screening. 6. Subject has had any prior bowel surgery, excepting appendectomy. 7. Subject has participated in an investigational drug or device study within the 30 days prior to study screening, with the exception of Salix protocols 3003 &amp; 3004 entitled: "A multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the use of mesalamine pellet formulation 1.5G QD to maintain remission from mildly to moderate ulcerative colitis." 8.

Females of Reproductive Potential: If a female subject becomes pregnant while on this study, the study drug will be discontinued immediately and the subject followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known. If a pregnancy occurs, it will be reported in the same manner as an unexpected AE using the guidelines provided in Section 6.4.1.9. Premature Subject Discontinuation: A subject may be discontinued from the study for the following medical or administrative reasons: Occurrence of an AE, which in the judgment of the investigator suggests an unacceptable risk to the subject (The investigator will follow the subject until satisfactory resolution of the AE or the AE is determined to be stable); Development onstudy of any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator or the study sponsor, places the subject at an unacceptable medical risk if he/she continues; Pregnancy; Subject request; Institution of additional medical (rescue) therapy for UC. The investigator may discontinue individual subjects from the study at any time. Subjects will be encouraged to complete the study; however they may voluntarily withdraw at any time. The investigator must provide written documentation of the reason for discontinuation on the CRF. Regardless of the reason for withdrawal, all subjects will be asked to undergo an end of therapy evaluation. Every attempt will be made to obtain all the end of study assessments, including all of the subscales of the MMDAI (i.e., bowel frequency, bleeding, physician's assessment, and endoscopy/sigmoidoscopy score). Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn will not be replaced under this protocol.</criteria>
