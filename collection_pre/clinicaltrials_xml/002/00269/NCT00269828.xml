	<criteria>1. Female. 2. Histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed diagnosis of NSCLC. 3. ECOG performance score of 2. 4. Patients who meet one of the following criteria: Stage IIIB who are not candidates for combined modality therapy (primary radiation therapy or surgery), or Stage IV. 5. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. 6. Adequate bone marrow function 7. Adequate renal function 8. Adequate hepatic function 9. Patients with known brain metastases must have received standard antitumor treatment for their CNS metastases as defined by the site’s institutional standards. 10. Patients who have had major surgery must be fully recovered from the surgery. 11. Ability to comply with the visit schedule and assessments required by the protocol. 12. For patients of reproductive potential, commitment to use adequate contraception. 13. Signed approved informed consent, with understanding of study procedures. 14. Agreement to begin study therapy within 8 calendar days after randomization. 1. Any intolerance to polyLglutamic acid, Poloxamer 188, dibasic sodium phosphate, monobasic sodium phosphate (the excipients of CT2103). 2. Evidence of small cell carcinoma, carcinoid, or mixed small cell/nonsmall cell histology. 3. Any prior systemic chemotherapy for the treatment of lung cancer. This includes systemic radiosensitizers used to treat brain metastases and any biologic agent. 4. Concurrent primary malignancies except for carcinoma in situ or nonmelanoma skin cancer. 5. Grade 2 or greater neuropathy. 6. Evidence of significant unstable neurological symptoms within the 4 weeks before study randomization. (If unstable neurologic symptoms resulted from brain metastases, patient must meet inclusion criteria number 9). 7. Clinically significant active infection for which active therapy is underway. 8. Investigational therapy within 4 weeks before randomization, unless local requirements are more stringent. 9. Unstable medical conditions including unstable angina or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months before randomization. Patients with evidence of cardiac conduction abnormalities are eligible if their cardiac status is stable. 10. Pregnant women or nursing mothers. 11.
