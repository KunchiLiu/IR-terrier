	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the classical tactics in the treatment of septic shock (dopamine, noradrenalin and dobutamine) to the use of vasopressin as first choice pressor. Vasopressin seems to be an interesting alternative in the treatment of septic shock. To this date, available studies have showed that it could correct hyperkinetic syndrome and vasoplegia in septic shocks without noticeable side effect. It as been demonstrated that vasopressin improves renal function, as no effect on digestive organs and as no metabolic effect.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Legally major patient presenting a septic shock. The time window between beginning of symptoms and onset of treatment is established at 12 hours. The patient must be intubated and mechanically ventilated. Patient presenting a mean arterial blood pressure of less than 60 mm Hg after adequate fluid resuscitation (at least 1 L of colloid or crystalloid) and 10 ug/Kg/min of dopamine. Patient presenting a cardiac index of at least 3 L/min/m2 Shock other than septic cardiac hypokinesia a preexisting organic renal failure that needs hemodyalisis oesophagal or gastric phatology that would lead to a nasogastric tube contraindication</criteria>
