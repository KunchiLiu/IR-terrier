	<brief_summary>This trial of SB-480848 in approximately 920 subjects with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) or CHD-risk equivalent will examine whether SB-480848 produces sustained inhibition of plasma Lp-PLA2 activity, explore the effects of SB-480848 on other circulating biomarkers associated with cardiovascular risk, and evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of SB-480848 over 12 weeks of once-daily oral dosing. Subjects will first be randomized 1:1 to double-blind atorvastatin 20 mg or 80 mg once daily for a minimum of 3 weeks. Subjects will then be randomized 1:1:1:1 to oral doses of SB-480848 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. Blood samples will be collected at various timepoints. Vital signs, electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory safety tests and adverse event assessments will be performed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SB-480848.</brief_summary>
