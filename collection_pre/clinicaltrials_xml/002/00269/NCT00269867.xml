	<brief_title>Infliximab Plus Methotrexate for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of infliximab in patients with active Rheumatoid Arthritis, despite methotrexate treatment. Infliximab is an anti-TNF chimeric monoclonal antibody (cA2). The primary measures of effectiveness include the change from baseline in American College of Rheumatology (ACR20) response at week 30, and the change in the modified van der Heijde Sharp Score. The ACR20 Responder Index a composite of clinical, laboratory, and functional measures and the van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) scoring method is a method of rating structural damage in patients.. Patients will be treated with either infliximab or matching placebo.</detailed_description>
