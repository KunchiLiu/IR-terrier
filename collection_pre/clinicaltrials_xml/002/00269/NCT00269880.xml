	<brief_title>A Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Abciximab, an Anti-Platelet Therapy, in Combination With Two Different Heparin Regimens in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of abciximab, an anti-platelet therapy, in combination with two different heparin regimens in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: abciximab/low-dose weight-adjusted heparin, abciximab/standard-dose weight-adjusted heparin, or placebo/standard-dose weight-adjusted heparin. The primary outcomes of the study include the number of deaths, myocardial infarctions, or repeat revascularizations within 6 months, and the number of deaths, myocardial infarctions, or severe myocardial ischemia leading to urgent repeat percutaneous coronary intervention or urgent coronary artery bypass surgery within 30 days. Please see attached results. Abciximab bolus plus 12-hour infusion with standard-dose weight-adjusted heparin; Abciximab bolus plus 12-hour infusion with low-dose weight-adjusted heparin; Placebo bolus plus 12-hour infusion with standard-dose weight-adjusted heparin</detailed_description>
