	<brief_summary>Preliminary not-controlled clinical studies of the efficacy of monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide administration in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis reported encouraging results, but no randomized controlled trial has been conducted so far. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of IV cyclophosphamide as compared to IV methylprednisolone administered every 4 weeks during 1 year and every 8 weeks during 1 year, on the delay to confirmed disability deterioration as assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The secondary objectives are to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy at 2 years on the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), the percentage of patients with disability deterioration (EDSS) and the number of relapses. An intention-to-treat statistical analysis will be carried out.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Preliminary not-controlled clinical studies of the efficacy of monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide administration in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis reported encouraging results, but no randomized controlled trial has been conducted so far. A slight efficacy of Methylprednisolone has been reported in this indication. Objectives The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of IV cyclophosphamide on the prevention of disability deterioration in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The secondary objectives are to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of IV cyclophosphamide on the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) and the number of relapses. Study design Randomized double-blind two-arm controlled trial. Intervention Experimental group : IV cyclophosphamide infusion administered every 4 weeks during 1 year and every 8 weeks during 1 year. Control group : IV methylprednisolone infusion administered every 4 weeks during 1 year and every 8 weeks during 1 year. Outcomes Primary outcome : delay to disability deterioration as assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS: 0.5 or 1 point increase, depending on baseline score) evaluated every 4 weeks for one year, then every 8 weeks for one year. Secondary outcomes : proportion of patients with disability deterioration (EDSS: 0.5 or 1 point increase, depending on baseline score), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) and the Z scores of MSFC three components, number of MS relapses, proportion of patients with adverse events and delay of occurrence of adverse events, quality of life questionnaires. - Quality of life questionnaires - Disability self-assessment questionnaires Main time of assessment : 2 years. Sample size 360 patients Statistical analysis Intention-to-treat analysis.</detailed_description>
