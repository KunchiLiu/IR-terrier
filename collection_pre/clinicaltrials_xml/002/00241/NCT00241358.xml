Adequate cardiac function with no history of congestive heart failure and no history of atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine clearance of ≥75% of normal (CockcroftGault equation) Adequate hepatic function as defined by a total bilirubin &lt;2x normal or absence of hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis Adequate neurologic function as defined by: No evidence of a severe central or peripheral neurologic abnormality. No history of cerebrovascular accident or seizure disorder requiring anticonvulsant medication Must be HIV1 &amp; 2 antibody, HIV1 antigen, and HTLVI &amp; II antibody seronegative, by FDA licensed test.
