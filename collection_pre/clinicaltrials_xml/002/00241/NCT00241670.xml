	<brief_summary>The aim of the study "Fluorescence-guided resection of malignant gliomas with 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) vs. conventional resection" is to determine how accurately contrast agent-accumulating tumour can be removed by primary surgery and to assess the clinical usefulness of this method.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorescence-guided Resection of Malignant Gliomas With 5-Aminolevulinic Acid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant gliomas are locally invasive tumors that carry a dismal prognosis despite a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Cytoreductive surgery is generally considered beneficial but complete resection of contrast enhancing tumor is achieved in less than 20 % of patients, one reason being the difficulty in discerning marginal, enhancing tumor intraoperatively. Five-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) leads to the accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins in malignant gliomas, a phenomenon under exploration for intraoperative identification and resection of these tumors. This study investigated the benefit derived from fluorescent-guided resections using 5-ALA on surgical radicality, progression-free survival and morbidity.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Radiological suspicion of a unilocular malignant glioma with distinct ring or garlandshaped contrast agentaccumulating tumour structures and a core of reduced intensity in the MRI (central necroses) with no significant nonstaining tumour tissue (exclusion of a secondary malignant glioma). Indication for surgical tumour resection. If radical resection is planned, the location of the contrast agentaccumulating tumour should allow complete resection. First operation of the tumour, no other tumourspecific pretreatment Karnofsky at least 70 % Patient's written informed consent Age 1872 years Tumour location in the midline, basal ganglia, cerebellum or brain stem More than one contrast agentaccumulating lesion unrelated to the primary tumour or extracerebral metastases Porphyria, hypersensitivity to porphyrins Renal insufficiency: Creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl Hepatic insufficiency: Bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dl Quick test &lt; 60 % gammaGT &gt; 70 U/I Malignancies other than basaliomas Existing or planned pregnancy or lactation, or inadequate contraception Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial or participation in another clinical trial in the 30 days preceding randomisation</criteria>
