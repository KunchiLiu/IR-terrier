	<brief_summary>The overall objective is to compare efficacy and safety of TachoComb S and standard surgical treatment for the control of local bleeding in patients undergoing surgical resection of renal tumours. Specific objectives include the comparison between test treatments of intra-operative haemostatic efficacy as well as post-operative blood loss, haematoma formation, and surgeon's rating of usefulness of test treatment.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Kidney Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Thrombin</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients of or above 18 years of age scheduled for resection of superficial tumour on the kidney and scheduled for open surgery. After the tumour resection the wound should be suitable for the treatments in the study, and the integrity of the urinary tract should be maintained. Exclusion criteria: Patients undergoing an emergency operation, or with more than one tumour will be excluded. Patients with a clinically abnormal value of prothrombin time or activated partial thromboplastin time, anamnetic evidence of coagulation disorders and a history of allergic reactions after application of human fibrinogen, human thrombin and/or collagen will be excluded. In case the tumour was resected by use of a laser scalpel, infrared coagulator or argon beamer and if any fibrin glue haemostatic was used before randomisation the patient will be excluded from the trial. Furthermore, patients will be excluded if extensive resection/extirpation of the kidney become necessary or in case of serious surgical complication occurring during the operation.</criteria>
