	<brief_summary>Several studies have previously examined the use of botulinum toxin serotype A for myofascial pain of the neck and shoulders (cervicobrachial syndrome). These studies have suffered from: 1. inclusion of confounding conditions in the proband group, and 2. inability to identify predictors of response. This study attempts to define the characteristics of responders to botulinum serotype A for myofascial pain of the neck and shoulders (cervicobrachial syndrome).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Botulinum Toxin Serotype A Injections for Cervicobrachial Myofascial Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: Single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, enriched trial. Subjects will wash-out of their existing pain medications at least 2 weeks prior to baseline visit. At baseline, patients with a Numerical Pain Rating of 4 or greater will be injected with Botulinum Toxin Serotype A. At 14 weeks postinjection, those who at the 6 weeks post-injection visit had at least a 50% decrease in their pain outcome measures will be randomized into one of two treatment groups. Group 1 will receive a second BTX injection while group 2 will receive an injection of saline and both groups will be followed for an additional 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
