	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that a well-designed hepatitis C (HCV) video education curriculum for active drug injectors will lead to measurable improvements in HCV testing rates, HAV and HBV vaccination rates, as well as knowledge and attitudes about this condition. The investigators will use a short 10 minute video designed for active drug users to and assess its impact vs. a usual-care counseling intervention. The investigators will measure and compare its impact at baseline, 4 weeks after video viewing, and 12 weeks after intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Video-Based HCV Curriculum for Active Injection Drug Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Active drug injectors are at high risk for contracting and transmitting HCV. Very few culturally-specific tools have been developed to improve outcomes in this population. We hypothesize that measurable improvements in HCV testing rates, hepatitis A and B vaccination rates, and knowledge, attitudes, and motivations toward behavior change may be elicited by such a curriculum. In this study, we will investigate the impact of a short HCV education video on active drug injectors at a syringe exchange program. Subjects will be enrolled in one of two cohorts: a usual-care cohort, which will receive the program's standard HCV counseling; vs an intervention cohort, which will view the education video. Subjects will undergo written testing for knowledge, attitudes about transmission behaviors, and motivations toward behavior change before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, 4 weeks after the intervention, and 12 weeks after the intervention. Additionally, we will measure and compare the rates of HCV testing and HAV/HBV vaccinations before and at the end of the 12 week time point in both cohorts.</detailed_description>
