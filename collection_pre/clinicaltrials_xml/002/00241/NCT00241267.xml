	<brief_summary>The exploration of neoplastic pulmonary pathology is based on computed tomography and bronchoscopy. This allows targeted samples of the identified lesions. A new ultrasonographic method is proposed as a non invasive and non irradiating technic by using a dedicated probe easily introduced via the channel of the fibrescope, so as to complete the identification of peripheral lesions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective of the study is to assess the ability of endobronchial ultrasonography to diagnose peripheral pulmonary lesions during the bronchoscopy and to correlate the abnormalities to computed tomography and/or histology. The dedicated probe consist of a linear array of 2-3 mm in diameter connected to a commercial unit.</detailed_description>
