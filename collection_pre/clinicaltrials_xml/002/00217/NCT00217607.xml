	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well paclitaxel works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue angiosarcoma or lymphangiosarcoma that cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Soft Tissue Angiosarcoma or Lymphangiosarcoma That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the 2-month objective response rate in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, unresectable soft tissue angiosarcoma or lymphangiosarcoma treated with paclitaxel. Secondary - Determine the 4- and 6-month response rate in patients treated with this drug. - Determine tolerability of this drug in these patients. - Determine the time to disease progression and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the clinical criteria predicting response in patients treated with this drug. - Correlate the efficacy of this drug with the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis regulation in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
