	<brief_summary>Study Objective: 1. To evaluate whether combined therapy with folic acid 2.5 mg/day, vitamin B6 50 mg/day and vitamin B12 1000 micrograms/day vs placebo reduces the rate of atherosclerosis progression, as evaluated by quantitative B-mode carotid ultrasound (US).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Homocysteine Lowering and Atherosclerosis Reduction Trial (HART)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HART study is designed as a substudy of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation-2 (HOPE-2)trial which evaluates the effect of combined therapy ? folic acid and vitamin B6 and B12 on clinical events. The study is designed to enrol 900 study participants randomized to homocysteine lowering therapies or placebo. Follow-up will estimate over 5 years. Study participants will undergo yearly carotid B-Mode ultrasound examinations.</detailed_description>
