	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: The use of nutritional supplements, such as selenium, may stop prostate cancer from growing. Internal radiation, such as brachytherapy, uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Giving selenium before brachytherapy may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying selenium to see how well it works compared to placebo in treating patients who are undergoing brachytherapy for stage I or stage II prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selenium in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Brachytherapy for Stage I or Stage II Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the effects of selenium vs placebo on tissue biomarkers of prostate cancer susceptibility, using tissue samples from biopsies before and after treatment, in patients undergoing brachytherapy for stage I or II prostate cancer. Secondary - Determine the effects of selenium on antioxidant enzyme activities in these patients. - Determine, preliminarily, whether there is a threshold effect among patients with low baseline levels of selenium treated with this drug. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral selenium for 3-6 weeks. Patients then undergo brachytherapy. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo for 3-6 weeks. Patients then undergo brachytherapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 and 6 months.</detailed_description>
