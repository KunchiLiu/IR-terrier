	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and bevacizumab to see how well they work compared to oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage II colon cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab is more effective than combination chemotherapy alone in treating colon cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin, Leucovorin Calcium, and Fluorouracil With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery for Stage II Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To demonstrate an improvement in 3-year disease-free survival for high-risk stage II colon cancer patients randomly assigned to 5-FU (fluorouracil), leucovorin (leucovorin calcium), oxaliplatin versus 5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare overall survival between the regimens. II. To further define the toxicity profiles of the regimens. III. To prospectively determine the impact of tumor biological characteristics on the survival of patients with stage II colon cancer. IV. To assess the association between oxaliplatin exposure, allelic variants in candidate genes, and neurotoxicity. (Pharmacogenetic ancillary objective) OUTLINE: Patients with high-risk disease are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (Arms A and B). Patients with low-risk disease are assigned to Arm C. ARM A: Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM B: Patients receive oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as in Arm A and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive bevacizumab alone for 12 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM C: Patients undergo observation. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then every 12 months for 10 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>STEP 1: INITIAL REGISTRATION The distal extent of the tumor must be &gt;= 12 cm from the anal verge on endoscopy; if this distance was not confirmed on endoscopy preoperatively, then the distal extent of the tumor must be &gt;= 12 cm from the anal verge as determined by surgical examination; colonoscopy should be performed postoperatively for those unable to have a preoperative colonoscopy to guarantee there are no synchronous lesions; (if tumor is located beyond sigmoid colon and centimeter distance unavailable, include anatomic region of colon, e.g. right colon, transverse colon, hepatic flexure descending colon, cecum etc.) Patients must have paraffinembedded tumor specimen available for evaluation of microsatellite instability and loss of heterozygosity at 18q, to determine high risk versus low risk Highrisk patients will be randomized to treatment Arms A or B Lowrisk patients will be registered to Arm C for observation NOTE: Every effort should be made to submit blocks (tumor and normal mucosa) to the Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCO) immediately; blocks CANNOT be accepted after day 50 (post surgery) in order to allow for molecular assessment Specific laboratory requirements for Step 2 must be obtained within 2 weeks prior to Step 2 randomization Patients must not have synchronous tumors Patients must not have appendiceal tumors Patients must not have a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) Patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) are eligible Patients must have no history of isolated, distant, or noncontiguous intraabdominal metastases, even if restricted Patients must have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon that meets the criteria below: Stage II adenocarcinoma (pT3/pT4a/pT4b pN0 M0 according to the definitions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer, 7th Edition, 2010): the tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolic tissues (pT3), penetrates to the surface of the visceral peritoneum (pT4a), or directly invades other organs or structures (pT4b); patients with mesenteric tumor deposits or satellites without identifiable residual lymph node in the absence of lymph node involvement are now designated pN1c, rather than pT3; patients with such tumor deposits are not eligible for E5202; patients must have had a complete resection (R0 resection) Patients must have &gt;= 8 lymph nodes evaluated and reported Patients must not have presented with clinical complete obstruction or perforation of the bowel Patients must not have had any systemic or radiation therapy initiated for this malignancy Patients must not have a previous or concurrent malignancy;
