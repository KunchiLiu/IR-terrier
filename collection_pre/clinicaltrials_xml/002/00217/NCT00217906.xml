	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: While increased asthma morbidity and mortality have been observed across all ethnicities, results from several studies have found that asthma morbidity has increased disproportionately in low-income African American children. Elementary school-based asthma education programs have shown promise in improving asthma management, and reducing asthma morbidity in this high-risk population, however, the fastest growing asthma risk is associated with children young than six. By elementary age many parents and children with asthma have well-established patterns of inappropriate asthma management that may be difficult to change. To date, no research has examined the impact of early intervention for asthma management in low-income, high-risk children. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Head Start sites will be randomized to either a minimal intervention control group or the A+ Asthma early intervention program designed to educate and assist Head Start teachers and family service coordinators to: optimize classroom management of asthma, educate, facilitate and reinforce appropriate parental medical and behavioral management of asthma, and instruct, model and reinforce early asthma knowledge and age-appropriate skills for preschool age children. The primary outcome that the study was designed to evaluate Head Start absences/days enrolled, determined by review of Head Start attendance records. The secondary outcomes specified in the protocol are health care utilization (emergency department visits, hospitalizations, primary care visits), asthma symptoms (restricted activity, symptom-free days, day and nighttime symptoms), asthma medications, parents' asthma-related quality of life, and parent, child and teacher asthma knowledge and management practices. The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.</detailed_description>
