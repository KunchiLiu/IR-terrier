	<brief_summary>Hand and foot skin diseases, such as dermatitis and psoriasis, that do not respond to topical creams can be treated with ultraviolet light therapy. Topical psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) is commonly used to treat these conditions, but requires additional time for the hands and feet to soak in psoralens before the light treatment. Newer narrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB) units have become available which allow for light treatment without soaking first. The purpose of this study is to determine if NBUVB is as effective as PUVA for hand and foot skin diseases.</brief_summary>
