	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving docetaxel together with bevacizumab is more effective than docetaxel alone in treating breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel together with bevacizumab works compared to docetaxel alone as first-line therapy in treating women with stage IV breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel With Bevacizumab as First-Line Therapy in Treating Women With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial began as a 2-arm study with a docetaxel-alone arm. When bevacizumab became widely available, it was converted to a 1-arm open-label trial of docetaxel/bevacizumab. Patients enrolled in the docetaxel-alone arm were permitted to cross over to docetaxel/bevacizumab. Patients received bevacizumab 15 mg/kg and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously (I.V.) every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.</detailed_description>
