	<brief_summary>This is a clinical trial in relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis to determine if Topamax added to Avonex has a neuroprotective effect as measured by the brain parenchymal fraction ( a measure of brain shrinkage) and by clinical assessment scores to evaluate disease progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study of Combination Treatment With Avonex and Placebo-Controlled Dosing of Topamax in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The protocol requires all participants to be treated with Avonex and in addition patients will be blindly assigned to either a group who receive Topamax or a placebo control. Repeated neurological and clinical examinations are performed with laboratory tests to determine any possible adverse drug effects. The scaled neurologic examinations (EDSS and MSFC) and brain MRI's are done at regular intervals to evaluate possible treatment effects.</detailed_description>
