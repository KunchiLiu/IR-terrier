	<brief_summary>This research is being done to study the effects (good and bad) of taking CellCept based on blood concentrations versus taking a fixed dose of CellCept without measuring the blood concentration. CellCept is one of the three immunosuppressant drugs (drugs that suppress the immune system) which will be taken as part of this kidney transplant study. Cyclosporine or tacrolimus and corticosteroids are the two other drugs which will be taken.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Kidney Transplant Study to Look at the Effects of Taking Fixed Doses of CellCept Versus Taking Doses of CellCept Based on the Concentration of CellCept in the Blood When Taking Full or Reduced Dose Calcineurin Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open label study, which means the participant will know which drugs they are on. Participants will be put in one of three groups within 24 hours of the participant's transplant. The participant will be asked to return throughout the 24 months for physical exams, blood and urine tests.</detailed_description>
