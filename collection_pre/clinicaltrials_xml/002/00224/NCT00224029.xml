	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Oxybutynin in Patients With Neurogenic Overactive Bladder Associated With a Neurological Condition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Dose Titration Period began with a 3.9 mg/day or 7.8 mg/day as a starting dose after the completion of a 3-day diary for baseline evaluations, including urodynamic testing. The clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) frequency remained constant throughout the Dose Titration Period. The dose was adjusted every two weeks during the Dose Titration Period by increasing one dose level, at the investigator's discretion, based on the patient's symptoms. If a patient achieved complete continence and reported tolerable or absence of side effects, the patient was continued at that dose for the duration of the 8-week Titration Period. If a patient reported unacceptable side effects, the dose was reduced by one level. This reduced dose was considered the maximum tolerable dose for the patient and the patient continued at that dose for the duration of the 8-week Titration Period. The dose levels evaluated were 3.9 mg/day, 7.8 mg/day, 9.1 mg/day, and 11.7 mg/day. Of the 22 subjects in the modified intent-to-treat population evaluated for efficacy, 0 were in the 3.9 mg/day dose group, 3 were in the 7.8 mg/day dose group, 8 were in the 9.1 mg/day dose group, and 11 were in the 11.7 mg/day dose group.</detailed_description>
