	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to improve the survival rate of those patients with acute fulminant hepatitis through treatment with the MARS® extra-corporal liver-purification system by: 1. Reducing the number of patients who die before a graft is available 2. Increasing the chances of survival without a liver transplant 3. Reducing the pre- and post-operative mortality in transplant patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The MARS® Albumin Dialysis System in Patients With Fulminant and Subfulminant Hepatic Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with fulminant or subfulminant hepatitis with either an indication or a relative contraindication to a liver transplantation, are randomized to two groups: 1. A group treated with the conventional medical intensive treatment (including the hemodialysis techniques, continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration, if necessary) and the gold standard surgical treatment (liver transplantation) compared to 2. A group receiving, in addition to the conventional medical intensive treatment, albumin dialysis using the MARS device and the gold standard surgical treatment (liver transplantation).</detailed_description>
