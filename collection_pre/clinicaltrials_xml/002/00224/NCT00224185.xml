	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain biologic materials from the blood and lungs of normal individuals to establish a set of normal range for various parameters. These will provide important information when applied to individuals with various pulmonary diseases, and will help in understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of various lung diseases.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study procedures will be performed at the Weill Cornell Medical College-New York Presbyterian Hospital and/or Weill Greenburg York Avenue Building. Study procedures done elsewhere that are within the protocol timeframe will be accepted if seen fit by the investigators so that they are not repeated unnecessarily. Study individuals who undergo bronchoscopy with intravenous administration of sedatives and analgesia may be required to stay overnight. Bronchoscopy is normally an ambulatory procedure. The subject is observed after the bronchoscopy, including vital signs and level of consciousness, until they are back to baseline. An overnight stay would only be required if the individual was not, in the judgment of the attending physician, safe to be discharged as is standard practice. Follow up of all participants are carried out by telephone within 1 wk following the procedure. Rockefeller University has been added as a second site. Individuals undergoing bronchoscopy without intravenous administration of sedatives and analgesia are not required to stay overnight due to the lack of administration of CNS-altering drugs and the limited sampling involved (tracheal brushes only).</detailed_description>
