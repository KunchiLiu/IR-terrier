	<brief_summary>ADHD is often associated with sleep difficulties. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common problem presented to children mental health services. The disorder affects approximately 5 % of school-age children. The core symptoms of this disorder include varying degrees of inattention, impulsiveness and restlessness. In addition to the core symptoms, ADHD is associated with other problems (e.g. academic underachievement, poor social relations and sleep disturbances). Despite clinical observations of sleep problems in children with ADHD, there is little empirical research on this topic. The prevalence, type of sleep problems, and significance of these sleep disturbances in children with ADHD remain undocumented. The objective is to determine the relationship of sleep problems to attention deficit/hyperactive disorder, comorbid disorders, and the effect of stimulant treatment.</brief_summary>
