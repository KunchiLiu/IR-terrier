	<brief_summary>Friedreich ataxia, an autosomal recessive condition, ascribed to frataxin gene expansion, has been shown to result from an iron- induced injury to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Buffering free radicals with short-chain quinones (Idebenone) protects the patients against cardiomyopathy but not CNS involvement. Removing CNS iron should limit the impact of the neurological symptoms of the disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current clinical trial is a monocentric open phase1-2 trial in the context of rare diseases framework, aimed to the goal of defining the tolerance/efficacy of the treatment.
