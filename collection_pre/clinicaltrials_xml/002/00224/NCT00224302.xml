	<brief_title>Treatment of MDEs During the Course of Psychotic Disorders With Duloxetine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive episodes (MDE) frequently occur during the course of schizophrenic psychoses, both as as "post-psychotic" depressions, and also independently from psychotic episodes. A number of clinical studies reported the application of different antidepressive substances, such as Imipramine, Reboxetine or Venlafaxine. In general, the treatment of schizophrenic patients with antidepressive drugs can be considered as necessary and save, resulting in therapeutic guidelines of different psychiatric societies. However, since 5 to 10 % of the schizophrenic patients commit suicide, there is still much effort necessary in order to improve the treatment of affective symptoms in schizophrenic psychoses.The recently introduced antidepressive substance Duloxetine selectively inhibits as a SSNRI the reuptake of serotonine and noradrenaline from the synaptic cleft. Duloxetine was proven as antidepressive, anxiolytic and analgetic in a series of multi-centre, placebo-controlled investigations. Based on these considerations and on successful experiences in single case reports we aim to investigate the therapeutic effects of duloxetine in patients with lifetime diagnoses of the schizophrenic spectrum.</detailed_description>
