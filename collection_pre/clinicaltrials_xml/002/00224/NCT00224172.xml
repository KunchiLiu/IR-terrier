	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to construct a prognostic model to identify risks of poor outcomes at one year following hospital discharge of patients treated in an ambulatory cate setting. The study will incorporate pre-hospitalization characteristics, hospitalization events, comorbidity burden, psychosocial measures and post-hospitalization care characteristics to predict re-hospitalization and mortality at one year.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This model will identify potentially modifiable variables in the post-hospitalization clinic setting that result in increased rates of hospital readmission and mortality. Specifically, it is hypothesized that longer time to first outpatient visit after hospitalization, multiple providers, poor follow-up with scheduled appointment and discrepancies between discharge and outpatient medication lists will be predictors of adverse outcomes. Utilizing statistical modeling methods, it will be possible to recognize at risk patients, to identify modifiable risk factors and outpatient care characteristics, and in the future, to direct patient specific interventions to improve outcomes.</detailed_description>
