	<brief_summary>The purpose of this protocol is to obtain biologic materials from the blood and lungs from patients with lung disease in order to develop an understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of these disorders. General admission criteria for this project will require at least one of the following: (1) symptoms consistent with pulmonary disease; (2) chest X-ray consistent with lung disease; (3) pulmonary function tests consistent with lung disease; (4) lung biopsy consistent with lung disease; (5) family history of lung disease; and (6) patients with diseases of organs with known association with lung disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Lungs of Individuals With Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will undergo a general medical evaluation by a pulmonary physician (and consultants as appropriate for other organs). The typical routine medical studies to be carried out may include: chest X-ray (posterior-anterior and lateral), non-contrast high resolution CT scan of the chest, pulmonary function tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, general hematologic studies, general serologic studies, /immunologic studies, biochemical analyses (including carboxyhemoglobin to measure blood carbon monoxide levels in order to accurately evaluate the diffusion capacity in individuals who smoke since smoking increases the blood levels of carbon monoxide), alcohol blood test, urinalysis, urine chemistries (including blood or urine nicotine and cotinine test to evaluate urine for active or passive exposure to nicotine), blood or urine drug screening (to evaluate use of recreational drugs and/or mood altering medications), pregnancy test (if applicable) and HIV serology. Also, a sweat chloride and sweat rate test may be performed by the physician to evaluate participants with a possible diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The study individual will undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy with a combination of bronchial brushing and/or bronchoalveolar lavage and/or bronchial wall biopsy. The primary factor for determining if an individual will have bronchial alveolar lavages (BAL) and/or brushings and/or biopsies is the particular lung disease affecting the individual. This will depend on the known mechanism relevant to the pathogenesis of the particular disease. For example, in individuals with asthma, the samples may include airway brushing and airway biopsies; in contrast, in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sampling may include airway brushings, airway biopsies, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Other determining factors include: the amount of moderate sedation (if used) and the amount of analgesia used; the maximal dosage of topical lidocaine that is allowed per procedure; allergic reactions to any of the medications used in the procedures; and individual's tolerance to the procedure.</detailed_description>
