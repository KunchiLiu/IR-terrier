	<brief_title>Ultrasound Study of the Uterine Healing Process After Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are recruiting women who are presenting for their first (primary) cesarean delivery. They will be randomized to one- or two-layer myometrial closure at the time of their cesarean delivery. Ultrasound will be used to serially assess the myometrial thickness and myometrial remodeling process.</detailed_description>
