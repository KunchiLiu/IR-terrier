	<brief_title>Acute Cognitive and Neurobehavioral Intervention: Efficacy Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the efficacy of the First Steps intervention for improving neurobehavioral functioning, functional status, and life satisfaction, and for increasing knowledge about TBI and compensatory strategies. The First Steps program was developed to address the neurobehavioral and emotional concerns of survivors of TBI during the course of inpatient rehabilitation. Program format and content reflects clinical experience and extensive research review. Input from survivors, family members, and rehabilitation staff trained in working with the TBI population has also helped shape the implementation protocol. The foundation of the protocol is a curriculum [Niemeier, J., Kreutzer, J., &amp; Taylor, L. (2005). Acute cognitive and neurobehavioral intervention for individuals with acquired brain injury: Preliminary outcome data. Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 15(2), 129-146.] The First Steps curriculum consists of ten lessons and was developed to address the common needs, issues, and concerns of TBI survivors admitted acutely for inpatient rehabilitation.</detailed_description>
