	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate various methods for estimating body composition in human subjects. Each subject is evaluated by several methods that are then compared to a criterion value. We hypothesize that the prediction method will yield the same result as the criterion value. The risks to subjects are minimal and all techniques are routinely performed.</brief_summary>
