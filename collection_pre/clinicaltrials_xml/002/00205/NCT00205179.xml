	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the potential effects of soy isoflavone supplements on cognitive function for men and women with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Preliminary studies evaluating the effects of soy supplements on memory in cognitively healthy older adults have yielded promising results that are now being evaluated in patients with AD. It is hypothesized that isoflavone supplements will ameliorate cognitive declines for older adults diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, when compared to subjects on placebo.</brief_summary>
