	<brief_summary>Normal hearing listeners gain important everyday benefits from listening with two ears (bilateral hearing) compared to their baseline performance with hearing aids. Advantages of bilateral hearing include the ability to determine where sounds are coming from and the ability to hear sounds and understand speech in noisy environments. Based upon these advantages, this study will (1) evaluate the benefit of hearing with two Bionic Ear implants (one in each ear) and (2) compare HiResolution sound processing with conventional sound processing.</brief_summary>
