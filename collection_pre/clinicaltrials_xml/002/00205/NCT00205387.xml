	<brief_summary>Cardiac elastography is a new technique to analyze strain and strain rates in many organ systems, including the heart. In this study, cardiac elastography derived from the analysis of raw radiofrequency data obtained from a conventional clinical echocardiograph system will be compared to processed information that comes from the same echocardiograph system. The purpose of this study is to determine if cardiac elastography can accurately determine strain and strain rates as compared to more conventional means.</brief_summary>
