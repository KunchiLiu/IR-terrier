	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the acute and chronic effectiveness of the Advanced Bionics Precision(TM) Spinal Cord Stimulation System in subjects with failed back surgery syndrome and associated low back axial pain. Subjects will undergo a temporary or permanent trial to assess their candidacy for placement of an implantable pulse generator. Those who demonstrate a significant clinical reduction in pain will be enrolled in the chronic study. Subjects will be followed for 12 months post implantation to assess the long-term effectiveness of the therapy.</brief_summary>
