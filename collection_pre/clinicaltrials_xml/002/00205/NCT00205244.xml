	<brief_summary>Children scheduled for elective surgery are randomized into a control and intervention group. Children in the intervention group receive a CD and booklet of relaxation and distraction stories to listen to/read during the preoperative period. Preoperative anxiety is assessed by the child life specialist in the preoperative holding area. Ease of induction and emergence from anesthesia are rated by the anesthesia care provider. Post-hospital behaviors are reported by the parents one week after discharge. It is hypothesized that children receiving the intervention will have less anxiety, easier induction and emergence from anesthesia, and fewer changes in post-hospital behaviors than children in the control group.</brief_summary>
