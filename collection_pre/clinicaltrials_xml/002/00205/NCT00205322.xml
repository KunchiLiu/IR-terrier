	<brief_summary>The combination of oxaliplatin, 5-FU, leucovorin, and capecitabine is hypothesized to retain and potentially improve upon the activity of the FOLFOX regimens. Additionally, the use of an oral rather than an infusional 5-fu regimen represents a clear advantage in terms of both patient convenience and lack of associated catheter-related complications.</brief_summary>
