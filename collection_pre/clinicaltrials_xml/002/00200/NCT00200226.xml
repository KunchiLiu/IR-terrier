	<brief_summary>An endometrial biopsy involves a thin tube being passed through the cervix (opening of the uterus) to obtain a sample of the lining of the uterus. Sometimes there may be discomfort with this procedure especially if the cervix is not dilated or opened. Previous research has suggested that taking a drug called misoprostol may help the cervix to start to dilate or open. This study will see if misoprostol will help open the cervix for an endometrial biopsy, to lessen the discomfort and make the biopsy easier to perform.</brief_summary>
