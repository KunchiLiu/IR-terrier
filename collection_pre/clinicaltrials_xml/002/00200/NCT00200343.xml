	<brief_summary>This study is a 24-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind control trial with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in patients with chronic hepatitis C in Japan. The primary objectives of this study are to verify the superiority of efficacy of UDCA 600 or 900mg/day to that of 150mg/day and the safety of UDCA treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Ursodeoxycholic Acid to Treat Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a 24-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind control trial with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in patients with chronic hepatitis C in Japan. The primary objectives of this study are to verify the superiority of efficacy of UDCA 600 or 900mg/day to that of 150mg/day and the safety of UDCA treatment. The primary endpoint was percent changes of serum alanine aminotransferase(ALT) levels at 24-week of administration compared to pre-administration levels and secondary endpoints, serum aspartate aminotransferase(AST) and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase(gamma-GTP) levels. Further, changes of bile acid composition and HCV-RNA levels at 24-week of administration were examined.</detailed_description>
