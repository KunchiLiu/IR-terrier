Patinets with a history of true allergy to morphine or its derivatives (including apomorphine), sulfur, sulfur containing medications, sulfites, sulfates, Tigan(R)(trimethobenzamide). Patients treated with experimental agents (other than apomorphine intermittent subcutaneous injections) within 30 days before study entry.
