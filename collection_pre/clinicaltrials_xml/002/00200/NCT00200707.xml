	<brief_summary>Emerging evidence suggests that stem cells and progenitor cells derived from bone marrow can be used to improve cardiac function in patients after acute myocardial infarction. In this randomised trial, we aim to assess whether intracoronary transfer of autologous bone-marrow cells could improve myocardial viability at 3 and 12 months' follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction, 100 patients are randomly assigned to either a control group (n=50) who receives an optimal medical treatment, or a bone-marrow-cell group (n=50) who receives an optimal medical treatment and intracoronary transfer of autologous bone-marrow cells 7â€¢10 days after PCI.</detailed_description>
