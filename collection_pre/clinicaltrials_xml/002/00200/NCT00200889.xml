	<brief_title>Effect of Acupuncture on Human Brain Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese practice involving the insertion of needles into specific parts of the body for therapeutic purposes. Although the practice has become more popular in the West, the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture have not been thoroughly examined. This study will determine how acupuncture affects human brain activity, particularly during deqi, a unique sensation experienced during acupuncture that is considered essential to the clinical effectiveness of the practice. This study will comprise 2 clinic visits. At Visit 1, participants will be randomly assigned to receive manual acupuncture; electro-acupuncture, which passes an electrical current through the needles; or some type of sensory stimulation. At Visit 2, participants will again be randomly assigned to receive one of the three interventions. As participants receive their assigned intervention, they will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans. Participants will also have their heart rate monitored during the brain scans.</detailed_description>
