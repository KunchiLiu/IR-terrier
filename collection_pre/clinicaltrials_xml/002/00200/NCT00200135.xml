	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out how many helmeted versus non-helmeted motorcycle accident victims (MCA) sustain head and/or face injuries. Also, we will find out how much it costs to get medical care for head and face injuries in helmeted versus non-helmeted motorcycle victims. Finally, we will compare how long it takes helmeted versus non-helmeted motorcycle victims with face and head injuries to return to work.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, quasi-experimental research study that will compare clinical outcomes of helmeted versus non-helmeted motorcycle victims admitted to trauma centers, as well as victims treated and released from emergency departments. The primary objective of this study is: - To determine if the financial charges and ratio of cost to charges (RCC), including acute hospitalization, rehabilitation or skilled care, outpatient care, and time to return to work (implying lost wages) is different between helmeted versus non-helmeted motorcyclists with head or face injuries Secondary objectives include: - To determine if inpatient mean total acute care and downstream charges and RCC are higher for non-helmeted versus helmeted motorcycle victims admitted to three Pennsylvania trauma centers with head and face injuries - To determine the mean time of return to full duty work (at previous level of employment) is shorter for helmeted or non-helmeted motorcycle victims admitted to three Pennsylvania trauma centers with head and face injuries - To determine if non-helmeted or helmeted motorcycle victims admitted to three Pennsylvania trauma centers have increased incidence and severity of head and face injuries - To determine the incidence and severity of non-helmeted motorcycle accident victims is higher than helmeted counterparts treated and released from emergency departments for face and head injuries - To determine if non-helmeted motorcycle victims die at scene or in emergency departments (from head and face injuries) more often than helmeted motorcycle victims - To determine if more helmeted or non-helmeted motorcycle accident victims require no immediate medical care for head and face injuries</detailed_description>
