	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multi-centre, randomised Phase III study, looking at a series of 480 patients up to the age of 65 with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) not previously treated. They will receive VAD or Velcade®/dexamethasone combination as induction treatment plus/minus (±) dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide/etoposide/cisplatin (DCEP) followed by autograft as first-line therapy, as the investigators try to compare the complete remission (CR) rate (with negative or positive immunofixation) at the end of their induction treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After their written informed consent has been obtained and their eligibility verified, patients are randomised between 4 treatment arms: A1 VAD (4 cycles); A2 VAD (4 cycles) followed by DCEP (2 cycles); B1 Velcade® + dexamethasone (4 cycles); B2 Velcade® + dexamethasone (4 cycles) followed by DCEP (2 cycles) A1, A2, B1, B2 + autograft. Randomisation will be stratified on the basis of the initial b2 microglobulin level (&gt; or &lt; 3 mg/l) and the presence of chromosome 13 abnormalities identified by FISH analysis. VAD: Vincristine/Adriamycin/Dexamethasone; DCEP: Dexamethasone/Cyclophosphamide/ Etoposide/Cisplatin.</detailed_description>
