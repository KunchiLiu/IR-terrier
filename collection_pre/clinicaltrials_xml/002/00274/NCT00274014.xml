	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of a one-year treatment with inhaled tiotropium bromide 18 mcg once daily on lung function, incidence and severity of exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The secondary purpose was to explore possible relationships between lung function changes and occurrence of COPD exacerbations and to try to characterize these exacerbations.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This was a multicentre, randomised, double blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, one year study. It was designed to determine the effect of inhaled tiotropium treatment on airflow obstruction (PEFR), incidence and severity of exacerbations in patients with COPD. Following an initial 3-week screening period qualifying patients were randomized to either tiotropium or placebo at Visit 2. Patients returned to the clinic at weeks 6 (Visit 3), 12 (Visit 4), 24 (Visit 5), 36 (Visit 6), 48 (Visit 7) and at Week 50 for the conclusion of the trial (Visit 8). The patients received treatment daily for 48 weeks (336 days). PEFR, as well as use of rescue medication and respiratory condition, were self-assessed by patients and recorded every morning on a graphical diary card every morning. The graphical presentation of these data was supposed to help investigators to detect exacerbations occurring between two consecutive visits. Details on hospitalizations due to COPD exacerbations were recorded in a special hospitalization booklet. Study Hypothesis: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of a one-year treatment with inhaled tiotropium bromide 18 mcg once daily on lung function, incidence and severity of exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The secondary purpose was to explore possible relationships between lung function changes and occurrence of COPD exacerbations and to try to characterize these exacerbations. Comparison(s): Tiotropium 18 mcg once daily vs Placebo</detailed_description>
