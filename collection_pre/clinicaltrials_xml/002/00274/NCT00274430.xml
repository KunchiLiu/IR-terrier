	<brief_summary>A double-blind placebo controlled study - To compare the effect of tadalafil and dexamethasone versus placebo on Ppa and pulmonary edema formation in subjects susceptible to HAPE. - To investigate the effect of dexamethasone on alveolar fluid clearance, as assessed by measurement of the nasal potential difference, and prevention of HAPE. - To investigate the effect of the tadalafil and dexamethasone versus placebo on the dynamic CBF autoregulation properties and on the development of AMS in HAPE susceptible subjects.</brief_summary>
