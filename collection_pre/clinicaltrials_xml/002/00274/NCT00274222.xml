	<brief_title>The Role of Nebulized Budesonide in the Treatment of Acute Exacerbations of COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients, hospitalized with AECOPD, were randomized into three groups. Group I received only bronchodilator treatment (BDT), Group II received SC (40 mg prednisolon) plus BDT, and Group III received nebulized budesonide (NB)(1500 mcg qid) plus BDT. Improvement rates in multiple parameters during 10-day hospitalization, and acute exacerbation and re-hospitalization rates within one-month after discharge were compared between the groups.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>COPD patients who were admitted to our pulmonary department for an acute exacerbation were prospectively enrolled in the study COPD patients hospitalized with specific reasons like pneumonia, pulmonary emboli, congestive heart failure, pneumothorax etc. as the cause of acute exacerbation, or patients with risk of imminent respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or direct admission to the ICU were excluded.</criteria>
