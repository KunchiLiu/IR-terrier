	<brief_title>Effects of a 9-months Treatment of SPIRIVA on Health Related Quality of Life in Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a multicentre, randomised, double blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, 9 month study. It was designed to determine the effect of inhaled tiotropium treatment on quality of life in patients with COPD. Following an initial 2-week screening period, patients were randomized to either tiotropium or placebo at Visit 2. Patients returned to the clinic at month 3 (Visit 3), 6 (Visit 4), and 9 (Visit 5) for the conclusion of the trial. The patients received treatment daily for 9 months. Quality of life was measured on each visit by using the Saint george's respiratory Questionnaire. Additionally a short form questionnaire was developped for that study (Visual Simplified Respiratory Questionnaire). Lung function was also measured at each visit by spirometry. Study Hypothesis: The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of Tiotropium and placebo on improving HRQoL evaluated by the percentage of SGRQ responders. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the effect on HRQoL assessed by the percentage of SGRQ responders between the two treatment groups. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in effect on HRQoL assessed by the percentage of SGRQ responders between tiotropium and placebo. The test will be performed at the alpha = 0.05 level of significance. Comparison(s): Tiotropium 18 mcg once daily vs Placebo</detailed_description>
