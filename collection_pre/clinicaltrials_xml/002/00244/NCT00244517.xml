	<brief_summary>Anaesthetics may impair the diastolic function of the heart, but the importance of this finding for patients has not been sufficiently examined. Specially the effects on diastolic function in patients with diastolic dysfunction has to be determined. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of isoflurane (only part I), sevoflurane and desflurane (part I+II) on the diastolic left ventricular function by doppler echocardiography.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DIAFAX I+II-Effects of Inhalative Anesthetics on Left Ventricular Diastolic Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In part I, 60 healthy young subjects free from cardiovascular disease will be examined. In part II, 50 patients with impaired diastolic but preserved systolic function, i.e., patients with arterial hypertension and ejection fraction &gt; 50%. Doppler echocardiography will be performed at baseline before induction of anaesthesia, during anaesthesia in the spontaneously breathing patient, and in the mechanically ventilated patient.</detailed_description>
