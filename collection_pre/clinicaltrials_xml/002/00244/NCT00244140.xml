	<brief_summary>This is a research study involving the use of a contrast agent called Ultravist Injection. Ultravist, the study drug, is used to improve the pictures obtained using computed tomography (CT). Ultravist acts like a dye to make CT pictures brighter and easier to read. In the case of this study, it will be injected into a vein in the patient's arm; from there, it travels through the blood stream and to the areas to be examined. CT scans will then be taken of the patient's head and/or body as ordered by his/her physician. Phase IIIb Study to Document the Safety and Efficacy of Ultravist 370 mg I/ml, When Administered Intravenously, in Volumes up to 162.2 ml, for Clinically Indicated Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) of the Head and/or Body</brief_summary>
