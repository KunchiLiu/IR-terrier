	<brief_title>Acupuncture in Treating Hot Flashes in Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the impact of acupuncture therapy on the frequency and intensity of hot flashes and the quality of life of patients with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation. - Determine if blood serotonin and urinary 5-HIAA are increased in patients treated with acupuncture. - Determine if plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide and MHPG are reduced in patients with hot flashes due to androgen deprivation treated with acupuncture. - Determine the ability of tongue diagnosis, a traditional Chinese clinical assessment method, to predict clinical and biological changes in these patients. - Determine the effect of acupuncture on insomnia and loss of vitality caused by hot flashes in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo acupuncture for 30 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks and then once weekly for an additional 6 weeks. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10, and then at 6 weeks after completion of study treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
