	<brief_summary>Current treatments for head lice include over-the-counter products such as permethrin and prescription products such as OVIDE (malathion 0.5%) lotion. In a previous phase II study, a novel, easy-to-use malathion 0.5% formulation was found to be a safe treatment for head lice. The current study will compare the efficacy and safety of this novel formulation of malathion with OVIDE and with an over-the-counter permethrin product.</brief_summary>
