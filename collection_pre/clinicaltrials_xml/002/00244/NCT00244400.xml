	<brief_title>Examine the Possible Association of Hepatic CYP3A Activity and the Susceptibility to Femur Head Necrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Femur head necrosis is one of the major side effects of corticosteroid therapy. Since corticosteroids are metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A, a low endogenous activity of this enzyme may contribute to the pathogenesis of ONFH. The purpose of the present study was to examine the possible association of hepatic CYP3A activity and the susceptibility to femur head necrosis in patients treated with corticosteroids.</detailed_description>
