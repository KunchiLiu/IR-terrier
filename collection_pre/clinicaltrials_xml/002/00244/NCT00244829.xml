	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving imatinib mesylate after a donor stem cell transplant may prevent the recurrence of Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving imatinib mesylate after a donor stem cell transplant and to see how well it works in treating patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate After a Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety of adjuvant imatinib mesylate after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) in patients with high-risk Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia. Secondary - Determine the bcr/abl transcript load during the first 90 days after AHSCT in patients treated with this drug from the time of engraftment. - Determine the 1-year survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot, multicenter study. Beginning within 14-30 days after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily until 1 year after transplantation. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
