	<brief_summary>To compare renal function (51Cr-EDTA clearance) 48 hours post open-heart surgery (coronary bypass or valve surgery) in patients with impaired renal function after randomization to either nifedipine infusion at start of surgery and the following 24 hours or placebo (0.9% saline infusion). Study hypothesis is that nifedipine has a prophylactic effect on decline in renal function.</brief_summary>
