	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to evaluate the metabolic effects of concomitant use of three consecutive doses of recombinant human growth hormone over three days and exercise during continuous nutrient infusion in chronic hemodialysis patients. We would also like to evaluate the metabolic effects of nutritional supplementation alone without the additional anabolic strategies.</brief_summary>
