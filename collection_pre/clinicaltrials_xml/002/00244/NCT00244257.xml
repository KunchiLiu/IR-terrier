	<brief_summary>This study is designed to investigate the safety of a single infusion of GMA161 in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, as well as, the way the drug enters and leaves the body. In addition, throughout the study, platelet counts and other blood cell numbers will be measured. NOTE: A decision was made to terminate this study in June 2008 due to low enrollment.</brief_summary>
