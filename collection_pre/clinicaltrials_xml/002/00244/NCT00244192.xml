	<brief_title>Effects of Infliximab (Remicade) on Fat Free Mass in Patients With Moderate to Severe COPD Suffering From Cachexia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD is a multicomponent disease characterized by abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles that accompanied by systemic effects like weight loss, muscle wasting, reduced functional capacity and health status. A persistent systemic inflammatory response reflected by enhanced levels of acute phase proteins like C-reactive protein (CRP) or pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) - α, is present in COPD. There are several studies that indicate that an increased systemic inflammator response is associated with weight loss, cachexia (loss of fat-free muscle mass), physical functioning and health status. Cachexia associated with systemivc inflammation can not always readily be overcome by nutritional intervention alone. The hypothesis of this study is that infliximab therapy (3 infusions with 5 mg/kg infliximab or placebo 1:1 on week 0, 2 and 6) will increase fat-free mass relatively to placebo by decreasing inflammation. Secondary endpoints are: lung function, muscle function, exercise capacity and health status. On week 8, 12 and 26 follow-up measurements will be done.</detailed_description>

Treatment with any other therapeutic agent targeted at reducing TNFa (e.g. pentoxifylline, thalidomide, etanercept, etc.) within 3 months of screening. Treatment with immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapy. 16. Previous administration of infliximab 17. Known allergy to murine products 18. Are considered ineligible according to the TB eligibility assessment, screening, and early detection of reactivation rules defined in Section 4.3. 19. Have or have had an opportunistic infection (eg, herpes zoster [shingles], cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis carinii, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, or mycobacteria other than TB) within 6 months prior to screening. 20. Have a chest radiograph at screening that shows evidence of malignancy, infection, or any abnormalities suggestive of TB 21.
