	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a drug named tamsulosin (Flomax), or another drug named dutasteride (Avodart), or a combination of these two drugs is effective in improving urinary symptoms and decreasing the rate of intermittent self-catheterization after prostate brachytherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Tamsulosin and/or Dutasteride to Relieve Urinary Symptoms After Brachytherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Image-guided transperineal permanent prostate brachytherapy (PI) is an accepted curative treatment option for patients with early stage prostate cancer. The most severe side effect of PI is urinary retention requiring intermittent self-catheterization (ISC). This study will assess the ability of pharmacologic intervention to ameliorate the post-operative side effect of PI. The use of both tamsulosin and dutasteride is proposed to have benefit in reducing urinary symptom score and in reducing the rate of intermittent self-catheterization for patients with prostate adenocarcinoma after prostate implant.</detailed_description>
