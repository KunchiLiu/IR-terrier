	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: A computer-based survey and communication aid may help physicians and patients to communicate better and help make treatment decisions easier. PURPOSE: This phase III randomized clinical trial is studying how well giving a computer-based survey together with a communication aid works compared to a computer-based survey alone in improving physician-patient communication and treatment decision making in patients with metastatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computer-Based Survey and Communication Aid in Improving Physician-Patient Communication and Treatment Decision Making in Patients With Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare satisfaction with physician-patient communication and decisional conflict in patients with metastatic cancer undergoing a computer-based survey with vs without a communication aid. - Compare patient expectations regarding potential benefits and adverse reactions associated with treatment options in patients undergoing the computer-based survey and communication aid. - Compare the content of physician-patient consultations in patients undergoing the computer-based survey and communication aid. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 study arms. - Arm I (generic computer-based survey): Patients complete a 45- to 60-minute generic computer-based survey that assesses demographics, familiarity and comfort with computers, treatment history, and affective elements. - Arm II (targeted computer-based survey and communication aid with physician summary report): Patients complete a 45- to 60-minute targeted computer-based survey assessing patient values, information needs, and distress. Patients then complete a targeted computer-based communication aid that addresses cognitive and affective components of cancer treatment education and provides communication skills training. After completion of the survey and communication aid, a summary report of the survey results is generated and provided to the patient's physician. - Arm III (targeted computer-based survey and communication aid): Patients complete a targeted computer-based survey and communication aid as in arm II. No summary report is provided to the physician. After completion of a computer-based survey and communication aid, all patients undergo a consultation with their physician. A randomized subset of 25% of physician consultations* are audiotaped and later analyzed. Patients complete a 15-minute written survey after completion of the physician consultation and then at 3 months. NOTE: *Patients are stratified according to study arm (I vs II vs III) and consulting physician gender for this randomization. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 720 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
