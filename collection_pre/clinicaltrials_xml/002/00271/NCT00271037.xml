	<brief_summary>Pelvic organ prolapse occurs when the pelvic organs (e.g., the uterus or bladder) fall or slide down into the vagina. Pelvic organ prolapse can be corrected with surgery. Some types of surgery try to restore the normal anatomy and function of the vagina (i.e., reconstructive surgery). Other surgery repairs the prolapse by essentially closing the vagina (e.g., colpocleisis or colpectomy), thereby leaving a woman unable to have vaginal intercourse in the future. The use of colpocleisis has not been well-studied. The current literature is lacking sufficient studies of colpocleisis to fully understand its risks and benefits for women considering surgery for prolapse. Traditionally, colpocleisis has been restricted to elderly women thought to be poor medical risks for prolonged reconstructive surgery. This study will describe the postoperative course of women who undergo colpocleisis, with particular attention to the persistence or recurrence of urinary incontinence and patient satisfaction after the colpocleisis prolapse surgery.</brief_summary>

Traditionally, colpocleisis has been restricted to elderly women thought to be poor medical risks for prolonged reconstructive surgery. This study will describe the postoperative course of women who undergo colpocleisis, with particular attention to the persistence or recurrence of urinary incontinence and patient satisfaction after the colpocleisis prolapse surgery. Women who agree to participate in the study will complete questionnaires before surgery, and at 3 months and 1 year after surgery. Questionnaires include the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI), which includes questions about pelvic symptoms and the level of bother the symptoms cause; the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ), which includes questions about the impact on life activities; and the SF-36, which measures health-related quality of life. Comparisons: Symptoms that may be related to prolapse, such as urinary incontinence, will be compared in women before and after surgery to see if the surgery provides improvement in those symptoms. In addition, patient satisfaction and health-related quality of life will be studied by making comparisons before and after prolapse surgery repair.</detailed_description>
