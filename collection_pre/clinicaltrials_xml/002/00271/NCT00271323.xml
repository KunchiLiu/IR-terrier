	<criteria>1. Informed consent form obtained, signed and dated before specific protocol procedures. 2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma or a combination of these) 3. Patients must have a loco regionally advanced unresectable NSCLC; Stage IIIA with clinical multiple N2 nodes (preferably with histological or cytological confirmation). Patients with peripheral tumours of the lower lobe with contralateral upper mediastinal nodes at station N2 are excludedÂ· Stage IIIB T4 or N3. In the T4 category, patients with pleural or pericardial effusion and multiple nodules in the same lobe are excluded. Patients with T4 disease secondary to extensive and massive involvement of the great vessels are excluded.Patients should be excluded when the expected risk of pulmonary toxicity is likely to be high, e.g. V20 in excess of 35%. 4. Males or females aged between 18 and 75 years. 5. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. 6. WHO performance status 0 or 1. 7. Weight loss &lt;=10% within the last 3 months. 8. Laboratory requirements at entry (within 7 days before randomization): Blood cell counts: Absolute neutrophils &gt;= 2.0 x 10^9/L Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin &gt;= 10 g/dl Renal function: Serum creatinine &lt;=1 x the upper limit of normal (UNL). In case of borderline value of serum creatinine, the 24h creatinine clearance should be &gt;= 60 mL/min. Hepatic function: Serum bilirubin &lt;= 1 x UNL ASAT and ALAT &lt;= 2.5 x UNL Alkaline phosphatase &lt;= 5 x UNL Patients with ASAT and/or ALAT &gt; 1.5 x UNL associated with alkaline phosphatase&gt; 2.5 x UNL are not eligible for the study. 9. Lung function tests at entry: FEV1: &gt;= 50 % x Normal value DLCO: &gt;= 50 % x Normal value 10. Adequate cardiac function. 11. Patient with either measurable and/or nonmeasurable lesion (according to RECIST criteria). 1. Diagnosis of small cell lung cancer. 2. Pregnant or lactating women. 3. Patients (male or female) with reproductive potential not implementing adequate contraceptive measures. 4. Prior systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy including neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment for NSCLC. 5. Prior surgery for NSCLC, if less than 5 years from study. 6. Prior radiotherapy for NSCLC. 7. History of prior malignancies, except for cured nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated insitu carcinoma of the cervix or other cancer curatively treated and with no evidence of disease for at least five years. 8. Symptomatic peripheral neuropathy Grade &gt;= 2 except if due to trauma. 9. Other serious concomitant illness or medical conditions: Congestive heart failure or angina pectoris except if it is medically controlled. Previous history of myocardial infarction within 1 year from study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or arrhythmias. History of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders including dementia or seizures. Active infection requiring IV antibiotics. Active ulcer, unstable diabetes mellitus or other contraindication to corticosteroid therapy. Superior vena cava syndrome contraindicating hydration. Preexisting pericardial effusion. Preexisting symptomatic pleural effusion. 10. Significant gastrointestinal abnormalities, including requirement for intravenous nutrition, active peptic ulcer disease, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption. 11. Distant metastasis. 12. Concurrent treatment with any other experimental anticancer drugs. 13. Concomitant or within 4week period administration of any other experimental drug under investigation. 14. Significant ophthalmologic abnormalities. 15. Moderate to severe dermatitis. 16. Hypersensitivity to docetaxel, cisplatin, or any of its excipients. 17. Concomitant use of phenytoin, carbamazepin, barbiturates, or rifampicin. 18. Mental condition rendering the patient unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study. 19. Patient unlikely to comply with protocol, i.e., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for followup visits, and not likely to complete the study. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
