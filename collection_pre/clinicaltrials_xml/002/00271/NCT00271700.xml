	<brief_title>Improving Glycemic Control on GMS: A Quality Improvement Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will examine whether new processed and technologies for monitoring diabetic patients' insulin levels improves patient care. Patients at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), staying on the General Medicine Service, who have Type 2 diabetes and who are not on IV insulin can participate in this study. Physicians and nurses will be taught new rules to care for diabetic patients, while in the hospital. Also, the BWH computer system will be updated to include these new rules for administering insulin. Patients who participate in the study will be randomly placed into one of two groups: one group that will be cared for by physicians and nurses who have learned these new rules for administering insulin; or the second group, who will receive diabetes care at BWH before the new rules were adopted. The study will last approximately 1 year.</detailed_description>
