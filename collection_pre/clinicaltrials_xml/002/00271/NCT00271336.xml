	<brief_title>Pentoxifylline in the Treatment of NEC in Premature Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm neonates with a clinical suspicion of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) will potentially be candidates for study. After obtaining parental consent, the infants will be prospectively and randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1. Treatment group: to receive IV pentoxifylline (5 mg/kg/hour to run over 6 hour x 6 days) and 2. Placebo group: to receive an equal volume of Â½ normal saline to run over 6 hours x 6 days.</detailed_description>
