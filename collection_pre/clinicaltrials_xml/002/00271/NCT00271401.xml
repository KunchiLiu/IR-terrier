	<brief_title>A Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Intracoronary Stenting With or Without Abciximab, an Anti-Platelet Therapy, and Conventional Coronary Angioplasty With Abciximab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of intracoronary stenting with or without abciximab, an anti-platelet therapy, and conventional coronary angioplasty with abciximab in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: coronary angioplasty plus abciximab, intracoronary stent plus abciximab, or intracoronary stent plus placebo. The primary measures of effectiveness will be a 30-day composite, clinical outcome as determined by the number of deaths, myocardial infarctions, or urgent repeat revascularizations. Please see attached results. Patients will receive one of three different treatments: Coronary angioplasty plus abciximab; Intracoronary stent plus abciximab; or Intracoronary stent plus placebo.</detailed_description>
