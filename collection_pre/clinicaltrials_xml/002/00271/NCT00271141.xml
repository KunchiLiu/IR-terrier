	<brief_summary>The proposed work is based on the detection of a novel molecule for sensitivity to oxidative stress in humans in venous blood</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multifunctional Substrate for Early Detection of Oxidative Stress Susceptibility and Application to Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since alterations in mitochondrial functions in platelets and lymphocytes have been detected in Parkinson's disease we plan to monitor the metabolism a a new molecule (LTG) in the blood samples of Parkinson's disease patients and compare them to controls. We shall use 10 cc of venous blood and analyze serum, white blood cells and platelets. We shall not extract nor use DNA.The main purpose is to develop a marker for Parkinson's disease in venous blood.</detailed_description>
