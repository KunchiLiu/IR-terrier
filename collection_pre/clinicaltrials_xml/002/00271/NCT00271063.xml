	<brief_title>Study of Liposomal Annamycin in Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I/II, multi-center, open-label, dose escalation, MTD study of liposomal annamycin in refractory or relapsed ALL patients. Enrollment will occur in cohorts of approximately 3 patients with 10 additional patients enrolled at the MTD. The liposomal annamycin doses will be escalated in sequential cohorts. Four dose levels of liposomal annamycin are planned: 190, 230, 280, and 310 mg/m2/day.</detailed_description>
