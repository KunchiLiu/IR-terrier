	<brief_summary>Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EE) is a chronic, T-helper 2 cell (TH2) - type inflammatory disorder of the esophagus with a rapidly increasing prevalence. Studies analyzing the natural course of EE provide strong evidence, that the chronic inflammation leads to irreversible structural changes in the esophagus with a loss of the mucosal elasticity and a fibrosis of the sub-epithelial esophageal layers with a concomitant risk of impairment in function. Treatment strategies in chronic inflammations have, in general, two main goals: 1) Relief of symptoms and 2) Prevention of long-term damage of the affected organ. Until now, the treatment of EE is still controversial. Standard recommendations for therapy of this chronic eosinophilic inflammation include dilation, systemic or topical corticosteroids and leukotriene antagonists. Several of these reports demonstrate, that topical corticosteroids may be effective for symptom control as well as for down-regulating the local inflammation. Furthermore it has been demonstrated, that treatment with topical corticosteroids is as effective as oral prednisone. However, the majority of therapeutic recommendations are based on clinical observations, case reports or small case series. The purpose of this study is the evaluation of the efficacy and the safety of a monotherapy with a topical corticosteroid as short-term induction-treatment and as long-term, maintenance-treatment compared with placebo, in the treatment of adult patients with active EE.</brief_summary>
