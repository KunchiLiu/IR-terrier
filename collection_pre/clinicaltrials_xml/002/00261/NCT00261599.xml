	<brief_summary>Very often patients receive medication before a diagnostic procedure, like a colonoscopy, to help them relax and stay calm during the procedure. This is called procedural or minimal-to-moderate sedation. One product used for sedation is called propofol. AQUAVAN (fospropofol disodium) is made as a water soluble form of propofol allowing for rapid sedation during the entire procedure. This study is designed to test AQUAVAN for sedation during colonoscopy procedures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Effectiveness and Safety Study of AQUAVAN® Injection (Fospropofol Disodium) for Sedation During Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, dose-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a moderate dose of AQUAVAN compared to a subtherapeutic dose of AQUAVAN,both following pretreatment with an analgesic fentanyl, in patients who are undergoing elective colonoscopy. A group of patients will receive midazolam as a reference therapy. Following completion of pre-procedure assessments, patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups at a 2:3:1 (AQUAVAN initial dose 1 [subtherapeutic dose]:AQUAVAN initial dose 2 [moderate dose]: initial Midazolam Reference Dose) allocation ratio on the day of the scheduled procedure. A person skilled in airway management and authorized by the facility in which the colonoscopy is performed (such as a respiratory therapist, a study nurse, or a clinician) must be immediately available during the conduct of the study. All patients will be placed on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula (4 L/min), and an ECG monitor, pulse oximeter, and blood pressure monitor will be attached prior to administration of study medication. All patients will receive an injection of analgesic pretreatment followed by the administration of study medication. This protocol recognized 2 distinct phases of sedation: Sedation Initiation and Sedation Maintenance. Assessments will be made to evaluate the patients for levels of sedation, clinical benefit of sedation, and adverse events. Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis.</detailed_description>
