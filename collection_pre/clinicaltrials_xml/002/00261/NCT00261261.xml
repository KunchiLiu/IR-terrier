	<brief_summary>Children experience significant anxiety and distress during the preoperative period. Currently available interventions are ineffective and/or associated with significant disadvantages. These interventions exclusively target the child and do not attempt to reduce parental anxiety. Based on an integration of the literature in both the anesthesia and psychological milieus, we developed ADVANCE, a behaviorally oriented anxiety reduction program for children undergoing surgery that targets the family as a whole.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Children and their parents (n=408) were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) Control: received standard of care, 2) PPIA: received standard parental presence during induction of anesthesia, 3) ADVANCE: received family-centered behavioral preparation, and 4) oral Midazolam. We assessed the effect of group assignment on anxiety levels and postoperative outcomes.</detailed_description>
