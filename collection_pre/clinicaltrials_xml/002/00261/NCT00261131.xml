	<brief_title>Efficacy and Functional Outcomes of Botulinum Toxin A Injections to Hamstrings in Flexed Knee Gait in Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study proposes to: (1) to determine if injections of BTX-A to the hamstring muscles result in measurable physiologic (body structure and body function) changes not observed with normal saline injections, in children with spastic diplegic CP who walk with a flexed-knee gait pattern; (2) to assess whether physiologic changes translate into functional (activity and participation) improvements; (3) to evaluate family's perception of change in function, activity, participation, and quality of life. This study will demonstrate if BTX-A injected into overactive hamstring muscles of children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP) and a flexed-knee walking pattern has measurable effects across the spectrum of dimensions of disablement of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). It is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind trial comparing results of injection of BTX- A and placebo saline in controls, into overactive hamstring muscles, using multiple outcomes measures. Temporal-spatial gait parameters, instrumented 3DGA kinematics, passive ROM, spasticity measurement with both Ashworth and Tardieu scales, muscle strength/control, Gross Motor Function Measurement (GMFM), Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI), Gillette Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ), 6-Minute Walk Test, and Goal Attainment Scale (GAS), assessing all ICF domains, will be collected at baseline and at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-injection. Power analysis demonstrates the need to randomize 250 children (125 with BTX-A, 125 with saline), allowing for attrition. Nine participating hospitals will contribute patients.</detailed_description>
