	<brief_summary>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a medical condition affecting the stomach and esophagus. GERD occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter does not close properly and stomach contents leaks back (refluxes) into the esophagus. GERD is one of the most common medical disorders, with estimates of up to 50% of adults reporting reflux symptoms. Proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole, can relieve symptoms of GERD in a large proportion of patients. Of particular interest in GERD is the assessment of symptom severity and quality of life, and the response to treatment. Therefore, a questionnaire was developed to assess GERD symptoms (`ReQuest TradeMark in Practice`). An important point to consider when using such a questionnaire is to follow the patientsÂ´ medical response to treatment and note whether a patient needs to change dosing, such as changing from full dose to half dose, or vice versa. The aim of the study is to determine the value of the questionnaire (`ReQuest TradeMark in Practice`) according to treating physicians` clinical judgment when using pantoprazole at full and half dose. The study duration consists of a pre-treatment periods (0-2 weeks) and two treatment period (8 weeks each). During the first treatment period, pantoprazole will be administered once daily at full dose (40 mg). During the second treatment period, pantoprazole will be administered once daily at half dose (20 mg). The study will provide further data on safety and tolerability of pantoprazole.</brief_summary>
