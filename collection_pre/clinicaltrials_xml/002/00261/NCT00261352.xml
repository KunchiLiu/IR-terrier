	<brief_summary>This is a 24-week study to determine the lipid metabolic effects, safety, and tolerability of tesaglitazar compared with metformin and metformin in combination with fenofibrate in patients with type 2 diabetes and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Improvement in dyslipidemia will be evaluated. The study comprises a 2-week enrollment period, 6-week run-in and a 24-week randomized, double blind, parallel group, multi-center, active controlled (metformin with or without fenofibrate) treatment period and a 3-week follow-up. From visit 2 (run-in), all patients will receive a standardized dose of statin (rosuvastatin)</brief_summary>
