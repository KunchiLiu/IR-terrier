	<brief_summary>3 patients were enrolled in each of 3 study cohorts. There three cohorts were given differing, incrementally larger doses of this phase I drug. The same safety measures are being obtained on all patients. Efficacy measures were individualized as enrolllees do not have the same underlying vascular anomaly. The study is structured to include a 24 month drug-phase and a 24 month follow-up phase. The study is now closed to enrollment.</brief_summary>
