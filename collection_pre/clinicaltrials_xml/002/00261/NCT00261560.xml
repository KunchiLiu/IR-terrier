	<brief_title>A Safety and Effectiveness Study of Acetaminophen Extended Release (3900 mg/Day) and Ibuprofen (1200 mg/Day) in the Treatment of Pain Associated With Ankle Sprains.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of 1300 mg acetaminophen extended release given three times daily for nine days to that of 400 mg ibuprofen given three times daily for nine days for the signs and symptoms of Grade I and Grade II lateral ankle sprains. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline (Day 1) to Day 4 in the subjects' pain upon walking. Safety assessments consist of the monitoring of adverse events and assessments of the ankle injury during the course of the study. Two hypotheses are examined using a step down approach. The first hypothesis is that acetaminophen extended release is not inferior to ibuprofen in relieving the pain associated with (Grade I or Grade II) lateral ankle sprains. If acetaminophen extended release is not inferior to ibuprofen in relieving the pain associated with Grade I or Grade II lateral ankle sprains, the second hypothesis is that acetaminophen extended release is superior to ibuprofen in relieving the pain associated with Grade I or Grade II lateral ankle sprains. Two acetaminophen 650 mg extended release caplets, taken by mouth, three times a day for nine days or two ibuprofen 200 mg caplets, taken by mouth, three times a day for nine days</detailed_description>
