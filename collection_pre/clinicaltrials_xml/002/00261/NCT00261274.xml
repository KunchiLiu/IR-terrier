	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that small amounts of a person's own red cells, when treated with an enzyme to make A-ECO Red Blood Cells, can be safely re-infused, repeatedly. Each participant will have some blood drawn, treated with an enzyme, washed and re-infused five times. Additional samples of blood will be drawn for testing and evaluation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of ECO Conversion System For Red Blood Cells.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will involve a statistically valid number of subjects so that firm conclusions may be drawn about the safety of small volumes of A-ECO cells. All participants will receive their own (autologous) red cells that have been either: 1) treated with an enzyme to create A-ECO cells (test group); or 2) washed with saline (control group). The test and control groups will be compared for the rate and extent any adverse reactions or unexpected laboratory test results.</detailed_description>
