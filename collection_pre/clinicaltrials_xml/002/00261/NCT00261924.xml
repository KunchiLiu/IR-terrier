	<brief_summary>Objective: To determine if platelets treated for pathogen inactivation and stored for 6 to 7 days are safe and effective compared to platelets collected by the same method, stored for the same amount of time and not treated for pathogen inactivation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Platelets Treated for Pathogen Inactivation and Stored for Up to Seven Days</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although the European Commission directive 2004/33/EC states that platelet preparations may be stored for 7 days in conjunction with detection or reduction of bacterial contamination, most blood centers store platelets for only 4 or 5 days. Extending the storage time could greatly improve platelet availability for patients while decreasing wastage of this limited resource.</detailed_description>
