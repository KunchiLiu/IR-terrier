	<brief_summary>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) remains difficult to treat by standard treatment approaches. Novel drugs have shown promising results in early clinical evaluations. In the current trial, we investigate a combination of bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor), rituximab (a monoclonal antibody), and dexamethasone in patients with MCL, who have already been pretreated by standard chemotherapy and show again signs of disease progression. The study objectives include remission rates, safety of this drug combination, and survival time.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Description of the treatment regimen: Bortezomib: 1.3 mg/m2 as i.v. bolus injection, given on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each treatment cycle; Rituximab: 375 mg/m2 infusion, day 1 of each cycle; Dexamethasone: 40 mg per day orally (days 1 â€“ 4) of each treatment cycle.
