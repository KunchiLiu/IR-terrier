	<brief_summary>Evaluate renal graft function (based on the calculated Glomerular Filtration Rate) at 12 months after transplantation in patients receiving either a regimen of sirolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil following an antibody induction (RATG) or a standard regimen combining tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil, both regimens including corticosteroids in patients undergoing renal allograft transplantation. In addition, the two treatment groups will be compared with respect to the incidence of acute rejection at 3, 6 and 12 months following transplantation, and the patient and graft survival at 6 and 12 months after transplantation. The safety of sirolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil following an antibody induction (ATG) will be evaluated beginning in the immediate post-operative period.</brief_summary>
