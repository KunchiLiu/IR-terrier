	<brief_title>A Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Long-term Correction of Anemia With Epoetin Alfa in Early Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease is very common among patients with end-stage renal disease. This study is a long-term, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study to determine the efficacy and safety of administering epoetin alfa to treat anemia (patients in Group 1) or partially treat anemia (patients in Group 2) in order to reduce the risk of heart failure in chronic renal failure patients on early dialysis and to improve their quality of life. Efficacy of epoetin alfa will be determined by comparing between Group 1 and Group 2 the heart structure (changes in left ventricle volume and mass viewed on echocardiograms), development of heart failure, correlation between changes in heart structure and hemoglobin level, a 6-minute walking test, and by 2 quality of life measures-a quality of life questionnaire and a fatigue questionnaire. Safety data associated with elevation of hemoglobin will be collected and monitored throughout the study: hemoglobin-related adverse events include thrombovascular events, seizures, and hypertension. Development of antibodies to erythropoetin over long-term treatment also will be assessed by serum samples gathered over the course of the study. The hypothesis of this study is that earlier and longer-term anemia intervention in patients without symptomatic heart disease or heart architecture distortions may conserve heart function and improve their quality of life, and that the intervention will be well tolerated by the patients. Patients not on epoetin alfa at start: epoetin alfa (50 IU/kg), 3 times per week with increases every 4 weeks at either 25 IU/kg or up to 25% of previous dose to reach target hemoglobin (Hb), then dose maintained. Patients on or switched to epoetin alfa at start are titrated to maintain target Hb.</detailed_description>
