	<criteria>Anatomic (stentgraft) Aortic Aneurysm Diameter &gt; 4.5 cm Those aortic aneurysms &lt; 4.5 cm that are at least 1.5 times the diameter of the aorta with a size increase of 5 mm or greater over a six month period will also be included for possible treatment. Aortoiliac aneurysms in which the aortic aneurysm is &lt; 4.5 cm but the iliac artery aneurysms are &gt; 3.0 cm in diameter or there is evidence of recent expansion (5 mm or greater over a six month period) in iliac aneurysms &lt; 3.0 cm. Saccular aortic aneurysms &gt; 3.0 cm. Aortic Neck Diameter &gt; 17 mm and &lt; 28 mm (Phase I) Diameter &gt; 14 mm and &lt; 28 mm (Phase II) Angulation Neck Length &lt; 45° &gt; 15 mm &lt;60° &gt; 25 mm Iliac Arteries Diameter &gt; 8 mm and &lt; 18 mm (Phase I and Phase II) At least one common iliac artery with a cuff &gt; 15 mm. Diameter Aortic Neck Common Iliac 2628 mm 13–18 mm 2325.9 mm 1017 mm 2022.9 mm 9–15 mm 1719.9 mm 813 mm 1416.9 mm 811mm *NOTE: An aortic diameter cannot be treated if the iliac diameter is not in the same range (e.g. 2628 mm aortic necks must be in conjunction with 1318 mm common iliacs). Anatomic (surgical controls) · Surgical controls will be required to meet only the aortic or aortoiliac aneurysm size requirements for anatomic inclusion criteria. Aortic Aneurysm Diameter &gt; 4.5 cm Those aortic aneurysms &lt;4.5 cm that are at least 1.5 times the diameter of the aorta with a size increase of 5 mm or greater over a six month period will also be included for possible treatment. Aortoiliac aneurysm in which the aortic aneurysm is &lt;4.5 cm but the iliac artery aneurysm are &gt;3.0 cm in diameter or there is evidence of recent expansion (5 mm or greater over a six month period) in iliac aneurysms &lt;3.0 cm. Saccular aortic aneurysms &gt; 3.0 cm. Clinical (stentgraft) Males and nonpregnant females &gt; 40 years of age. Clinical (surgical controls) Surgical control patients will be required to meet all of the abovestated stentgraft clinical inclusion criteria. Anatomic (stentgraft) Aortic Aneurysm Diameter · &lt; 4.5 cm that are not at least 1.5 times the diameter of the aorta with evidence of a size increase of 5 mm or greater within a six month period. Aortoiliac Aneurysms &lt; 3.0 cm in diameter unless evidence of recent expansion (5 mm or greater within a six month period). The iliac portion of the aneurysm extending to the bifurcation bilaterally which would necessitate covering both internal iliac arteries with the device. Aortic Neck Diameter &lt; 17 mm and &gt; 28 mm (Phase I) Diameter &lt; 14 and &gt;28 (Phase II) Thrombus lined Highly calcified NOTE: See inclusion criteria for length below the renals and degree of angulation. Iliac Arteries &lt; 8 mm and &gt; 18 mm (native) (Phase I and Phase II) Highly calcified (common) Neither common iliac artery with a cuff &gt; 15 mm. NOTE: See inclusion criteria for aortic neck and iliac artery diameters. Anatomic (surgical controls) · Surgical controls will be excluded based only on the aortic or aortoiliac aneurysm size requirements for anatomic exclusion criteria. Aortic Aneurysm Diameter · &lt; 4.5 cm that are not at least 1.5 times the diameter of the aorta with evidence of a size increase of 5 mm or greater within a six month period. AortoIliac Aneurysms &lt; 3.0 cm in diameter unless evidence of recent expansion (5 mm or greater within a six month period). The iliac portion of the aneurysm extending to the bifurcation bilaterally which would necessitate surgically covering both internal iliac arteries. Clinical (stentgraft) 1. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. 2. Renal insufficiency – creatinine level &gt; 2.5 mg/dl.</criteria>
