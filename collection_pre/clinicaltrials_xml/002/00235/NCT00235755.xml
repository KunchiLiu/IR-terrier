	<brief_title>Retigabine Efficacy and Safety Trial for Partial Onset Refractory Seizures in Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 study is being conducted in Europe, Israel, Australia, and South Africa to evaluate the efficacy and safety of retigabine dosed at 900 mg/day and 600 mg/day, in three equally divided doses, compared with placebo in patients with epilepsy who are receiving up to three established antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The primary objective is to demonstrate a superior change in total partial seizure frequency for four weeks from baseline to the double-blind period. The proportion of responders (greater than or equal to 50% reduction in seizure frequency for four weeks from baseline to the double-blind period) will also be evaluated.</detailed_description>
