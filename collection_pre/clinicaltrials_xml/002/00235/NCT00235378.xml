	<brief_title>Genetic Study of Lupus Patients and Their Families</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Little is known about the genetic factors that predispose people to developing SLE. Genes in patients with SLE may provide clues about SLE's pathogenesis. This study will compare genes from SLE patients, their unaffected family members, and control participants. Travel to the study site is not required. In this study, blood samples will be collected from people diagnosed with SLE, their unaffected family members, and condition-matched controls. Participants will be asked questions about their health and will provide a small blood sample. Participants will also be asked to provide written permission for release of medical information, so that their disease status can be verified through medical record review or through consultation with their doctors. Study personnel may contact participants in the future for follow-up questions and additional blood draws, if the participant agrees.</detailed_description>
