	<brief_summary>The goal of the trial is to determine whether human albumin, administered within 5 hours of symptom onset, improves the 3-month outcome of subjects with acute ischemic stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Albumin in Acute Ischemic Stroke Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human serum albumin, at 2 g/kg, administered over 2 hours by intravenous infusion, will be compared to placebo (isovolumic normal saline) among patients with acute ischemic stroke. All patients will have a baseline stroke severity measured as NIH Stroke scale score &gt; 5. Patients will treated according to the best standard of care including concurrent treatment with intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolysis where appropriate. The primary outcome will be determined at 3 months. The primary hypothesis is that, using the composite outcome of a modified Rankin score 0-1 or NIH stroke scale score 0-1 at 3 months (or both), the proportion of patients with improved outcomes will be greater by 10% or more in the active treatment group. [The current trial is termed "Part 2" and incorporates revisions to the initial protocol that were instituted after the DSMB suspended subject recruitment because of a safety concern after 434 subjects had been enrolled. The protocol revisions of Part 2 resulted from the study team's thorough review of the Part-1 safety data and were designed to optimize safety going forward.]</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Acute ischemic stroke NIH stroke scale score &gt; 5 Age &gt;= 18 and &lt;= 83 ALB or placebo can be administered within 5 hours of symptom onset ALB or placebo can be administered within 60 minutes of tPA administration in the thrombolysis group Signed informed consent Episode/exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) from any cause in the last 6 months. An episode of congestive heart failure is any heart failure that required a change in medication, diet or hospitalization. Known valvular heart disease with CHF in the last 6 months. Severe aortic stenosis or mitral stenosis. Cardiac surgery involving thoracotomy (e.g., coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement surgery) in the last 6 months. Acute myocardial infarction in the last 6 months. Signs or symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, including ECG findings, on admission. Baseline elevated serum troponin level on admission (&gt;0.1 mcg/L) Suspicion of aortic dissection on admission. Acute arrhythmia (including any tachycardia or bradycardia) with hemodynamic instability. Findings on physical examination of any of the following: (1) jugular venous distention (JVP &gt; 4 cm above the sternal angle); (2) 3rd heart sound; (3) resting tachycardia (heart rate &gt; 100/min) attributable to congestive heart failure; (4) abnormal hepatojugular reflux; (5) lower extremity pitting edema attributable to congestive heart failure; and/or (6) definite chest xray evidence of pulmonary edema. Current acute or chronic lung disease requiring supplemental chronic or intermittent oxygen therapy. Historical mRS ≥2. Patients who live in a nursing home or who are not fully independent for activities of daily living immediately prior to the stroke are not eligible for the trial. Inpatient stroke. I.e., patients with a stroke occurring as a complication of hospitalization for another condition, or as a complication of a procedure. Planned acute use of intraarterial (IA) tPA or acute endovascular intervention (e.g., stenting, angioplasty, thrombus retrieval device use) must conform to the following criteria: (1) begin within 5 hours of symptom onset, and (2) finish within 7 hours of symptomonset. Fever, defined as core body temperature &gt; 37.5oC (99.5oF). Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL or 180 µmol/L. Profound dehydration. Evidence of intracranial hemorrhage (intracerebral hematoma (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), epidural hemorrhage, acute or chronic subdural hematoma (SDH)) on the baseline CT or MRI scan. History of allergy to albumin. History of latex rubber allergy. Severe chronic anemia with Hgb &lt; 7.5 g/dL Pregnancy, breastfeeding or positive pregnancy test. (Women of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test prior to ALB administration.) Concurrent participation in any other therapeutic clinical trial. Evidence of any other major lifethreatening or serious medical condition that would prevent completion of 3month followup, impair the assessment of outcome, or in which ALB therapy would be contraindicated or might cause harm to the subject.</criteria>
