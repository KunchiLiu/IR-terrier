	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the standard rehabilitation offered by three hospital rehabilitation units in Norway, one in Trondheim, one in Ålesund and one in Levanger, compared to an interval treadmill training program. The subjects participating in the study are patients with myocardial infarction. The maximal oxygen consumption of the subjects will be tested before and after the training period.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the standard rehabilitation offered by three hospital rehabilitation units in Norway, one in Trondheim, one in Ålesund and one in Levanger, compared to an interval treadmill training program. The subjects participating in the study are patients with myocardial infarction. The maximal oxygen consumption of the subjects will be tested before and after the training period. Primary outcome: Maximal oxygen consumption Secondary outcomes: Blood values (for endothelial function, blood lipids, etc), flow mediated dilatation, quality of life (SF 36 and MacNew), weight, BMI, heart rate fall 1 minute after stopping the maximal treadmill test.</detailed_description>
