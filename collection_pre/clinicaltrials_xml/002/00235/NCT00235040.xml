	<brief_title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Acute Respiratory Infection Smart Form</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1: To design and implement an integrated documentation-based clinical decision support and physician feedback system, provided in an electronic health record (EHR), to improve the management of patients with acute medical conditions. Hypothesis 1: A documentation-based clinical decision support tool (CDSS) "smart form" physician feedback system, can be designed and implemented to facilitate documentation and physician order-entry, provide individualized, evidence-based recommendations for the management of patients acute respiratory infections (ARIs), and are usable by primary care physicians. Specific Aim 2: To determine the effectiveness of documentation-based CDSS and physician feedback on documentation and the clinical management of patients respiratory tract infections. Hypothesis 2A: A documentation-based CDSS "smart form" will increase the documentation of important clinical data in patients with ARI when compared to usual practice. Hypothesis 2B: A documentation-based CDSS "smart form" will increase adherence with guidelines for the management of patients with ARI when compared to usual practice.</detailed_description>
