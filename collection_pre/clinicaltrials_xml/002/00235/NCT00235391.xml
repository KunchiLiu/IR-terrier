	<criteria>Male or female patients greater than or equal to 2 years of age Documented congenital disorder of red blood cells (e.g., βthalassemia major, sickle cell anemia, diamondblackfan anemia) requiring ongoing blood transfusions Cannot be adequately treated with a locally approved iron chelator due to one of the following reasons: Documented noncompliance, defined as having taken less than 50% of the prescribed chelation therapy doses in the 12 months prior to study entry Contraindications, unacceptable toxicities and/or documented poor response to locally approved iron chelators despite proper compliance History of at least 20 blood transfusions (equivalent to 100 mL/kg of packed red blood cells (PRBC]) Serum ferritin value greater than or equal to 1000 µg/L Ability to comply with all studyrelated procedures, medications, and evaluations Ongoing treatment with another iron chelator (Any other iron chelation therapy must be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to study entry.) Patients who meet the eligibility criteria for any other ongoing Novartis sponsored clinical study protocol with deferasirox and who have geographic access to these sites Patients unable to tolerate (or who have unacceptable toxicities to) prior treatment with deferasirox Serum creatinine above the upper limit of normal at screening. Patients with ALT ≥ 500 U/L at screening. Evidence of chelationrelated cataracts or hearing loss within 4 weeks prior to baseline Pregnancy (as indicated by serum βHCG pregnancy test at screening for all female patients with the potential to become pregnant) and patients who are breastfeeding Patients treated with systemic investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to or with topical investigational drug within 7 days prior to the baseline visit Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
