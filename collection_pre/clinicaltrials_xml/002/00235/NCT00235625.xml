	<brief_summary>Turmeric (Curcuma Longa) is member of the ginger family and is best known for its culinary use as the major of component of curry powder. The volatile of oils (called curcuminoids) of the turmeric root, however, have anti-inflammatory actions which make them promising candidates for the treatment of psoriasis. For example, curcumin has been shown to improve psoriasis in experiments using in vitro models. Turmeric has been shown to have minimal side effects in doses up to 12 grams per day. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and to estimate the efficacy of oral Curcuminoid C3 Complex® in patients with chronic psoriasis vulgaris.</brief_summary>
