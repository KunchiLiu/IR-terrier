	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to compare the performance of the Cypher sirolimus-eluting and the Taxus paclitaxel-eluting stent systems in a prospective, multi-center, randomized clinical study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The REALITY Study - Head-to-Head Comparison Between Cypher and Taxus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized study conducted at 90 centers in Europe, Latin-America and Asia. A total of 1335 patients will be entered into the study and will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either the sirolimus-eluting or the paclitaxel-eluting stent system. All patients will have repeat angiography at eight months and will be followed for 24 months post-procedure.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald Classification B&amp;C, IIIIII) OR patients with documented silent ischemia; 2. Treatment of up to two de novo native coronary artery lesions in a maximum of two major coronary arteries; 3. Ostial lesions; 4. Bifurcations; 5. Target vessel diameter of both lesions must be &gt;=2.25mm and &lt;=3.0mm in diameter (visual estimate); 6. One target lesion must be at least 15 mm in length and the second lesion has to be at least 10 mm in length with no upper limit on either; 7. Target lesion stenosis for both lesions is &gt;50% and &lt;100% (visual estimate). 1. Patient has experienced a Qwave or nonQwave myocardial infarction with documented total CK &gt;2 times normal within the preceding 72 hours and the CK and CKMB enzymes remain above normal at the time of treatment; 2. Has unstable angina classified as Braunwald A IIIIII; 3. Any of the lesions is an unprotected left main coronary disease with &gt;=50% stenosis; 4. Angiographic evidence of thrombus within target lesion; 5. Heavily calcified lesion and/or calcified lesion, which cannot be successfully predilated (applies to both lesions); 6. Documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;=25%; 8. Totally occluded vessel (TIMI 0 level) (applies to both lesions); 9. Prior stent within 10mm of target lesion (applies to both lesions).</criteria>
