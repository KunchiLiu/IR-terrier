	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the sirolimus-coated Bx VELOCITY™ stent in maintaining minimum lumen diameter in de novo native coronary artery lesions as compared to the uncoated Bx VELOCITY balloon-expandable stent. Both stents are mounted on the Raptor® Rapid Exchange Stent Delivery System.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study of the BX VELOCITY Stent In Patients With De Novo Coronary Artery Lesions.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter (up to 35 centers), prospective, randomized double blind study. This study has a 2-arm design assessing the safety and effectiveness of the sirolimus-coated Bx VELOCITY stent to the uncoated Bx VELOCITY stent, both mounted on the Raptor Rapid Exchange Stent Delivery System. A total of 350 patients will be entered in the study and will be randomized on a 1:1 basis. Patients will be either randomized to the sirolimus coated or uncoated BX-VELOCITY stent. Patients will be followed at 30 days, 6, 9, and 12 months, and at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years post-procedure, with all patients undergoing repeat angiography at 8 months. Medical resource use during the 5 years follow-up period will be collected and analyzed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald Classification B&amp;C, III) OR patients with documented silent ischemia; 2. Treatment of a single de novo native coronary artery lesion in a major coronary artery in patients with single or multivessel disease; patients with multiple lesions can be included only if the other lesions do not require treatment; 3. Target vessel diameter at the lesion site is &gt;=2.50mm and &lt;=3.0mm in diameter (visual estimate); 4. Target lesion is &gt;=15mm and &lt;=32mm in length (visual estimate); 5. Target lesion stenosis is &gt;50% and &lt;100% (visual estimate); 1. Patient has experienced a Qwave or nonQwave myocardial infarction with documented total CK &gt;2 times normal within the preceding 24 hours and the CK and CKMB enzymes remains above normal at the time of treatment; 2. Has unstable angina classified as Braunwald III B or C and A IIIIII, or is having a peri infarction; 3. Unprotected left main coronary disease with &gt;=50% stenosis; 4. Significant (&gt;50%) stenoses proximal or distal to the target lesion that might require revascularization or impede runoff; 5. Have an ostial target lesion; 6. Angiographic evidence of thrombus within target lesion; 7. Heavily calcified lesion and/or calcified lesion which cannot be successfully predilated; 8. Documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;=25%;</criteria>
