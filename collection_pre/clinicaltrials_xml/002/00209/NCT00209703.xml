	<brief_title>Feasibility Study of mFOLFOX6 in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicenter Open-label, single-arm feasibility study is conducted on patients with histological stage IV colorectal cancer given oxaliplatin, leucovorin plus fluorouracil. The usefulness of this regimens as therapy for colorectal cancer was evaluated by the disease-free survival rate (DFR), overall survival rate (OS), incidence and severity of adverse event.</detailed_description>
