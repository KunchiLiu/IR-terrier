	<brief_title>Randomized Phase II Trial Induction Therapy for Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to identify new chemotherapy treatment regimens with better response rates and to find out if the combination of docetaxel and capecitabine can shrink the size of breast tumors and preserve the breast. Induction chemotherapy offers the possibility of less surgery and determines tumor sensitivity in vivo. Previous trials have demonstrated that complete pathologic response in the breast at surgery corresponds with improved outcome. Additionally, we will correlate specific molecular markers in the breast tumors before and after chemotherapy, with response to treatment. Expression of these molecular markets may be used in the future to predict the likelihood of response to chemotherapy given post-operatively.</detailed_description>
