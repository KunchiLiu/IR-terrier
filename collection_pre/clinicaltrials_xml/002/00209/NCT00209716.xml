	<brief_summary>A phase I/II study is conducted to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and efficacy of a combination chemotherapy using docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) in Pre-treated patients with metastatic esophageal cancer. The usefulness of the this regimen is evaluated by response rate, median survival time, and progression free survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study of Taxotere,CDDP and 5-FU(TPF) in Pre-treated Pts With Metastatic Esophageal Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with pre-treated measurable metastatic esophageal cancer were included in this trial. Patients received this combination chemotherapy repeated every 28 days until progression disease. Starting dose (dose level 1) were docetaxel 30 mg/m2 on day 1, fixed dose intravenously cisplatin (15 mg/m2/day) and continuous infusion 5-FU (800 mg/m2/day) on day 1-4. DLT was defined as follows (according to NCI-CTC version 2.0); Grade 4 neutropenia lasting for more than 4days, Grade 4 anemia and thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 neutropenia accompanied fever (&gt;38℃) , and Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity (except for nausea, appetite loss , general fatigue). Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined when the incidence of critical toxicity exceeds 50% at a certain dose level. Response rate will be calculated according to RECIST criteria.</detailed_description>
