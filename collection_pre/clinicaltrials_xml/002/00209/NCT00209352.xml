	<brief_title>Long-Term Oral Acyclovir Usage to Prevent Herpes Zoster Virus Infection After Bone Marrow Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Herpes zoster infection occurs in 30% of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients who had a history of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. A safe and effective prevention strategy has not been established. 77 marrow allograft recipients at risk for VZV reactivation were randomized to oral acyclovir 800 mg twice daily or placebo given from day 30 until day 365 and were followed for toxicity and clinical evidence of herpes zoster infection.</detailed_description>
