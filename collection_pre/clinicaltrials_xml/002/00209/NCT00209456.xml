	<criteria>Subjects must be adults between 55 to 90 years of age with an established diagnosis for dementia in accordance with DSMIV criteria and have to fulfil at least one of the following: The ICC criteria for probable and possible DLB, the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDSADRDA) for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), or the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Association Internationale Pour la Recherche et l’Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINCSAIREN) for Vascular Dementia (VaD). Subjects are not eligible if they have a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of &lt;10 and use medication known or suspected to interact with the striatal uptake DaTSCAN to the dopamine transporter. Furthermore subjects are not eligible if they were diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease (PD), with persistent severe depression, normal pressure hydrocephalus, multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration or Huntington’s Chorea Disease.</criteria>
