	<brief_summary>A phase I/II study is conducted to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and efficacy of a combination chemotherapy using CPT-11 and Paclitaxel in pre-treated patients with metastatic gastric cancer. The usefulness of the this regimen is evaluated by response rate, median survival time, and progression free survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study of Paclitaxel Plus CPT-11 in Pts. With 2nd Line Chemotherapy of Inoperable or Recurrent GC.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with pre-treated measurable metastatic gastric cancer were included in this trial. Patients received this combination chemotherapy repeated every 28 days until progression disease. Starting dose (dose level 1) were CPT-11 80 mg/m2 on day 1 and 15, Paclitaxel 60 mg/m2 on day 1 and 15. DLT was defined as follows (according to NCI-CTC version 2.0); Grade 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia(≥25000), Grade 3 neutropenia accompanied fever (&gt;38℃) , and Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity (except for nausea, vomit, appetite loss , general fatigue, alopecia). Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined when the incidence of critical toxicity exceeds 50% at a certain dose level. Response rate will be calculated according to RECIST criteria.</detailed_description>
