	<brief_title>IPTi in Mozambican Infants for Malaria Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of the antimalarial drug sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine administered intermittently at 3, 4 and 9 months of age through the EPI scheme at the time of routine immunisations. Children will be randomized into placebo and SP treatment groups by block randomization, and it is expected a similar age distribution and a similar number of children in each group. Doses of sulphadoxine (25 mg/kg)-pyrimethamine (1.25 mg/kg) (SP) or placebo will be given by a health assistant according to bodyweight (a quarter of a tablet for those &lt;5kg, a half for those 5-10 kg, and a whole tablet for children &gt;10 kg). The tablets will be crashed and diluted with water for their administration.</detailed_description>
