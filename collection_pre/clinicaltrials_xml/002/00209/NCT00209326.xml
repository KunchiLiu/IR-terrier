	<brief_title>A Proof of Concept Study Assessing the Effect of Four Different Single Bolus Intravenous Doses of FE200440 and Placebo on Stopping Preterm Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- To determine the effects of four different single bolus doses of FE200440 administered intravenously on stopping preterm labour compared to placebo in pregnant women with advanced gestational age - To establish the effects of four different single bolus doses of FE200440 administered intravenously on uterine contractions compared to placebo - To evaluate the effects of four different single bolus doses of FE200440 administered intravenously on labour progression compared to placebo - To establish the dose-response curve of single bolus doses of FE200440 administered intravenously in terms of time to delivery, uterine contractions and labour progression - To determine the duration of action of four different single bolus doses of FE200440 administered intravenously in terms of time to delivery, uterine contractions and labour progression - To establish the pharmacokinetic parameters of FE200440 after single bolus intravenous administration - To determine the relation between plasma concentrations of FE200440 and uterine contractions and labour progression - To compare the maternal, fetal and infant safety profile after intravenous administration of four different single bolus doses of FE200440 and placebo - To evaluate the impact of four different single bolus doses of FE200440 administered intravenously on delivery outcome, postpartum events and lactation</detailed_description>
