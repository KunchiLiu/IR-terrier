	<brief_summary>Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is an examination similar to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) which uses a magnetic field and a contrast medium when needed to visualize blood flow in the arterial vessels throughout the body. Gadodiamide, a contrast medium, is already approved and is used to image blood vessels by directly injecting it into the vein, but this procedure has not been formally tested to image the aorto-iliac vessels using MR. The study is designed to determine the presence or absence of a relevant stenosis (ie greater than/equal to 50%) or occlusion in aorto-iliac arteries. Intra-arterial Digital Subtraction Angiography (IADSA) will be used as the standard of truth.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Study subjects must be adults with confirmed or suspected aortoiliac stenosis. The subject must have been referred for Digital Subtraction Angiography. The subject has a known hypersensitivity to either conventional Xray or gadolinium based MR contrast media including, but not restricted to, the investigational product. The subject is lactating. The subject is pregnant as defined by a serum or urine betaHCG pregnancy test obtained within 24 hours before administration of the investigational product. The subject received or is scheduled to receive MRI contrast medium within 24 hours prior to or less than 24 hours after administration of the investigational product. The subject received or is scheduled to receive Xray contrast medium within 24 hours prior to or less than 24 hours after administration of the investigational product. The subject received an investigational product other than OMNISCAN (gadodiamide) within 30 days prior to OMNISCAN administration or will receive an investigational product within the followup period proposed for this study. The subject presents any clinically active, serious, lifethreatening disease with a life expectancy of less than 6 months. The subject has a serum creatinine value of &gt;= 3.5 mg/dL (309.4 Âµmol/L). The subject has previously been included in this study. The subject has a contraindication for MRI according to accepted clinical guidelines. The subject has metal implants and/or stents in the aortoiliac region and/or hip replacement.</criteria>
