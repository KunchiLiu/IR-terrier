	<brief_summary>Image quality in coronary artery computed tomography is influenced by the heart rate variation during the examination. The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate the change in heart rate following injection of a contrast medium called Visipaqueâ„¢ (iodixanol). Image quality and diagnostic quality of the examination will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
