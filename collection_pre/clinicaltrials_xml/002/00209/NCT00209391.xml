	<brief_summary>Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is an examination similar to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) which uses a magnetic field and a contrast medium when needed to visualize blood flow in the arterial vessels throughout the body. Gadodiamide, a contrast medium, is already approved and is used to image blood vessels by directly injecting it into the vein, but this procedure has not been formally tested to image the renal artery vessels using MR. The study is designed to determine the presence or absence of a relevant stenosis (ie greater than/equal to 50%) or occlusion in renal arteries. Intra-arterial Digital Subtraction Angiography will be used as the standard of truth.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Study Subjects must be adults with confirmed or suspected Renal Artery stenosis. The subject must have been referred for Digital Subtraction Angiography. The subject has a known hypersensitivity to either conventional Xray or gadoliniumbased MR contrast media including, but not restricted to, the investigational product. The subject is lactating. The subject is pregnant as defined by a serum or urine βHCG pregnancy test obtained within 24 hours before investigational product administration. The subject has received or is scheduled to receive MRI contrast medium within 24 h prior to or less than 24 hours after the investigational product administration. The subject has received or is scheduled to receive Xray contrast medium within 7 days prior to or less than 24 hours after administration of investigational product. The subject has received an investigational product within 30 days prior to or will receive an investigational product less than 24 hours after investigational product administration. The subject has an active, serious, lifethreatening disease with a life expectancy of less than 6 months. The subject has had a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in the renal region performed within 4 weeks prior to investigational product administration. The subject has a stent in the renal arteries. The subject has had a kidney transplantation. The subject has a serum creatinine value of &gt;3.5 mg/dL (309.4 µmol/L). The subject has previously been included in this study. The subject has a contraindication for MRI according to accepted clinical guidelines.</criteria>
