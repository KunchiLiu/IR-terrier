	<brief_title>Phase I / II Study of Irinotecan (CPT-11) Combined With l-Leucovorin (l-LV) and 5-FU in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicenter Open-label, single-arm, phase I/II clinical trial is conducted on patients with histological stage IV colorectal cancer given irinotecan, leucovorin plus fluorouracil. The usefulness of this regimens as 1st line therapy for colorectal cancer was evaluated by the disease-free survival rate (DFR), median survival time (MST), incidence and severity of adverse event.</detailed_description>
