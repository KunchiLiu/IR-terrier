	<brief_summary>The goal of the study is to test the efficacy of brief physician advice in reducing the frequency of high risk drinking and alcohol-related harm in a population of university students seeking routine care at UBC Student Health Service. It is hypothesized that receiving the intervention will reduce the amount of alcohol consumed and the incidence of alcohol-related harm among the students in the intervention group, as compared to the control group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We estimate that roughly 3000 students will need to be screened to obtain sufficient eligible participants to randomize 150 students. High-risk drinkers will be identified by means of an embedded alcohol screening survey, which will be distributed through Student Health Services. Those deemed eligible through the screening survey and who have agreed to be contacted will be invited to attend a baseline interview, which will further define eligibility and assign interested students to the control or intervention group. Those randomized to the usual care control group will receive a self-help health booklet and will be contacted to complete a follow-up telephone interview at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Those randomized to the intervention group will receive the same booklet and will meet with a Student Health Service physician. There will be two face-to-face meetings with the physician and two follow up phone calls by the physician. The physicians use a scripted workbook, diary cards and other materials designed to reduce alcohol use and the frequency of high risk drinking. Those in the intervention group will also be contacted to complete a follow-up telephone interview at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Outcome data will also be sought, with participantsâ€™ permission, from campus organizations including Campus Housing, Security, the RCMP and the Registrar.</detailed_description>
