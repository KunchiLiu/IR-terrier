	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving external-beam radiation together with internal radiation works in treating patients with cervical cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the feasibility of magnetic resonance-guided, endocavitary, high-dose rate brachytherapy implants in patients with stage IB-IVB cervical cancer. - Provide more reliable dose-volume estimations based on three-dimensional imaging-based treatment planning in patients treated with this regimen. Secondary - Determine the toxic effects and treatment tolerance in patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate three-dimensional dose-volume histograms of organs at risk with treatment toxicity in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the disease status, time and patterns of relapse, and survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy 4-5 days a week for up to 7 weeks. Patients also undergo MRI-guided high-dose brachytherapy comprising one brachytherapy implant a week for 3-6 implants. Brachytherapy may be administered during or after external beam radiotherapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
