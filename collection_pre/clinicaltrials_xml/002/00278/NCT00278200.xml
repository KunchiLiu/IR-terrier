	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells may help the body build an effective immune response. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy in treating patients who are being considered for solid organ transplant who are at risk for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients Who Are Being Considered For a Solid Organ Transplant and Are at Risk For Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of photochemically-treated autologous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell vaccine in generating an EBV-specific T-cell and antibody response in EBV-negative patients or in boosting the response in EBV-positive patients who are being considered for a solid organ transplant and are at high risk for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. - Determine adverse events associated with this vaccine in these patients. - Determine the ability of the vaccine to protect from EBV primary infection in EBV-seronegative patients during the time course of the study. OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, pilot study. Patients are stratified according to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status (seropositive vs seronegative). Patients receive photochemically-treated autologous EBV-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell vaccine intradermally once in weeks 0 and 4. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
