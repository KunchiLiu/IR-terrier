	<brief_summary>A multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy of CHADD (Controlled Heat-Assisted Drug Delivery) applied over a 50 mcg/hr ZR-02-01 matrix transdermal fentanyl patch for the treatment of breakthrough pain in adult patients with moderate to severe non-malignant chronic pain. The open-label study arm will last up to 12 days. The double-blind arm will last up to 15 days. Eligible patients who complete the open-label arm will be allowed to enroll in the double-blind study arm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fentanyl Transdermal Patch With CHADD™ for Breakthrough Pain in Patients With Moderate to Severe Non-Malignant Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ZARS Pharma is developing a Matrix Transdermal Fentanyl/CHADD (Controlled Heat-Assisted Drug Delivery) Drug Delivery System to be used for the treatment of chronic and breakthrough pain. The Matrix Transdermal Fentanyl/CHADD Drug Delivery System has been designed to provide long-term delivery of fentanyl for the treatment of chronic pain as well as intermittent increases in fentanyl concentrations for the treatment of breakthrough pain. Breakthrough pain is defined as a transitory exacerbation of pain that occurs on a background of otherwise stable pain in a patient receiving chronic opioid therapy. Matrix Transdermal Fentanyl/CHADD Drug Delivery System has 2 components: a matrix transdermal fentanyl patch (the ZR-02-01 patch in doses of 25, 50, 75 and 100 mcg/hr) with corresponding thin film dressing (ie, overlay) and the CHADD (Controlled Heat-Assisted Drug Delivery). The matrix transdermal fentanyl patch provides a continuous delivery of fentanyl over 72 hours, in a manner similar to Duragesic®. During a breakthrough pain episode, a CHADD unit is placed over (adhered to) the matrix transdermal fentanyl patch. The CHADD is a thin patch-like chemical heating device that generates a controlled level of heat for approximately 15-20 minutes. The application of heat delivers increased amounts of fentanyl when applied over the ZR-02-01 matrix transdermal fentanyl patch.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient is 18 through 70 years of age. Patient has moderate to severe nonmalignant chronic pain. Patient is opioidtolerant, requires treatment with chronic opioids and is currently taking a dose of 50 mcg/hr transdermal fentanyl for the treatment of chronic pain. Patient must have been taking this dose for at least 2 weeks. Patient must be experiencing 1 to 4 episodes of target breakthrough pain (breakthrough pain that is related to the patient's chronic pain condition) a day while taking a dose of 50 mcg/hr transdermal fentanyl. Patient has active cancer. Patient has a history of substance abuse or has a substance abuse disorder. Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.</criteria>
