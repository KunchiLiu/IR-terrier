	<brief_summary>A significant proportion of advanced gastric cancer (AGC) occurs in individuals 65 years of age and older. In addition, patient delay in seeking care for symptoms results in diagnosis at a more advanced stage than that seen in younger individuals. However, clinical trials on gastric cancer rarely have been available to the elderly. Recently oral 5-FU pro-drugs, which have been reported to have clinically significant response rates and survival with mild or negligible toxicities, have been widely used for the patients with AGC. However, few studies have been conducted in elderly patients.</brief_summary>
