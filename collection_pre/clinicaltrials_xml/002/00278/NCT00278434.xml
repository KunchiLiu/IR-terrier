	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep tumors from forming, growing, or coming back. Zoledronate may prevent the growth of cervical cancer by blocking blood flow to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia cells. The use of zoledronate may keep cancer from forming. PURPOSE: This randomized is studying how well zoledronate works in treating patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 or 3.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zoledronate in Treating Patients With Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia 2/3 or 3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess clinical response, in terms of lesion size and histological grade, of zoledronate in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 or 3. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot study. Patients are stratified according to degree of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (CIN2/3 vs CIN3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive zoledronate IV over 20 minutes on day 1. - Arm II: Patients receive placebo IV over 20 minutes on day 1. In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses. In week 8, patients undergo surgical resection comprising loop excision or cone biopsy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at week 10 by telephone. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
