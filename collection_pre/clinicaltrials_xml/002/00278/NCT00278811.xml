	<brief_title>Emergency Linkage to Outpatient Psychiatric Services</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are subgroups of patients who only seek care in emergency settings. An effective strategy to link that group to ambulatory care involves extending contact with psychiatric emergency services beyond the initial hospital-based visit. The "window of opportunity" to promote successful treatment linkage is brief. This is a study of a novel treatment format that seeks to expand the concept of the emergency contact, the study patients method of entering the mental health system of care, and by doing this, enhance retention in prescribed outpatient care. The effects of the intervention on patient symptoms and mental health service use will be examined.</detailed_description>
