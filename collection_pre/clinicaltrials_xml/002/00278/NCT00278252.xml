	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well etoposide works in treating young patients with ependymoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etoposide in Treating Young Patients With Relapsed Ependymoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate in young patients with relapsing and/or refractory ependymoma treated with a rapid schedule of intravenous etoposide. Secondary - Determine the possibility of second surgery or additional radiotherapy in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients whose tumor becomes resectable after courses 3 or 6 undergo surgical resection. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for approximately 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 14 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
