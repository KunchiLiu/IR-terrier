	<brief_title>GTA-Glyceryltriacetate for Canavan Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Canavan Disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme named Aspartoacylase (ASPA). This disease is a devastating, progressive disease with no available treatment. As a result of the ASPA deficiency, there are high levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and low levels of L-aspartate and acetate. We hypothesize that one of the functions of ASPA is to provide sufficient levels of acetate for CNS myelinization. For this reason, we offer to supplement acetate levels by the oral administration of glyceryl triacetate (GTA). Such treatment must be offered to patients before the age of 18 months, prior to the termination of CNS myelinization. 1. Two patients, aged less than 15 months, will receive daily doses of oral GTA 2. The daily dose will be increased incrementally until the maintenance dose is reached. This will be done under close monitoring of the patients, including periodic blood gas sampling. 3. GTA has not been shown to cause any known toxicity, according to the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (Fiume, 2003).</detailed_description>
