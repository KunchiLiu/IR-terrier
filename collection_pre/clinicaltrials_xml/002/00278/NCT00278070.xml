	<brief_title>Metronomic Oral Vinorelbine in Patients With Metastatic Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to define the biologically optimal dose of vinorelbine when administered at a metronomic dosing schema. [Metronomic chemotherapy refers to the close, regular administration of minimally toxic doses of cytotoxic drugs, with minimal or no drug-free breaks, over prolonged periods]. Patients with recurrent or metastatic solid tumors are randomly assigned one of three different doses of oral vinorelbine (30 or 40 or 50 mg). Treatment is administered three times a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) continuously until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or to a maximum of 24 months.</detailed_description>

Hypertension that cannot be controlled with medications (&gt; 150/100 mmHg despite optimal medical therapy) Ongoing anticoagulation therapy Pregnancy or breastfeeding Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator, excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration; or which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the trial.</criteria>
