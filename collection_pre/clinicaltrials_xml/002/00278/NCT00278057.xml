	<brief_summary>We wanted to test the hypotheses that blood pressure level was lower, that the variability of blood pressure and blood glucose was reduced, and that quality of life was improved when glucose was added to the dialysis fluid.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>STUDY OF GLUCOSE IN DIALYSIS WATER WITH REGARD TO BLOOD PRESSURE AND QUALITY OF LIFE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of glucose added to the dialysis fluid on 1.blood pressure and variation in blood pressure, 2.blood glucose and variation in blood glucose, and 3.quality of life in patients treated with chronic maintenance hemodialysis in a randomized, placebo-controlled, unblinded cross-over study.</detailed_description>
