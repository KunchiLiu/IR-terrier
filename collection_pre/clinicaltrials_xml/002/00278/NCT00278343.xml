	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well cediranib maleate works in treating patients with persistent, recurrent, or refractory advanced ovarian epithelial, peritoneal cavity, or fallopian tube cancer. Cediranib maleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor and by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate in Treating Patients With Persistent, Recurrent, or Refractory Advanced Ovarian Epithelial, Peritoneal Cavity, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Objective tumor response rate (complete plus partial response plus stable disease &gt; 16 weeks as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria) in women with recurrent or refractory advanced ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Time to disease progression, median survival time, and duration of overall cancer antigen (CA)-125 response. OUTLINE: Patients receive cediranib maleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
