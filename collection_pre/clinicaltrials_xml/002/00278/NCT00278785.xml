	<brief_summary>The underlying hypothesis that providing brief interventions to individuals who engage in potentially harmful patterns of alcohol use will alter their drinking behavior and therefore avoid negative consequences. Specifically, this study aims to determine if brief interventions will: 1. Reduce the number of re-admissions and deaths due to injuries associated with alcohol consumption 2. Reduce the number of driving under the influence (DUI) arrests 3. Reduce harmful drinking behavior</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brief Intervention for Alcohol Use Among Injured Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcohol use is the most common underlying cause of injuries in the United States. There is a growing body of literature suggesting that brief interventions (BI), in the form of a short (10-60 minute) counseling session, may decrease alcohol consumption and its harmful consequences. In contrast to the abundant literature on the effectiveness of BI in the outpatient setting, only 3 randomized controlled trials have been performed an adults specifically in the setting of acute trauma, and have had inconclusive results. All three studies used highly trained persons to perform the BI, and all were greater than 30 minutes in duration, a situation that may not necessarily reflect the practicalities of routine medical care. This raises the question of whether the benefits seen in these studies reflect the expertise of a small number of individuals or whether the effects correlate with the amount of time spent with the patient. Highly trained personnel and time are valuable commodities in a busy trauma center and may not be feasible given the competing clinical demands. We propose to investigate whether BI are effective in a setting that is more likely to reflect "real world" of clinical medicine rather than an idealized setting, utilizing trauma nurse practitioners to perform brief (5-10 minute) interviews. We will identify all patients admitted with trauma who test positive on a blood alcohol test. These patients will be consented and randomized to either a brief intervention group, or a standard medical care group. All patients will receive an AUDIT questionnaire to identify patterns of drinking behavior and an alcohol information pamphlet. After discharge, patients will be telephoned at 1,6, and 12 months. The first 2 contacts will be to see how the patient is doing and to verify the contact information. The AUDIT questionnaire will be re-administered during the 12 month interview.</detailed_description>
