	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to demonstrate that SR57667B at the dose of 4 mg/day, in comparison to placebo, decreases the decline in cognitive performance and the global clinical decline over 1 year in patients with mild to moderate AD. Secondary objectives are to assess the effect of SR57667B on functional decline and its safety/tolerability in patients with mild to moderate AD, and to document plasma concentrations of SR57667 in patients with mild to moderate AD.</brief_summary>
