	<brief_summary>The collective effects of two-layer pancreas preservation, pretransplant islet culture, day -2 pretransplant immunosuppression, and induction immunosuppression with the FcR-nonbinding anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody hOKT3γ1 (Ala-Ala)to facilitate diabetes reversal after single-donor islet transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>hOKT3γ1 (Ala-Ala) Combined With Sirolimus and Delayed Tacrolimus in Type 1 Diabetic Islet Allograft Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, one-year follow-up study of type 1 diabetic islet allograft recipients who receive FcR non-binding OKT3 antibody hOKT3γ1 (Ala-Ala) plus sirolimus induction immunotherapy combined with sirolimus and delayed tacrolimus maintenance immunosuppression. Six subjects were transplanted. The premise behind the proposal is that hOKT3γ1(Ala-Ala) corrects the imbalance between autoreactive and regulatory T cells and consequently prevents autoimmune destruction of transplanted islets. To prevent allorejection, hOKT3γ1(Ala-Ala)was combined with sirolimus and delayed tacrolimus. Additionally, the safety and efficacy of the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen of sirolimus combined with tacrolimus was monitored.</detailed_description>
