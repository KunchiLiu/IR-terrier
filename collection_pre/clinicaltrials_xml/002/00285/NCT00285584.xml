	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study was to test the whether high-risk, HIV-seronegative persons with mild-to-moderate depression would be more likely to adopt protective behavior change when provided with pharmacotherapy for their depression than when treated with placebo. High-risk behaviors include using illegal drugs and participating in unprotected sexual intercourse. The specific pharmacotherapy used in this study was the anti-depressant, bupropion. The subject population consisted of HIV negative men who have sex with men (MSM) with mild-to-moderate depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bupropion For Reducing High-Risk Behaviors in Depressed Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression in men is often masked by high-risk behaviors such as alcohol and drug abuse. Common symptoms among depressed men include feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, irritability, and anger. MSM are among those at highest for HIV acquisition due to high-risk behaviors, including unprotected sexual intercourse and drug abuse. Bupropion is an antidepressant medication commonly used to treat depression. The purpose of this study thus was whether bupropion could help MSM with mild-to-moderate depression reduce their high-risk behaviors. Participants in this trial were randomly assigned to receive either bupropion or placebo for 6 months. Study visits lasting approximately 2 hours each occurred at Day 0, and at Months 4, 6, and 9; included in these visits were physical examination, testing for HIV and sexually transmitted disease (STD), depression screening, and an interview-administered questionnaire inquiring into sexual activity and drug use. Shorter study visits, lasting 15 - 30 minutes each occurred at Day 15, and Months 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7, and included depression screening and physical exam.</detailed_description>
