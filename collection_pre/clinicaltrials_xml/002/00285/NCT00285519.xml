	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether strict blood pressure (BP) control by doxazosin using home BP monitoring, especially targeting the morning BP level, can reduce hypertensive target organ damage.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Morning blood pressure may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertensive target organ damage. Increased sympathetic nerve activity is reported to be one of the mechanisms of morning hypertension; however, there are no available data that show whether strict home blood pressure control, especially in the morning period, can reduce target organ damage.We will evaluate whether strict morning blood pressure control by sympathetic nervous system blockade using an alfa-blocker, doxazosin, and with the addition of a beta-blocker if needed, can reduce hypertensive target organ damage.</detailed_description>
