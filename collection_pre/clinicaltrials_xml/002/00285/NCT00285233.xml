	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of islet allotransplantation for the reestablishment of stable glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes, using anti-thymocyte globulin induction immunosuppression with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and low dose tacrolimus maintenance immunosuppression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Delayed Mycophenolate Mofetil in Single-Donor Islet Allotransplantation in Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess the safety and efficacy of a new single-donor islet allotransplant protocol focusing on minimization of ischemic damage by the two-layer pancreas preservation technique, attenuation of posttransplant nonspecific inflammatory responses by etanercept and anti-thymocyte globulin, deletion/inactivation of autoreactive T cells by anti-thymocyte globulin and daclizumab induction immunotherapy, and potent yet non-diabetogenic maintenance immunosuppression with sirolimus and delayed mycophenolate mofetil instead of tacrolimus for the reestablishment of stable glycemic control in recipients with type 1 diabetes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Primary islet allotransplant 2. Type 1 diabetes mellitus, complicated by at least one of the following situations that persist despite intensive efforts in close cooperation with their diabetes care team: 1. Metabolic lability/instability; 2. Reduced awareness of hypoglycemia; 3. Persistently poor glucose control (as defined by HgbA1c&gt;10% at the end of six months of intensive management efforts with the diabetes care team); 4. Progressive secondary complications. 3. Age 18 and older 4. Able to give written informed consent 1. Known hypersensitivity to rabbit proteins. 2. Presence of history of panelreactive antiHLA antibodies (&gt;10%). 3. Insufficient cardiovascular reserve. 4. Creatinine clearance &lt;60 mL/min/m2. 5. Portal hypertension, abnormal liver enzyme tests, or history of significant liver disease. 6. History of malignancy within 5 years. 7. Active peptic ulcer disease. 8. Severe unremitting diarrhea or other gastrointestinal disorders potentially interfering with the ability to absorb oral medications. 9. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. 10. Active infections. 11. Serological evidence of infection with HIV, or HBsAg or HCVAb positive within the previous 12 months prior to transplantation. 12. Negative screen for EpsteinBarr Virus (EBV) by an EBNA method 13. Evidence of infiltrate, cavitation, or consolidation on chest xray during prestudy screening. 14. Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression that is unstable or uncontrolled on current medications. 15. Ongoing substance abuse; drug or alcohol. 16. Recent history of noncompliance. 17. Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere with the safe completion of the trial.</criteria>
