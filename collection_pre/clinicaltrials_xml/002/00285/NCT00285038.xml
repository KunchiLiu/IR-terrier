	<brief_title>Ultrasound (US)-Doppler for the Diagnosis of Asymptomatic Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in Gynecologic Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The association between malignancy and venous thromboembolism (VTE) is well known. It has been shown that there is a high prevalence of VTE in gynecological malignancies. Early detection of VTE can identify patients who may benefit from anticoagulant therapy and prevent morbidity and mortality. NO clear guidelines are available for anticoagulant prophylaxis in a selected group of ambulatory gynecological cancer patients. It has been shown, in other selected groups of patients that Ultrasound Doppler can be used in order to diagnose asymptomatic DVT (deep vein thrombosis).</detailed_description>
