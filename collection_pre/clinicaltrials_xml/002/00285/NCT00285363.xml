	<brief_summary>This descriptive study aims to allow children and adolescents who have cancer to self-evaluate their quality of life. It is hypothesized that treatment affects quality of life in the areas of physical and social functioning. It is further hypothesized that these effects dissipate within 6 months after treatment is completed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality of Life Among Children and Adolescents With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participants will include all children and adolescents (aged 7 to 21 years old) currently receiving care from the Hematology/Oncology Clinic at the CMHC, which will serve as the study site. These individuals will be identified by the health care professionals working in the clinic. Specific study criteria will include only those individuals who (1) can read or write in the English language (due to limited availability of translators); (2) appear to not possibly suffer psychological harm by participating (as determined by any health care professional working in the Clinic); and (3) do not have a health condition and/or medical need that supersedes study participation. The weekly list of appointments will be reviewed by the researchers who already work in the Clinic for appropriateness (JH, JB and KS). To prevent participation coercion, solicitation for participation will be provided through the Child Life Specialist (CLS). The CLS is known to each participant and will function as a data collector for this study.</detailed_description>
