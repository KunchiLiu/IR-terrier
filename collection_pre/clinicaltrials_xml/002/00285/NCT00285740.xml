	<brief_title>Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Treat Depression in an Epilepsy Clinic Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is frequent in PWE and often missed for unclear reasons. Busy neurology clinics and their overworked physicians often lack psychiatric backup that may make inquiring about psychological issues problematic. In the psychiatric community, awareness of the need for depression intervention in the primary care clinic has been recognized for many years and several treatment models exist. This study will attempt to use one such model, i.e. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) using a group format and tailoring its use for an epilepsy clinic population.</detailed_description>
