	<brief_summary>This study is being done to measure the functions of the stomach after eating a meal and to develop a new method that will simultaneously measure both gastric emptying and the relaxation of the stomach after a meal using nuclear medicine testing. This would make the testing more convenient for patients and will also offer better understanding of these two gastric functions.</brief_summary>
