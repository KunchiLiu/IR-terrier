	<brief_summary>This pilot study will assess the efficacy of several sequential pharmacological treatments for patients with Refractory Depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequential Tranylcypromine (TC), TC + Dextroamphetamine and TC + Triiodothyronine for Refractory Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study will recruit 40 patients with Major Depression and a history of at least two failed prior adequate somatic treatments. In addition to usual physical work-up, all patients will have extensive thyroid testing, and then will receive standard dose Tranylcypromine (i.e., max. 60 mg/d). Non-remitters will have dose increased to max. 120 mg/d if tolerated. Non-remitters to high dose Tranylcypromine will then have Dextroamphetamine added with frequent blood pressure monitoring to max. 40 mg/d. Non-remitters will have Triiodothyronine added to the Tranylcypromine.</detailed_description>
