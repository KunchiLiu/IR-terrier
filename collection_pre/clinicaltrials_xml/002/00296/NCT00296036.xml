	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and topical urea/lactic acid-based cream may prevent or lessen hand-foot syndrome caused by chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether giving pyridoxine with or without topical urea/lactic acid-based cream is more effective than topical urea/lactic acid-based cream alone or a placebo in preventing hand-foot syndrome. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying pyridoxine and topical urea/lactic acid-based cream to see how well they work compared with giving pyridoxine together with a placebo, giving topical urea/lactic acid-based cream together with a placebo, or giving two placebos in preventing hand-foot syndrome in patients who are receiving capecitabine for breast cancer or other cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pyridoxine and Topical Urea/Lactic Acid-Based Cream in Preventing Hand-Foot Syndrome in Patients Receiving Capecitabine for Breast Cancer or Other Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether the prophylactic use of a topical urea/lactic acid cream can decrease the incidence/severity of capecitabine-caused palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia in patients receiving capecitabine for breast and/or other cancer. - Evaluate the potential toxicity of this cream. - Determine whether the prophylactic use of vitamin B6 can decrease the incidence and/or severity of capecitabine-caused palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. - Evaluate the potential toxicity of vitamin B6. - Determine whether the prophylactic use of a topical urea/lactic acid cream in combination with vitamin B6 can decrease the incidence and/or severity of capecitabine caused palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are stratified according to age (&lt; 50 years old vs 50-60 years old vs &gt; 60 years old), sex, capecitabine dose level (2000 mg/day vs 2500 mg/day), cancer type (breast vs other), and mode of therapy (adjuvant [including neo-adjuvant] therapy vs metastatic disease). Patients are randomized to 1 of 6 treatment arms (treatment arms I-IV closed to accrual as of 10/24/007). - Arm I (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007): Patients receive topical urea/lactic acid-based cream applied to palms and soles twice daily and oral pyridoxine once daily on days 1-21. - Arm II (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007): Patients receive topical urea/lactic acid-based cream as in arm I (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007) and oral placebo once daily on days 1-21. - Arm III (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007): Patients receive placebo cream applied to palms and soles twice daily and pyridoxine as in arm I (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007). - Arm IV (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007):Patients receive placebo cream as in arm III and oral placebo as in arm II (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007). - Arm V: Patients receive topical urea/lactic acid-based cream applied to palms and soles twice daily on days 1-21. - Arm VI: Patients receive placebo cream applied to palms and soles twice daily on days 1-21. In all arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
