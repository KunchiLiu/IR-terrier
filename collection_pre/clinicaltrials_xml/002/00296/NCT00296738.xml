	<brief_summary>Myocardial scintigraphy with 123I-MIBG allows for visual and semi-quantitative assessment of sympathetic cardiac innervation using the hear to mediastinum ratio (HMR). Impaired cardiac MIBG clearance may occur in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). The purpose of present study was to develop and validate a quantitative index for the assessment of cardiac MIBG uptake kinetics using SPECT/CT for diagnosis of CHF</brief_summary>
