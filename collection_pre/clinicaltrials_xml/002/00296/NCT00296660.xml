	<brief_title>Acute HIV Infection Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have identified strategies for the large-scale identification of acute HIV infections. One system using such strategies has already been implemented in North Carolina, and this system will be used in this study run by the Center of HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology (CHAVI). This study will collect data on the mechanism of HIV transmission and the genetic, biologic, antigenic, and structural characteristics of the virus. The study will enroll HIV infected people with acute HIV infection and their sexual partners, people with established HIV infection, and HIV uninfected people. This study will last 96 weeks. Group 1 participants will be people with acute HIV infection. These participants will have 15 study visits; some visits will include a physical exam and medical history. Group 1 will also be asked to complete a sexual behavioral assessment at study entry and every 12 weeks thereafter. Group 2 participants will be people with established HIV infection. Group 3 participants will be HIV uninfected people. Groups 2 and 3 will have 10 study visits; some visits will include a physical exam and medical history. Groups 2 and 3 will also be asked to complete a sexual behavioral assessment at study entry, every 12 weeks until Week 72, and Week 96. Group 3 will undergo HIV testing at each visit and will receive pre- and post-test counseling. At each visit, participants will undergo HIV safe sex counseling and will update their locator information. Blood, genital secretion, and breast milk collection will also occur at each visit.</detailed_description>
