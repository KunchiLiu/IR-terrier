	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: A subject will be considered eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following criteria apply: Consent: A signed and dated written informed consent must be obtained from the subject or subject's legally acceptable representative prior to study participation. An informed consent must be signed prior to any change in the subject's medication regimen, including withholding medications prior to Visit 1. Gender: Male or female. Females are eligible to participate only if they are currently not pregnant and not lactating. Females of childbearing potential will be required to use a highly effective method for avoiding pregnancy (i.e., contraception with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year). Female subjects of childbearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy test at Visits 1, 2, 3, and 4. Any female who becomes pregnant during the study will be withdrawn. Female subjects should not be enrolled if they plan to become pregnant during the time of study participation. Age: 15 years and older. Asthma Diagnosis: A diagnosis of persistent asthma, for at least three months, as defined by the following American Thoracic Society definition: Asthma is a clinical syndrome characterized by increased responsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree to a variety of stimuli. The major symptoms of asthma are paroxysms of dyspnea, wheezing, and cough, which may vary from mild and almost undetectable to severe and unremitting (status asthmaticus). The primary physiological manifestation of this hyperresponsiveness is variable airway obstruction. This can take the form of spontaneous fluctuations in the severity of obstruction, substantial improvements in the severity of obstruction following bronchodilators or corticosteroids, or increased obstruction caused by drugs or other stimuli [American Thoracic Society, 1987a]. NOTE: Intermittent and seasonal asthma, as well as exerciseinduced bronchospasm alone, are excluded. Asthma Therapy: 3 months' prior and current use of one of the following asthma therapies, with no change in regimen during the month prior to Visit 1: Scheduled or asneeded inhaled or oral shortacting beta2agonist (SABA). Subjects must be able to replace their current shortacting beta2agonist with albuterol/salbutamol, to be used only on an asneeded basis for the duration of the study. Allowed noncorticosteroid controller therapy (e.g., anticholinergics and cromolyn). One of the following inhaled corticosteroids taken at the corresponding daily dose: criteria. Inhaled Corticosteroid (Total Daily Dose) Beclomethasone dipropionate (≤420mcg) Beclomethasone dipropionate HFA (≤240mcg) Budesonide (≤400mcg) Flunisolide (≤1000mcg) Fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol (≤220mcg) Fluticasone propionate inhalation powder (≤250mcg) Mometasone furoate (≤220mcg) Triamcinolone acetonide (≤1000mcg) Subjects taking ADVAIR 100/50mcg BID are eligible to replace ADVAIR with FLOVENT HFA 110mcg BID for 14 days prior to Visit 1. This change will be at the Investigator's clinical discretion, taking each individual's current and past asthma stability into account. The subject must be aware of the risks and benefits of switching their medication and acknowledge this by signing an informed consent prior to any change in the subject's medication regimen. Asthma Severity: An FEV1 between 65% 95% of predicted value at Visit 1 after withholding asthma medications as detailed in the protocol. At Visit 2, subjects must also be experiencing minimum asthma symptoms as defined in Section 5.2.3, "Randomization Criteria", and in Section 6.2 of the protocol. Predicted FEV1 will be based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) predicted normal values [Hankinson, 1999]. Rhinitis Diagnosis: A diagnosis of seasonal allergic rhinitis defined as follows: A clinical history (written or verbal confirmation) of allergic rhinitis with the seasonal onset and offset of nasal allergy symptoms during each of the previous 2 relevant allergy seasons (captured in source documents only). AND •A positive skin test reaction to a geographically relevant seasonal allergen, as determined by the skin prick method, within 24 months prior to or at Visit 1. For the purposes of this study, a positive skin test reaction is defined as a wheal diameter that is at least 3mm greater than diluent control using 1:20 W:V glycerinated solution. •At Visit 2, subjects must also be experiencing minimum rhinitis symptoms as defined in Section 5.2.3, "Randomization Criteria", and in Section 6.2 of the protocol. Geographical Location: Active residence within a geographical region where exposure to a relevant seasonal allergen is expected to be significant during the entire study period. Note: The principal investigator is responsible for tracking and recording pollen counts for geographically relevant seasonal allergens throughout the entire study. Alternatively, this information may be obtained from a reputable source from within the same geographical area. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply: Currently Diagnosed with LifeThreatening Asthma: An episode or episodes of asthma requiring intubation associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest, or hypoxic seizures. Asthma Instability: Hospitalization for asthma within 6 months of Visit 1. Concurrent Respiratory Disease: Current evidence of pneumonia, pneumothorax, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrotic disease, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or any other respiratory abnormalities other than asthma. Nasal Obstruction: Severe physical obstruction of the nose (e.g., deviated septum) that could affect the deposition of doubleblind intranasal study drug. Nasal History: History of nasal septal perforation or recent nasal septal surgery. Other Concurrent Conditions/Diseases: Any evidence of rhinitis medicamentosa, history of glaucoma and/or cataracts or ocular herpes simplex, or any clinically significant, uncontrolled condition or disease state that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through study participation or would confound the interpretation of the results if the condition/disease exacerbated during the study. The list of additional excluded conditions/diseases includes, but is not limited to: cardiac arrhythmias; congestive heart failure; coronary artery disease; poorly controlled diabetes, poorly controlled hypertension, poorly controlled peptic ulcer, hematologic, hepatic, or renal disease; immunologic compromise; current malignancy; current or quiescent tuberculosis, and Cushing's or Addison's disease. Drug Allergy: Any immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to any beta2agonist, sympathomimetic drug, leukotriene modifier, or any intranasal, inhaled, or systemic corticosteroid therapy, or sensitivity to aspirin or other NSAIDS. Subjects with severe milk protein allergies are also excluded from participation. Respiratory Tract Infections: Any sinus, middle ear, oropharyngeal, upper or lower respiratory tract infection that has not resolved at least 14 days immediately preceding Visit 1, or for which antibiotic therapy has not been completed at least 14 days prior to Visit 1. Concurrent Medications: Concurrent use of any of the following medications that may affect the course of asthma, rhinitis, or interact with sympathomimetic amines or montelukast. Betablockers tricyclic antidepressants monoamine oxidase inhibitors phenobarbital rifampin ritonavir ketoconazole Systemic Corticosteroids: Use of oral or parenteral systemic corticosteroids within 28 days of Visit 1, or requirement for more than two courses of parenteral systemic corticosteroids for asthma within 6 months of Visit 1. NOTE: Topical hydrocortisone cream or ointment (1% or less) is permitted during the study. Excluded Rhinitis Medications: The following rhinitis medications must be withheld during the corresponding "exclusion period" prior to Visit 1 and are not allowed any time during the study, unless dispensed as doubleblind study drug: Medication (Exclusion Period Prior to Visit 1) Intranasal and ocular corticosteroids (28 days) Leukotriene modifiers (e.g., Singulair, Accolate, Zyflo) (28 days) Intranasal and ocular cromolyn (14 days) Longacting antihistamines (e.g., loratadine, cetirizine) (10 days) Shortacting antihistamines (includes prescription and OTC) (72 hours) Oral and intranasal decongestants (72 hours) Intranasal anticholinergics (e.g., Atrovent) (24 hours) Excluded Asthma Medications: The following asthma medications must be withheld during the corresponding "exclusion period" prior to Visit 1. These asthma medications, with the exception of an inhaled corticosteroid/longacting beta2agonist combination product and Xolair, may be continued during the runin period of the study (between Visits 1 and 2), but must be withheld prior to Visit 2 for the appropriate "exclusion period" as shown below.
