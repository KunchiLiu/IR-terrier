	<brief_title>Therapeutic Study of ONO-4819CD for Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis is a relapsing disease of unknown cause characterized by bloody diarrhea. Therapy usually involves 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. However, steroid resistance and dependency can become problematic. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as azathioprine, are beneficial but may have serious side effects. Therefore, new therapeutic approach is needed. Prostaglandin E2 is one of the prostanoids, which is involved with innate immunity. PGE2 induces oral tolerance to specific antigen in the small intestine and downregulates the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages and neutrophils. Accordingly, PGE2 is considered to be the mediator of mucosal protection. Recently, it was elucidated that disruption of EP4 gene, which is one of PGE receptors, caused severe colitis in mice. Moreover, EP4-selective agonist (AE1-734) was also revealed to ameliorate severe dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice. We therefore examined the effects of 2 weeks intravenous EP4-selective agonist therapy for patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.</detailed_description>
