	<brief_title>Trial of Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stomach cancer is the most common cancer in Korea and one of the major health problems worldwide. The most effective treatment for gastric cancer is curative surgical resection of primary tumor. However, a substantial number of patients eventually die of recurrences after curative resection. A number of randomized trials investigating the role of adjuvant chemotherapy have been conducted. However, the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy is still controversial and varied between Western and Asian trials. Meta-analysis of Western trials didn't demonstrate the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection. Conversely, some Asian studies have demonstrated the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection. In a previous study, mitomycin plus tegafur prolonged the survival in resected gastric cancer compared to no treatment. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the intraperitoneal chemotherapy with early mitomycin administration and adding cisplatin to prolonged treatment with doxifluridine compared to mitomycin plus doxifluridine.</detailed_description>
