	<brief_summary>The particular aim of this study is the comparison of the diagnostic results of MRA images upon application of Vasovist (gadofosveset), a contrast agent not yet available on the market, with the MRA images upon application of a conventional extracellular contrast agent. A catheter angiography, which will be performed as a routine diagnostic procedure for vascular diseases, will serve as an evaluation standard.</brief_summary>
