	<brief_title>Omacor and Cardiovascular Risk Factors in HIV Patients on HAART Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Results from recent studies show increasing numbers of Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) incidents among patients on HAART treatment (Highly Active Antiviral Therapy). Three elements have received special attention: 1. the immunodeficient effects of the HIV infection itself may influence the progression of arteriosclerosis 2. the higher levels of risk behaviour in this group of patients (i.e. high prevalence of smokers in this group) 3. The HAART treatment itself increases plasma levels of cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, resulting in HIV related lipodystrophy. The cardioprotective effects of n-3 PUFAs are well established both through epidemiological studies and through small and large clinical trials. Clinical trials have shown positive effects of n-3 PUFA on plasma triglycerides, and statistically significant reductions in cardiovascular death and sudden cardiac death. Moreover n-3 PUFAs have been shown to have beneficial effects on endothelial function. Based on the above rationale it is expected that Omacor (Omega-3-acid ethyl ester 90) will have positive effects on risk factors related to Ischemic Heart Disease in HIV patients on HAART treatment. Approximately 50 patients will be randomized to Omacor 4 grams/day or placebo. Treatment period is 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
