	<brief_summary>Studies have shown that individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at greater risk for having a substance use disorder compared to people who do not have ADHD. Rates of cocaine abuse in adults with ADHD are significantly higher than they are in adults who do not have ADHD. Some clinicians suggest that adults with ADHD may abuse cocaine in order to self-medicate their ADHD symptoms. Atomoxetine is a drug that has been effective in treating ADHD. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of atomoxetine in reducing cocaine use in people with ADHD who abuse cocaine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atomoxetine for Treating Cocaine Abuse in Adults With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ADHD is a neurologic disorder that is thought to be caused by chemical imbalances of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. The disorder can cause inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Cocaine abuse rates in adults with ADHD are significantly higher than they are in adults who do not have the disorder. This may be reflective of an attempt by individuals with ADHD to self-treat symptoms. Atomoxetine is an FDA-approved drug that is used to increase the ability to pay attention and decrease impulsiveness and hyperactivity in children and adults with ADHD. The drug is in a class of medications called selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and works by increasing the levels of norepinephrine, a natural substance in the brain that affects a person's attention and impulsivity. It is possible that reducing ADHD symptoms in cocaine abusers with ADHD will help decrease their need for cocaine. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of atomoxetine in reducing cocaine use in people with ADHD who abuse cocaine. Participants in this open label study will receive atomoxetine for 12 weeks, and will take one dose each morning for the duration of the study. Doses will be increased gradually to minimize side effects and enhance treatment compliance. In addition, all participants will receive individualized relapse prevention therapy once weekly. Participants will be required to report to the study site three times a week to receive medication, complete questionnaires regarding ADHD symptoms and substance use behavior, and provide a urine sample while being supervised by study staff. Also, vital signs will be monitored and medication side effects will be assessed at each visit. Participants will report to the study site 6 months after starting in the study for a follow-up visit, at which time ADHD symptoms, substance use behavior, and social functioning will be assessed.</detailed_description>
