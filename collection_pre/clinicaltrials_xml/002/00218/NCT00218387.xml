	<brief_summary>Cocaine addiction is a serious health problem with no available medical treatment for preventing relapse. Modafinil, a medication that enhances mood, increases energy, and improves concentration, may be useful in preventing relapse among individuals with cocaine addiction. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of modafinil, in combination with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), to prevent drug relapse among cocaine addicts.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modafinil Combined With Cognitive Behavior Therapy to Treat Cocaine Addiction - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development of a medication to treat cocaine addiction specifically by lessening withdrawal symptoms has been a primary focus of research. Common cocaine withdrawal symptoms include depression, lack of energy, and poor concentration. Modafinil, a central nervous system stimulant, is a medication that can speed up physical and mental processes in the brain. It is currently used to treat narcolepsy, a condition that causes excessive sleepiness. Modafinil enhances mood, increases energy, and improves concentration in people with narcolepsy. Modafinil may also cause the same effects in individuals addicted to cocaine, thereby countering the symptoms of cocaine withdrawal. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of modafinil plus CBT versus placebo plus CBT for treating cocaine dependence. A 2-week screening period will be followed by an 8-week treatment phase. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 200 mg of modafinil, 400 mg of modafinil, or placebo on a daily basis for the 8 weeks of treatment. During this time, participants will be asked to report the number of days that they use and do not use cocaine. This will be confirmed three times a week with urine tests. Mood, level of daytime sleepiness, and symptoms of cocaine withdrawal and cocaine "high" will be evaluated. Compliance with study medication will be assessed with urine and blood tests. Medication side effects will be monitored through physical examinations, routine lab tests, ECGs, and self-reports. Follow-up evaluations will occur 4 and 8 weeks following the end of treatment.</detailed_description>
