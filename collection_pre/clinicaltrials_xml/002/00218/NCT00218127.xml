	<brief_title>Treatment of Opioid/Heroin Dependence: Comparison of Three Medication Dosing Regimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heroin is a highly addictive drug, and its abuse has both medical and social consequences. ORLAAM is approved to treat both opiate and narcotic dependence. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of ORLAAM in treating heroin dependent individuals. In addition, this study will determine the most effective dosing regimen of ORLAAM. This study will last 20 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of three dosing conditions: 1) standard fixed dose, 2) dose-by-weight, and 3) dose effect. The dose effect condition will include a dose of ORLAAM dependent on opiate use and withdrawal symptoms associated with opiate use; doses may be adjusted throughout the study. All participants will receive cognitive behavioral therapy throughout the study.</detailed_description>
