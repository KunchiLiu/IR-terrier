	<brief_title>A Network &amp; Dyad HIV Prevention Intervention for IDU's - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV seroincidence among injection drug users remains high, with unprotected sexual contact substantially contributing to new HIV infections among injection drug users (IDUs). Interventions that are culturally competent and target drug users' main sex and drug partners may be especially effective for HIV/STI and HCV control and prevention. The intervention to be tested in this study draws upon theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting that peer educator programs can have significant effects on the risk-related behaviors of both the educators and the peers whom they educate. Specifically, through group and individual focused sessions, participants learn and practice skills designed to reduce drug and sex related risk behaviors. Furthermore, individuals and their main risk partners attend a training session that focuses on risk reduction within their relationship.</detailed_description>
