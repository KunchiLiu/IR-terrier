	<brief_title>Pharmacotherapy Dosing Regimen in Cocaine and Opiate Dependent Individuals - 8</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examining two doses of modafinil (200 and 400 mg) and citalopram (20 and 40 mg) in the treatment of methadone maintained cocaine dependent individuals. Participants will first be given methadone to determine its tolerated and effective doses. Most participants will be able to reach a stable dose of methadone within 7 to 10 days of methadone initiation. When 80% of the projected dose of methadone has been achieved, participants will begin the medication regimen of modafinil or citalopram. Modafinil will be given over a 7-day period. Dosing of modafinil will begin at 200 mg and, depending on the individual, may increase to 400 mg. Citalopram will be given in increasing doses, starting at 20 mg and increasing to 40mg.</detailed_description>
