	<brief_summary>During the past 15 years, the demand for treatment for marijuana-related problems in the United States has increased nearly twofold. Selegiline is a medication currently used to treat nicotine dependence. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether selegiline may be useful in treating individuals with marijuana dependence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Selegiline in Treating Marijuana Dependent Individuals - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Behavioral therapy paired with drug therapy might be a more effective treatment approach to marijuana dependence than behavioral therapy alone. Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor. It increases dopamine activity in parts of the brain that are involved in dependence on addictive drugs such as nicotine, cocaine, and marijuana. Selegiline has been effective in treating nicotine dependence, but has not yet been studied in treating marijuana dependent individuals. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of selegiline in treating marijuana dependent individuals. Specifically, this study will determine whether selegiline reduces marijuana craving and withdrawal symptoms, thus leading to reduction or abstinence in marijuana use. Participants in this 9-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be randomly assigned to receive either selegiline (10 mg/day in two 5 mg pills) or placebo. Study visits will occur twice each week. At each study visit, participants will complete self-reports and urine toxicology tests. Throughout the study, participants will receive weekly individual counseling. The counseling sessions will last 15 minutes. Reduction in marijuana use as well as the number of weeks of consecutive marijuana abstinence will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
