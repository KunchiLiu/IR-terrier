	<brief_title>Effects of Post-Session Supplemental Hydromorphone on Drug Seeking Behavior in Opioid Dependent Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug dependence is often characterized by severe drug seeking behavior. Learning to understand, predict, and control this maladaptive choice behavior may lead to improved prevention and treatment strategies. HYD is a drug that is currently used as a cough suppressant and to relieve pain. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which opioid drug seeking behavior by heroin dependent individuals can be reduced by environmental factors, including supplemental opioid drug availability, drug price, and alternative non-drug reinforcers. Specifically, this study will determine whether knowledge of post-session HYD availability influences drug seeking behavior in heroin dependent individuals, who are maintained on buprenorphine during their participation. Participants in this observational study will take part in multiple trials in which they have the opportunity to choose either HYD or money. On the first two experimental days, prior to choice sessions, participants will receive a sample of the drug doses that can be chosen. During test sessions, participants will have 12 opportunities to choose either drug or money. Participants will use a computer to earn choices. Respiration rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure will be monitored throughout choice trials. Supplemental HYD will be made available following some choice sessions. Self-report questionnaires will be completed at different times during the study. Participants will be maintained on buprenorphine throughout the study, with a minimum 2-week lead before the experiment, and a fixed 3-week detoxification after study completion.</detailed_description>
