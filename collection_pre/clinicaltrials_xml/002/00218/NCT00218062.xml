	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Modafinil and D-amphetamine in Treating Cocaine Dependent Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cocaine is a strong central nervous system stimulant that is widely abused throughout the United Sates. Due to its widespread use, it is important to develop an effective treatment for cocaine dependence. Modafinil is a glutamate-enhancing agent. D-amphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant that is approved to treat individuals with narcolepsy and attention deficit disorder. Both modafinil and d-amphetamine may be effective treatments for cocaine dependence. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of modafinil and d-amphetamine, alone and in combination, in treating cocaine dependent individuals. This study will last 16 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) 200 mg dose of modafinil; 2) 400 mg dose of modafinil; 3) 30 mg dose of d-amphetamine combined with 200 mg dose of modafinil; and 4) placebo. All participants will receive 200 mg of modafinil over 4 days. Participants assigned to the 400 mg modafinil treatment group will then receive double the initial dose of modafinil for the duration of the study. Participants in the combined group (modafinil and d-amphetamine) will receive 15 and then 30 mg of d-amphetamine over 4 days.</detailed_description>
