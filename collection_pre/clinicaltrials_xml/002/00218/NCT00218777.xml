	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Habit Reversal Training for the Treatment of Chronic Tic Disorders in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CTDs and Tourette syndrome are neurobehavioral disorders that are characterized by a persistent pattern of motor and vocal tics. Tics are intermittent movements or sounds that occur repeatedly. They can be either brief, rapid, and darting movements or more purposeful movements, such as repetitively locking and unlocking a door. Vocal tics can be simple, as in sniffing or grunting, or more complex, such as complete words or phrases. Tic disorders can cause considerable distress in affected children, and can lead to social and academic impairment. If left untreated, CTDs can last into adulthood. The standard treatment for suppressing CTDs is medication; dopamine-blocking drugs are used most commonly. These medications, however, are associated with a range of adverse effects that can result in poor treatment compliance and premature treatment termination. Recent research suggests that HRT may be an effective, lower risk treatment for CTDs. HRT is a behavioral treatment based on increasing awareness of one's behaviors and replacing unwanted behaviors with less bothersome ones. This study will determine the effectiveness of CBT with HRT in treating CTDs in children and adolescents. Participants in this double blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either CBT plus HRT or standard care, which will consist of psychoeducation and supportive therapy. All participants will partake in 8 sessions of their assigned therapy over the course of 10 weeks. After the initial 10 weeks, those who responded to treatment will report back to the study site for 3 monthly booster sessions. Changes in tic severity, effects of the therapies on overall functioning and quality of life, and possible predictors of treatment outcome will be assessed.</detailed_description>
