	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effect of thalidomide in patients with multiple myeloma. The patients receive either thalidomide or a placebo tablet (neither patient nor doctor know which of these are given) in addition to the ordinary chemotherapeutic drug against multiple myeloma. We will find out for how long time the patients will stay free of the disease and for how long time they will live, and can evaluate whether thalidomide is a beneficial drug against this disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thalidomide to Patients With Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thalidomide has recently emerged as an effective treatment for patients with myeloma refractory to conventional chemotherapy. So far only limited experience is available on thalidomide for newly diagnosed myeloma. Therefore the Nordic Myeloma Study Group decided to perform a trial comparing traditional melphalan-prednisone therapy with melphalan-prednisone + thalidomide/placebo. The study design is a multicentre double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial. Mainly patients &gt;65 years of age will be included since patients &lt;65 years will be treated with high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support. The primary end-point is overall survival. Secondary end-points are quality of life, response rate, time to response, response duration and toxicity.</detailed_description>
