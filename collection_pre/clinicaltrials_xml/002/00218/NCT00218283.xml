	<brief_summary>Smokeless tobacco (ST), which includes both chewing tobacco and snuff, has as many health risks associated with its use as cigarettes. While there are many treatment programs that focus on stopping tobacco use, there are no interventions that specifically focus on reducing tobacco use. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of nicotine lozenge at reducing tobacco use in ST users.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nicotine Lozenge to Reduce Smokeless Tobacco Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals who use ST are at risk for developing heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and cancer. Other long-term effects include tooth abrasion, gum recession, and loss of bone in the jaw. Many individuals who use ST recognize the health risks associated with ST, but either do not want to quit or feel that it is impossible to quit. For these individuals, tobacco reduction may be an important transitional goal, either prior to quitting or as a treatment endpoint. The need exists for a program specifically aimed towards reducing, rather than quitting, tobacco use. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of nicotine gum at reducing ST use, as well as assessing the motivation to either quit or sustain lower levels of ST use. This 8-week study will enroll frequent users of ST. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either nicotine lozenge plus behavioral counseling or behavioral counseling alone. All participants will be asked to alternate use of their usual ST brand with nicotine lozenge or placebo in order to reduce nicotine intake by 50% during the first 4 weeks and by 75% the following 4 weeks. Participants will be required to maintain a daily tobacco use diary. Study visits will occur once a week. Tobacco levels will be monitored with urine tests, and questionnaires will be completed to assess tobacco use. Follow-up evaluations will occur 12 and 26 weeks following the end of treatment.</detailed_description>
