	<brief_title>Effectiveness of ATMX in Treating Adolescents With ADHD and SUD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High rates of ADHD have been reported in adolescents with SUD. In addition, untreated ADHD is a risk factor for developing SUD. Atomoxetine is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and is currently used to treat adolescents with ADHD. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of atomoxetine in treating adolescents dually diagnosed with ADHD and SUD. This study will last up to 18 weeks. Participants will receive six treatments of manual-driven, cognitive behavioral therapy for substance abuse over at 6 or earlier weeks. Participants and their parents will partake in therapy sessions. Subjects who have completed at least 2 weeks of CBT will be eligible to enter the controlled trial, at which point participants will be randomly assigned to receive either atomoxetine or placebo, which they will take once daily for 12 weeks. At the Week 12 study visit, participants will be assessed for symptoms of ADHD and SUD.</detailed_description>
