	<brief_summary>As designs of existing outcome studies are disparate and do not always relate well to a Swedish context, the need for further studies is obvious. Also, an empirical theory drawn from the best practice supporting autonomy and wellbeing for clients in a nursing home setting has not yet been fully depicted. The study described below intends to fill a gap in knowledge related to the effect of enhanced activities of daily living (ADL)-training, physical, and daily activities and staff education in a nursing home setting, based on a theory- and evidence-based intervention programme in a Swedish as well as a Nordic health care context. The aims of the study are to describe the impact of an individually tailored intervention program, in a nursing home setting, on: - Physical capacity - Degree of dependence in ADL - Long-term participation in physical and/or daily activities - Self-rated wellbeing</brief_summary>
