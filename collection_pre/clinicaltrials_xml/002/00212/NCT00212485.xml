	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see whether power Doppler sonography (PDS) can be used to diagnose synovitis in patients with inherited bleeding disorders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Use of Ultrasound in the Diagnosis of Hemophilic Joint Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim #1 - To determine if PDS can be used to diagnose synovial hypertrophy and inflammation in joint disease associated with inherited bleeding disorders. MRI will be used as a reference standard. Aim #2 - To determine if PDS can be used to assess therapeutic response to treatment. Aim #3 - To determine if PDS can be used as a screening tool for diagnosing early synovitis.</detailed_description>
