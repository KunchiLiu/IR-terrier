	<brief_summary>This study will compare the effect of constant low-level energy [150 joules] to an escalating energy [200-300-360 joules] regimen of biphasic waveform defibrillation on multiple patient outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biphasic Defibrillation Study: Trial to Compare Fixed Versus Escalating Energy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot, which will enroll 200 subjects, will allow a reasonable estimate of effect size and this will, in turn, allow for the accurate design and planning of a definitive randomized controlled trial. The following outcomes will be evaluated: 1. Important Clinical Outcomes: - Successful conversion, - Resuscitation to one hour, - Survival to hospital discharge, - Neurological function, and - Quality of life. 2. Process Outcomes: - Number of shocks required, - Recurrences of VF, and - Responsiveness to varying periods of pulselessness. 3. Adverse Outcomes: - Myocardial damage.</detailed_description>
