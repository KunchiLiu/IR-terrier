	<brief_summary>Protocol #1:The goals of this study was to examine whether increased weight loss in obese adolescent is induced when the weight loss medication sibutramine is added to a family-based, behavioral weight control program. Protocol #2: This study aims to improve the behavioral treatment of obesity during adolescence. A behavioral program using regular foods will be compared to a behavioral program using a structured meal plan (a portion-controlled approach with liquid-meal replacements [nutritional supplements]). This structured approach may be better for the promotion of weight loss compared to a diet of regular foods.</brief_summary>
