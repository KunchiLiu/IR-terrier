	<brief_summary>EGFR and COX-2 are involved in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and metastases and are frequently over expressed in NPC.COX-2 and EGFR inhibitors are active in NPC.There is synergistic action between COX-2 and EGFR inhibitors. Study hypothesis: Celecoxib and gefitinib can reduce angiogenesis and induce anti-tumorigenicity in patients with nasopharngeal cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Histologically proven NPC. 2. Any clinical stage NPC as defined by the AJCC/UICC System. 3. No prior radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, immunotherapy or investigational agents. 4. No prior NSAIDs or corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks. 5. ECOG performance status â‰¤ 2. 6. Adequate end organ function 7. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months. 8. Signed informed consent 1. Inability to take celecoxib and gefitinib for the specified period of time (14 days) prior to definitive therapy. 2. Tumor not visible on fibre nasopharyngoscopy for biopsy. 3. Known peptic ulcer disease. 4. Evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease. 5. Previous or concomitant malignancies with the exception of adequately treated carcinomainsitu of the cervix and basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. 6. Women who are pregnant or lactating. Females with childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study enrolment. 7. Women of childbearing potential who are not practising adequate contraception. 8. Concurrent medical problems that would significantly limit compliance with the study. 9. Presence of any underlying medical conditions (eg. Unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, renal or hepatic disease) that in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient unsuitable for study participation. 10. Known hypersensitivity to celecoxib and gefitinib or any of the excipients of the products, known sulphonamide sensitivity and allergic reaction following the ingestion of NSAIDs. 11. Known HIV, HBV or HCV infection.</criteria>
