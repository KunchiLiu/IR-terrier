	<detailed_description>The study will see if counselling adolescents with severe or moderate Hemophilia A or B results in increased compliance in the maintenance of bleeding logs.To do this subjects will be randomized into a control group and a group who will receive consistent counselling by a pharmacist about their bleeding logs. The aims of the study are: - To provide a new method of bleeding and treatment documentation in the home setting (logs) to adolescent subjects with Hemophilia A or B - To counsel these subjects about adherence to their treatment regimen prescribed by physician and the importance of keeping accurate documentation of each bleeding episode and its treatment. - To improve maintenance of logs, to allow for 1) assessment of bleeding frequency and treatment efficacy and 2) early detection of target joint bleeding and the potential need for prophylactic factor replacement.</detailed_description>
