	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes is a condition that is caused in part by an abnormality of the immune system which occurs when T cells, which are part of the immune system, damage the insulin secreting cells (islet cells) in the pancreas. Although it is known that T cells are important mediators of the disease, progress in the development of reliable T cell assays has been modest. The purpose of this study is to learn which T cell assays are most reliable and reproducible so that the investigators can improve their understanding about how type 1 diabetes occurs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T Cell Validation Study Using Blood Samples From Subjects With Recent Onset Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The T Cell Validation Study is designed to determine the ability of T cell assays to identify differences in responses from participants with type 1 diabetes compared to normal control subjects, and to compare four different laboratory tests which examine T cells to determine whether the measurements are quantitatively reproducible. Antibody assays that confirm the presence of type 1 diabetes will be evaluated including: Diabetes Biochemical Autoantibody Assay (anti-GAD65, anti-ICA512, anti-insulin) and Islet Cell Autoantibody testing; genetic testing (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] and human leukocyte antigen [HLA]) will also be done to learn more about the T cell assays. The following T Cell Assays will be conducted in individuals with type 1 diabetes, as well as those without type 1 diabetes: - Cellular Immunoblot Testing - T Cell Proliferation Assay - Tetramer Assay - Cytokine ELISpot Assay</detailed_description>
