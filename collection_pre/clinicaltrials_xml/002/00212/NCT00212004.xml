	<brief_title>Pioglitazone Protects DM Patients Against Re-Infarction (PPAR Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a well-established risk factor for coronary heart disease and atherosclerotic change in coronary artery. So we designed a prospective randomized multi-center trial named the pioglitazone could reduce the recurrence of myocardial infarction in patients with DM and myocardial infarction(PPAR study) to evaluate whether pioglitazone could reduce the recurrence of myocardial infarction in patients with DM(HbA1c&lt;6.5%) and myocardial infarction. 100 hospitals will participate in the PPAR study. Patients with DM who have history of prior myocardial infarction are randomly allocated to receive pioglitazone or (1)instructs weight reduction, appropriate diet, regular exercise and/or (2)prescribes sulfonylurea agents. The number of patients to be recruited is 3000 and this study will continue at least 2 years. The primary end-points are (1) cardiovascular mortality and (2) hospitalization for cardiovascular events. Effects in suppression of new diabetes development also will be evaluated. We should recognize DM as important therapeutic target to decrease recurrence of cardiovascular events. PPAR study, a large scale multi-center trial in Japan, will provide us new evidence how to treat DM patients with prior myocardial infarction.</detailed_description>
