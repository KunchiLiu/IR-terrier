	<brief_summary>Background: Long-lasting pain and disability, known as chronic whiplash-associated disorder (WAD), may develop after forced flexion-extension trauma to the cervical spine. Mechanisms behind WAD are virtually unknown, as are the possible effects of early intervention. This trial was undertaken to compare the effect of three early intervention strategies for the prevention of developing chronic WAD following acute whiplash injury. Methods: 458 participants were randomised to one of 1) stiff neck collar, 2) advice to act-as-usual, or 3) an active mobilisation regime. Participants were followed for one year and treatment effects were compared in terms of lasting neck pain, headache, disability and sick-leave.</brief_summary>
