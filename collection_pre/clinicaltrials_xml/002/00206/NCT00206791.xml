	<brief_summary>The purpose of this non-comparative study is to test, for the first time, the bioactivity of a new “ready to use” calcium phosphate biomaterial in fillings of little losses of osseous substance from various origins, such as traumatic and benign tumoral causes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Osteoconduction Potential of an Injectable Calcium Phosphate in Orthopaedic Surgery in Fillings of Osseous Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A lot of osseous substitution products were already used to fill osseous defects in order to prevent losses of osseous that are envisaged and so prejudicial. Synthetic calcium phosphate ceramics (particularly granulated forms) already has shown their osteoconduction potential in human at different sites. But it is difficult to put these granules in very little place. The injectable form of calcium phosphate granules “ready to use” is easier to be used and allow a diminution of the risk of infection during surgery, and permit homogeneity of the biomaterial. Injectable form of calcium phosphate granules did already has shown his biocompatibility and biofunctionality in animals. The purpose of this study is to study the biocompatibility and biofunctionality of this biomaterial in his injectable form in fillings of little losses of osseous substance from various origins were no charge will act to the biomaterial.</detailed_description>
