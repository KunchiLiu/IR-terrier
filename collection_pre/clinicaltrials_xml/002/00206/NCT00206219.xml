	<criteria>Histological confirmation of evidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Tumors have progressed after primary treatment with radiation or chemoradiation and have failed to respond to at least one course of standard platinumbased chemotherapy. Tumors have progressed after primary treatment with radiation or chemoradiation and are considered unsuitable for platinumbased chemotherapy. Carcinomas of the postnasal space, thyroid, sinus or salivary gland tumors. Isolated recurrent disease that may be amenable to local therapy; e.g., surgical intervention or radiation therapy. Known severe hypersensitivity to ZD1839, Methotrexate or any of the excipients of these products.</criteria>
