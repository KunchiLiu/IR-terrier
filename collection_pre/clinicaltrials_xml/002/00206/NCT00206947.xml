	<brief_summary>The present study will specify and delineate the separate components of cognitive deficits and examine the effects of adjunctive cholinergic augmentation on these cognitive deficits as well as psychopathology in schizophrenic patients treated with an antipsychotic compound with no aberrant binding affinity for the cholinergic receptor system. The hypothesis is that cholinergic augmentation using donepezil will improve cognitive deficits, sensory gating deficits, and psychopathology in schizophrenic patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic (ziprasidone).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The CAMPUS Project: Cholinergic Augmentation of Cognitive Deficits in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of cholinergic augmentation of atypical antipsychotic medication on: - Cognitive deficits - Sensorimotor gating - Psychopathology The primary objective was to examine: â€¢ The effects of donepezil, compared to the effects of placebo, on cognitive function, sensorimotor gating and psychopathology in patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic (ziprasidone). Secondary objectives are to examine: - The effect of donepezil, compared to the effects of placebo, on cognitive function, sensorimotor gating and psychopathology in patients treated with ziprasidone. - Which specific areas of cognitive deficits benefit from cholinergic augmentation of atypical antipsychotic treatment. - The interactions between cognitive deficits and psychopathology: To what extent the effects of cholinergic augmentation on psychopathology, sensorimotor gating, and cognition are independent or correlated. - Which specific brain areas are activated during cholinergic augmentation of treatment with an atypical antipsychotic drug (ziprasidone). Participants: Schizophrenic men and women between the ages 18 to 55 who meet the ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia living in the catchment area of the psychiatric departments of Bispebjerg University Hospital,Rigshospitalet, or Psychiatric Center, Glostrup. Patients can be either unmedicated, or need to be switched from other antipsychotic medications due to side-effects, or lack of effect on negative symptoms, positive symptoms, or cognitive function. Patients can be enrolled in the study as inpatients or outpatients, and changes in hospitalization status during the trial are allowed. Patients were stabilized on antipsychotic medication (ziprasidone) before they were randomized to treatment with either donepezil or placebo.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients: Men and women between the ages 18 to 55 who meet the ICD10 criteria for schizophrenia living in the catchment area of the psychiatric departments of Bispebjerg University Hospital, Psychiatric Center, Glostrup and Rigshospitalet. Patients can be either unmedicated, or need to be switched from other antipsychotic medications due to sideeffects, or lack of effect on negative symptoms, positive symptoms, or cognitive function. Controls: Healthy men and women matched according to gender, age, and socioeconomic status (determined by the level of education and income of parents). Patients: Patients hospitalized against their will. Patients with a serious medical illness or with laboratory abnormalities, where pharmacotherapy poses a substantial clinical risk; pregnant or lactating patients; patients with organic psychosis, a history of severe head trauma or convulsive disorders, or patients with mental retardation. Patients with significant alcohol or drug dependence are excluded. Controls: Pregnant or lactating women; a history of severe head trauma; mental retardation; learning difficulties; a history of psychiatric illness or a familial predisposition to psychiatric illness (in firstdegree relatives); significant alcohol or drug dependence; episodic incidents of excessive alcohol consumption or drug abuse are not reasons for exclusion. Abuse is monitored by interviewing patients and by measuring the urine content for amphetamine, cannabinoles, opiates, and benzodiazepines. Concomitant use of benzodiazepines for agitation or insomnia (oxazepam up to 45 mg daily) is allowed when needed and when used conservatively during the trial. Use of anticholinergic compounds is not allowed.</criteria>
