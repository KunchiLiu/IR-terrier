	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Computer controlled continuous positive airway pressure (autoCPAP) is equally effective in improving obstructive sleep apnea syndrome symptoms, breathing disturbances, objective vigilance, and it is cost-effective compared to conventional fixed continuous positive airway pressure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Auto-adjusted Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for Long-term Treatment of Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To investigate whether computer controlled continuous positive airway pressure (autoCPAP) improves subjective sleepiness, quality of life, objective vigilance, and nocturnal respiration to a similar degree as conventional fixed continuous positive airway pressure in the initial phase of treatment and over the subsequent 2 years during home therapy 2. To investigate the cost of autoCPAP compared to fixed CPAP therapy</detailed_description>
