	<brief_title>A Follow-up Colonoscopy Examination in Patients Who Had Previously Undergone Screening Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second commonest cancer in Hong Kong, and tends to be increasing. Screening for colorectal cancer can reduce the cancer incidence and mortality by detecting early lesions. However, the best interval for a follow up colonoscopy, particularly for those with normal baseline colonoscopy, remains largely unknown. This study aim to determine the prevalence of colonic neoplasm in average-risk patients who had previously undergone screening colonoscopy and the optimal time interval for re-screening.</detailed_description>
