	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Patients who have histologically and/or cytologically confirmed solid tumors requiring treatment. 2. Patients with solid tumors which are resistant to approved conventional antitumor therapies, or for which no appropriate treatment is available. 3. Patients who had completed all previous treatments (including surgery and radiotherapy) and supportive care (such as transfusion of blood, blood components and granulocyte colonystimulating factor [GCSF] treatment) at least 4 weeks before registration, and no sign or symptom of acute toxicity occurred in previous treatments. 4. Patients 20 years or older and less than 75 years of age at the time of registration. 5. Patients with 0 or 1 Performance Status (PS) established by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG.) 6. Patients who can stay in hospital for more than 1 cycle of treatment. 7. Patients who are expected to survive for more than 3 months from the start of study drug administration. 8. Patients who have provided written informed consent for the participation in the study. Exclusion criteria: 1. Patients with clinical symptoms due to brain metastases requiring treatment. 2. Patients who have any of the following laboratory test findings: 1. Hemoglobin less than 9.0 g/dL 2. Neutrophil count less than 1.5 x 10 9/L 3. Platelet count less than 100 x 10 9/L 4. Serum bilirubin greater than 1.5 mg/dL 5. AST, ALT greater than 100 IU/L 6. Serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/minute 3. Patients with positive reaction for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis virus C (HCV) antibody or hepatitis B virus surface (HBs) antigen, or patients with untreated serious infections. 4. Patients with clinically significant cardiac disorders or unstable ischemic heart diseases including myocardial infarction within six months before the registration for the study. 5. Patients with marked Baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (QTc interval greater than 450 msec for males or greater than 470 msec for females) using the Fridericia method for QTc analysis. 6. Patients with hemorrhagic or thrombotic diseases or who are using therapeutic doses of anticoagulants such as aspirin, warfarin, or ticlopidine. 7. Patients who are diagnosed with hypertension (defined as repeatedly measured blood pressure = 160/90 mmHg) at Screening, irrespective of use of antihypertensive drugs. 8. Patients who have proteinuria greater than 1 on bedside testing. 9. Patients who have history of insufficient gastrointestinal absorption, or patients who received gastric or intestinal anastomoses within 4 weeks before registration. 10. Patients who have history of alcoholism, drug addiction or mental or physical disorders, which, in the investigators opinion, may impair study compliance. 11. Patients who received any investigational drug within 30 days before the registration of the study. 12. Patients who received CYP3A4 inhibitors including itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, diltiazem or verapamil during screening and who have to use these drugs during the study. 13. Pregnant or nursing patients (all female patients with pregnancy potential must have negative pregnancy test performed before registration, and postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months.) Female patients must use appropriate contraception. 14. Fertile male patients who refuse to use contraception, or whose female partners are not using appropriate contraception. 15. Patients who are judged by the investigator to be inappropriate for the study.</criteria>
