	<brief_summary>There is evidence from a variety of animal studies that choroidal blood flow is under neural control. By contrast, only little information is available from human studies. Recent results indicate that a light/dark transition is associated with a reduction in choroidal blood flow due to an unknown mechanism. We have shown that during unilateral dark/light transitions both eyes react with choroidal vasoconstriction strongly indicating a neural mechanism responsible for the blood flow changes. Dopamine has been discussed as a chemical messenger for light adaptation. However, dopaminergic effects in the eye are not restricted to synaptic sites of release, but dopamine also diffuses to the outer retinal layers and pigment epithelium. Accordingly, dopaminergic effects also include a modulatory role on retinal vessel diameter and animal studies provide evidence for vasodilatory effects in the choroid. There is evidence that during darkness retinal and choroidal dopamine levels decrease. Accordingly, dopamine could provide a modulatory input to the light/dark transition induced changes of choroidal circulation. The aim of the present study is to test this hypothesis.</brief_summary>
