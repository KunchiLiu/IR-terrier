	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving carboplatin together with docetaxel after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving carboplatin together with docetaxel works in treating patients with stage I, stage II, or stage III non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph II Adjuvant Carboplatin/Docetaxel in Curatively Resected Stage I-IIIA NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the feasibility of adjuvant carboplatin and docetaxel in patients with resected stage I, II, or IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. Secondary - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the survival patterns of patients treated with this regimen. - Assess the patterns of recurrence in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive carboplatin IV on day 1 and docetaxel IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
