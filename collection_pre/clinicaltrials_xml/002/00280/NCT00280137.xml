	<brief_summary>To examine the psychometric properties of a brief quality of life (QOL) instrument for use in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The purpose of this prospective study is primarily to determine the validity and reliability of a new health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measure in children with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE). We wish to secondarily examine concordance between child- and parent-reports of the HRQOL measure and identify factors associated with poorer HRQOL in them. Earlier studies have shown that SLE significantly impacts QOL in adults. At present, there is no disease-specific instrument for measuring HRQOL in children with SLE. In response to these concerns, we developed the "Simple Measure of Impact of Lupus Erythematosus in Youngsters© (SMILEY©). Establishing the validity and reliability of SMILEY©, examining child-parent agreement and identifying factors associated with poorer HRQOL will enable us to measure the impact of SLE in children, and formulate appropriate interventions for this sensitive population. We plan the following specific aims: 1. to determine construct validity and reliability of SMILEY© child and parent versions in children with SLE using gold standards (Pediatric Quality of Life inventory - PedsQL generic and rheumatology modules, Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire -CHAQ) 2. to determine responsiveness of SMILEY© 3. to examine level of agreement between child- and parent-reports of SMILEY© in children with SLE 4. to identify medical (steroid use, use of disease modifying agents such as cytoxan, cellcept, thalidomide, or cyclosporine, disease duration, disease activity and disease damage etc.) and psychosocial (self-concept, socioeconomic status) factors that affect HRQOL (as measured by child- and parent-reports of SMILEY© and PedsQL generic and rheumatology modules) and physical function 5) to translate, adapt and validate SMILEY in different languages</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Health-related Quality of Life Measure in Pediatric Lupus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric lupus is a chronic multisystem rheumatic disease, associated with significant medical and psychosocial implications. Frequent physician visits for routine, urgent or emergent care, limitation of activities, medication side effects, change in body image, fear of the future, and missing school are all disruptive to the patients and parents and impact all spheres of their lives. There is no lupus-specific questionnaire designed to measure the well-being of children with this disease. We developed a brief questionnaire, "Simple Measure of Impact of Lupus Erythematosus in Youngsters© (SMILEY©) with both child and parent versions. We conducted further research about how children/parents feel about having/their children having lupus and used those responses to modify the preliminary SMILEY©. After several iterations, the SMILEY with 26 questions was developed with parallel child- and parent-versions with responses in the form of 5 faces-scale denoting different expressions, in order to ensure easy comprehension across different ages and cultures. During their visit, information about their lupus will be collected from the children and parents, and they will be asked to complete the SMILEY© and questionnaires measuring quality of life, physical function, self-esteem and behavior. They will be given an additional copy of SMILEY©, which they will be asked to complete within 10 days of their initial evaluation and return by mail (self-addressed, stamped envelope will be provided). Then both children and legal guardians will again be asked to complete questionnaires including SMILEY© during their subsequent visits at least every 3-6 month intervals or earlier if there has been a change in disease activity as determined by the physician. Medication use, disease activity and disease severity assessments will be made by the physician with initial and subsequent evaluations. We will determine the psychometrics properties of SMILEY and responsiveness to change in disease activity. Both national and international sites will be included in the study. SMILEY in addition will be translated and adapated to different languages and subsequently validated. This study will provide valuable information about the impact of lupus on their overall well-being. Being a brief, valid, reliable and easy to administer instrument, SMILEY© would be suitable for use across different age groups, languages and cultures. SMILEY© will be used as an important clinical outcome tool in both clinical and research arenas, thus enabling us to formulate appropriate interventions.</detailed_description>
