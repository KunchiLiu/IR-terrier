	<brief_summary>Study objectives: - To provide more insight on the modulation of inflammation and matrix degrading factors in serum and urine by leflunomide in early , active patients with RA and to validate the sensitivity of DEMRI (Dynamic Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in detecting inflammatory changes in active RA in response to treatment with leflunomide - Effect of leflunomide therapy on physical function improvement and Quality of life</brief_summary>
