	<brief_summary>The primary purpose is to compare patency of two different types of biliary metal stents, i.e. covered versus uncovered Nitinella metal stent. Secondary purposes are to determine frequency of complications in the two groups, e.g. cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis.</brief_summary>
