	<brief_summary>Osteoporotic fractures of the hip are a major cause of admission to long-term care facilities. Such fractures put patients at high risk for further fractures, pain and disability. Current data show that many patients in long-term care facilities do not receive FDA medications for their osteoporosis. This trial will test whether a multi-model intervention (which provides feedback about provider use of osteoporosis medications, information about osteoporosis, and currently approved osteoporosis medications)directed at physicians, other health care providers, and nurses will improve the number of prescriptions written for FDA approved medications for osteoporosis treatment.</brief_summary>
