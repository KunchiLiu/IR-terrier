	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Participants aged between 20 and 44 years at the time of obtaining informed consent. 2. Participants whose M wave amplitude potential (between baseline and negative peak) in the EDB by stimulating peroneal nerve in the foot joints is 1 mV or more during electrophysiological examinations at the times of screening and immediately before administration. 3. Participants who are judged to be eligible for study entry by an investigator or subinvestigator at screening and at immediately before pretreatment medical examination. 4. Participants who are given a full explanation about the objective and details of this study before starting screening and give written consent based on their free will. 1. Participants who have a complication or history of peripheral neuropathy, nerve root impairment, muscle disease. 2. Participants with a disease that may influence the study drug evaluation, such as disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, respiratory, endocrine, hematological, neurological, psychiatric and cardiovascular system, and congenital abnormality in metabolism. 3. Participants who have accessory deep peroneal nerve. 4. Participants who previously received a treatment with botulinum toxin. 5. Participants with a history of hypersensitivity to any component of E2014 (human serum albumin, succinate buffer solution). 6. Participants who are positive for urine drug screening at the time of screening or immediately before study drug administration. 7. Participants who received prescription drug(s) within 1 month before study drug administration. 8. Participants who have been treated with another investigational drug within 4 months before study drug administration. 9. Participants who have experienced heavy exercise or hard labor within 2 weeks before study drug administration. 10. Participants who underwent blood transfusion within 3 months before, those whose 400 mL of whole blood was collected within 3 months before, or those whose 200 mL of whole blood was collected within 1 month before study drug administration. 11. Participants who are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs antigen), hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, or serologic test for syphilis (STS). 12. Participants who received a diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or those with positive result for human immunodeficiency virus. 13. Participants who are unwilling or unable to abide by the requirements of this study, or those who may violate the prohibitions and restrictions of this study. 14. Participants who are judge to be ineligible for study entry by a principal investigator or subinvestigator.</criteria>
