	<brief_summary>This study will examine the effects of having a case manager help PHAs access and use health, social services and practical resources that are helpful to their needs as compared to the usual more PHA self-managed approach of deciding and using services as they see necessary. New and existing users of HIV/AIDS services in Wellington-Dufferin, Waterloo and Grey-Bruce Regions who consent to this study will be randomized to receive their usual self-directed supportive, educational, medical and medical care services when they seek assistance according to their needs or these usual services augmented by case management services. They will be measured before randomization and at 3, 6 and 12 months following service use for their satisfaction with HIV/AIDS services, compliance with HIV/AIDS medication, improvement in quality of life, psychological distress, risk behaviours and expenditures for the use of a range of publicly funded services.</brief_summary>
