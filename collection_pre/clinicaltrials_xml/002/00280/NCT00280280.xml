	<brief_summary>The purposes of this pilot study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Botox® compared to the safety and efficacy of oral baclofen in reducing muscle tone-related disability resulting from neurological damage or a stable neurological disorder and to evaluate drug-therapy tolerance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Botox vs. Baclofen for Upper Limb Spasticity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spasticity results from any injury to the central nervous system, including brain or spinal cord. Illnesses or injuries that typically cause spasticity include cerebral palsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain or spinal cord injury. Common treatments for spasticity include physical and occupational therapy as well as oral medications such as baclofen, injected medications such as botulinum neurotoxin, intrathecal medications and surgical procedures. The approach to the treatment of spasticity is comprehensive in nature and these therapies have been widely applied to a broad population of patients including children, adults and older adults. This is a single-center, randomized, prospective, parallel, double-blind study. Study duration is approximately 16 weeks.At Visit 2 (Baseline Visit), all eligible study subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: intramuscular Botox plus oral placebo, or intramuscular placebo plus oral baclofen.</detailed_description>
