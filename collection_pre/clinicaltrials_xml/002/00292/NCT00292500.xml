	<brief_summary>This evaluation is designed to evaluate the feasibility of using an automated distal coronary anastomotic to facilitate grafting of the left internal mammary artery to the left anterio descending coronary artery during myocardial revascularization in patients with coronary artery disease requiring surgical intervention. The study is designed to assess the ability to compare the patency of grafts created using an automated device versus hand-sewn grafts of the same vessels in the same patient population.</brief_summary>
