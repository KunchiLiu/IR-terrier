	<brief_summary>In cancer patients, the increase of troponin I soon after chemotherapy is a strong predictor of left ventricular dysfunction and poor cardiologic outcome. This information provides a rationale for the development of prophylactic strategies directed against chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity (CTIC). Activation of the renin-angiotensin system has been proved to be involved in the development and progression of cardiac dysfunction in several clinical settings, and has been suggested to have a role in the occurrence of CTIC. We investigated the role of treatment with ACE-inhibitors in the prevention of CTIC in high-risk cancer patients.</brief_summary>
