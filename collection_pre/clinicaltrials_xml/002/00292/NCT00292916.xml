	<brief_summary>The effect of whole body vibration (WBV) on bone strength and fall frequency in older adults is still vague. Although there is some evidence that WBV may impact Bone Mineral Density in very frail elderly, there is a lack of data concerning the effect of WBV in community-living elderly woman. We hypothesize that WBV significantly affects bone parameters as assessed by DXA, QCT, US and bone markers with parallel positive changes of fall related risk factors (power, strength, balance, and reaction time). We further hypothesize that the effects of WBV were superior to conventional resistance exercise.</brief_summary>
