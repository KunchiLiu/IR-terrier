	<brief_title>The Impact of Omega-3 Fat Emulsion on Clinical Outcome of Post-Operative Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As an essential component of parenteral nutrition, fat emulsion has been used more than 30 years. It provides energy and essential fatty acids. Commercial fatty emulsion products mostly come from soy bean. The omega 6 fatty acids make up with the major fatty acids of this fat emulsion, and lack of omega 3 fatty acids generally. The imbalance of these two types of fatty acids may impact with negative clinical outcomes. There are lots of omega 3 fatty acids makes up with fish oil emulsion, especially with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).Few clinical studies found its clinical efficacy in recently years. A commercial product of omega 3 fat emulsion by Fresenius-Kabi was registered in Europe at 1998. There is no any clinical trial in Asia to elaborate the efficacy of omega 3 fat emulsion, as well the lack of large scale clinical trial in the world. Currently study is the first large scale, randomized, double blind and multi-center clinical trial to elaborate the impact of fish oil fat emulsion in Asia and Europe.</detailed_description>
