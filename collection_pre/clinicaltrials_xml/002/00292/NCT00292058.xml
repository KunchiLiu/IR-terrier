	<brief_title>Comparing Telepsychiatry and in-Person Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We predict that patients referred by their family physician for a psychiatric consultation and, if needed, short-term follow-up will have equivalent clinical outcomes when seen via telepsychiatry as compared to those patients seen in-person. We also predicted that telepsychiatry will be cheaper than in-person care.Study Design: a single-centre equivalence trial.We will use a sample size calculation and analytical methods that are specifically tailored for equivalence trials.</detailed_description>
