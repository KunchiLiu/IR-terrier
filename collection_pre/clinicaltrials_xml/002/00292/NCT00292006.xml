	<brief_title>Computerized Tomography to Help Diagnosis Pediatrics Scaphoid Fractures.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The use of plain radiograph in the detection of pediatrics scaphoid fractures has low specificity and sensitivity. Patients with documented anatomical snuffbox tenderness and negative plain radiographs are casted in thumb spica casts and seen by a pediatrics orthopedics surgeon. However few patients with clinical scaphoid fractures have documented scaphoid fractures, with the most common injury of soft tissue injury to the surrounding tissues. The use of CT scan to detect scaphoid fractures is not well documented and may be an appropriate substitute for plain radiographs. Hypothesis: CT scan of the wrist will have higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting pediatrics scaphoid fracture than plain radiographs.</detailed_description>
