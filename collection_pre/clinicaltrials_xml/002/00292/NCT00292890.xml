	<brief_summary>Background and aims: - In the Netherlands most patients with diabetes mellitus that are treated with insulin, use an insulin pen for insulin administration. The injection technique can influence the absorption rate of insulin. - The aim of this study is to compare the effect of insulin injections using a 5 mm insulin needle with insulin injections using a longer needle, on HbA1c, bloodglucose levels, hypoglycaemic events, bleeding, bruising, insulin leakage and pain perception. - Study Hypothesis: 'Insulin injected with needles of 5 mm can be given without a skinfold. The length of the needle will not influence HbA1c levels and bloodglucose levelsâ€™.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- In this randomised, clinical trial with cross-over design, 52 patients with Diabetes type 1 and 2 using a 8 or 12 mm needle, are randomised into two groups. - Group I starts using 5 mm needles for insulin administration, after 13 weeks group I returns to their previously used 8 or 12 mm needle - Group II continues using their own 8 or 12 mm needle, after 13 weeks group II starts using 5 mm needles for insulin administration. - During each visit the HbA1c level is measured and a copy is made of the logbook of the patient with the blood glucose measurements. - Insulin doses and number of experienced hypoglycaemic events are registered at each visit. - The opinion and experiences of the patients regarding the different needles are obtained by using a questionnaire. - Within-group analyses are computed, using the Wilcoxon signed Ranks Test. Between-group analyses are computed using the Mann-Whitney U test.</detailed_description>
