	<detailed_description>During short-term study, adult U.S. students in Mexico (n = 310) with acute diarrhea (â‰¥ 3 unformed stools with enteric symptoms) were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized trial wherein they were given rifaximin 200 mg three times a day for 3 days (R) (n = 102), loperamide 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after each unformed stool not to exceed 8 mg/day for 2 days (L) (n = 104) or both drugs in the same dosage schedule (L/R) (n = 104). The major outcome parameter was time from initiation of therapy until passage of the last unformed stool before becoming well (TLUS).</detailed_description>
