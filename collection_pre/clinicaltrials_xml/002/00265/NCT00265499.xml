	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether skeletonization of the internal thoracic artery leads to improved flow, increased length, improved sternal perfusion, and decreased pain and dysesthesia in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Internal Thoracic Artery Skeletonization Study: A Paired, Within-Patient Comparison</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditional harvesting of the internal thoracic artery (ITA) for use as a conduit in coronary bypass surgery involves the dissection of a rim of tissue surrounding the artery on either side. Although the benefits of ITA use are well established, there are certain limitations to its routine use. Recent studies, primarily observational, have suggested that skeletonization of the ITA (i.e. harvesting of the ITA alone) may overcome some of these limitations by improving conduit flow, increasing length, and reducing the risk of deep sternal infection in high risk patients. Furthermore, skeletonization of the ITA can potentially preserve intercostal nerves and reduce post-operative pain and dysesthesias associated with ITA harvesting. In order to assess the effects of ITA skeletonization, this is a prospective, randomized, within-patient study design in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.</detailed_description>
