	<brief_title>Study of Different Suturing Techniques for Perineal Repair After Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomised controlled trial with 400 participants was initiated in August 2004. The two suture techniques compared were both 2-layered and either continuous sutures or interrupted, inverted stitches to perineal muscles and the subcuticular layer. A polyglactin 910 multifilament thread on an atraumatic needle was used and the perineal skin was left unsutured. Healthy primiparas &gt;36+0 weeks gestation could participate if they had a either a 2nd degree perineal laceration or an episiotomy. The trial was a double-blind and analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. Main outcomes were pain, wound healing and patient satisfaction.</detailed_description>
