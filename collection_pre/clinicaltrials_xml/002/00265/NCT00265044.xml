	<brief_title>Improving Practice Patterns for the Treatment of Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project was a randomized trial designed to examine the relative contribution of three quality improvement interventions of increasing intensity on BP control in veterans. Providers in each stratum and their eligible patients were randomized to one of three study arms. The providers randomized to the first arm received education alone, and were considered the controls. Providers randomized to the second arm received both provider education and a hypertension alert. The third arm included provider education, a hypertension alert, and patient education. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 21- 90 years and filled their medications with the VA pharmacies. Between July and December 2003, we determined patient eligibility using a search strategy using data from the Mid South Quality Improvement Data warehouse, which is downloaded monthly from Veterans' Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA).</detailed_description>
