	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as infrared thermography, may help find Kaposi's sarcoma and learn the extent of disease. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well infrared thermography finds skin lesions in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infrared Thermography in Finding Skin Lesions in Patients With Kaposi's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare ultra-sensitive infrared thermographic images with visible light digital photographic images and clinical dermatologic examination as methods of measuring cutaneous lesions in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Secondary - Compare differences in modulation of temperature detected in KS skin lesions with non-involved skin of the same patient and with normal skin of healthy volunteers by sequential imaging using the infrared thermographic camera. OUTLINE: This is a controlled, pilot study. Patients undergo clinical assessment followed by simultaneous digital photographic camera imaging and high-resolution infrared thermographic camera imaging of designated normal skin areas and selected marker lesions. Before imaging, a metal bar chilled to 0ยบ C, 10ยบ C, and 25ยบ C is applied to the lesions and designated normal skin areas for up to 90 seconds. Healthy volunteers (controls) undergo the same procedure as for the patient except only designated normal skin areas are used. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients and 10 healthy volunteers (controls) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
