	<brief_title>A Study of CNTO 328 in Subjects With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study uses a type of drug called anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, also known as CNTO 328. CNTO 328 is a new experimental drug. This study is trying to better understand the safety, the tolerability (side effects), and the distribution of the drug in the blood stream. The effects of CNTO 328 in patients with renal cell carcinoma are currently unknown. However, recent data has shown that treatment with another anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody reduces the symptoms of renal cell carcinoma. The study is divided in 3 parts. Part 1 is the phase I portion of the study and evaluated the safety of CNTO 328 in subjects with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Part 2 and 3 will evaluate efficacy and safety of the drug in this patient population.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis (histologically confirmed, preferably) of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with documented metastases beyond the level of the regional lymphatics (ie, any T, any N, M1 disease) Measurable or evaluable disease (Part 1); measurable disease (Part 2 and Part 3) Documented disease progression based on objective tumor assessment (Part 2 and Part 3), proven by tumor measurements on 2 computerized tomography scans within 6 months prior to enrollment Life expectancy greater than or equal to 6 months at screening Serum Creactive protein (CRP): detectable ( 4 mg/L or more) according to the standard assay of the core laboratory (Part 1 and Part 2); serum CRP detectable to 30 mg/L or more (Part 3) Received any investigational drug within 30 days, whichever is longer History of receiving murine or chimeric proteins or human/murine recombination products (such as BE8 and other antiIL6 monoclonal antibodies) Serious concurrent illness or significant cardiac disease characterized by significant ischemic coronary disease or congestive heart failure Chronic infection, prior history of recurrent infection, or clinically important active infection Presence of a transplanted solid organ (with the exception of a corneal transplant more than 3 months prior to screening) or having received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant or peripheral blood stem cell transplant</criteria>
