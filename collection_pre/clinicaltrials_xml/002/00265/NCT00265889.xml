	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Giving two autologous stem cell transplants (one after the other) may be an effective treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving two autologous stem cell transplants works in treating patients with progressive or recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the 3-year progression-free survival of patients with progressive or recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with tandem autologous stem cell transplantation (2 courses of high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell rescue). - Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are stratified according to risk (poor risk [primary progressive, recurrent, or resistant relapse] vs good risk [first recurrence]). - Salvage therapy (for patients with relapsed disease after achieving a previous complete response): Patients receive at least 2 courses of salvage chemotherapy or radiotherapy. - Autologous hematopoietic stem cell collection: Patients undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell collection. Patients with an inadequate number of collected stem cells are removed from the study. - First preparative regimen: Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV continuously over 16 hours on day -1. - First autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT): Patients undergo autologous SCT on day 0. They also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV over 30 minutes once daily beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover. At least 4-8 weeks later, patients proceed to second preparative regimen. - Second preparative regimen: Patients receive high-dose carmustine IV over 1-2 hours on days -6, -5, and -4, etoposide IV over 4 hours on day -3, and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day -2. Beginning 36-48 hours later, patients proceed to the second autologous SCT (day 0). - Second autologous SCT: Patients undergo second autologous SCT on day 0. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV over 30 minutes once daily beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
