	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of irbesartan on the progression of liver fibrosis in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C. The expected total enrollment is 200 patients. Patients who meet the study criteria and accept to participate at this study will take by day one tablet of 150 mg of treatment (irbesartan or placebo) during two years. The assessment of efficacy will be make by evaluation of area of liver fibrosis and blood markers of liver fibrosis</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The results of several studies suggests than the AT1 receptor antagonists of angiotensin II have inhibitory effects on TGF-beta 1 production and can limit the progression of liver fibrosis. Therefore, the angiotensin II could be another mediator of the synthesis of the extra-cellular matrix at the hepatic level, opening new perspectives with the antagonists of angiotensin II receptors drugs (ARA2/sartans). This study is a randomized, double blind, multi-center, parallel assignment, and efficacy study.</detailed_description>
