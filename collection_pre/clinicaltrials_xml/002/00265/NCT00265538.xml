	<brief_summary>This study examines the use of patient initiated discussions of blood pressure medication in the primary care setting. Additionally, this study examines different levels of patient incentive(s) to initiate discussions with providers including information only, information plus 20$ incentive and reimbursement for 6 months of copay, and information/monetary incentive plus a reminder call prior to the index visit. Patient opinions about doctor/patient relationships will be assessed. Provider attitudes and prescribing behaviors will be analyzed as well.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized to Pure control, intervention control, intervention group a, intervention group b or intervention group c. Pure control patients will not receive any study information about diuretics and their providers will not see any patients who receive our study intervention letter. Patients in the intervention control group will not receive the intervention but will see providers who have other patients in the intervention groups. Patients in intervention group a will receive a customized letter prior to their next primary care appointment with information regarding the patient's specific blood pressure, current blood pressure medication and recommendation for switching or adding a thiazide. Patients in group b will receive the customized intervention letter as well as a 20$ incentive for discussing the information with their provider and a copay reimbursement for 6 months if a prescription is written for a thiazide. Patients in group c will receive the intervention letter, 20$ discussion incentive, copay reimbursement as well as a phone call reminder 1-2 days prior to their primary care visit.</detailed_description>
