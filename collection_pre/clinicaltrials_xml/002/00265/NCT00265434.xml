	<brief_summary>Rhinosinusitis disorders are often associated with Cystic Fibrosis. They can restrict quality of life enormously and give cause to repeated ENT surgery. The basic defect in CF is a dysfunction of Chloride channels in exocrine glands, leading to retention of secretions and consecutive chronic inflammation with bacterial superinfections. The prospective placebo controlled cross-over study aims at the evaluation of the efficacy of a nasally inhalation of Pulmozyme with respect to mucus retention and resulting inflammation.</brief_summary>
