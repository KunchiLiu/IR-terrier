	<brief_summary>Our goal is to study pharmacogenetics in Mexican-Americans, using depression treatments as a proof of the concept that pharmacogenetic approaches can be used to optimize treatment strategies for common and complex disorders in this population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a single site, 8-week, double-blinded, placebo lead-in trial with fluoxetine or desipramine. All subjects have a comprehensive psychiatric and medical assessment, and if enrolled, continued with two consecutive phases of the study: 1) A one-week, single-blind placebo lead-in phase to eliminate placebo responders. 2) Subsequent random assignment to one of two treatment groups: fluoxetine 10-40 mg/day or desipramine 50-200 mg/day. Given the proven efficacy of these antidepressant medications, a placebo lead-in period followed by active treatment for all patients has been utilized in order to minimize human subjects at risk.</detailed_description>
