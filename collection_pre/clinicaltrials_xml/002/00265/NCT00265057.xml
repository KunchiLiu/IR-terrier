	<brief_summary>N-cadherin, a protein involved in blood vessel cell binding, is increased as cancer progresses, and is on the surface of many tumor cells. ADH-1 blocks N-cadherin. This study will test the safety and effects of ADH-1 in subjects with incurable, solid tumors with a protein biomarker called N-cadherin. This study will identify the amount of ADH-1 that subjects can tolerate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of ADH-1 Given Intravenously to Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Signed written informed consent Male and female patients &gt; or = 18 years of age with a solid tumor(s) refractory to standard curative therapy or for which no curative therapy exists. Study currently enrolling only patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer or advanced ovarian cancer to the safety expansion phase. Clinically or radiologically documented measurable disease. Immunohistochemical evidence of Ncadherin expression (at least 1+ positive) in archived or fresh tumor tissue Adequate performance status and organ function, as evidenced by hematological and biochemical blood testing and electrocardiogram (ECG) Exclusion criteria: Receipt of ADH1 prior to this clinical study Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or any other investigational drug within 30 days before study entry History of primary brain tumors or brain metastases (known or suspected) unless any lesions have completely resolved following appropriate treatment and there has been no recurrence for at least 6 months. History of spinal cord compression. History of tumors that have shown clinically significant evidence of active bleeding (e.g., gross hemoptysis, hematemesis, hematuria, melena, or bleeding superficial tumor) within 12 weeks before study entry. Stroke, major surgery, or other major tissue injury within 30 days before study entry History of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, angina, life threatening arrhythmias, significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, or known hypercoagulable states</criteria>
