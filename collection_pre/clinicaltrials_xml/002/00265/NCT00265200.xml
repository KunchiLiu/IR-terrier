	<brief_title>Using TRAP to Evaluate the Effect of Zometa on Bone Metastasis Due to Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new blood test as a way to follow the effect of Zometa in treating bone metastases. The blood test will look for a protein, called TRAP, which is released into the blood stream by the breakdown of bone. This study will compare the TRAP blood test with other blood tests for bone destruction.</detailed_description>
