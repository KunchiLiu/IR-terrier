	<detailed_description>Despite increased awareness of the importance of being screened for colorectal cancer, African Americans continue to be disproportionately affected by this disease. The Colorectal Cancer Screening Intervention Trial (CCSIT) is designed to test and expand a public health intervention that combines social marketing and community-coalition building efforts. The purpose of this study is to 1) evaluate the effects of three different approaches on knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (KABs) about colorectal cancer; 2) to examine the effects of three different approaches to adherence to screening guidelines and 3) to evaluate the independent role of setting on screening practices. Participants age 50 and over are recruited from churches, clinics and senior sites which allows us to examine the impact of setting on participant recruitment and changes to KAB. Pre and post questionnaires are administered to determine the knowledge attitudes and behaviors (KAB) related to screening and to measure psychosocial parameters (self-esteem, perceived stress and social support). These persons are randomized into one of four groups, the control group and three intervention arms: (1) one-on-one counseling sessions, (2) small group educational sessions and (3) financial incentives interventions where out of pocket cost for screening is reimbursed. The counseling and educational interventions incorporate the Health Belief Model and Social Learning Theory.</detailed_description>
