	<detailed_description>This preliminary study aims to investigate the mechanism of higher rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia. As part of the study, we collect neuroendocrine-immune data on patients with first episode, treatment naive psychosis, patients with newly diagnosed schizophrenia and normal healthy controls. Regardless the treatment status, we collect the same neuroendocrine-immune on the participants (patients and controls) after 2 months. Thus, our study does not control treatment. Patients take treatment in consultation with their physician. Some of them even decide not to take any medications. At the 2nd visit, we do ask them about the the medications they are taking if any.</detailed_description>
