	<brief_summary>An increase prevalence of CMV, EBV and or HHV-6 in diseased tissue of inflammatory bowel disease would suggest a role for these viruses in the etiology and/or exacerbation of IBD, whereas their absence would preclude such association.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence of Cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr Virus and Human Herpes 6 Virus in Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The protocol is designed to evaluate the following objectives: 1. The prevalence of cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and human herpes 6 virus DNA in inflamed intestinal mucosa of patients with Crohn's colitis and ulcerative colitis compared to their prevalence in healthy intestinal mucosa of patients not affected by these conditions; 2. To evaluate the prevalence of cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and human herpes 6 virus DNA in the intestinal mucosa of patients with Crohn's colitis and ulcerative colitis compared to that in inflamed mucosa caused by other conditions (non specific colitis); 3. To compare the prevalence of cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and human herpes 6 virus DNA in inflamed and healthy tissue in the same patients with Crohn's colitis and ulcerative colitis; 4. To determine whether the presence of cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and human herpes 6 virus DNA detected by nPCR correlates with immunohistochemical detection of viral protein in colonic tissue. 5. To determine whether the relative viral quantity of CMV, EBV or HHV-6 is related to severity of disease activity.</detailed_description>
