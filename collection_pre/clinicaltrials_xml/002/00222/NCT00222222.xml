	<brief_summary>Aims of the study were to find vascular markers of inflammation and endothelial damage during the course of severe sepsis in septic patients and the effects of treatment with anti-inflammatory medication (such as Drotregocin alfa (activated)). Another aim is to find new markers and gene polymorphisms for prognosis and mortality of patients with severe sepsis. The hypothesis is that higher plasma concentrations of certain markers in septic patients are associated with a higher mortality rate.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During the past years many investigators have focused on the immunological changes in sepsis disease, and great attention has been paid to the development of practicable means of immunomonitoring. Human activated protein C (Drotrecogin alfa (activated)), an important coagulation inhibitor plays a major role in regulating microvascular coagulation, inflammation and immunology. Little is known about prognostic vascular biomarkers during the time course of patients with severe sepsis.</detailed_description>
