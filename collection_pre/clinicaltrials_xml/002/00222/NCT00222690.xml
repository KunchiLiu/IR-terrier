	<brief_title>Living With Fibromyalgia: Triggers,Subgroups, and a Cognitive-Behavioral and Interactive Technology-Based Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia (FM) may currently be the most common rheumatic diagnosis of rheumatologists among their female patients, with 15-20% of all new rheumatology referrals meeting the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnosis criteria for fibromyalgia. People with fibromyalgia live through widespread musculoskeletal chronic pain, fatigue, psychological distress, and exhibit diminished physical performance due in part to the cycle of pain that adversely affect their activity participation and overall well-being. The purpose of this prospective mixed methods study is to conduct semi-structured qualitative interviews using ethnographic techniques to examine the personal experiences of women living with fibromyalgia. The specific aims of this study are to identify clinically relevant “triggers” of fibromyalgia symptoms and examine their impact on activity limitations and participation restrictions.</detailed_description>
