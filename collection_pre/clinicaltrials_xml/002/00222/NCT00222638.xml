	<detailed_description>The pharmacokinetic and the pharmacodynamic interactions and the possible clinical events connected with the simultaneous administration of Oral Anticoagulants (OA) and the influenza virus vaccine were evaluated in several small studies which yielded conflicting results, thus encouraging additional investigations with prospective studies in order to obtain a more consistent evidence about the safety and efficacy of vaccination against influenza virus in patients on OA Treatment.</detailed_description>
