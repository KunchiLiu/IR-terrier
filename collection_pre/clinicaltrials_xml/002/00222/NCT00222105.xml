	<brief_summary>Four monthly treatments with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, thalidomide and dexamethasone for newly diagnosed myeloma patients as induction therapy prior to high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Efficacy, Toxicity, Harvest Yield and Quality of Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable hematological malignancy of plasma cell origin. Plasma cell clonality and dysfunctional immunoglobulin production characterize the disease. The consequences of abnormal plasma cell growth are manifested by a myriad of symptoms and signs that often have significant impact on the patient's quality of life. These include pancytopenia secondary to predominant distribution of tumor cells within the bone marrow along with many other effects. This study is focused on the efficacy of Doxil® (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) with low dose Dexamethasone and Thalidomide (Ddt) in previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma.</detailed_description>
