	<brief_summary>Several prognostic predictors, including baseline ALL features and response to initial therapy, have been described in adult ALL raising the issue of whether these predictors might be redundant and which must be considered for treatment stratification. In the GRAALL-2003 prospective Phase 2 study, we aim to hierarchize the following high-risk factors in Ph-negative ALL patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1) baseline (BL) : WBC30G/L in B-lineage, CNS involvement, MLL-AF4 and E2A-PBX fusions, haploidy/near-triploidy; 2) early response (ER) : corticoresistance after prophase (CsR), chemoresistance at Day 8 (ChR); all CsR and/or ChR patients are planned to receive higher doses of cyclophosphamide (HyperC) at Day 15 of induction; 3) induction response (IR) : no CR or Ig-TCR minimal residual disease (MRD) 10-2 after standard or HyperC induction. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is proposed to patients with a donor and at least one BL, ER, or IR factor.</detailed_description>
