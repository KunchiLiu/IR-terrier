	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial to Examine Effects of Atomoxetine in the Treatment of Negative Symptoms in Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study proposes to examine the effect of Atomoxetine (Strattera), a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor on Negative Symptoms and Quality of Life and its safety when used in conjunction with an atypical antipsychotic agent in remitted community dwelling subjects with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective disorder. Atomoxetine was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in children and adults. All subjects will receive various psychometric assessments at 2-week intervals for a period of 26 weeks. It is hypothesized that subjects treated with Atomoxetine in this 26 week random assignment, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, will have a significantly greater improvement in quality of life and social functioning.</detailed_description>
