	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis for this application for a multicenter phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT) is that induced moderate hypothermia (HYPO) (32-33 째C) after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children and maintained for 48 hours will improve mortality at 3 months and 12 month functional outcome as assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary specific aim of this RCT is to determine the effect of induced moderate HYPO (32-33 째C) after severe TBI in children on mortality at 3 months post injury. The primary outcome measure will be the GOS; the primary time point for evaluation is 3 months. Further secondary functional outcome measures will include the GOS - Extended Pediatrics (GOS - E Peds), and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) and will be assessed in conjunction with the GOS at 6 and 12 months post injury. The secondary hypotheses are based on the results and analysis of the Pilot Clinical Trial (completed and recently published [Adelson et al. NEUROSURGERY. 56 (4): 740-754, 2005]). These secondary hypotheses include that induced moderate hypothermia (HYPO) (32-33 째C) after severe TBI in children and maintained for 48 h: - will improve other outcome assessments including neurocognitive status on performance-based neuropsychological testing across the domains of intellectual development, learning and memory, language, motor and psychomotor skills, visuo-spatial abilities, attention and executive function, and behavior at only 6 and 12 months after injury; - HYPO will improve long term outcome of all age ranges and across genders in infants, young, preadolescent, and adolescent children; AND - HYPO will lessen intracranial hypertension and lessen the intensity of therapy necessary for control of ICP. Based on these hypotheses, further secondary specific aims are proposed: - Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of early induced moderate HYPO (32-33째C) after severe TBI in children on global function and neurocognitive outcomes in the areas of intellectual ability/ development, memory and learning, and behavior at 6 and 12 months post injury. - Specific Aim 3: To determine the effect of early induced moderate HYPO after severe TBI in children of different age ranges (&lt; 6 y and 6- &lt; 16 y) on mortality and 6 and 12 months functional and neurocognitive outcomes. - Specific Aim 4: To determine the effect of early moderate HYPO after severe TBI in children on reducing intracranial hypertension and maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).</detailed_description>
