	<brief_title>Ovarian Screening Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the year 2001 approximately 23,400 women in the USA are expected to be diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma and 13,900 will die of the disease. This means that within the USA more women die annually from ovarian cancer than all other gynecologic malignancies combined. Within the Commonwealth of Kentucky approximately 250 women per year develop ovarian carcinoma. Survival for patients with ovarian cancer is directly related to the stage of disease at diagnosis. Unfortunately, the majority of women present with advanced disease (Stage III and IV) and most of these patients will die of the disease. The aim of screening for ovarian cancer is to reduce the morbidity and mortality by detecting the disease at an early stage since ovarian cancer detected when disease is confined to the ovary (Stage I) is associated with a dramatically improved 5-year survival. Disease confined to the ovary may be cured in over 90% of patients, in some cases without the need for chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
