	<brief_summary>Currently, when a child has fever either ibuprofen (e.g. Motrin, Advil) or acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol) is given. Both Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen are approved for over the counter use for treatment of fever by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This study hopes to determine whether giving both medications together is better than giving one medication alone for the treatment of fever.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibuprofen Alone and in Combination With Acetaminophen for Treatment of Fever</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite a lack of evidence to support their fears, a majority of parents, pediatricians, and pediatric nurses believe that fever can be dangerous to a child. This "fever phobia" has caused a majority of caregivers to aggressively treat fever with antipyretics such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, often in combination. Although there is scant data to support the use of these medications together for fever control and none using alternating regimens, it was recently reported that 50% of pediatricians and 70% of pediatricians with less than 5 years of experience advise parents to alternate acetaminophen and ibuprofen as an attempt to achieve maximal antipyresis. While a combination of aspirin (no longer used for antipyresis in children) and acetaminophen has been shown to be superior to either agent alone for fever reduction, these data cannot be extrapolated to the pairing of ibuprofen and acetaminophen. There is evidence that combinations of acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are more effective for the treatment of pain and can reduce opioid use when compared with a single agent. Improved activity and alertness in children have been reported after antipyretic administration. It is believed that acetaminophen and ibuprofen may be safely used together because the two medications have significantly different pathways of metabolism that are not affected by each other, and have been used abroad in combination form for over a decade. Both acetaminophen and ibuprofen have been shown to be safe when given individually or together in recommended doses for short term use. There are no reports of adverse effects from combination therapy with standard doses. In addition, while it now appears that fever itself is probably a protective physiologic response, under different circumstances it has the potential to be harmful. Fever increases the metabolic rate approximately 10% for every 1 degree C rise in body temperature. The myocardial depression,orthostatic dysfunction, and increases in oxygen consumption, respiratory minute volume, and respiratory quotient that occur may not be tolerated by all patients including some children. Because of the ubiquitous nature of the problem, childhood fever, this study has the potential to immediately impact the way clinicians and parents treat children with fever. If the combination regimens are not shown to be superior, it could limit improper medication administration and overdose. If it is superior, the combination of medications may improve other symptoms associated with fever such as discomfort. Either way, it will fill the gap that exists in the evidence-based approach to the management of childhood fever and immediately impact current practice.</detailed_description>
