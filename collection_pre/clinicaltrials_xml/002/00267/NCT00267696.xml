	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of the drug combination: gemcitabine, carboplatin and bevacizumab in patients that have been diagnosed with platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Gemcitabine/Carboplatin/Bevacizumab to Treat Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study participants will receive the drug combination gemcitabine/carboplatin and bevacizumab once every two weeks. As long as there is evidence that the tumor is not growing and the participant is not experiencing any unacceptable side effects, participation can continue up to 2 years. The study is being done to find the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of this combination of chemotherapy drugs. Bevacizumab affects the growth of new blood vessels in the body. It is part of this study to see if stopping the growth of new blood vessels in the body will help stop the growth and the spread of cancer. The other two chemotherapy drugs, gemcitabine and carboplatin, are currently being used together for the treatment of ovarian cancer.</detailed_description>
