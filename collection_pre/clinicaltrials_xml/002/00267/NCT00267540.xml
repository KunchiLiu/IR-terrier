More specifically the effects on the following parameters will be assessed: - Vitamin D metabolites. - Parathyroid hormone. - Bone turnover. - Bone mineral accretion. - Serum calcium and phosphate. - Renal handling of calcium and phosphate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Vitamin D on Bone Accretion and Turn-Over in Young Girls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This work package will consist of a randomised double blind one-year vitamin D supplementation study. Primary effect parameter is change in bone mineral content and therefore study duration will be one year. A total of 225 subjects, 75 in each of the three groups: one control and two intervention groups, will be included Two dosages of supplementation will be used: 5 µg per day and 10 µg per day.</detailed_description>
