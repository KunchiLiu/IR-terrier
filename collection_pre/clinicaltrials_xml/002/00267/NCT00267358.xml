	<brief_summary>Anorexia and cachexia are devastating complications in late-stage cancer patients and is strongly associated with mortality in these patients. Activation of Ghrelin receptors have been demonstrated to stimulate appetite. RC-1291 HCl, by virtue of its ghrelin like activity and Growth Hormone releasing effects may have a dual role in the reversal of cancer induced anorexia and cachexia. This placebo controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of RC-1291 HCl in cancer patients with anorexia and cachexia.</brief_summary>
