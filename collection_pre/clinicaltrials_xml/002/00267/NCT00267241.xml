	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects in terms of gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and comfort of breathing, of different assisted mechanical ventilation in ALI/ARDS patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Different Assisted Mechanical Ventilation in Acute Lung Injury (ALI)/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ALI/ARDS patients (during assisted ventilation) will be ventilated with different types of assisted ventilation (pressure support, pressure support plus sigh, BIPAP, variable ventilation) and gas exchange, comfort of breathing, respiratory mechanics and pattern of breathing will be measured.</detailed_description>
