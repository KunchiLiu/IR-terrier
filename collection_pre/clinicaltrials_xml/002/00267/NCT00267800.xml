	<brief_summary>The cause of most interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) is still unknown. Further research, for example to determine predisposing genetic factors, is therefore needed. A database with relevant clinical data and DNA/serum samples of ILD patients could facilitate future research on the cause of ILDs.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Protocol title: 'Registration of clinical data and DNA of patients with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)' Rationale: The etiopathogenesis of most Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs) is still unknown. Further research, e.g. to determine predisposing genetic factors, is therefore needed. A database with relevant clinical data and DNA/serum samples of ILD patients could facilitate future research on the etiopathogenesis of ILDs. Objective: Availability of relevant clinical data and DNA/serum samples of ILD patients in a database. Those data can be used for future research. Study design: A prospective observational study Study population: Patients diagnosed with ILD attending the pulmonology department in participating hospitals. Intervention: a blood sample is taken from each patient. Furthermore, additional information is collected from the medical file. Main study parameters/endpoints: DNA and serum sample, demographic variables, medical information, occupational history and hobbies. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, group relatedness: two tubes of blood will be drawn from the patients. The risks of drawing blood from a vein are minimal.</detailed_description>
