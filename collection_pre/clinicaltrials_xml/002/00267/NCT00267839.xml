	<brief_title>Effect of Exercise on Risk-factors of Elderly Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The human aging process is associated with a significant increase of risk factors (i.e. osteoporosis, coronary heard disease, diabetes) and a decline in neuromuscular function impacting independence of the subject. Osteoporosis, diabetes type II and arteriosclerosis are diseases known to correlate with age. Participating in regular sport activities elicits numerous favorable effects that contribute to "healthy aging". Unfortunately all existing studies which focus on specific diseases or conditions favour dedicated exercise regimes. However, the complex risk factor scenario of older adults requires multi-purpose exercise programs with impact on all relevant risks. Furthermore so far no exercise study longitudinally determines the effect of an ambulatory exercise program on health cost considering the specific health policy framework of Germany. We hypothesize that regular exercise 1. significantly impact relevant osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes risk factors in elderly subjects 2. significantly reduces health costs in elderly community living women</detailed_description>
