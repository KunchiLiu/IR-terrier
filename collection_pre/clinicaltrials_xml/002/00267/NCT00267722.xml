	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate an intravenous (by injection) investigational medication to treat moderate to severe inflammatory, nonstricturing, nonpenetrating Crohn's disease. The research is being conducted at up to 5 clinical research sites in the US and Europe and is open to both men and women ages 18 to 70 years old. Participants in the study will have a number of visits to a research site up to 17 months. All study-related care and medication is provided to qualified participants at no cost: this includes all visits, examinations and laboratory work. Visilizumab is a humanized antibody (antibodies are proteins that are normally made by the immune system to help defend the body from infections and other foreign substances) that is directed against T cells. Visilizumab selectively attacks problematic T cells and, in doing so, it may prevent them from causing inflammation. Visilizumab has also been observed to have a suppressive effect on the body's immune system (system in the body that reacts to foreign or occasionally one's own proteins).</brief_summary>
