	<brief_summary>This study is designed to investigate the use of omalizumab as a pretreatment for patients with persistent allergic asthma who are candidates for allergen immunotherapy (ie, allergy shots) and will test the hypothesis that omalizumab may reduce the rate of systemic reactions to immunotherapy in patients with persistent allergic asthma.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients were eligible for inclusion if they met all of the following criteria: Informed Consent Patients who were informed of the study procedures and medications and provided their written informed consent Demographics Male or female Any race Ages 18 55 years Body weight &gt;=20 kg and &lt;=150 kg Total serum IgE concentration &gt;=30 and &lt;=700 IU/mL at Visit 0 Disease Definitions/Medications History of at least moderate persistent allergic asthma (consistent with Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] guidelines of &gt;=1 year in duration On a stable asthma treatment regimen including inhaled corticosteroids for the preceding 4 weeks An FEV1 while withholding shortacting betaagonists for at least 6 hours and longacting betaagonists for at least 12 hours, of &gt;=75% of the predicted value at Visit 0 Evidence of reversible airway obstruction, as defined by an increase in FEV1 of &gt;=12% between 20 to 30 minutes after 4 puffs (or less at the discretion of the investigator) of inhaled shortacting betaagonist administration at Visit 0 or within the preceding year Documented sensitivity to perennial aeroallergens, as evidenced by a positive skin test (wheal &gt;=5mm greater than saline control) to at least 1 of 3 perennial aeroallergens (house dust mite, cat, or dog) at Visit 0 or within the preceding year Average PEFR variability &lt;=20% (calculated as [(PM PEF AM PEF)/(PM PEF + AM PEF)/2 x 100) during the 2week screening period Prespecified level of nocturnal asthma symptoms (i.e., a mean nocturnal asthma score of &gt;0 and &lt;=0.5) and a mean combined clinical symptom score (nocturnal, morning, and daytime) of &gt;0 and &lt;=3 during the screening period Nonsmoker for at least 1 year prior to Visit 1, with a smoking history of no more than 10 packyears (i.e., 1 pack [20 cigarettes] per day for 10 years) Judged to be in good physical and mental health (except for his/her asthma), based on medical history, physical examination, and routine laboratory data, and appeared to be able to successfully complete this trial Patients were to be excluded from participation if they met any of the following criteria: Pulmonary History of intubation for asthma Asthma exacerbation requiring treatment with systemic steroids within the preceding 3 months Asthma exacerbation requiring treatment in an emergency department or a hospital admission in the preceding 6 months Upper respiratory tract infection or sinusitis within the preceding 4 weeks History of an anaphylactic allergic reaction (except to stinging insects, foods, or drugs other than omalizumab) History of treatment with immunotherapy to any allergen within past 3 years History of aspirin or non steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)related asthma; patients could have been included in NSAIDs use was avoided for the duration of the study General Medical History of or current malignancy Any clinically significant uncontrolled systemic disease or a history of such disease (e.g., infectious, hematologic, renal, hepatic, endocrinologic, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular disease) within the previous 3 months Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at Visit 1 Platelet levels &lt;=130 x 10 9/L at visit 1 Women of childbearing potential who were not practicing a medically approved contraception method (e.g., oral, subcutaneous, mechanical, or surgical contraception), as well as women who were pregnant or nursing History of hypersensitivity to any ingredients, including excipients (sucrose, histidine, or polysorbate 20) of the study medication or drugs related to omalizumab (e.g., monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal gammaglobulin) Severe medical condition(s) that, in the view of the investigator, prohibited participation in the study Previous treatment with omalizumab within 1 year of screening Considered by the investigator to be potentially unreliable or who may not have reliably attended study visits History of drug or alcohol abuse Procedural Unable to perform acceptable, reproducible spirometry, or PEFR measurements Unable or unwilling to comply with the study procedures as determined during the screening phase, including adequate completion of the diary Medications Patient took the following medications before Visit 0. These medications were not permitted during the trial unless otherwise specified: Oral, intravenous, intramuscular, or intraarticular corticosteroids within 4 weeks Betaadrenergic antagonists (including ocular preparations) within 1 week Antihistamines within 1 week; after skin testing was completed (Visit 0), antihistamines could be used as needed for the remainder of the study Intravenous gammaglobulin or immunosuppressants within 4 weeks Tricyclic antidepressants within 1 week Investigational drugs within 4 weeks</criteria>
