	<brief_summary>Late onset Hypothyroidism was found in infant with congenital hypothyroidism. The hypothesis is that infants with congenital hypothyroidism may lose thyroxin and other hormones via the chylothorax fluid causing transient hypothyroidism. In this study hormonal concentration will be measured in the chyle as well as hormonal serum level.</brief_summary>
