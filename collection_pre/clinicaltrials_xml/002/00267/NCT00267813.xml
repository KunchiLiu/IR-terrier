	<brief_summary>Craving and withdrawal from smoking cigarettes are major factors for relapse. We investigated craving for cigarettes in smokers undergoing pharmacological treatment with Bupropion (Zyban). We compare cue-induced reactivity to smoking videos in smokers who were successfully treated with Bupropion to smokers who are still smoking. We measured the brain's metabolic activity in response to smoking and neutral cues in Positron Emission Tomography using FDG.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Craving and withdrawal from smoking cigarettes are major factors for relapse. We investigated craving for cigarettes in smokers undergoing pharmacological treatment with Bupropion (Zyban)for 2 months. We compare cue-induced reactivity to smoking videos in smokers who were successfully treated with Bupropion to smokers who are still smoking. We measured the brain's metabolic activity after exposure to videotapes showing smoking and neutral scenes in Positron Emission Tomography using FDG. There were 2 scanning sessions, one with a smoking videotape and one with a neutral video separated by a week. So far we have compared the brain's metabolic activity in 6 abstinent smokers and 6 still smokers.</detailed_description>
