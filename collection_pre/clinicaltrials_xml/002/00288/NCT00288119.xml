	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center study whose aim is to define the epidemiology and genetics of Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma. The researchers have studied families affected with Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, a specific type of cancer of the esophagus. They have found that Barrett's and esophageal cancer occur at a younger age in these families suggesting that familial Barrett's esophagus is a genetically inherited disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Familial Barrett's Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is trying to determine whether Barrett's esophagus and associated esophageal cancers, specifically esophageal adenocarcinoma are inherited in certain families. Persons who are affected with Barrett's esophagus or esophageal cancer (adenocarcinoma type) are asked to complete a questionnaire that determines their habits and asks a detailed family history. Family members of patients seen at University Hospitals of Cleveland and the Cleveland Clinic are also being recruited for screening tests of their esophagus. The investigators plan to eventually screen family members at all participating institutions. This research will eventually lead to the identification of inherited genetic changes that cause Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer. It will help the investigators develop better methods for preventing or identifying esophageal cancer at an early curable stage.</detailed_description>
