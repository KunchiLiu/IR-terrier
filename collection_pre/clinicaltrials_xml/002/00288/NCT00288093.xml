	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of 3-AP when given together with radiation therapy in treating patients with stage III pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. 3-AP may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. 3-AP may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving 3-AP together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3-AP and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III Pancreatic Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximal tolerable dose (MTD) of 3-AP administered in combination with radiation therapy (XRT) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinomas. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To document the therapeutic response of this combination in patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinomas. II. To establish radiographic correlates using secretin stimulated magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). III. To measure deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)before and after treatment at specified times and try to correlate findings to activity and toxicity of triapine. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 3-AP (Triapine®). Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for approximately 5½ weeks (a total of 28 fractions). Patients also receive 3-AP (Triapine®) IV over 2 hours 3 days a week every other week for 5½ weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 3-AP (Triapine®) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 1 year.</detailed_description>
