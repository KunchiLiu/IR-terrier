	<detailed_description>Accomplishment of the specific aim will be determined by a two group randomized effectiveness study (Treatment vs. Comparison) utilizing 24 RI worksites with randomization by site. The specific impact and outcome evaluation measures (BMI, DHQ-FFQ, and 7-day PAR) will be collected at Baseline, 12, and 24 months on a longitudinal cohort selected at random from the employee lists of each participating worksite. Extensive process evaluation and a mediating variable framework are also included to identify the mechanisms in successful change at both the worksite and individual level, which will maximize the potential for dissemination and generalization of the intervention as well as advance theory and improve intervention practice and policy. Primary outcome measure will be weight (BMI).</detailed_description>
