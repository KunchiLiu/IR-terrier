	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to compare the time, risk and cost savings of 2 patient groups who receive FDA approved left ventricular pacing leads.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Registry of Epicardial LV Leads Placed During Cardiac Surgery Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to: a) examine the usefulness of placing an epicardial LV lead at the time of open chest surgery in patients who are likely to benefit from a CRT system following their surgery; b) compare differences between patients who receive LV leads using the transvenous approach and those patients who receive LV leads using the epicardial approach; and c) assess the cost effectiveness of placing the LV lead via the transvenous versus the epicardial approaches.</detailed_description>
