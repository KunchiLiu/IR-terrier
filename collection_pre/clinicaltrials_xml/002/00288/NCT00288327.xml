	<detailed_description>We conducted a 2 year study to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a CVD risk reduction intervention program for older, under or uninsured women. We used an existing nutrition and physical activity (PA) intervention tool (New Leafâ€¦Choices for Healthy Living) designed specifically for this demographic group as part of the WISEWOMAN program (A CDC-funded CVD risk factor screening and intervention program for older, low-income women). We enhanced this already tested intervention to include: 1) the latest recommendations regarding dietary fat and carbohydrate intake, 2) group education sessions and follow-up telephone contacts from lay health advisors (LHAs); and 3) a community resource linkage component delivered primarily by LHAs. We tested the enhanced intervention in a randomized controlled trial in a community health center setting. A total of 240 women aged 40-64 were randomized to the enhanced New Leaf intervention or minimum intervention groups. Women in the enhanced New Leaf group received a 6 month intensive intervention consisting of 2 individual counseling sessions at the CHC, postcard mailings, 3 group sessions, and lay health advisor (LHA) guided linkages to community resources for diet and PA. This was followed by a 6 month maintenance period led by the LHA and including 6 phone contacts, and 3 tailored mailings along with continued community resource linkages. Primary outcome measures at 6 and 12 months included 1) PA measured by CSA accelerometer and 2) fruit, vegetable, and fat intake. Secondary outcomes included biomarkers of dietary intake (red blood cell membrane fatty acids, carotenoids), CVD risk factors (total and HDL cholesterol, blood pressure), and psychosocial variables.</detailed_description>
