	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of Ultrafiltration to influence the rate of hemodynamic improvement, as measured by the decline in the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, in patients with NYHA class III/IV Heart Failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extracorporeal Ultrafiltration (UF) vs. Usual and Customary Care for Patients With Severe Heart Failure (HF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be preformed in a specialized heart failure unit at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) and will include both the UF-treated group and a control group receiving usual and customary care. Patients will be stratified according to renal function at the time of admission. Therapies will be guided by specific hemodynamic criteria routinely used at the study institution.</detailed_description>
