	<brief_summary>Ranibizumab is derived from a murine monoclonal anti- vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody and can penetrate through the many retinal cell layers following intravitreal injection. The present study is directed towards the assessment of ranibizumab administered on the same day in combination with verteporfin in patients with subfoveal CNV secondary to ARMD</brief_summary>
