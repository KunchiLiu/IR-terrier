	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn what changes in blood vessel contraction may occur as a result of a disease of the vessel that requires surgery. The study will examine the calcium channels present in the vessels being operated on, and the genes that may alter blood vessel function. Possible variation in these genes may change the kind of calcium channels present in blood vessels.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to learn more about how blood vessels function and the mechanism that causes them to contract. The study will investigate the natural history of diseased blood vessel tissue and the calcium channels in the muscle part of the blood vessel. The study will also examine how genetics influences cardiovascular disease and its causes and treatments. Patients scheduled for vascular surgery will be approached to participate in this study. During surgery, tissue fragments of diseased and marginal tissue will be obtained. A blood sample will be obtained at either the time of surgery or consent and genomic DNA will be extracted.</detailed_description>
