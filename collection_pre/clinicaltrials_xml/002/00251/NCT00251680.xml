	<brief_title>Efficacy of Lapaquistat Acetate in Subjects Currently Treated With Lipid-Lowering Therapy.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus is a recognized cause of secondary dyslipidemia, and is also independently considered to be a major cardiovascular risk factor requiring aggressive lipid-lowering treatment. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 85% to 90% of diabetes worldwide. It affects about 2% of the Caucasian population in most Westernized countries, and the prevalence rises with age to 10% in those over 70 years of age. Five percent or more of young- and middle-aged adults in some Asian or Afro-Caribbean groups in the United Kingdom have this condition. Approximately 12 million Americans have type 2 diabetes, and an estimated 20 million more have some degree of glucose intolerance. The greatest cause of mortality in type 2 diabetes is atherosclerotic vascular disease and its sequelae between 75% and 80% of adult subjects with diabetes die of macrovascular complications. Lapaquistat acetate is a squalene synthase inhibitor currently under development at Takeda for the treatment of dyslipidemia. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of lapaquistat acetate co-administered with an established lipid-lowering therapy including atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, or fenofibrate in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</detailed_description>
