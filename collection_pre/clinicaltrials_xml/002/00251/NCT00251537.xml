	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to assess the safety and antiretroviral activity of a naturally occuring substance known as Leukotriene B4(LTB4). The aim of the study is to determine the effect of LTB4 on viral load during a period of 6 weeks, 4 weeks of active treatment and 2 additional weeks after the end of active treatment for safety follow-up. 40 patients in seven clinics in Canada will be randomized into three treatment arms, either of two doses of LTB4 or placebo. Study drug is administered intravenously once daily. LTB4 can activate and stimulate various white blood cells and by the activation release natural substances in the body and this process is an important part of the body's defense against infections.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of LTB4 in HIV-1 Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this pilot study is to investigate whether LTB4, administered at a dose that provides an increase in alfa-defensin release from neutrophils, can affect HIV viral load in HIV-1 infected individuals. The safety, tolerability and effect will be assessed of 28 days of daily intravenous dosing of LTB4 on HIV viral load. Safety and tolerability will also be assessed. The study is randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled. All subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three treamtent groups, LTB4 at two different dose levels or corresponding placebo. Treatment duration is 4 weeks and follow-up period is 2 weeks. Subjects will visit the clinic on a daily basis during the treatment period to receive a daily intravenous injection of the study drug. 40 subjects will be enrolled, seven clinics in Canada will participate in the study. Primary endpoint: Change in viral load over the treatment period of 28 days. Secondary endpoint: CD4, CD8 and neutrophil counts, alfa-defensins and CC-che, mokine release in blood.</detailed_description>
