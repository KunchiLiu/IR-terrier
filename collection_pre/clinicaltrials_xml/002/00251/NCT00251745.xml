	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Dexlansoprazole Modified Release Formulation to Treat Heartburn</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, 3-arm study with a 4 week treatment period. This study will compare the efficacy of daily Dexlansoprazole MR (60 mg and 90 mg) with that of placebo when administered orally as a single daily dose in the morning, before breakfast. The study is designed to evaluate symptom relief in subjects with symptomatic non-erosive GERD. Approximately 450 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 120 U.S. and potentially ex U.S. sites. The study consists of two periods; a screening period, which will last a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 21 days, and a treatment period, which will last 4 weeks. Because the development plan for Dexlansoprazole MR was revised, the results of 2 identical studies, T-GD04-082 (this posting, NCT00241745) and T-GD04-083 (NCT00251758), were combined and analyzed as a single larger study referred to as study T-GD04-082. A total of 908 subjects were included in the combined analysis; 416 subjects were enrolled into Study T-GD04-082 and 492 subjects were enrolled into Study T-GD04-083.</detailed_description>
