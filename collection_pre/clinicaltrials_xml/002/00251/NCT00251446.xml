	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, single-arm study in patients with stage IIIB (with malignant pleural effusion) and IV NSCLC who have been previously treated with a platinum-based doublet. Each cycle will be 21 days. On Day 1 of each cycle, patients will receive vinflunine 320 mg/m2 as a 20-minute IV infusion. Patients will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be evaluated every 2 cycles for response using RECIST criteria.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>To be eligible for the study, patients must fulfill all of the following criteria: Patients must have signed an IRBapproved informed consent. Patients must have recurrent or metastatic stage IIIB (with malignant pleural effusion) and IV NSCLC that has progressed after receiving a platinumbased doublet as firstline therapy. Patients must have measurable disease, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Previously irradiated lesions will not be allowed as measurable disease. Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2. Patients must be &lt;18 years of age. Previous chemotherapy must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients must either be not of child bearing potential or have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration. Patients are considered not of child bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal for at least 12 months. Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraceptive measures during study treatment and for a reasonable time thereafter. Patients must have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1500/uL, platelet count &gt;100,000/uL, and hemoglobin &gt;8 g/dL. Patients must have a serum creatinine &lt;2 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN). Patients must have a total bilirubin &lt;2.5 x ULN and aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt;5.0 x ULN. Any of the following criteria will make the patient ineligible to participate in this study: Patients previously treated with vinflunine or another vinca alkaloid. Patients with untreated and clinically unstable brain metastases. Significant history of uncontrolled cardiac disease; i.e., uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction (within prior 6 months), uncontrolled congestive heart failure, and cardiomyopathy with decreased ejection fraction. Patients with a serious uncontrolled intercurrent medical or psychiatric illness, including serious infection. Patient has a coexisting malignancy or had a malignancy diagnosed within the last 3 years, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ. Patient received treatment with a nonapproved or investigational drug within 30 days before planned start of study treatment. Patient is not completely healed from a previous oncologic or other major surgery. Patient is receiving or planning to receive any concurrent chemotherapy not indicated in the study protocol or an investigational agent during the study period. Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to vinflunine or any of the components in vinflunine or another vinca alkaloid. Any patient who is pregnant or lactating. Any patient who is unable to comply with requirements of study.</criteria>
