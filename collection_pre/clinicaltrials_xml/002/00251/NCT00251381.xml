	<brief_title>Cetuximab &amp; Concomitant-Boost Accelerated RT in Patients With Locally Advanced Oropharynx Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- To determine the 1-year rate of locoregional disease control in the experimental arm, using a control arm to avoid selection bias. - To determine the 2 and 3 year rate of locoregional disease control. - To evaluate the safety and toxicity of the combination of cetuximab and concomitant-boost accelerated radiotherapy followed by 12 weeks of complementary treatment with cetuximab. Both acute and chronic toxicity will be assessed. - To determine specific disease-free survival, event-free survival, disease-specific survival and overall survival - To determine acute and late toxicity - To determine EGFR, p53, Ki67, and evaluate its value as a prognostic factor.</detailed_description>
