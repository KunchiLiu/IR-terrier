	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether around-the-clock dosing of pain medication, with or without nurse coaching, increases the effectiveness of pain management (i.e., decreased pain intensity scores with and without swallowing, increased use of pain medication, improved sleep, increased oral intake of fluids, decreased negative behaviors, and the same degree of side effects), over time, compared to standard care with "as needed" dosing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Home Care Management of Pediatric Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The undertreatment of postoperative pain in children remains a critical problem. Only recently have clinical trials begun to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacologic interventions in the management of postoperative pain beyond the immediate postoperative recovery period and after discharge home following tonsillectomy. Given the fact that approximately 50% of pediatric surgeries are done on an outpatient basis, this study has the potential to improve the home pain management of thousands of children. This study is one of the first to evaluate in a systematic fashion the use of an around-the-clock dosing of a weight appropriate dose of a nonopioid/opioid combination analgesic compared to as needed dosing. Because the study will evaluate the effectiveness of both a behavioral intervention and two different pharmacologic interventions, it will provide important information that should have a direct clinical application in the management of children's pain. The consent form is written according to the standards outlined by the Committee on Human Research, including: 1) an explanation of the purposes of the research and the expected duration of the subject's participation; 2) a description of the procedures to be followed; 3) a description of any foreseeable risks or benefits to the subject, and any alternative courses of treatment; 4) a statement describing the extent to which confidentiality of records will be maintained; 5) a statement whether compensation will be provided and medical treatment made available if injury occurs; 6) the name and number of the Chair of the Committee on Human Research; 7) a statement that participation is voluntary, and that the subject may discontinue participation at any time; and 8) a statement indicating that the subject has received a copy of the consent document and related materials. A separate form is signed to authorize access to their health care information.</detailed_description>
