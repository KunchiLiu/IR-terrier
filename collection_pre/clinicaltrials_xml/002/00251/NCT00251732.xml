	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the role of pain modulation in GERD patients who fail to obtain clinical relief with standard dose (once daily) PPI. The study will compare the efficacy of 1) standard dose PPI plus low-dose tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) to, 2) double dose PPI to, 3) standard dose PPI and placebo to determine the relative symptom resolution and health related quality of life in GERD patients who fail standard dose PPI and are randomly assigned to one of these three groups.</brief_summary>
