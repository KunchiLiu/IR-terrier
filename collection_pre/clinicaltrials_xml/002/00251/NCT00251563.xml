	<brief_summary>Environmental and genetic factors may play a role in the progression of cancer. The goal of this project is to establish a series of cross-sectional / case-control studies to evaluate risk factors of cancer in China.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidemiologic, Laboratory, and Clinical Characterization of Individuals With Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to investigate the epidemiologic, genetic, laboratory and clinical characterization of individuals with cancer (gastric, colorectal, esophageal, liver, prostate, lung, breast and endometrial cancer, etc.). We will accrue approximately 1600 patients as experimental group. The control group consists of subjects who will be confirmed without cancer. We will explore the environmental (including family history, life style, diet, physical activity, neuropsychological functioningï¼Œplasma levels of oxidative stress factors, angiogenic factors, and tumor markers, etc.) and genetic (including oxidative stress factors and angiogenic factors, etc.) risk factors. We will study the association between various environmental risk factors with the clinical characterization and correlation between the genetic polymorphisms and the presence of various cancer.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>This is a study only of Chinese. Subjects will be allowed to participate if they selfidentify as Chinese. The age range of the participants will be between 18 and 89 years. Individuals with cancer (gastric, colorectal, esophageal, liver, prostate, lung, breast and endometrial cancer, etc.) will be allowed to participate. To participate in the study as the control, subjects should be confirmed without cancer.</criteria>
