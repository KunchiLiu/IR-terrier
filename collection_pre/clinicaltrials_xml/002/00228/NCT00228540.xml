The patient is a boy or girl 6 through 17 years of age (inclusive) at the screening visit, and both the patient and parent/legal guardian are Englishspeaking.

The patient's parent/legal guardian must be willing and able to comply with study procedures and restrictions. Patients are excluded from participating in this study if 1 or more of the following criteria are met: The patient has any current psychiatric comorbidity, including but not limited to depression or other mood disorder, or pervasive mental disorder, that requires pharmacotherapy. The patient is satisfied with current ADHD medication and has no side effects. The patient is using other prescription medications for ADHD with psychoactive properties (eg, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, pemoline, atomoxetine) after the baseline visit. The patient has used monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors within 1 week before the baseline visit. The patient has used an investigational drug within 1 month before the screening visit. The patient has a known clinically significant drug sensitivity to modafinil or any of its inactive ingredients. The patient is pregnant or lactating.
