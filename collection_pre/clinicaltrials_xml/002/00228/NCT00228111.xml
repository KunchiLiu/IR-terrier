	<brief_title>TRACT Study: Evaluation of the Value of Routine Thoraco-abdominal CT in Blunt Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The technological advances in computed tomography (CT), with faster image acquisition resulting in higher resolution, result in making CT a more widely and intensively used imaging modality in trauma patient care. Thoraco-abdominal CT in addition appears to have additional diagnostic value compared to conventional radiography, especially in severely injured trauma patients. Nowadays, both clinical data and conventional radiology are used to determine which patient should undergo body CT scanning. Currently there are no widely accepted guidelines for the use of a "standard" TRAuma CT (TRACT). Although many retrospective and several prospective cohort studies have been published on this topic, the data are not sufficient to sustain evidence-based practice in decision-making. The aim of this study is, to establish the additional effectiveness and costs of routine thoraco-abdominal CT in blunt trauma patients versus conventional radiological imaging and to determine which clinical parameters predict a high additional value of routine thoraco-abdominal CT. Consecutive trauma patients, who are at least 16 years old and are suffering from severe injuries, undergo a standard trauma CT of the cervical spine, the thorax and abdomen after clinical evaluation and conventional radiological workup. Clinical, conventional and computed tomographic radiological assessment, costs, therapeutic consequences and 6 months patient follow up are recorded and will be statistically analyzed.</detailed_description>
