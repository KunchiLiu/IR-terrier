	<brief_summary>Ph.D project: Periapical bone healing after apicectomy with and without retrograde root filling. The aim of this study is to assess periapical bone healing after apicectomy without a filling and apicectomy combined with a retrograde filling material, MTA. Further, we will estimate risk factors in non-healing cases. Study hypothesis: There is no difference in treatment outcome between: Periapical bone healing after apicectomy with retrograde root filling and Periapical bone healing after apicectomy without retrograde root filling</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ph.D project: Periapical bone healing after apicectomy with and without retrograde root filling. 60 patients have been selected from a group of 490 patients, who had a full mouth radiographic status taken in connection with a population study of apical periodontitis in Aarhus Community. The selection criteria for the 60 patients were patients with a persisting apical periodontitis, Periapical Index (PAI) score 3-5, on front teeth and premolars in the upper jaw. The orthograde root filling in the tooth must be at least 2 years old and sufficient regarding density and length. The 60 patients will be randomised into the two groups of apicectomy with and without filling. A radiograph will be taken just before the operation and 6 and 12 months after the operation. In the assessment of bone healing, we will use two different techniques, subtraction radiography and the Periapical Index (PAI). We will also evaluate the benefits of using the operation microscope during the operation, and if clinical photos can be useful as documentation of treatment result.</detailed_description>
