	<brief_summary>CNS reorganization is evidenced in patients with CNS lesion, no exception to the patients with spinal cord injury. The paraplegics have to increase their loading of upper extremities to compesate the lost function of lower extremities. We hypothesize that CNS reorganization can happen in the chronic paraplegics. We try to compare the changes of parameters of transcranial magnetic stimulation in these patients with the normal population cross-sectionally.</brief_summary>
