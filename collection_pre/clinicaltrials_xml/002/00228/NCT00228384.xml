Quality of life questionnaires completed. Noninvasive lower extremity arterial studies within 45days prior to study procedure. If applicable, staged ipsilateral vascular procedure ≥ 14days prior to study procedure. If applicable, vascular treatment on nonstudy leg for bilateral claudication ≥ 14days prior to study procedure. Male, infertile female, or female of child bearing potential practicing an acceptable method of birth control with a negative pregnancy test. Projected life expectancy of greater than three years. The ability to comply with protocol. Angiographic and Lesion Requirements meets protocol criteria. Untreated flowlimiting aortoiliac occlusive disease. Any previous stenting or surgery in the target vessel. Subjects with arterial lesions requiring treatment with device diameters other than 6, 7, or 8 mm. Severe ipsilateral common femoral/profunda disease requiring surgical intervention. Femoral or popliteal aneurysm. Nonatherosclerotic disease resulting in occlusion. Tibial artery disease requiring treatment. Prior ipsilateral femoral artery bypass. Severe medical comorbidities. Popliteal artery vascular access at any time during procedure. Antegrade and retrograde vascular access on the same common femoral artery at the time of the SFA intervention. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL within 45 days prior to study procedure. Major distal amputation. Septicemia. Any previously known coagulation disorder. Morbid obesity or operative scarring that precludes percutaneous approach (physician's discretion). Contraindication to anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. Known allergies to stent/stentgraft components. History of prior lifethreatening reaction to contrast agent. Currently participating in another clinical research trial. Current peritoneal or hemodialysis.</criteria>
