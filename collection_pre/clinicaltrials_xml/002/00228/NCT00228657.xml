	<brief_summary>Patients resuscitated with 4% Albumin will have less incidence and reduced severity of pressure injuries than patients resuscitated with 0.9% Sodium Chloride due to the improved intravascular oncotic pressure effected from higher albumin levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Formation and Severity of Pressure Ulcers Associated With 4% Albumin vs. 0.9% Sodium Chloride</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pressure ulcers incur multiple risks to the patient. The disruption of the skin is a portal of entry for infection , which may remain localised to the site or become blood borne. A pressure ulcer can lead to protein and fluid losses from the wound exudate. Many authors have theorised the existence of a relationship between the development of pressure ulcers and low serum albumin levels however, there is no strong evidence to prove this correlation. The literature does demonstrate a clear relationship between people with existing pressure ulcers and the presence of low serum albumins. Specifically serum albumin levels &lt;30mg/dl have been associated with the incidence of pressure ulcer development.</detailed_description>
