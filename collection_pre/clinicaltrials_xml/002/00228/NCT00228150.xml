	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to assess the effect of SR57667B at the dose of 4 mg/d on the progression of Parkinson symptoms in patients with early PD. The primary outcome will be the time to progression of disability warranting initiation of L-dopa or a dopamine agonist. Secondary outcomes will comprise assessments of symptoms, activities of daily living and global clinical status.</brief_summary>
