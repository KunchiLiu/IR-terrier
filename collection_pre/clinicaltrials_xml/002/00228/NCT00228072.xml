	<brief_title>Liposuction as Treatment for Excessive Axillary Sweat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The surgical standard treatment for isolated excessive axillary sweating is excision of the hair-bearing area of the axilla. This technique is associated with a risk of impaired wound healing, infections, wide scars and a risk of impairment in the movement of the arm (seldom). A new technique suction-curettage, much alike the liposuction technique, in which the dermis is curettage from a sub-dermal approach with a cutting and sucking devise, may be promising in regard to recovery and cosmetic appearance postoperatively, but the effect of the sweat production is not well known. This study compares liposuction vs. standard excision in individuals with isolated excessive isolated axillary sweating randomized to treatment with one of each technique in both axillas.</detailed_description>
