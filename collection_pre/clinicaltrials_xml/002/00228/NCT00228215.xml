	<brief_title>Tips for Infant and Parent Sleep (TIPS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infant and maternal sleep in the postpartum are related, and influenced by the mother's understanding of infant sleep behavior, the environmental and social cues for sleep presented to the infant, development of the infant's sleep physiology, maternal sleep habits and behaviors, and maternal feelings related to her sleep and her baby's sleep. These factors may be modifiable through the use of behavioral-educational interventions. A randomized controlled trial design will be used to answer whether a behavioral-educational sleep intervention and support from a nurse in the immediate postpartum improves maternal and infant sleep 6 weeks later. Sleep-wake patterns will be analyzed through the use of actigraphy, a wristwatch-like device that measures sleep-wake activity. This is a pilot study which will test the usefulness and practicality of this type of program, so that a larger scale study can be developed.</detailed_description>
