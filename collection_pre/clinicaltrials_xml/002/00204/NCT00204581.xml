	<brief_summary>The intra-/perilesional application of interleukin-2 seems to be a safe and effective treatment of skin and soft tissue metastases in malignant melanoma. Especially in case of intransit metastases the overall survival rate is still 20-30%. However, the management of intransit metastases is sometimes difficult because of frequent recurrences. IL-2 intralesionally seems to be an non-invasive option as pilot studies indicate. In this study the safety and efficacy of IL-2 are evaluated.</brief_summary>
