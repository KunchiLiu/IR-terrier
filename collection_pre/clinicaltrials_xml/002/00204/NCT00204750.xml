	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of bougie dilation to electrosurgical incision of symptomatic schatzki's rings at one year follow-up in the presence of rabeprazole treatment. All patients will be followed for one year for recurrence and/or severity of dysphagia and will be placed on rabeprazole for that time period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Electrosurgical Incision Versus Bougie Dilation of Symptomatic Lower Esophageal (Schatzki's) Rings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty consecutive patients referred for endoscopic evaluation at endoscopy labs at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center and the Salt Lake City VA Medical Center for dysphagia will be enrolled in the study prior to endoscopy. If a Schatzki's Ring is found at endoscopy, the patient will be randomized to electrosurgical incision or standard bougie dilation. Patients will be placed on rabeprazole for one year. Follow-up on recurrence and/or severity of dysphagia will be analyzed at interim time periods (1,3,6, 9 12 months).</detailed_description>
