	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant treatment with pegylated interferon-α-2a (PEG-IFN) vs. 'low dose' interferon-α-2a in patients with malignant melanoma in stage IIA (T3a) - IIIB. A total of 880 will be randomized up to three months after first surgical management of their melanoma to either: PEG-IFN-α-2a or low-dose interferon-α-2a.</brief_summary>
