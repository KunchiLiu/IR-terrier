	<brief_summary>The conceptual framework underlying the TEACH Research Program is based on a specific theoretical approach designed to influence adolescent career choice, in this case towards a career in clinical research. The factors responsible for influencing career choice that form the foundation for our investigation are: 1) the importance of role models in career choice; 2) acquisition of knowledge in order to align ambitions; and 3) the participation of students in activities that actively challenge and engage them. These three factors are addressed by the following three components of the TEACH Research Intervention: 1) participation in a research team consisting of a multi-tiered structure of mentors; 2) classroom instruction of clinical research knowledge and career strategies; and 3) a hands-on clinical research experience through an internship on the Hospitalist Project. The evaluation of TEACH Research (Teaching Early Achievers for Careers in Health) aims to rigorously evaluate a precollege enrichment program in clinical research targeting high school students particularly underrepresented minorities, in order to increase the entry and success of these students into careers in clinical research. Through these measures, the TEACH Research Program will educate high achieving minority students and in turn hopefully encourage and promote these students to think about a career in clinical research.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This projects aims to rigorously evaluate a precollege enrichment program in clinical research targeting high school students, and particularly underrepresented minorities, in order to increase the entry and success of these students into careers in clinical research. Through the components listed in the brief summary, we hope to promote a career in clinical research among high achieving minority students. To determine whether TEACH research generates these benefits, we will recruit a larger number of candidates interested in the TEACH research than we have spots, then randomly assign students to TEACH Research or the standard more didactic enrichment programs already included in the Collegiate Scholars Program. In addition to determine the overall efficacy of the program, we will study how aspects of the program, including the didactic components, mentored research experience, and work experience, and characteristics of the student affect the development of the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors needed for a career in clinical research.</detailed_description>
