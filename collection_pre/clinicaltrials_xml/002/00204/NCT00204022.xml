	<brief_title>Mycophenolate Mofetil Versus Azathioprine for Maintenance Therapy of Lupus Nephritis.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proliferative glomerulonephritis is a common and severe manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that usually requires intensive therapy with high doses of glucocorticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs, such as intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide (CYC). The objective of the MAINTAIN Nephritis Trial is to compare mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and azathioprine (AZA), in terms of efficacy and toxicity, as remission-maintaining treatment of proliferative lupus glomerulonephritis, after a remission-inducing therapy with a short-course IV CYC regimen. The hypothesis addressed by the MAINTAIN Nephritis Trial is that MMF is superior to AZA.</detailed_description>
