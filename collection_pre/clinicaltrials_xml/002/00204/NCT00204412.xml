	<brief_title>Exercise and Flax-Based Nutritional Supplementation for Lowering Cholesterol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Flax supplementation and exercise training each have small beneficial effects for improving blood lipid profile and reducing cardiovascular disease risk. Flax lignan, a phytoestrogen found in flaxseed is thought to be the active compound responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effect of flaxseed. Our purpose is to combine an exercise training program (walking) with flax lignan supplementation for improving blood lipid profile. Comparisons: Walking (6 days per week) plus flax lignan (500 mg per day) compared to walking plus placebo.</detailed_description>
