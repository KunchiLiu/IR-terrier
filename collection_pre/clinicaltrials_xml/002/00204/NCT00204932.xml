	<brief_summary>Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is form of fat found in dairy foods, beef and other natural sources. When given to small animals, decreases of body fat have been noted.. Although weight loss is the best treatment for overweight and obesity, it is difficult to maintain the loss in the long term. Because of this, treatment emphasis has turned to small weight losses obtained through non-restrictive diets and prevention of weight regain. This is a study to determine if 6 months of consumption a purified form of CLA will result in greater loss of body fat than control and to determine whether CLA consumption increases total fat oxidation, which would help explain why the weight loss occurs.</brief_summary>
