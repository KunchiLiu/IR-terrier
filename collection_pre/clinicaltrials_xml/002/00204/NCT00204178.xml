	<brief_title>The Role of Reactive Oxygen Species in Ischaemia-Reperfusion Injury of the Transplanted Kidney</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oxidative stress is one of the most important factors in ischaemia-reperfusion injury to the transplanted organ. In kidney transplant recipients following factors were measured: glutathione level, activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and superoxide anion production by granulocytes in whole blood without and after the stimulation with zymosan. Blood was sampled from peripheral vein (before reperfusion) and directly from renal vein (5 and 15 minutes after reperfusion). Transplanted kidney function was evaluated by the incidence and length of Delayed Graft Function and serum creatinine level in 2 and 6 weeks after transplantation.</detailed_description>
