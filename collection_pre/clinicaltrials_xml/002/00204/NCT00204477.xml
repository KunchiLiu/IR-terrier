	<brief_summary>Soy consumption has been associated with reduced risk for developing breast cancer. Ovarian hormones and breast density are considered breast cancer risk markers. We propose to test the hypothesis that consumption of soy protein reduces ovarian steroid hormones and results in a corresponding reduction in breast density.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Soy Protein and Breast Cancer Risk Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aims will be tested by conducting a randomized, double-blind study, with two arms and 100 women in each arm. Premenopausal women will be recruited and randomly allocated to take one of two different dietary supplements daily for 2 years. The two test diets soy protein drink and caseinate protein drink. Multiple blood, urine, and breast fluid samples will be obtained before and during the dietary intervention period and analyzed for ovarian hormones. At baseline and after the intervention period, breast density will be assessed by radiological techniques. The efficacy of the dietary intervention will be determined by comparing mean changes of ovarian steroids and dense breast tissue over the 2 year dietary intervention period in the two diet groups with adjustment for baseline values and individual patient characteristics of interest. We predict that 2 years of soya dietary supplements will reduce breast density, which will be explained by individual hormonal changes.</detailed_description>
