	<brief_summary>The study will provide an empirical basis for a pharmacological treatment option. An open-label, randomized, multi-centre parallel group design is used. An intensified clinical management (CM), which allows needs-based psychological crisis intervention, is compared to a combination of such a CM and the atypical neuroleptic amisulpride. The central hypothesis is that the combination of a clinical management with an atypical neuroleptic is the superior treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Pharmacological and Psychological Intervention for Late Prodromal States of Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first diagnosis of schizophrenia is preceded by a long lasting period comprising an untreated psychotic and a prodromal state. The duration of untreated psychosis correlates with a significant worsening of several outcome variables and persons fulfilling criteria of a prodromal state are already suffering from prodromal symptoms and from a significant deterioration of social and vocational functioning. However, a sufficient strategy for early intervention is still lacking. The study will provide an empirical basis for a pharmacological treatment option. An open-label, randomized, multi-centre parallel group design is used. An intensified clinical management (CM), which allows needs-based psychological crisis intervention, is compared to a combination of such a CM and the atypical neuroleptic amisulpride. For analysis 130 patients will be recruited within three years, the treatment period is two years.</detailed_description>
