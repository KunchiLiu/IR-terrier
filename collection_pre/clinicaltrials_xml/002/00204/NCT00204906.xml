We hypothesized that part of this neglect is due to absence of data documenting safe and effective ways to replete this inadequacy. Subjects with low vitamin D concentrations are dosed with 50.000 IU three times a week for 25 hydroxy vitamin D, parathyroid hormone and bone turnover status. .</detailed_description>
