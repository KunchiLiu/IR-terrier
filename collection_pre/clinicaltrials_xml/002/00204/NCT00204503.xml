	<brief_title>Open-Label Depakote ER in Patients With Bipolar I or II Depression and Alcohol Abuse or Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over half of all patients with bipolar disorder have comorbid substance abuse. The most common substance of abuse is alcohol, which is most commonly associated with the depressed phase of the illness. Although there are available treatments for bipolar depression, no studies have been done to evaluate efficacy in bipolar patients with comorbid substance abuse disorders. Given the independent open-label evidence for efficacy and safety of divalproex sodium in alcohol abuse and bipolar depression, divalproex sodium is the most likely candidate for potential success in bipolar depressed patients with comorbid alcohol abuse or dependence. The purpose of this study is to determine if Divalproex Sodium can be used to Treat and Prevent Depression in Patients with Bipolar Disorder who have Comorbid Alcohol Dependence/Abuse.</detailed_description>
