	<brief_title>Pediatric Epilepsy Database</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At some point this information may be used to retrospectively review trends in seizure types, diagnostic evaluation and treatment (medical or surgical). The potential data recorded will be that of standard of care provided to these patients, including age, gender, seizure type/classification, diagnostic procedures (eg. EEG, MRI Magnetoencephalography {MEG}, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography {SPECT}, Positron Emission Tomography {PET}, invasive electrocorticography) and various treatments (medications, diet, or neurosurgical interventions for the treatment of epilepsy). Records in the database will have identifiable information (name, date of birth, date of procedure, medical record number), but these identifying data will be removed, and only nonidentifying data will be used in the event of research completed using information from this clinical database.</detailed_description>
