	<brief_title>Vaccination With Tumor mRNA in Metastatic Melanoma - Fixed Combination Versus Individual Selection of Targeted Antigens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>vaccination protocol to induce clinically specific immune responses against melanoma associated antigens by intradermal injections of mRNA coding for the corresponding antigens. Half of patients is treated with mRNA coding for Melan-A, Mage-A1, Mage-A3, Survivin, GP100 and Tyrosinase. The other half of patients is treated with an individualized selection of mRNAs after analysis of overexpressed melanoma antigens in autologous tumor tissue. GM-CSF is used as an adjuvants. Phase I/II clinical trial to analyse safety and immune responses in stage III/IV melanoma patients.</detailed_description>
