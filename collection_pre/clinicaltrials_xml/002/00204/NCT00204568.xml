	<brief_summary>The goal of this trial is to determine whether oral continuous (metronomic) therapy with trofosfamide results in a similar rate of progression-free time after 6 months as intravenous treatment with adriamycin. In addition, the study is intended to investigate the level of toxicity associated with the two treatment regimens (safety profile).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Group A:Adriamycin (60 mg/m2, d1, qd22) 75 mg/m2 may be applied instead of 60 mg/m2 for patients between 60 and 70 years of age (optional) Group B:Trofosfamide (300 mg absolute p.o. qd over 7 days, then 150 mg p.o. absolute qd continuously) In case of absence of any toxicity during treatment with trofosfamide 150 mg absolute a dose escalation to 200 mg absolute is allowed (optional)</detailed_description>
