	<brief_summary>Complete resection is still the only curative treatment option in patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Patients with a non-resectable STS have a dismal prognosis even without evidence of metastatic disease. The aim of this trial is to determine whether neoadjuvant dose-intensive chemo-radiotherapy is a feasible and effective approach in patients with non-resectable STS.</brief_summary>
