	<brief_title>Virtual Colonoscopy (VC) for Primary Colorectal Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to use virtual colonoscopy screening to learn more about what happens to small colon polyps (less than 10 mm) over time. From this, we can find out whether it's safer to remove all colon polyps right away or leave the small ones in place and remove only those that grow to 10 mm or more.</detailed_description>
