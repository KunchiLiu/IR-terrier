	<brief_title>Comparison of the Two Immunosuppressive Regimens Based on Tacrolimus and Cyclosporine Following Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite several multicenter studies, there is no hard evidence on the superiority of a cyclosporine or tacrolimus based immunosuppressive regimen following kidney transplantation, in a single-center setting. Existing studies concentrated on benefits in safety and efficacy, but seldomly evaluated the cost-effectiveness of one treatment. The study has been designed in a fashion as close to the daily clinical practice as possible. Patients are randomized in pairs, receiving kidneys from the same donor, thus avoiding donor-related bias. Those having specific indications or contraindications for one of the study medications were not entered into the study. All other study-related decisions are made only on a clinical basis and according to the standard practice of the center. Patients are followed on the intention-to-treat rule. Cost-effectiveness will be calculated on 12-month treatment for each patient entered into the study.</detailed_description>
