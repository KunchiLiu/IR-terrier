	<brief_title>Vitamin D Administration in the Nursing Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Research questions: We propose a prospective double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of once-monthly vitamin D oral capsules (50,000 units) in nursing-home residents. Subjects from several Wisconsin nursing homes were randomized to receive once-monthly vitamin D oral capsules (50,000 units) or placebo. Blood levels of 25-OH D, parathyroid hormone, serum calcium, and a marker of bone turnover will be measured periodically by standard lab assays. Swallowing quality of life was measured by questionnaire. Appropriate statistical tests (paired T tests, 95% confidence intervals will be calculated with the large sample approximation for binomial variables, other).</detailed_description>
