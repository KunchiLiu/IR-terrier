	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of combining exercise training (i.e. weight lifting and walking) and dietary supplementation with a soy-based nutritional supplement for increasing bone mineral density. We hypothesize that the exercise training and soy-based supplement will be additive for increasing bone mineral density.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Exercise Training and Soy-based Nutritional Supplementation on Prevention of Osteoporosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise training is effective for increasing bone mineral density and preventing osteoporosis, but the effects are small. When estrogen replacement is given to post-menopausal women the effectiveness of exercise training for improving bone mineral density is increased. Currently many women are concerned about the risks of taking hormone-replacement therapy and are seeking alternative therapies. The purpose of our study therefore is to use an estrogen-like dietary supplement derived from soy called a phytoestrogen (soy isoflavone) combined with exercise training for improving bone mineral density. Comparisons: Four groups are being compared: 1) Exercise training (i.e. weight lifting 2 times per week and walking 4 times per week) plus soy isoflavone (90 mg aglycone equivalents per day); 2) Exercise training plus placebo; 3) Exercise placebo (flexibility exercises four times per week) plus soy isoflavone; 4) Exercise placebo plus placebo.</detailed_description>
