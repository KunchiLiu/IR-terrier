	<brief_summary>This trial will provide long-term data on safety, satisfaction and maintenance on therapy of fesoterodine (SPM 907) in subjects with overactive bladder syndrome. Subjects completing the 12 week treatment period of SP584 had the opportunity to participate if eligibility was confirmed. They received fesoterodine 8mg with the option to reduce the dose to 4mg during scheduled visits, and to increase again to 8mg, a procedure which can be followed on an annual basis. The primary variables are long-term safety and tolerability, measured by observation and assessment of adverse events and duration on therapy. Further safety variables include the assessment of laboratory parameters, changes in ECG, physical exams and measurement of residual urine. Secondary efficacy variables included various parameters derived from micturition diaries and the evaluation of Quality of Life questionnaires</brief_summary>
