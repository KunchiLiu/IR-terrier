	<brief_summary>The aim of this study conducted in patients with high risk ST-segment elevation AMI admitted to hospitals with no PTCA facilities is to compare the effects on clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness of two reperfusion strategies: - Fibrinolytic therapy with Abciximab and half-dose Reteplase, with rescue PTCA in case of lack of reperfusion - Elective referral for “facilitated” PTCA after early administration of Abciximab and half dose of Reteplase</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patients with ST-segment elevation AMI admitted within 12 hours from symptoms onset will be screened to enter in this study. Data of patients with ST-segment elevation AMI within 12 hours from symptoms onset who do not meet the inclusion criteria or do not sign the informed consent form are entered into a dedicated registry.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ECG with STelevation (≥ 1mm in at least 2 ECG limb leads or ≥ 2 mm in 2 contiguous precordial leads) AMI within &lt;12 hours from symptoms onset fulfilling 1 or more of the following criteria of “high risk”: 1. Summation of STsegment elevation or depression ≥ 15 mm in all 12 electrocardiographic leads or new onset complete left bundle branch block; 2. Previous myocardial infarction (Q and non Qwave); 3. Killip Class 2 or 3; 4. LV ejection fraction at transthoracic ultrasound &lt; 40%. 1. Inability to provide informed consent; 2. Age &gt; 75 years 3. CABG or PCI procedure in past history involving the infarctrelated artery; 4. Participation in another study with any investigational drug or device within the previous 30 days; 5. Concomitant noncardiac disease likely to limit longterm prognosis (e.g. cancer); 6. Cardiogenic shock (hypotension with Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) &lt; 90 mmHg and tachycardia &gt; 100 beats / min, not due to hypovolemia and requiring inotropic support or balloon counterpulsation); 7. Need for concomitant major surgery (e.g. valve surgery or resection of aortic or left ventricular aneurysm, carotid endarterectomy, abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery, congenital heart disease etc); 8. Severe hepatic disease; 9. Patients with acute or chronic renal impairment (serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg % or 200 mg/l or creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min); 10. Transmural MI in different location within the previous week; 11. Previous administration of thrombolytics within 7 days; 12. Intolerance or contraindications to ASA or Clopidogrel; 13. Known leucopenia, defined as a leukocyte count of &lt; 3.500 White Blood Cells (WBC)/ml 14. Known neutropenia, defined as &lt; 1000 neutrophils / ml; 15. Known thrombocytopenia (&lt; 100.000 platelets / ml ); 16. Documented active peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal bleeding within the previous 6 months; 17. Previous hemorrhagic stroke; 18. Previous ischemic cerebrovascular event within 3 months; 19. Intracranial neoplasm; 20. Recent major surgery at risk of bleeding; 21. Episodes of uncontrolled hypertension (&gt; 180/110 mmHg despite treatment) in past 2 years; 22. Administration of oral anticoagulants within the previous 7 days unless INR ≤ 1.2; 23. Severe recent trauma; 24. Known or possible pregnancy; 25. Absence of suitable vascular access (diffuse peripheral arterial disease); 26. Basal ECG changes which make identification of STsegment elevation impossible (i.e.: ventricular activation from artificial pacemaker, etc.).</criteria>
