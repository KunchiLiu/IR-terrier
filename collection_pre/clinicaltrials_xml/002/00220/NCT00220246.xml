	<brief_summary>Two major genetic pathways leading to colorectal carcinoma can well be distinguished; the 'suppressor pathway', which is characterized by inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes and the 'mutator pathway', which is characterized by microsatellite instability. The purpose of this study is to explore a third putative pathway; microsatellite and chromosome stable colorectal cancer where an alternative cancer-causative mechanism might play a role.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical and Molecular Characterization of Familial Microsatellite Stable Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with familial colorectal cancer will be characterized with respect to family history, medical history and demographic characteristics. The histopathology of the tumors will be reviewed. Tumor specimens will be analysed on molecular defects.</detailed_description>
