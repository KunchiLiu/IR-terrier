	<brief_summary>This is a study to investigate the efficacy and safety of epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) as neoadjuvant therapy prior to radical chemoradiotherapy using capecitabine and cisplatin as radio-sensitisers in patients with newly diagnosed localized squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus.</brief_summary>

Histologically verified squamous cell carcinoma of the cervical or thoracic oesophagus American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage IIII (T13 N01 M0) (33), as assessed by spiral or multislice computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasound, where radical chemoradiation would be considered with curative intent. No previous chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other investigational drug treatment for this indication. World Health Organization (WHO) performance status 0,1 or 2. Adequate bone marrow function with platelets &gt; 100 x 10^9/l; white blood cells (WBC) &gt; 3 x 10^9/l; neutrophils &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/l at the time of study entry. Serum bilirubin &lt; 35 micromol/l. Serum creatinine &lt; 180 micromol/l and measured creatinine clearance over 60 ml/min. No concurrent uncontrolled medical condition. No previous malignant disease other than nonmelanotic skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix in the last 10 years. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months. Adequate contraceptive precautions if relevant. Informed written consent. The presence of locally advanced or metastatic disease precluding curative chemoradiation (T4 or Stage IV or M1ab) or disease not encompassable in a radical radiotherapy field. Total dysphagia (O'Rourke's swallowing function scoring system 5) precluding swallowing of capecitabine even when crushed. Medical or psychiatric conditions that compromise the patient's ability to give informed consent. Intracerebral metastases or meningeal carcinomatosis. New York Heart Association classification Grade III or IV. Uncontrolled angina pectoris. Pregnancy or breast feeding. Impaired renal function with measured creatinine clearance less than 60 ml/min.
