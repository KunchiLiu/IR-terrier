	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Readiness and Motivation Therapy in Individuals With Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Readiness and motivation for change is a significant concern in the treatment of individuals with eating disorders, as evidenced by frequent treatment drop-out, refusal, and relapse. This research examines the efficacy of a 5-session intervention designed to enhance readiness and motivation for change in individuals with anorexia nervosa. A manualized treatment protocol of Readiness and Motivation therapy (RMT) has been developed. It is hypothesized that individuals randomly assigned to RMT will have improved readiness and motivation for change as assessed using the Readiness and Motivation Interview (RMI) at post-treatment, 3-month, and one-year follow-up than individuals assigned to a no treatment control condition. If RMT proves to be effective, it could be added to the menu of treatment options, to permit for better tailoring of treatment to client readiness for change.</detailed_description>
