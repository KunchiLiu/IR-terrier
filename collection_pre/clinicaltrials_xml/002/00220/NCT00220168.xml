	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and toxicity of a 3 weekly regimen containing irinotecan combined with capecitabine in the setting of relapsed or refractory upper gastrointestinal tumours. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma originating from the oesophagus, oesophagogastric junction or stomach who have previously received chemotherapy and have either failed to respond or who have relapsed within 3 months after an initial response will be eligible for treatment in this study. The response rate, failure-free survival and overall survival of treated patients will be evaluated. Toxicity and quality of life will also be monitored closely.</brief_summary>
