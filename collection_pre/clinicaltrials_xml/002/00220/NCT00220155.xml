	<brief_summary>To assess the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine given by fixed dose rate intravenous infusion in patients with pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Fixed Dose Rate Gemcitabine for Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous lines of treatment recorded. Adjuvant and palliative. Treatment will continue until clinical indication due to PD or toxicity, or until completion of 6 cycles of gemcitabine, whichever comes first. All patients will be assessed for toxicity and followed up for disease recurrence/progression. The study will be divided into two accrual stages - the first consisting of 17 patients. If 6 or more patients achieve tumour response or stabilisation in the first stage, the second stage will commence accrual of a further 20 patients. Hence, the total planned accrual will be 37 patients.</detailed_description>
