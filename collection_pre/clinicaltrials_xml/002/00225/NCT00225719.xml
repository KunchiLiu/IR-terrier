	<brief_summary>Currently available therapies to treat Acute Coronary Syndromes(ACS) have several limitations including; the relatively long treatment duration required before apparent significant benefit; the inability to achieve reversal of the atherosclerotic process; and poor patient compliance due to chronicity of therapy. This study will assess the effects of rHDL compared with placebo on indices of atherosclerosis progression and regression as assessed with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in patients after acute coronary syndromes (ACS).</brief_summary>
