	<brief_summary>In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a common procedure used to assist couples who have difficulty conceiving a pregnancy. IVF is a process where oocytes (eggs) are retrieved from a woman's ovaries and fertilized with sperm in the laboratory. In order to maximize the number of oocytes that can be retrieved, a women undergoes ovarian stimulation with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Typically 6-20 oocytes are retrieved, but in some cases there is a limited response to the stimulation, producing a limited number of oocytes. This is called poor ovarian response. This study is designed to objectively compare two treatment regimens currently advocated in clinical practice, but never compared directly. The purpose is to assess ovarian response to starting treatment at the end of the preceding cycle may increase the number of developing oocytes.</brief_summary>
