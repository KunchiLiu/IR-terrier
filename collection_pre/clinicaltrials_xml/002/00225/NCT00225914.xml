	<brief_title>Study of Paxil Use in Menopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a 10-week double-blinded treatment study of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women who present with menopause-related symptoms after discontinuing Hormone Therapy(HT), with or without concomitant symptoms of depression and anxiety. The menopausal transition is a period of heightened vulnerability to mood and anxiety disturbances. It is also a period when women may experience significant vasomotor symptoms (i.e. hot flushes and night sweats). More recently, the occurrence of vasomotor symptoms has been associated with increased risk for depression in menopausal women. The efficacy of estrogens for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms is well established. In addition, the literature support a modulatory effect exerted by estrogen on various neurotransmitter systems that regulate mood and anxiety. Despite the efficacy of hormone therapy (HT) for the treatment of menopause-related symptoms, a significant number of women discontinue its use during the first year of treatment. Moreover, recent findings from the Women's Health Initiative Study (WHI) have challenged the safety and the benefits that were initially thought to be associated with long-term use of HT. As a result, many women who have been taking HT decided to discontinue the use of HT, which may result in significant changes in their physical well being, quality of life and, possibly, their mental health status. Therefore, the efficacy and tolerability of other interventions such as antidepressants for these sub-populations warrant further investigation. Treatment with Paroxetine has shown to be efficacious for menopause-related vasomotor symptoms. To date, no studies have examined the extent to which SSRIs may improve physical and psychological symptoms in women who discontinued HT.</detailed_description>

Women with prior use of HT for at least two months. 4. Women who discontinued HT use 1 to 12 months prior to study entry (screening visit). 5. Women who present with significant menopauserelated symptoms (defined as GCS total score &gt;20; vasomotor subscores &gt;3 and/or Â³14 moderate to severe hot flashes per week), with or without concomitant psychological complaints (symptoms of depression and/or anxiety). 6. Women who report physical/emotional symptoms developing or worsening within 3 months of HT discontinuation. 7. General good health. 1. Women who present with moderatetosevere symptoms of depression (MADRS scores &gt; 19) or anxiety (BAI scores &gt; 19) at baseline. 2. Women who meet diagnostic criteria at screening visit for a current major Axis I psychiatric disorder other than specific phobias (assessed through M.I.N.I. interview). Subjects presenting with symptoms of anxiety or depression, but not meeting criteria for Depressive Disorders, Bipolar Disorder, Panic Disorder, GAD, OCD or SAD, will be allowed in the study. 3. Regular treatment with hormonal medications, SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressant, mood stabilizer, oral neuroleptics, sedatives or hypnotics, overthecounter agents known to influence hot flushes or mood within 4 weeks prior to screening visit; used of depot neuroleptics within 12 weeks prior to screening visit. 4. Suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, or psychotic symptoms. 5. Menstrual dysfunction and amenorrhea of other etiologies. 6. History of seizure disorder 7. Pregnancy or breastfeeding.</criteria>
