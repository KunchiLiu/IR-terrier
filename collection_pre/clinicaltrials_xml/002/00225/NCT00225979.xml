	<brief_summary>Currently, the first line treatment for acromegaly is surgery, in order to remove the adenoma causing overproduction of growth hormone which leads to acromegaly. The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of long-acting repeatable formulation of octreotide and to compare it to the safety and efficacy of surgery in patients with acromegaly who have not had any previous treatment for acromegaly.</brief_summary>
