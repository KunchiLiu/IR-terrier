	<brief_summary>Conventional therapy is effective for diffuse aggressive lymphomas and low grade lymphomas, but is limited by relapse occurs in 40 to 50% of subjects. This study assesses autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) supplemented with high-dose therapy increases the event-free survival in diffuse aggressive lymphomas and low grade lymphomas, as an alternative to the limitations of conventional therapy. Preliminary studies with rituximab in low grade lymphomas indicate a response rate of about 50% with very little toxicity. Rituximab is hypothesized to be a candidate for post-transplant therapy because the majority of malignant lymphomas express the CD20 antigen; rituximab has impressive independent anti-tumor activity; and the antibody has little toxicity outside of the acute administration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab After Autologous Stem Cell Transplant for Relapsed B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first 4 subjects received rituximab weekly for 4 weeks at the standard dose of 375 mg/m2, starting 6 weeks after ASCT transplant. After an observation period to assess acute and late toxicity for the first 4 subjects, subsequent subjects received induction as above followed by an additional 4 week course at 6-months post-ASCT.</detailed_description>
