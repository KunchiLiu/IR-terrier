	<brief_summary>Patients with 3 or more adverse prognostic factors have a higher relapse rate. Significant anti-tumor activity in Hodgkin's lymphoma has been reported with two new drugs:gemcitabine and vinorelbine. The introduction of these new agents with their different mechanisms of action into the Stanford V regimen may increase effectiveness while maintaining a favorable toxicity profile with respect to fertility and a low risk of secondary leukemia. On this basis, we propose a new regimen, Stanford VI, for patients with bulky and advanced HD with 3 or more risk factors.</brief_summary>
