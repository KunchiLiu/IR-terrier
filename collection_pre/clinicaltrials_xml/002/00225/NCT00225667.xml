	<brief_title>Irbesartan for the Prevention of Atrial Arrhythmias and Cardiac Electrical Remodeling in Patients With Hypertension and Permanent Pacemakers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with permanent pacemakers have a high risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), particularly those with hypertension, sinus node dysfunction, and those with short episodes of atrial arrhythmias, known as atrial high-rate episodes (AHRE). AHRE are felt to be a precursor to AF, and may be both the result and a cause of changs in the atrial electrophysiology, and structure (known as cardiac remodeling)that are associated with the development of AF. Evaluating this process in human AF has been limited by the cumbersome nature of performing serial, invasive electrophysiologic studies. However, modern pacemakers now permit rapid, non-invasive electrophysiologic testing and can also accurately document AHRE, which allows the convenient study of therapy aimed at preventing the progression from AHRE to overt AF. In addition, this group of patients also affords the ability to evaluate the recurrence of AHRE on the progression of structural and electrical remodeling. Comparison: Irbesartan compared to placebo.</detailed_description>
