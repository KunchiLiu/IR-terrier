	<brief_title>A Study of the Cypher Sirolimus-Eluting Stent to Treat Bifurcation Lesions.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized study that will be conducted at up to 5 centers in Europe and the US. All patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be treated with the sirolimus-coated Bx VELOCITY Balloon-Expandable Stent and Stent Delivery System (SDS). As a secondary objective, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one stent in the main branch with balloon angioplasty by a kissing balloon technique in the side branch (stent/PTCA group), or to receive stents in both the main and side branches (stent/stent group). It is anticipated that up to 70% of the patients enrolled in the stent/PTCA group will be considered treatment failures and require a stent in the side branch. These patients will have a sirolimus-coated stent placed in the side branch and will be followed per the protocol, but will be analyzed separately. Therefore, it is anticipated that up to 75 patients will be enrolled in the trial. All patients will have repeat angiography at six months, with clinical follow-up to 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Has a diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald Classification B&amp;C, III) OR has documented silent ischemia; 2. Involves a single treatment of a de novo bifurcation lesion in native coronary arteries of patients with single or multivessel disease; patients with multiple lesions can be included only if other lesions treated during the index procedure are successfully treated prior to the treatment of the bifurcation lesion; 3. Has a true bifurcation lesion defined as stenosis &gt; 50% in both the main branch and the ostium of the side branch; 4. Has a main branch vessel that is &lt;=2.5 mm and &lt;=3.5 mm in diameter by online QCA proximal to the bifurcation; 5. Has a side branch vessel that is &lt;=2.5 mm and &lt;=3.5 mm in diameter by online QCA. 1. Patient has experienced a Qwave or nonQwave myocardial infarction with documented elevation of CK levels &gt; 2 times normal or CKMB levels &gt; 3 times normal within the preceding 24 hours and/or the CK and CKMB enzymes remain above normal at the time of treatment; 2. Has unstable angina classified as Braunwald A IIII, or III B or C, or is having a peri infarction; 3. Has a bifurcation lesion in a non protected left main; 4. Has an ejection fraction &lt;=35%; 5. There is presence of thrombus in the bifurcation lesion; 6. Has a totally occluded vessel.</criteria>
