	<criteria>Ambulatory male or female subjects &gt; 13 years old. A female subject must be nonlactating and at no risk for pregnancy. Diagnosis of USSSI with 2 or more of the following local signs and symptoms: Pain/tenderness Swelling Erythema Localized warmth Purulent drainage/discharge Induration Regional lymph node swelling or tenderness Extension of redness Acceptable USSSI include, but are not limited to: Cellulitis Erysipelas Impetigo Simple abscess Wound infection Furunculosis Folliculitis A sample for microbiologic culture must be obtained from the primary infection site within 48 hours prior to study drug administration. Exclusion Criteria Medical history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to penicillin and/or cephalosporin (including cefdinir and cephalexin) antibiotics according to the judgment of the Investigator. Subject with a complicated skin and skin structure infection as judged by the investigator. A chronic or underlying skin condition at the site of infection (e.g., a secondary infected atopic dermatitis or eczema) or infections involving prosthetic materials (e.g., catheter tunnel infections, orthopedic hardware). A wound secondary to burn injury or acne vulgaris. Any infection site that requires: intraoperative surgical debridement; excision of infected lesions or body parts. Infections that can be treated by surgical incision alone according to the judgment of the Investigator. Any other infection that necessitates the use of additional concomitant oral or parenteral antibiotic therapy. Known significant renal or hepatic impairment indicated by: Serum Creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL (176.8 mol/L) SGOT (AST) &gt; 3x the upper limit of the reference range SGPT (ALT) &gt; 3x the upper limit of the reference range Alkaline Phosphatase &gt; 2x the upper limit of the reference range Total Bilirubin &gt; 2x the upper limit of the reference range Underlying condition and/or disease that, according to the judgment of the Investigator, would be likely to interfere with completion of the course of study drug therapy or followup. The Investigator considers the subject an unsuitable candidate for cefdinir or cephalexin administration</criteria>
