	<brief_summary>This drug is being developed to treat cardiac edema. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the dose response for body weight in seven-day repeated oral administration of OPC-41061 at 15, 30, and 45 mg or placebo in patients with extracellular volume expansion secondary to CHF despite taking furosemide at 40 mg/d or more. This study is being conducted in Japan.</brief_summary>
