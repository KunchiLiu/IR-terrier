	<brief_title>Medications for the Treatment of Dysthymic Disorder and Double Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dysthymic Disorder is a common, chronic type of depression that is often seen as a mild condition and is under-treated. Because of its chronic course, it is often complicated by episodes of major depression and may require long-term treatment. This is a twelve week study during which daily doses of escitalopram (10-20 mg) or sertraline (50-200 mg) will be given to outpatients meeting criteria for Dysthymic Disorder or Double Depression. Medications will be assigned 1:1 and clinicians will be blinded to treatment. Efficacy will be based on scores for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, patient subjective reporting, and clinician observation. The study will have a total of 8 visits over 12 weeks, with a one-week medication taper period at the end. Subjects will have a physical exam, labs, and vital signs monitored at first visit and vital signs monitored at every subsequent visit. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening. All subjects will remain on the lowest medication dose for the first four weeks of the study.</detailed_description>
