	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can result in a loss of ability to filter and excrete phosphate. The body's attempt to adjust to an increased level of phosphate in the blood can result in elevated levels of hormones and minerals resulting in serious clinical consequences. This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lanthanum carbonate in lowering high levels of phosphorus in the blood in subjects with CKD Stages 3 and 4 compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
