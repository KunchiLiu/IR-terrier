	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well gemcitabine works in treating patients with newly diagnosed, relapsed, or chemotherapy-resistant mantle cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed, Relapsed, or Chemotherapy-Resistant Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of gemcitabine, in terms of objective response and tolerability, in patients with newly diagnosed, relapsed, or chemotherapy-resistant mantle cell lymphoma. Secondary - Determine the time to progression and time to treatment failure in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the response duration in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the adverse reactions in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-29 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
