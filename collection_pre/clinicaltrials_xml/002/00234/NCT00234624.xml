	<brief_summary>This 1-year project is intended to study the hemodynamic changes of poratal and hepatic artery during living related liver transplantation. We hypothesize that after right hepatectomy for living related liver transplatation, portal vein overflow will change the remnant liver contour and result in liver hyperplasia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We use CT as tools to reconstruct 3D images of portal vein and hepatic artery before and one month after operation. The images are transferred to CAD and computer simulation is performed.</detailed_description>
