	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Study Comparing Renal Artery Stenting (RESIST)With/Without Distal Protection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of using protective device/drug to prevent renal injury during renal artery stenting (RAS) and to assess whether the preventative effects are measurable, and if there is a differential treatment effect for either device alone or in combination. Specific goals of the study include: - To establish device and drug safety - To identify appropriate markers for renal injury - To measure effectiveness of drug and device - To enable the design of FDA efficacy trials for renal artery stenting inclusive of device and or drug The study will address the four following hypotheses: - AngioGuard™ distal protection device provides significant protection from atheroembolization during RAS procedures as measured by affected kidney GFR at 1 month after the procedure. - Abciximab (ReoPro) offers protection against platelet aggregation and embolization as measured by affected kidney GFR at 1 month after the procedure. - AngioGuard™ and Abciximab are safe, alone and in combination. - Is there an interaction effect between AngioGuard™ and ReoPro for efficacy and safety?</detailed_description>
