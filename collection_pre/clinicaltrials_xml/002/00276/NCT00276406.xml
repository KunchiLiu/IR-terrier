	<brief_summary>Doctors at Mayo Clinic are doing this study to learn if pyridostigmine, a drug, affects the speed at which food travels through the stomach, intestines and colon, and if pyridostigmine improves constipation symptoms in patients with diabetes. Pyridostigmine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine clinical use, however, its use as proposed in this study is considered investigational.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Pyridostigmine for Constipation in Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic constipation in diabetes mellitus is associated with colonic motor dysfunction and is managed with laxatives. Cholinesterase inhibitors increase colonic motility. The study evaluated the effects of a cholinesterase inhibitor (pyridostigmine vs. placebo) on gastrointestinal and colonic transit and bowel function in diabetic patients with constipation. After a 9-day baseline period, patients with diabetes mellitus and chronic constipation without defecatory disorder will be randomized to oral placebo or pyridostigmine, starting with 60 mg three times a day, increasing by 60 mg every third day up to the maximum tolerated dose of 120 mg three times a day; this dose will be maintained for 7 days. Gastrointestinal and colonic transit (assessed by scintigraphy) and bowel function will be evaluated at baseline and the final 3 and 7 days of treatment, respectively.</detailed_description>
