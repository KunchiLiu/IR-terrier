	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess whether, in individuals with type 2 diabetes, a low-fat, vegan diet improves blood glucose control more effectively than a control diet based on current American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines. The principal measure is hemoglobin A1c. Cardiovascular risk factors and dietary acceptability are also assessed. The study duration is 22 weeks with a one-year follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preliminary evidence suggests that low-fat, vegetarian regimens similar to those used to reverse coronary artery blockages may have a significant beneficial effect on type 2 diabetes, as demonstrated by reductions in fasting serum glucose concentrations and medication use. We therefore randomly assigned 99 individuals with type 2 diabetes to either a low-fat, vegan diet or a diet based on current American Diabetes Association guidelines for 22 weeks with a one-year follow-up period. The principal dependent measure is hemoglobin A1c. Cardiovascular risk factors are also being tracked, as is dietary acceptance.</detailed_description>
