	<brief_summary>A single post-hospital discharge home visit by a geriatric nurse practitioner or geriatric fellow can bridge the gap and ease the transition for elderly frail patients returning home after hospital admission. We believe this intervention will reduce medication errors, ensure follow-up discharge plans, decrease re-hospitalization rates, and decrease morbidity and mortality.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients admitted to the ACE unit during the study time frame, age 65 and over, and residing in the community before and after discharge from the hospital. Selected patients will have complex discharge plans including referrals to home care agencies, polypharmacy, multiple comorbidities, history of repeated hospitalizations, and poor social support systems in the community. In addition, eligible patients will have at least one of eight admitting diagnoses, chosen for their high likelihood of requiring postdischarge home care needs. These diagnosis include: CHF, COPD, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke, hip fracture, peripheral vascular disease or cardiac arrhythmia. The GNP or fellow will then request permission from the patient's primary physician to do a onetime postdischarge home visit.
