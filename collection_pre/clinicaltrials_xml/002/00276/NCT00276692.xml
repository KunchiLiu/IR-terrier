	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well irinotecan works in treating patients with newly diagnosed Ewing's sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Ewing's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Assess the responsiveness of single-agent irinotecan hydrochloride in a patient population with newly diagnosed high-risk Ewing's sarcoma. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses. After completion of 2 courses of therapy, patients may receive additional treatment at the discretion of the treating physician. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
