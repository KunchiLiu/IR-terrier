	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well temozolomide works in treating patients with high-risk relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide in Treating Young Patients With High-Risk Relapsed or Refractory Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the anti-tumor activity of temozolomide in young patients with high-risk relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. Secondary - Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine tolerability of this drug in these patients - Determine the tumor expression of the cellular repair mechanisms which repair DNA damage (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase [MGMT] and mismatch repair [MMR] systems) in patients treated with this drug. - Correlate MGMT and MMR expression with outcomes in patients treated with this drug. - Determine if MGMT and MMR expression/activity changes in the tumor during initial presentation, treatment, and relapse/progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the activity of MGMT in bone marrow taken at relapse, in terms of hematological toxicity, in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open label, nonrandomized study. Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily for 5 days. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses. Patients achieving stable or responding disease after completion of the 2 courses may receive up to 10 additional courses of treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
