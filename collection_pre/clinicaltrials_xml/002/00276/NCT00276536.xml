	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells and slow the growth of cancer. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of interferon alfa in treating patients with stage IV solid tumors, lymphoma, or myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interferon Alfa in Treating Patients With Stage IV Solid Tumors, Lymphoma, or Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Confirm tolerance and safety of interferon alfa-1b (IFN-α1b) in patients with stage IV solid tumors, lymphoma, or myeloma. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IFN-α1b given daily by subcutaneous injection in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive interferon alfa-1b subcutaneously once daily for at least 1 month. Treatment continues for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of interferon alfa-1b until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
