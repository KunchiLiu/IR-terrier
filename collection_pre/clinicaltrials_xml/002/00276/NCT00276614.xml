	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well bortezomib works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of bortezomib in patients with metastatic non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma in terms of objective response rate after a minimum of 2 courses of treatment. Secondary - Correlate clinical response in these patients with baseline von Hippel-Lindau expression and nuclear factor-KB activity. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month and then periodically for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
