	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with docetaxel works in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine and Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response rate and toxicity in patients with androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride and docetaxel. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
