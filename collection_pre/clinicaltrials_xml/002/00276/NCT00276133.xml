	<brief_summary>Small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) plays an important role in causing glomerular injury through conversion to an oxidatively modified form of LDL. However, few studies evaluated the effects of antilipidemic agents on the LDL particle size and renoprotective actions in hyperlipidemic patients with non-diabetic nephropathy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Atorvastatin Versus Probucol on Small Dense LDL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized crossover trial comparing the effect of atorvastatin (10 mg/day) and probucol (500 mg/day) for 24 weeks in 30 patients (urinary albumin excretion 0.3â€“2.0 g/day, and creatinine clearance &gt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 or serum creatinine concentration &lt; 2 mg/L). Lipid parameters, mean LDL particle diameter, creatinine clearance, and urinary albumin to creatinine excretion ratio are measured before and during treatment periods. It will be evaluated that, first, whether atorvastatin and probucol significantly reduce serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations, second, whether atorvastatin and probucol significantly increase the LDL particle size, third, whether significant differences in urinary albumin/creatinine excretion ratio and creatinine clearance are observed in both groups during treatment.</detailed_description>
