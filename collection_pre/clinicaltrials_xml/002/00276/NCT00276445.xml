	<brief_summary>Intravenous- injection of beta-1,3-glucan in human is known to induce T helper type 1 response, while oral uptake did not. It was examined whether superfine dispersed beta-1,3-glucan (SDG) contrived to absorbed by intestinal mucosa would alleviate allergic symptoms by per-oral ingestion</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Beta-1,3-glucan made from Japanese mushroom is commercially available for healthy foodstuffs. Allergy patients were orally administrated either SDG (n=30) or non-dispersed beta-1,3-glucan (NDG, n=30) and allergic symptoms were assessed clinically, by the double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study</detailed_description>
