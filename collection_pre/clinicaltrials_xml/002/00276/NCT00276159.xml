	<criteria>Subjects are eligible for the study if they meet all of the following Diagnosis of one of the following hematologic malignancies not responding to at least 2 standard treatment regimens. Any criteria for persistent or recurrent disease acceptable, i.e. ≥5% blasts for acute leukemia. acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) nonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) multiple myeloma (MM) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Performance status Karnofsky &gt; 50% for patients &gt; 10 years of age or Lansky &gt;50% for patients &lt; 10 year of age Normal organ function within 14 days of study entry If female and of childbearing potential, are willing to use adequate contraception (hormonal, barrier method, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. A female is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she has had her uterus removed, had a double oophorectomy, or has been amenorrheic for at least 6 months after chemotherapy Had/have the following prior/concurrent therapy: Systemic corticosteroids (oral or injectable) within 7 days of first dose of 852A (topical or inhaled steroids are allowed) Investigational drugs/agents within 14 days of first dose of 852A Immunosuppressive therapy, including cytotoxic agents within 14 days of first dose of 852A (nitrosoureas within 30 days of first dose) Drugs known to induce QT interval prolongation and/or induce Torsades De Pointes unless best available drug required to treat lifethreatening conditions Radiotherapy within 4 weeks of the first dose of 852A Hematopoietic cell transplantation 4 weeks of first dose of 852A Active infection or fever &gt; 38.5°C within 3 days of first dose of 852A Cardiac ischemia, cardiac arrhythmias or congestive heart failure uncontrolled by medication History of, or clinical evidence of, a condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could confound the results of the study or put the subject at undue risk Uncontrolled intercurrent or chronic illness Active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy within 30 days Active hepatitis B or C with evidence of ongoing viral replication Hyperthyroidism Uncontrolled seizure disorder Active coagulation disorder not controlled with medication Pregnant or lactating Concurrent malignancy (if in remission, at least 5 years disease free) except for localized (insitu) disease, basal carcinomas and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas adequately treated Proven active central nervous system (CNS) disease Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive Congenital long QT syndrome or abnormal baseline QTc interval (&gt; 450 msec in males and &gt; 470 msec in females) after Bazett's correction (QTc msec = QT msec / square root of the RR interval in seconds) on screening electrocardiogram (ECG).</criteria>
