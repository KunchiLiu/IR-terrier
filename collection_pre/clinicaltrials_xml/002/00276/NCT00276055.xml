	<brief_summary>1.1 To determine the recommended phase II dose for gemcitabine in combination with a fixed dose of docetaxel and bevacizumab. 1.2 To determine the efficacy of the combination of gemcitabine, docetaxel, and bevacizumab in patients with soft tissue sarcoma 1.3 To determine the toxicity profile of the combination of gemcitabine, docetaxel, and bevacizumab in patients with soft tissue sarcoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase IB Study of Gemcitabine, Docetaxel and Bevacizumab in Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel has shown impressive activity in soft tissue sarcoma, we hypothesize that the addition of an antiangiogenesis agent (bevacizumab) would enhance the anticancer activity, as shown in other tumor types.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: All patients, 18 years of age or older, with chemotherapy naive soft tissue sarcoma are eligible if there is measurable disease Prior surgery or radiotherapy for the primary tumor is allowed but needs to have been completed at least 2 weeks from entry, and patient should have completely recovered from the procedures. Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 02. Patients must sign an informed consent. Patients should have adequate bone marrow function defined by an absolute peripheral granulocyte count of &gt; 1,500 or cells/mm3 and platelet count &gt;100,000/mm3 and absence of a regular red blood cell transfusion requirement. Patients should have adequate hepatic function with a total bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl and serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) or serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) &lt; two times the upper limit of normal, and adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal. Patients with symptomatic brain metastases are excluded from this study. Pregnant women or nursing mothers are not eligible for this trial. Patients of child bearing potential must use adequate contraception. Patients may receive no other concurrent chemotherapy or radiation therapy during this trial. Patients with severe medical problems such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease or active infections are not eligible for this trial.</criteria>
