	<brief_summary>One of the most common residual lesions in adult survivors of pediatric cardiac surgery is pulmonary valve disease, particularly regurgitation. Multiple studies have demonstrated that placement of a pulmonary valve in such patients, results in improved ventricular function and resolution of symptoms. However, the optimal prosthetic valve for use in the pulmonary position has not been defined. There are essentially three alternatives available: the stented bioprosthetic valve, stentless bioprosthetic "tube" grafts used to replace the entire right ventricular outflow tract and mechanical valves. All three of these valve options have been used in adults with congenital heart disease at Emory Healthcare and at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston. The goal of this study is to evaluate and compare the indications and short and mid-term outcomes for these alternative therapies.</brief_summary>
