	<brief_summary>5 fluorouracil (5 FU), one of the most actively investigated anti-cancer drugs, is rapidly inactivated by the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). ADH300004 blocks DPD. This study will test the safety and effects of oral ADH300004 14 hours prior to oral 5 FU in subjects with refractory solid tumors.</brief_summary>
