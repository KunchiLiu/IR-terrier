	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of epoetin alfa compared with darbepoetin alfa in the treatment of anemia in adults receiving chemotherapy for cancer. Epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa are genetically engineered proteins that stimulate red blood cell production.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cost-effectiveness Study of Epoetin Alfa and Darbepoetin Alfa in Adult Patients With Cancer Who Have Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia has been identified as a common complication and a widespread problem in the cancer population. Anemia is a condition in which a patient has below normal levels of hemoglobin, the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen to all parts of the body. People with severe anemia may experience fatigue and shortness of breath with activity. Therefore, this condition can have a negative influence on a person's quality of life. Epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa, used to treat anemia in cancer patients, are genetically engineered proteins that stimulate red blood cell production. This study investigates treatment of anemia using either epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa during chemotherapy in adult patients with cancer. The study is intended to collect information on normal medical practice and routine anemia management performed at the participating centers. This is an observational, non-randomized, prospective, comparative, parallel-group survey performed in The Netherlands. Patients with various severities of disease may enter the survey as soon as either their epoetin alfa or their darbepoetin alfa treatment starts and will be followed until the end of their epoetin alfa/darbepoetin alfa treatment. Patient data are collected, on average, once monthly (depending on the treatment being received) and this continues until 4 weeks after the end of treatment with epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa. An assessment of cost-effectiveness will be made for both treatments. The assessment of cost-effectiveness will be based on the following: cancer type and status, chemotherapy and other anti-cancer treatment, hemoglobin levels, use of either epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa, use of blood transfusions, and serum iron levels and iron supplementation. Safety evaluations include the incidence of serious and non-serious adverse events. Because the study involves only collection of information, no treatment will be required by the Sponsor and no medication will be supplied by the Sponsor. Epoetin alpha and darbepoetin alpha are administered according to routine clinical practice.</detailed_description>
