	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the usefulness of the TRAP protein as (1) an early indicator of bone destruction and (2) a tool for assessing the effect of Zometa® in treating symptoms of bone metastases due to breast cancer. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) is a protein released into the blood stream as a result of bone destruction caused by metastasis of breast cancer to the bone. Bone destruction causes pain and bone fractures. This study will measure TRAP levels in serum taken from breast cancer patients to see if TRAP levels will be able to predict the effect of Zometa® treatment on bone destruction, pain and bone fractures.</brief_summary>
