	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cerebral blood flow in subjects with high and low activity in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).The renin-angiotensin system is a hormone system which is involved in the regulation of the blood pressure. Earlier studies have shown that high RAS activity is associated with a more pronounced cognitive impairment during hypoglycaemia compared to low RAS activity in both type 1 diabetic patients and healthy volunteers. We intend to examine brain activity by oxygen-15 labelled water-PET scanning during hypoglycaemia in response to cognitive function testing in 20 healthy male volunteers with high and low RAS activity, respectively</brief_summary>
