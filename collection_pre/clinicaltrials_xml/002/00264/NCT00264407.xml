	<detailed_description>Background: Female hormone influences on the development and aging of the auditory system are not completely understood. The present study retrospectively analyzed and compared hearing abilities among post-menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT), treated with estrogen and progesterone (E+P); estrogen alone (E), and a third (control - NHRT) group, matched for age, who did not receive any HRT. Methods: 126 subjects, (60-86 yr), N=32, E+P; N=31, E; N= 63, NHRT; matched for age and health status participated. All had relatively healthy medical histories, absence of significant noise exposure, middle ear problems, major surgeries or current/heavy smoking. Hearing tests included pure tone audiometry (PTA), tympanometry, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), transient otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and hearing-in-noise-test (HINT). The latter is a test for speech perception in background noise: the major complaint of hearing-impaired persons.</detailed_description>
