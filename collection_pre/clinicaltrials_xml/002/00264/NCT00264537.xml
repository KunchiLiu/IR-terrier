	<brief_title>A Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Golimumab in Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis That Are Methotrexate-naive</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Golimumab is a fully human protein (antibody) which binds to tumor necrosis factor (TNFa). TNFa is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and plays a major role in causing the joint pain, swelling, and damage from RA. Other marketed drugs that target TNFa (anti-TNFa drugs) have been shown to be effective in reducing the symptoms, signs, and joint damage of RA, but have limitations with respect to safety and ease of use. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of a new anti-TNFa drug, golimumab, at 2 doses, injected under the skin every 4 weeks, alone or in combination with methotrexate, compared with methotrexate alone, in subjects with active RA who have not been previously treated with methotrexate. The study hypothesis is that golimumab, alone or in combination with methotrexate, will be more effective in treatment of RA than methotrexate alone, as measured by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria and change from baseline in van der Heide Modified Sharp (vdH-S) score, without causing unacceptable significant adverse effects. The ACR response criteria were designed to determine the percentage of subjects who have achieved a certain level of improvement in their signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. The vdH-S score is a measurement of the amount of joint damage in a subject as seen by x-ray. Other secondary measures of effectiveness include the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), which is a series of questions that measure a subject's impairment in physical function caused by RA. Golimumab 50 mg or 100 mg, or placebo injections under the skin every 4 weeks until Week52. Methotrexate (MTX) or placebo capsules will be given in addition. At Week52, subjects on MTX alone with joint pain or swelling get golimumab 50mg, and all subjects receive golimumab for about 4 more years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (according to the revised 1987 criteria of the ACR) for at least 3 months prior to first administration of study agent Are methotrexate (MTX)naïve (ie, have not received more than 3 weekly doses of MTX for RA at any time) Have active RA as defined by persistent disease activity with at least 4 swollen and 4 tender joints, at the time of screening and baseline, and at least 2 of the following 4 criteria: a) Creactive protein (CRP) &gt;=1.5 mg/dL at screening or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) by Westergren method of &gt;= 28 mm in the first hour at screening or baseline, b)Morning stiffness of &gt;= 30 minutes at screening and baseline, c)Bone erosion by xray and/or MRI prior to first administration of study agent, d)Anticyclic citrullinated peptide (antiCCP) antibodypositive or rheumatoid factor (RF) positive at screening If using oral corticosteroids, must be on a stable dose equivalent to &lt;= 10 mg of prednisone/day for at least 2 weeks prior to first administration of study agent. Can not have inflammatory diseases other than RA that might confound the evaluation of the benefit of golimumab therapy No treatment with diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)/systemic immunosuppressives during the 4 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent No prior treatment with biologic antiTNF drugs (infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab) No history of, or ongoing, chronic or recurrent infectious disease No serious infection within 2 months prior to first administration of study agent.</criteria>
