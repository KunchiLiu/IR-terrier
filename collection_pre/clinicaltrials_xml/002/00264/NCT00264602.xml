	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine if we can identify the first lymph node that drains from the tumor, and thus would be the most likely site for metastatic disease, and remove it for analysis to improve the ability to detect tumor in this node and to remove this additional site that potentially contains tumor cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- This study is designed to determine the feasibility, safety amd dosing for indocyanine green and near-infrared fluorescent light in order to maximize the near infrared-guided detection of tumor-specific sentinel lymph nodes during the routine surgery for early stage lung cancer when the tumor and nearby lymph nodes are removed. - At the time of surgery, the indocyanine dye will be injected into or around the patient's tumor. We are using a dose approximately 10,000 times lower than previously approved for injection in the blood. After a few minutes, the surgeon will remove the lymph nodes near the tumor, as is standard for lung surgery, and we will look at these lymph nodes with near-infrared fluorescence. - The "filtered" near-infrared light causes the indocyanine green dye to fluoresce so that the surgeon can identify the lymph nodes most likely to contain tumor cells. If the lymph node is not found in the group of nodes usually removed, we will use the near-infrared light to look near the tumor for the sentinel lymph nodes and guide the surgeon so that the sentinel nodes can be removed and studied. The surgeon will then continue with the operation and remove the tumor. The lymph nodes are processed for special analysis tailored to finding metastasis in sentinel lymph nodes. - Since the first question of this study is to determine the smallest dose of indocyanine green that can be used safely for near-infrared detection of the lymph nodes, not all subjects will receive the same dose. The most any person will receive is 1/3 of a teaspoon. - A five year observation period begins following the operation during which surgeons and physicians will examine the patient and order certain studies to look for evidence of regrowth of the tumor.</detailed_description>
