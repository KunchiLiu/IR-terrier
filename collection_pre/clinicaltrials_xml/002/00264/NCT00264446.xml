	<brief_summary>5 fluorouracil (5 FU), one of the most actively investigated anti-cancer drugs, is rapidly inactivated by the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). ADH300004 blocks DPD. This study will examine the kinetics of inhibition and recovery of the metabolic pathways for fluoropyrimidines in subjects who receive a single oral dose of ADH300004, and may allow optimization of oral 5 FU dosing to subjects in future studies.</brief_summary>
