	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to evaluate if use of the AngioGuard™ XP improves myocardial reperfusion after PTCA as assessed by ST segment resolution at the end of PTCA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Distal Protection Combined With PTCA in AMI Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial. Patients will be randomized either to be treated by PTCA only or in combination with the An-gioGuard™ XP device. The patients will be followed for six-months post-procedure.</detailed_description>
