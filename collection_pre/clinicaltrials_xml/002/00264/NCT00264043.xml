	<criteria>Unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald classification B &amp; C, IIIIII, native vessels) or lesion located in the SVG; Single de novo or restenotic lesion requiring treatment in a major native coronary artery or saphenous vein graft; The vessel diameter to place the AngioGuard™ device in must be &gt; 3 and &lt; 5.5 mm (6.5 when the 7mm AngioGuard™ is available); Target lesion stenosis is &gt;50% and &lt;100% (TIMI 1). A Qwave or nonQwave myocardial infarction within the preceding 72 hours unless the CK and CKMB enzymes are back to normal; More than one coronary artery is 100% occluded; Patient has unprotected left main coronary disease with &gt; 50% stenosis; Patient has an ostial target lesion; Significant (&gt;50%) untreated stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion that will be treated during the procedure, since this may require revascularization or impede runoff; Ejection fraction &lt;30%; Totally occluded vessel (TIMI 0 Level).</criteria>
