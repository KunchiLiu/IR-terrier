	<brief_summary>The Frequent Hemodialysis Network (FHN) Daily Trial is a randomized controlled trial recruiting subjects from dialysis units associated with designated Clinical Centers in the U.S. and Canada and followed for 1 year. Subjects will be randomized to either conventional hemodialysis Daily HD delivered for at least 2.5 hours (typically 3 to 4 hours), 3 days per week, or to more frequent hemodialysis delivered for 1.5 - 2.75 hours, 6 days per week. The study has two co-primary outcomes: 1) a composite of mortality with the change over 12 months in left ventricular mass by magnetic resonance imaging, and 2) a composite of mortality with the change over 12 months in the SF-36 RAND physical health composite (PHC) quality of life scale.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Frequent Hemodialysis Network: Daily Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial is a randomized controlled trial recruiting subjects from dialysis units associated with designated Clinical Centers in the U.S. and Canada. A total of 250 ESRD patients receiving in-center HD will be randomized to continue with conventional HD, 3 days per week (control group), or switch to daily HD, 6 days per week (intervention group). Subjects will be treated and followed for 12 months. Two co-primary outcomes are designated: 1) a composite of mortality with the change over 12 months in left ventricular mass, and 2) a composite of mortality with the change over 12 months in the SF-36 RAND physical health composite. In addition, main secondary outcomes have been designated for each of seven outcome domains: 1) cardiovascular structure and function (change in LV mass), 2) health-related quality of life/physical function (change in the PHC), 3) depression/burden of illness (change in Beck Depression Inventory), 4) nutrition (change in serum albumin), 5) cognitive function (change in the Trail Making Test B), 6) mineral metabolism (change in average predialysis serum phosphorus), and 7) clinical events (rate of non-access hospitalization or death). Hypertension and anemia are also main outcome domains, but without designation of single first priority outcomes. The objectives of this study are the following: Feasibility: 1. To determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining patients in a randomized trial of six times per week in-center daily HD versus conventional three times per week in-center HD. 2. To determine patient adherence with and acceptance of in-center daily HD, and to identify reasons for discontinuation from or nonadherence with the therapy. Safety: 3. To determine the safety of in-center daily HD with a particular focus on vascular access events and participant burden. Efficacy: 4. To evaluate the efficacy of in-center daily HD compared to conventional three times per week HD on two co-primary outcomes: i) a composite of mortality with the change over 12 months in left ventricular mass by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ii) a composite of mortality with the change over 12 months in the SF-36 RAND physical health composite score (PHC). 5. To determine the effect of in-center daily HD on nine secondary outcome domains: i) cardiovascular structure and function, ii) health-related quality of life and physical function, iii) depression/burden of illness, iv) nutrition and inflammation, v) cognitive function, vi) mineral metabolism, vii) clinical events, viii) hypertension, and ix) anemia. Characterization of the Intervention 6. To better understand the complex therapy of in-center daily HD, by evaluating solute clearance, treatment times, volume removal, and non-dialytic factors such as differences in the frequency of medical surveillance and treatment. Implementation: 7. To determine the feasibility of implementing in-center daily HD in practice, by evaluating barriers to implementation such as the incremental cost of daily HD compared to 3 times per week conventional HD.</detailed_description>

Medical conditions that would prevent the subject from performing the cardiac MRI procedure (e.g., inability to remain still for the procedure, a metallic object in the body, including cardiac pacemaker, inner ear (cochlear) implant, brain aneurysm clips, mechanical heart valves, recently placed artificial joints, and older vascular stents) 7. Unable to verbally communicate in English or Spanish 8. Requires HD &gt; 3 times per week due to medical comorbidity (such as, but not limited to: systemic oxalosis, or requiring total parenteral nutrition). Occasional ultrafiltration on a fourth day per week is not an exclusion criterion. 9. Currently on daily or nocturnal HD, or less than 3 months since the subject discontinued daily or nocturnal HD 10. Scheduled for living donor kidney transplant, change to peritoneal dialysis, home HD, or plans to relocate to another center within the next 14 months 11. Expected geographic unavailability at a participating HD unit for &gt; 2 consecutive weeks or &gt; 4 weeks total during the next 14 months (excluding unavailability due to hospitalizations) (frequent HD subjects who leave for vacation may resort back to conventional HD during these time periods) 12. Less than 3 months since the patient returned to HD after acute rejection resulting in allograft failure 13. Currently in acute or chronic care hospital 14. Life expectancy &lt; 6 months 15. A medical history that might limit the subject's ability to take trial treatments for the 12 month duration of the study, including: currently receiving chemo or radiotherapy for a malignant neoplastic disease other than localized nonmelanoma skin cancer, active systemic infection (including tuberculosis, disseminated fungal infection, active AIDS but not HIV, and cirrhosis with encephalopathy) 16. Current pregnancy, or actively planning to become pregnant in the next 12 months 17. Contraindication to heparin, including allergy or heparin induced thrombocytopenia 18. Current use of investigational drugs or participation in another clinical trial that contradicts or interferes with the therapies or measured outcomes in this trial 19.
