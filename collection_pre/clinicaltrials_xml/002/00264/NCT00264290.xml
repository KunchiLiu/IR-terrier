	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with valganciclovir decreases T cell activation levels among HIV-infected patients with asymptomatic cytomegalovirus (CMV) co-infection, potentially improving immune responses to antiretroviral therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Infection with HIV &gt;1 year in duration. Age &gt;18 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibody positive. All Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T cell counts in the last year and at screening &lt;350 cells/mm3 On a stable highly addictive antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen (DHHS definition) for the preceding 6 months. 90% adherence to antiretroviral therapy within the preceding 30 days. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and all subjects must agree to use a doublebarrier method of contraception throughout the study period. Screening %Cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38)+ Human leukocyte antigenDrelated (HLADR)+ Cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T cells &gt;10% Patients intending to modify antiretroviral therapy in the next 16 weeks. Serious illness requiring hospitalization or parental antibiotics within preceding 3 months. Evidence of active symptomatic CMV endorgan disease. Treatment with valganciclovir or ganciclovir in the past 30 days. Concurrent treatment with immunomodulatory drugs. Concurrent treatment with nephrotoxic drugs Screening absolute neutrophil count &lt;1,000 cells/mm3, platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3, hemoglobin &lt; 8mg/dL, estimated creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/minute. Men who are considering having children will also be excluded given potential effects of valganciclovir on spermatogenesis. Pregnant or breastfeeding women</criteria>
