	<brief_summary>Inflammation is characterised by an increased risk for cardiovascular events. Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium caused by oxidative stress might provide a mechanistic link. In acute and chronic inflammation, oxidative stress occurs when the production of reactive oxygen species [ROS] (including superoxide anions [O2-]) exceeds the capacity of the endogenous antioxidant defense systems, resulting in ROS-mediated damage. Recombinant human superoxide dismutase (rhSOD) has shown potent antioxidant properties in in-vitro and animal studies and has been tested in phase I clinical trials in humans. rhSOD could offer a therapeutic option for vascular dysfunction in diseases associated with increased oxidative stress. The investigators, therefore, want to test if the hyporesponsiveness to vasoactive drugs (norepinephrine, acetylcholine and glyceroltrinitrate) during acute inflammation by low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is due to the increased production of superoxide anions, which could be scavanged by the radical scavenger rhSOD.</brief_summary>
