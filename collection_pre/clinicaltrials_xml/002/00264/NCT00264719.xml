	<brief_title>Metoclopramide to Aid Establishment of Breastfeeding:a Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: Early Use of oral metoclopramide can hasten and improve the establishment of lactogenesis II in mothers after preterm and term deliveries. Metoclopramide(Maxolon) promotes lactation by antagonizing the release of dopamine in the central nervous system, thereby increasing prolactin levels, and thus inducing or augmenting breast milk levels. While Metoclopramide has commonly been used to augment breast milk production and relactation, its efficacy in helping to establish lactogenesis II has never been studied in a controlled clinical trial. If effective, it may become a valuable tool in aiding the successful establishment of breastfeeding, particularly in high risk groups such as mothers of preterm babies. If shown to be an effective galactogogue, the use of metoclopramide provides an inexpensive and safe means of establishing and sustaining lactogenesis II, indirectly improving the degree and duration of breastfeeding practiced by mothers of both term and preterm infants. The anticipated benefits are expected to be greatest for preterm infants and their mothers.</detailed_description>
