	<brief_title>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Adolescents With Substance Use Disorders (SUD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research shows a high prevalence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adolescents with substance abuse disorders and indicates that they have poorer substance use treatment outcomes and poorer prognosis and risk of persistence and progression of drug use and behavior problems into adulthood. Although research indicates that the majority are not treated for ADHD while in substance treatment, we do not know whether concurrent pharmacotherapy for ADHD will improve treatment outcomes. This Clinical Trials Network (CTN) study will evaluate the efficacy of osmotic-release methylphenidate (OROS-MPH), relative to placebo, in treating ADHD and decreasing substance use in adolescents (13-18 years old) with ADHD and a substance use disorder. Approximately 300 participants will be recruited at 11 sites and randomly assigned to either OROS-MPH or matching placebo for a 16-week treatment period, during which all participants will receive individual cognitive-behavioral therapy as a standardized treatment for substance abuse.</detailed_description>
