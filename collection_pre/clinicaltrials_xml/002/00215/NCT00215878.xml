	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to asses the effects of the NMDA receptor full agonist D-serine while used as adjuvant treatment for individuals suffering from chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dysfunction of neurotransmission mediated at NMDA receptor plays a cardinal role in the pathophysiology of PTSD and PTSD patients typically suffer from cognitive dysfunctions and avoidance&amp; depressive symptomatology that may be mediated by NMDA receptor function deficits. Thus, enhancement of NMDA activity by using D-serine may be beneficial in the treatment of PTSD. The study design involves two 6 week periods during which the participants will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with D-serine (~2g /dy)and placebo. This design allows each participant the opportunity to respond to the experimental treatment.</brief_summary>
