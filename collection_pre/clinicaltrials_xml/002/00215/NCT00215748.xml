	<brief_title>Reduced Dexamethasone Pre-Medication Dose in Elderly Patients Receiving Weekly Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dose-limiting edema and effusions associated with cumulative docetaxel administraton have necessitated the recommendation that all patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids such as dexamethasone prior to docetaxel administration. Dexamethasone pre-medication may also decrease the incidence and severity of acute hypersensitivity reactions associated with docetaxel administration. However, administration of weekly dexamethasone can cause additional untoward side effects, especially in the older population. If the data from this phase II study is encouraging, a study to evaluate an even lower dose of dexamethasone can be conducted.</detailed_description>
