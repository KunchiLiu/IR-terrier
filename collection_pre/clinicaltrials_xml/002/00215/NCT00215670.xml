	<criteria>Best corrected visual acuity in the study eye between 20/40 and 20/320 and better or equal to 20/800 in the fellow eye. Subfoveal CNV, secondary to AMD, w/ a total lesion size [including blood, scar/atrophy &amp; neovascularization] of less than or equal to 12 disc areas, of which at least 50% must be active CNV. Patients of either sex, aged greater than or equal to 50 years. Previous subfoveal thermal laser therapy. Any subfoveal scarring or atrophy &amp; no more than 25% of the total lesion size may be made up of scarring or atrophy. More than one prior PDT w/ Visudyne is not permitted. Pts may not have rec'd their 1st PDT w/in less than 8 wks or more than 13 wks prior to the BSL angiography/photography for the study.</criteria>
