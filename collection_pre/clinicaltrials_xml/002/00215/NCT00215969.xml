	<brief_summary>Pre-eclampsia is one of the most common causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to identify pregnant women at risk for pre-eclampsia or other cardiovascular complications at a very early state of the disease, and thereby improve the current method of screening.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study in Pregnant Women With Hypercoagulopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>600 pregnant women will be included in the project and followed in a standardized manner during their pregnancy. On a regular basis blood- and urine samples will be taken throughout their pregnancy and until 1 month after delivery and analyzed for a large variety of coagulation factors in order to identify factors that might predict an increased risk of developing pre-eclampsia and/or cardiovascular events. In addition a DNA-sample is taken if consented in order to evaluate genetic factors.</detailed_description>
