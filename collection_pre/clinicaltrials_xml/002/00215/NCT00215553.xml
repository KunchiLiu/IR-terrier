	<brief_summary>Lung wash with KL₄Surfactant of individual lung segments using a bronchoscope compared to usual care alone consisting primarily of assisted (mechanical) ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>KL₄Surfactant Treatment in Patients With ARDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multinational, multicenter, two-part, Phase 2 study that will evaluate the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of KL₄Surfactant in adult ARDS patients when administered by sequential bronchoscopic lavage into each of the 19 bronchopulmonary segments of the lung and as a bolus instillation into each lung.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Intubated and required mechanical ventilation support Met the criteria for ARDS PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mmHg and ≥ 60 mmHg within 60 minutes before randomization Mean blood pressure was ≥ 60 mmHg immediately before randomization Had ARDS due solely to a major trauma Was currently participating in another clinical trial or received an experimental drug or device within the previous month A woman of childbearing age, unless pregnancy was excluded by a negative urine hCG test or if the subject was surgically incapable of childbearing Had a previous episode of ARDS that resolved and then recurred during the current hospitalization Had a disease that was sufficiently advanced, in the best judgment of the Principal Investigator, to markedly limit life expectancy to &lt; 6 months Was known to have AIDS or symptomatic HIV (CD4 counts &lt;500). Subjects with asymptomatic HIV were not excluded Received chemotherapy or radiation within the previous 90 days Received an organ transplant other than corneal transplants Received, or was currently receiving, immunosuppression therapy within the last 6 months Had severe neurological damage or the presence of a disease that was likely to significantly prevent weaning from the ventilator Had a best Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of ≤ 8 or an intracranial pressure ≥ 20 cm H2O prior to the institution of sedatives or paralysis</criteria>
