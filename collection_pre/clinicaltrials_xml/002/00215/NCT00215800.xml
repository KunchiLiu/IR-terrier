	<brief_title>The Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Ampligen in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, equal parallel groups study conducted at up to fifteen (15) centers to compare the safety and efficacy of Ampligen速 IV versus placebo IV in 230-240 patients with CFS/ME. Patients will be randomized and stratified to receive either Ampligen速 intravenously or placebo (normal saline) intravenously. Fifty percent (50%) of the patients will be treated with Ampligen速 IV and 50% of the patients will be treated with placebo IV. Patients will be studied until 64 weeks (STAGES I plus II) have passed or until: 1) removed because of toxicity, 2) they withdraw voluntarily, 3) a change in the patient's medical condition makes continued participation unsafe, 4) the patient becomes non-compliant with the requirements of the protocol or 4) the Sponsor terminates the study. Official Title: A multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of poly I:poly C12U (Ampligen速) 400 mg IV twice weekly versus placebo in patients with severely debilitating chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) Further Study Details Enrollment = 234: Study Completed</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. A diagnosis of CFS, as defined by the Center for Disease Control (1988 CDC case definition) &gt; 12 months (Appendix D). 2. Age Range: &gt; 18 years old, &lt; 60 years old. 3. Males or nonpregnant, nonlactating females: Females must be of nonchild bearing potential (either postmenopausal for two (2) years or surgically sterile including tubal ligation) or using an effective means of contraception (birth control pills, intrauterine device, diaphragm). Females who are less than two (2) years postmenopausal, those with tubal ligations and those using contraception must have a negative serum pregnancy test within the two (2) weeks prior to the first study medication infusion. Females of child bearing potential agree to use an effective means of contraception from four (4) weeks prior to the baseline pregnancy test until four (4) weeks after the last study medication infusion. 4. A reduced quality of life as determined by a documented KPS of 40 to 60 on three (3) occasions, each at least 14 days apart, during the twelve (12) weeks immediately preceding the start of study drug infusions. The KPS must be rounded in increments of ten (10). 5. Ability to walk (minimum of 20 seconds) on the moving treadmill (grade = 0%; belt speed = 1 mph) on a minimum of two (2) occasions during the twelve (12) weeks immediately preceding study entry. 6. Laboratory documentation (baseline or historical following onset of CFS/ME) of a negative ANA or a negative antids (doublestranded) DNA, a negative Rheumatoid Factor, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). 7. Laboratory documentation that the patient is euthyroid (patients on thyroid replacement therapy must be on a stable dose during the eight (8) week washout period) based on a thyroid profile (T4, T3, TSH, T3 uptake and Free T4 index) performed during baseline. 8. Ability to provide written informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature of this study.</criteria>
