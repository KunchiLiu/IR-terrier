	<brief_title>Cardiac Tumors in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary cardiac tumors in children are extremely rare. Benign tumors are typically myxomas, lipomas, and rhabdomyomas, while malignant tumors are typically angiosarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas. Due to the rarity of these tumors, it is difficult to gather meaningful information regarding their natural history, pathology and treatment. The primary aims are to define the natural history of untreated cardiac tumors, study the pathology of primary cardiac tumors, review the surgical treatment and results of primary cardiac tumors and to determine the prognosis for these tumors. The secondary aims are to discover patterns and consistencies among primary cardiac tumors and to define the best treatment options for these patients. The study will be conducted through a retrospective chart review of about 70 patients.</detailed_description>
