	<brief_title>Ampligen in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An Open-Label Study of Poly I: Poly C12U (AmpligenÂ®) in Patients with Severely Debilitating Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME). The FDA approved the study for cost recovery. Patients enrolled in the study are responsible for costs related to the therapy, e.g., drug cost, infusion cost, cost of supplies, diagnostic and other laboratory testing.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (&gt;= 12 months) as defined by the 1988 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC case definition for CFS or as defined only by the 1994 CDC case definition of CFS (Fukuda et al., Ann Intern Med. 1994; 121:953959) (other clinical conditions which could present with similar symptoms must be excluded.). 2. Age Range: &gt;= 18 years old, &lt;= 70 years old. 3. Males or nonpregnant, nonlactating females: Females must be of nonchild bearing potential (either postmenopausal for two years or surgically sterile including tubal ligation) or using an effective means of contraception (birth control pills, intrauterine device, diaphragm). Alternatively, female patients with a male partner having a successful vasectomy (considered successful if a volunteer reports that a male partner has either documentation of azoospermia by microscopy or a vasectomy more than 2 years ago with no resultant pregnancy despite sexual activity postvasectomy).Females who are less than two (2) years postmenopausal, those with tubal ligations and those using contraception must have a negative serum pregnancy test at baseline within the four (4) weeks prior to the first study medication infusion. Every four weeks, and at study termination a pregnancy test should be performed, either serum or urine stick test. However, if the urine result is positive, a serum pregnancy test will be performed. Females of child bearing potential agree to use an effective means of contraception from four (4) weeks prior to the baseline pregnancy test until four (4) weeks after the last study medication infusion. All male patients agree not to be a sperm donor and to use an effective means of contraception while on study medication and until 90 days after the last study medication infusion. 4. A reduced quality of life as determined by a Karnofsky performance score (KPS) of &gt;= 20 and &lt;= 60. The KPS must be rounded in increments of ten (10). 5. Ability to provide written informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature of this study. 6. Documentation (during baseline or historically following the onset of CFS) of a negative ANA or a negative antids (doublestranded) DNA, a negative Rheumatoid Factor, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Documentation during baseline of a normal T4 (or other laboratory evidence that subject is euthyroid) is also required. 1. Inability to return for scheduled treatment and assessments. 2. Chronic or intercurrent acute medical disorder or disease making implementation or interpretation of the protocol or results difficult or unsafe. 3. Pregnant or lactating females. 4. Therapy with interferons, interleukins, or other cytokines or investigational drugs within 6 weeks of beginning study medication. Subjects must give written informed consent prior to discontinuation of investigational drugs.</criteria>
