	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this trial is to determine how well patients with gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma respond to chemotherapy with epirubicin, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil followed by continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy given along with radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Chemoradiation Therapy for Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients will receive epirubicin and cisplatin intravenously on day 1 of treatment. 5-fluorouracil will be given continuously by intravenous infusion bia a portable ambulatory pump (CADD pump) for 21 days. This cycle of chemotherapy will take 21 days (3 weeks). Once it is complete there will be one week without therapy. - Once the patient has recovered from any side-effects from the chemotherapy they will start the combination chemoradiation therapy, 5-fluorouracil and radiation. The radiation will be directed to the upper abdomen in the area where the stomach tumor has been located. The radiation therapy will be given five days a week for a total of five weeks. During these five weeks patients will receive 5-fluorouracil continuously by CADD pump. - After completion of combination chemoradiation therapy there will be a three to four week rest period followed by 2 additional chemotherapy cycles identical to the first chemotherapy cycle. - The following tests and procedures will be performed: physical examination every 4 weeks except during the chemoradiation therapy when it will be done weekly; blood tests every week during chemotherapy and chemoradiation; CT scans and chest x-rays done before therapy, at the end of therapy, and yearly for 2 years; noninvasive testing to evaluate kidney function before starting the study. - The program of chemotherapy and radiation therapy will last approximately 30 weeks. After all treatment is completed, patients will return for physical examinations and blood tests every 3 months for 3 years; then every 6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction. Adenocarcinomas of the esophagus that are not involving the gastroesophageal junction are not eligible. Patients must have had en bloc resection of all known tumor and be at high risk for later failure. The surgical resection must have been done with a curative intent. The stomach, lver, peritoneum, omentum and regional lymph nodes must be evaluated and all identified tumor be resected. The surgical specimen, and the pathologic analysis thereof, must be adequate for TNM staging. Treatment must begin between day 20 and day 56 after the gastrectomy.
