	<brief_summary>The first phase II trial with cetuximab and FOLFOX, as 1st line therapy for MCRC, presented at ASCO 2004, showed a 81% response rate, with no unexpected toxicities for the combination. This study is aimed at establishing the efficacy and safety of the combination cetuximab/XELOX as first line therapy in patients with MCRC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>XELOX Plus Cetuximab as First-Line Therapy in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The phase II trials with XELOX, demonstrated that is a highly effective first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer, with response rates similar to the regimens with oxaliplatin and infusional 5-FU/LV (FOLFOX), but more convenient and likely to be preferred by both patients and health care providers. Cetuximab has a significant anti-cancer activity in the setting of chemo-resistant disease which suggests that a much greater degree of benefit may ensue when it is used at an earlier stage of the disease course. The first phase II trial with cetuximab and FOLFOX, as 1st line therapy for MCRC, presented at ASCO 2004, showed a 81% response rate, with no unexpected toxicities for the combination. This study is aimed at establishing the efficacy and safety of the combination cetuximab/XELOX as first line therapy in patients with MCRC.</detailed_description>
