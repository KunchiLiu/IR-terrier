	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety of irinotecan and cisplatin in combination with either capecitabine or continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil and to see what effects (good and bad) these have on patients with unresectable, advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine or 5-Fluorouracil in Combination With Irinotecan and Cisplatin in Patients With Solid Tumor Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This is a Phase I dose escalation study. The dose of drug the patient receives will be assigned based upon when they enter the study. Since we are looking for the highest dose of capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil that can be given safely in combination with cisplatin and irinotecan, not everyone who participates in this study will be receiving the same amount of the drug. - There are four parts to this study: 1)Choice of treatment, 2)Evaluation, 3)Chemotherapy and 4)Follow-up. - The patient and the patient's doctor will decide which form of chemotherapy is best for the patient, either pill form or continuous infusion. Chemotherapy pills (capecitabine) are given twice per day for 14 days is a row every 3 weeks. Continuous infusion (5-fluorouracil) is given through a pump 24 hours a day for 14 days every 3 weeks. - Prior to initiation to therapy the extent of the patients cancer will be evaluated. This includes a CT scan, chest x-ray, EKG and bloodwork. - Patient's will receive chemotherapy for 2 weeks followed by a one week break. This will constitute one cycle. The medications cisplatin and irinotecan will be given intravenously on the 1st and 8th day of each cycle. Following the rest period the next cycle of chemotherapy begins. - Following 2 cycles of chemotherapy, the patients cancer will be re-evaluated. A CT scan and bloodwork will be obtained and will be compared to the previous studies. Treatment will resume if the cancer is the same size or smaller than before and the patient is tolerating the chemotherapy well. The cancer will be re-evaluated every 2 cycles of chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
