	<brief_summary>SURFAXIN® (lucinactant) treatment will be examined in very low birth weight infants to prevent development of chronic lung disease, commonly known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), in premature infants who have required continued intubation and received surfactants for the prevention or treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SURFAXIN® Treatment for Prevention of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) in Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) Infants.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Determine the safety and tolerability of SURFAXIN administration in the first weeks of life as a therapeutic approach for prevention of BPD. Determine whether treatment with SURFAXIN during the first two to three weeks of life can decrease the proportion of infants on mechanical ventilation or oxygen or the incidence of death or BPD in VLBW infants when assessed at 28 days of life and 36 weeks post-menstrual age (as determined by the need for supplemental oxygen).</detailed_description>
