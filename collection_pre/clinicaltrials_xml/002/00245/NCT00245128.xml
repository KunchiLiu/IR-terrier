	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of imatinib mesylate and how well it works in treating patients with myelofibrosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of imatinib mesylate in patients with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. - Determine the 3-, 6-, and 12-month major and minor erythroid response rates in patients treated with this drug. Secondary - Determine reduction in marrow fibrosis in patients treated with this drug. - Determine decrease in spleen size in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized, pilot study. Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who do not experience a minor erythroid response or a 50% reduction in spleen size after 6 months of treatment are removed from the study. Patients experiencing clinical benefit (e.g., ongoing erythroid response) after 1 year of treatment may continue treatment with imatinib mesylate as above at the discretion of the principal investigator. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
