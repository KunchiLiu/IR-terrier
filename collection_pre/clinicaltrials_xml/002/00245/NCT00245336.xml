	<brief_title>Study of Recombinant Human Thrombin for Bleeding During Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3 multiple site, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of rhThrombin and bovine thrombin in patients undergoing spinal surgery, hepatic resection, peripheral arterial bypass surgery, or arteriovenous graft formation for hemodialysis access. After establishing eligibility, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive rhThrombin (1000 U/mL) or bovine thrombin (1000 U/mL). During a surgical procedure, study participants will be treated with blinded study drug (rhThrombin or bovine thrombin) in combination with an absorbable gelatin sponge at appropriate bleeding evaluation site(s) and time to hemostasis (TTH) will be assessed for up to 10 minutes. Bleeding appropriate for TTH evaluation is defined as mild to moderate bleeding, either on its own or remaining after brisk bleeding has been controlled by standard surgical modalities. Blinded study drug may also be used at additional appropriate bleeding sites. Study participants will have follow-up visits at about 2 days and 1 month after surgery. Approximately 400 to 600 patients will participate in the study. The final sample size will be determined based on blinded interim results.</detailed_description>
