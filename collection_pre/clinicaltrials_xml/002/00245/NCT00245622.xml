	<detailed_description>A 2 arm, 52 week parallel-group of Tovaxin versus placebo in subjects with CIS or RR-MS. Subjects who provide written, informed consent will complete screening and procurement assessments and provide blood to be used for vaccine production. Eligible subjects will be enrolled to receive either Tovaxin or placebo and will complete baseline assessments. Randomization and enrolled subjects will receive study treatment by subcutaneous injections at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24. Subjects will be monitored by CBC, serum chemistries, urinalysis, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), MSFC, MSQLI, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and monitor myelin reactive T cells for safety, efficacy, and tolerability of Tovaxin.</detailed_description>
