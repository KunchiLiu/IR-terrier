	<brief_summary>Primary efficacy endpoint: To study whether there is a difference in the length of the bleeding free periods between infusion of FVIII that is reconstituted with 22.1, 12.6, or 4.2 mg of pegylated liposomes per kg bwt compared with standard formulation. Safety endpoint: To study the safety and tolerability of Kogenate FS reconstituted with Pegylated liposomes</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Efficacy of Human Recombinant Factor VIII (Kogenate FS) Reconstituted in Pegylated Liposomes.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each subject will receive treatment for three bleeding episodes ("wash-in", on demand injections) followed by a minimum 4 day wash-out. Following this each subject will be randomized to a specific treatment order. Each order consists of four identical blocks. In each block the following three injections will be given: 1 One prophylactic treatment (randomized solution for dissolution) 2 and 3. Two standard on-demand treatments for a spontaneous bleeding episode (standard Kogenate FS). Each block will be followed by a four day wash-out. In total each subject should receive 3+4x3=15 injections. It is estimated that each subject will be in the study for about 4 months. A treatment for a spontaneous bleeding episode may require more than one infusion.</detailed_description>
