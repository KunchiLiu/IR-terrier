	<brief_summary>This study will assess the efficacy of topiramate in the treatment of pathological gambling. Pathological gambling (PG) is a debilitating disorder, generally leading to severe personal, familial, financial, social, and occupational impairments. In PG, the patient experiences a progressive inability to resist impulses to gamble, and gambling significantly disrupt the patient's functioning in the personal, familial, and/or vocational spheres. Topiramate has shown preliminary evidence of efficacy in some impulse control disorders.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a 14-week, outpatient, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study of topiramate in subjects with pathological gambling. After giving informed consent, subjects who meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria may be enrolled. The study will consist of three phases: - Washout/Screening Phase (up to 28 days prior to randomization or longer for those medications requiring a longer washout period; - Double-Blind Phase (Titration: up to 6 weeks; Maintenance: 8 weeks); and - Taper Phase (approximately 1 week). The study medication will be titrated to 300 mg/day or the subject's maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Subjects must reach a minimum dose of 50 mg/day by Week 2. The taper phase will last approximately one week where subjects gradually reduce their medication until they are no longer taking study medication. Patient may also give an optional blood sample for pharmacogenomic testing</detailed_description>

If the repeat study is within the limits of the protocol the subject may be randomized. pulmonary disorders including subjects with active tuberculosis; endocrinological disorders; neurological disorders including subjects with seizure disorders and subjects with progressive or degenerative neurological disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis); or any disease or condition that compromises the function of those body systems that could result in altered absorption, excess accumulation, or impaired metabolism or excretion of topiramate. 14.
