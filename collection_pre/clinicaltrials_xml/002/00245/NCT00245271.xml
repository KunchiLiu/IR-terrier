	<brief_title>Safety of OMS103HP in Patients Undergoing Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is an important stabilizer of the knee. Orthopedic surgeons replace the torn ligament during ACL reconstruction surgery. Surgical trauma initiates an acute inflammatory response, including swelling and pain, that leads to restricted joint motion and loss of function. Because of the dynamic nature, complexity and redundancy of the chemical mediators of inflammation and pain and their pathways, no currently available single drug has sufficiently broad spectrum of activity to effectively inhibit the inflammatory process. OMS103 provides a multicomponent approach to controlling the inflammation induced by arthroscopic surgery. It delivers three active ingredients, each with distinct pharmacological activities, directly to the site of surgical procedures to preemptively block the inflammatory cascade induced by surgical trauma.</detailed_description>
