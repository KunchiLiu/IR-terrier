	<brief_title>Fluoxetine in Pediatric Body Dysmorphic Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BDD usually begins in childhood or adolescence, but its treatment in pediatric populations has not been investigated. Recent data suggests that adults with BDD may respond to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) such as fluoxetine (Prozac). Preliminary findings from case reports suggest that SRIs may also be effective in the treatment of BDD in children and adolescents. This study is the first large-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled medication trial of fluoxetine for children and adolescents with BDD. Participants should be aged 16 or younger. Participation in this trial will last approximately 14 weeks.</detailed_description>
