	<brief_summary>The benefit-risk-balance of the isopropanolic Cimicifuga racemosa extract (iCR) is compared with tibolone in menopausal symptoms treatment. Menopausal patients aged 40 - 60 years and with a Kupperman Menopause Index (KMI) equal or more than 15 participate and were assigned to either iCR corresponding to 40 mg crude drug/day (n=122) or tibolone 2,5 mg/day (n=122) orally. The primary endpoint is the benefit-risk balance at end of treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The benefit-risk-balance of the isopropanolic Cimicifuga racemosa extract (iCR) is compared with tibolone in menopausal symptoms treatment. The randomized, double-blind, controlled 3-month study in 5 centres of 3 cities in China enrolled 244 menopausal patients aged 40 - 60 years and with a Kupperman Menopause Index (KMI) equal or more than 15. The participants were assigned to either iCR corresponding to 40 mg crude drug/day (n=122) or tibolone 2,5 mg/day (n=122) orally. The primary endpoint is the combination of the Mann-Whitney values (MWV) of the KMI and the frequency of adverse events (benefit-risk balance) at end of treatment.</detailed_description>
