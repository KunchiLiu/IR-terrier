	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether the application form of etheric oils (camphor, cineol and menthol) causes changes in the concentration of this agents in the exhaled air. The second aim of the study is to determine differences in the subjective convenience of the application forms. We will test an commercial ointment application vs. smart textiles. Smart textiles are new high-tech products with the unique possibility to combine the textiles with functional products e.g. pharmaceutical agents.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>On the first appointment recruitment investigations will take place. After the person is enrolled to the study, the first determination of substances concentration in exhaled air and the convenience grade of the application form being exposed to will be achieved (study day 1). After a 7 days lasting washout phase on study day 2 newly determination of substances concentration and convenience grade of the other application will be assessed. Each study day will have an approximate duration of 11 h. During this time 9 samples of the persons exhaled air will be collected.</detailed_description>
