	<brief_summary>This was a study to compare less intense immunosuppression with a more traditional approach. The hypothesis was that less immunosuppression will provide similar protection against rejection than typical 2-3 drug therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Outcomes of Lower Immunosuppression Versus Traditional Immunosuppression in Heart Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a prospective, randomized, controlled (open-label) trial of 2 different strategies of immunosuppression in de novo post-heart transplant patients. The hypothesis was that immunosuppression with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, coupled with rapid steroid weaning would provide similar anti-rejection efficacy as tacrolimus with only a 2 week course of mycophenolate mofetil but including the same rapid steroid wean. The primary endpoint was the mean International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) biopsy score over the first 6 months post-transplant. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of adverse events over the first year post-transplant, as well as all-cause mortality, 12 month ISHLT biopsy score (mean), along with the incidence of proven cytomegalovirus disease. In addition, the incidence of allograft vasculopathy as assessed by angiography or intravascular ultrasound was compared between groups.</detailed_description>
