	<brief_title>Study of COLAL-PRED® in the Treatment of Moderate Acute Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis is a disease that causes inflammation of the large bowel, causing fever, diarrhoea, dehydration and other symptoms. Standard treatment for ulcerative colitis includes general medical treatments such as fluid and salt replacement and attention to diet. Anti-inflammatory medicines such as steroids (e.g. prednisolone) and aminosalicylates (e.g. mesalazine) are the main drug treatments. This study will investigate whether COLAL-PRED®, a novel dosage form of a prednisolone ester, is safe and effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, compared with the standard treatment (conventional prednisolone) and also to determine which dose which will work best for future patients.</detailed_description>
