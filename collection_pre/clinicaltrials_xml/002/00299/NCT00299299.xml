	<brief_summary>This study tests the feasibility and reproducibility of patient-specific motion models. These will be used for quantification of safe margin reduction. Patient-specific motion models will be built by post-processing 4D MRI data with non-rigid registration. By comparing these models between visits, model reproducibility will be assessed, and the methodology refined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modelling Internal Hepatic Movement With an External Abdominal Marker</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will use a real time position management (RPM) system for respiratory gating. The RPM system senses the respiration motion of the patient by tracking a pair of reflective markers on a lightweight "marker block" constructed of a synthetic material. This block is placed on the patient's abdomen. During Radiotherapy, the beam is only switched on at pre-determined phases of respiration. The appropriate phase of respiration is determined by the RPM system. This implies a reliable correlation of external block motion to internal hepatic movement. This correlation is not a simple one, and requires "modeling".</detailed_description>
