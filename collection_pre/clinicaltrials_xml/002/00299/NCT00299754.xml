	<brief_summary>Most studies of labour induction with misoprostol used doses higher than 25mg and intervals of 3-4 hours. We studied a low-dose regime of 25mg misoprostol and compared its efficacy as single dose or double dose with dosing interval of 6 hours to our current regime of 3 mg dinoprostone pessary.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Of Misoprostol And Dinoprostone Vaginal Pessaries for Cervical Priming (TROMAD Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>171 women with singleton term pregnancies and modified Bishop score (mBS) ≤ 5 were recruited and randomized into 3 arms: current dinoprostone regime, double dose misoprostol or single dose misoprostol. The primary outcome was the number of women who achieved favourable mBS&gt;6 or active labour by Day 2. Secondary outcomes were time interval from insert to active labour or delivery, abnormal uterine activity, delivery method and adverse neonatal outcome.</detailed_description>
