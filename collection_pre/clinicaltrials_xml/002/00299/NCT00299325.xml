	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To assess the effect of rimonabant on visceral fat area over a period of 12 months when prescribed with a mild hypocaloric diet in abdominally obese patients with metabolic syndrome Secondary objectives: - To assess the effect of rimonabant over a period of 12 months on: - Liver fat content using CT scan (Computed Tomography scan) - Anthropometric measures (weight, waist circumference, body composition using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)) - Lipid, lipoprotein profile - Glycemia, insulinemia and HbA1c - Adipokines, inflammatory and hemostatic markers - To evaluate the percentage of patients with metabolic syndrome at 12 months - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of rimonabant in these patients In four selected US sites the effect of rimonabant at 12 months will be also assessed on: - Basal lipolysis and insulin suppressed lipolysis (euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp). - Resting metabolic rate and substrate oxidation at rest using indirect calorimetry. - Adipose tissue histology and expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism (superficial adipose tissue biopsy).</brief_summary>
