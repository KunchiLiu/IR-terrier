	<brief_summary>This Phase I study will evaluate the safety of two doses of BG00001 at different doses and intervals. Eligible subjects will have: - malignant pleural mesothelioma, or - pleural effusions who have progressed through at least one prior therapy or have refused therapy BG00001 is given twice through a catheter in the pleural space.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ad.hIFN-β (BG00001) is a replication-defective recombinant adenoviral vector containing the human interferon-beta (hIFN-β) gene. This Phase I study is designed to evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of two doses of intrapleural (IP) Ad.hIFN-β in subjects with pleural malignancies either metastatic or pleural mesothelioma. Five dose levels will be studied: - Dose levels 1, 2, and 3 will be given on Days 1 and 15 - Dose levels 4 and 5 will be given on Days 1 and 8</detailed_description>
