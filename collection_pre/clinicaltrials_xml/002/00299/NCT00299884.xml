	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and non-inferiority of a lipid-lowering medication regimen comprised of the medications ezetimibe and fenofibrate taken daily, versus atorvastatin daily in lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) cholesterol. Additionally, other aims would include effects on other types of blood cholesterol and examining the safety of the ezetimibe and fenofibrate regimen, as compared to atorvastatin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atorvastatin Versus Ezetimibe and Fenofibrate as a Lipid-lowering Strategy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It has been demonstrated in several previous primary and secondary studies that lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with the use of medications such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors improves mortality and morbidity related to cardiovascular events in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Such inhibitors, which are known as 'statins', act to block the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. These medications are generally well tolerated by the vast majority of patients, but a small number experience side effects, most seriously those of myopathies, rhabdomyolysis and elevated liver enzymes - recognition of this fact, that statins are not universally without problems, highlights the need for viable alternatives. Ezetimibe is a relatively new medication in Canada, approved for use in patients with cholesterol problems. It is an intestinal cholesterol binder that is known to be well-tolerated, with side effects similar to placebo. Alone, it has a modest effect in the lowering of LDL-C. Fenofibrate is a medication that also works through the liver and has long been used to adjust blood lipid levels in patients with mixed lipid problems. Alone it also has a modest effect in the lowering of LDL-C. Recent study, however, has shown that the effect of ezetimibe and fenofibrate together in the lowering of LDL-C is greater than that of either drug alone. This combination, if as effective in this regard as atorvastatin, would prove a valid alternative to the use of the atorvastatin in the lowering of LDL-C, and a benefit for patients who have had problems tolerating statin therapy but still require medication for elevated cholesterol.</detailed_description>
