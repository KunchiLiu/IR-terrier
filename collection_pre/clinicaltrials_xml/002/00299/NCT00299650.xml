	<brief_title>Systematic Early Use of Neuromuscular Blocking Agents in ARDS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) in ARDS patients has not been extensively investigated. It has been recently demonstrated that a systematic 48-h infusion of NMBA is associated with a significant improvement in oxygenation as compared with a control group (Gainnier et al., Crit Care Med 2004). Moreover, a trend towards a reduction in the mortality rate has been observed. The aim of the study is to show a reduction of the mortality rate of ARDS patients.</detailed_description>
