	<brief_title>A Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Golimumab (CNTO 148) in Subjects With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Previously Treated With Biologic Anti-TNFa Agent(s)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Golimumab is a fully human protein (antibody) which binds to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa). TNFa is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and plays a major role in causing the joint pain, swelling and damage from RA. Other marketed drugs that target TNFa (anti-TNFa drugs) have been shown to be effective in reducing the symptoms, signs and joint damage of RA, but have limitations with respect to safety and ease of use. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of a new anti-TNFa drug, golimumab, at 2 doses, injected under the skin every 4 weeks in subjects with active RA previously treated with at least 1 dose of a biologic anti-TNFa agent (etanercept, adalimumab or infliximab). Concomitant therapy with methotrexate, sulfasalazine and/or hydroxychloroquine is permitted if the subject has tolerated these medications for at least 12 weeks prior to the first administration of study drug and is on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent. The study hypothesis is that golimumab will be a safe and effective treatment for RA in subjects with active RA previously treated with at least one biologic anti-TNFa agent as measured by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria, the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) responses and the change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), without causing unacceptable significant adverse effects. The ACR response criteria were designed to assess the level of improvement in the signs and symptoms of RA. The DAS28 responses also measure improvement in the signs and symptoms of RA using the joint examination and laboratory testing. The HAQ is a series of questions that measure a subject's impairment in physical function caused by RA. Patients will receive golimumab 50 mg or 100 mg or placebo injections under the skin every 4 weeks until Week 24. After Week 24, all subjects receive golimumab 50 mg or 100 mg injections, and golimumab continues for all groups every 4 weeks for about 4 and a half more years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients have a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (according to the revised 1987 criteria of the ACR) for at least 3 months prior to screening Have active RA as defined by persistent disease activity with at least 4 swollen and 4 tender joints, at the time of screening and baseline Must have been previously treated with at least one dose of etanercept, adalimumab, or infliximab If currently using methotrexate, sulfasalazine and/or hydroxychloroquine must have tolerated these agents for at least 12 weeks and be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent If using NSAIDs or other analgesics must be on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent If using oral corticosteroids must be on a stable dose equivalent to &lt;= 10 mg of prednisone/day for at least 2 weeks prior to first administration of study agent Are considered eligible according to specified tuberculosis (TB) screening criteria. Patients cannot have other inflammatory diseases other than RA that might interfere with the evaluation of the benefit of golimumab therapy No history of treatment with natalizumab, rituximab or cytotoxic agents No history of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis or optic neuritis or of concurrent congestive heart failure (CHF), lymphoproliferative disease, known malignancy or history of malignancy within the previous 5 years (with the exception of a nonmelanoma skin cancer that has been treated with no evidence of recurrence) No history of, or ongoing, chronic or recurrent infectious disease No serious infection within 2 months prior to first administration of study agent.</criteria>
