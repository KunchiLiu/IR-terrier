	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of sequential cord blood transplantation (2 cord blood units) for patients who have diseases that are capable of being cured by allogeneic stem cell transplant but do not have a matched family or volunteer unrelated donor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of Sequential Cord Blood Transplants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients will receive conditioning therapy with fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day x 6 days, melphalan 100 mg/m2/day x 1 day, rabbit antithymocyte globulin 1.5 mg/kg/day x 4 days. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of cyclosporine starting on day -1 and mycophenolate mofetil starting on day 0. Sequential cord blood units will be infused on Day 0.</detailed_description>
