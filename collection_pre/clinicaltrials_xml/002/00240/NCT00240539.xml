	<brief_summary>This study is performed to evaluate the persistence of anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs) antibodies up to 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 years after administration of the first dose of the study vaccine, Engerix-Bâ„¢. No new subjects will be recruited in this long-term follow-up study. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Follow-Up Study 16-20 Years After Hepatitis B Vaccination in Newborns of Mothers Who Were Seropositive for Hepatitis B Envelope Antigen (HBeAg) &amp; Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary study was to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of hepatitis B vaccine administered according to a 0, 1, 2, 12 month schedule in newborns of anti-hepatitis B envelope antigen positive (HBeAg+) and anti-hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg+) mothers. Results from the primary study have shown that the vaccine was immunogenic and protected neonates of HBeAg positive mothers against hepatitis B chronic carriage. The present study is carried out to evaluate the anti-HBs persistence and the prevalence and incidence of other hepatitis B markers (HBsAg, anti-hepatitis B core antigen {anti-HBc}, HBeAg, Alanine aminotransferase/Aspartate aminotransferase {ALT/AST}), and the clinical significance of the HBsAg and anti-HBc positive cases observed during the long-term from year 16-20. No vaccine will be administered during the long term follow up period.</detailed_description>
