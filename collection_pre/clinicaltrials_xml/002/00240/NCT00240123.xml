	<brief_title>Effect of Benadryl Sedation During ERCP or EUS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The usual sedatives used for endoscopy are meperidine (Demerol) and midazolam (Versed). Benadryl (Diphenhydramine) is often used in addition to these medications in an effort to improve sedation. There is little published information regarding the use of diphenhydramine in conscious sedation. It is recognized that certain patients have features that predict difficult sedation such as prescription sedative use or heavy alcohol use. In addition, prolonged procedures like ERCP and EUS require higher doses of sedatives. Diphenhydramine may improve the quality of sedation in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) procedures. You are being asked to participate because you are already scheduled to undergo one of these procedures.</detailed_description>
