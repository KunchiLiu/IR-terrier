	<brief_title>Study of Cetuximab in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin Expressing EGFR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin are often bad responders to conventional chemotherapy included cisplatin. The investigation of the EGFR expression may allow identifying new molecular targets for novel therapeutic strategies in patients with locally advanced or metastatic SCC of the skin. Several publications in the literature for primary lesions and one publication for metastatic lesions showed that EGFR was expressed in 80-90% of SCC of the skin. Immunohistochemistry studies performed at the Gustave Roussy Institute confirm these data: they found an over-expression of EGFR in 90% of patients with metastatic disease. These results are in favor of the investigation of cetuximab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic SCC of the skin expressing EGFR. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody targeted against EGFR administered weekly by intravenous route; it may be prescribed as out hospital to patients with locally advanced or metastatic SCC of the skin expressing EGFR. Due to the low occurrence of locally advanced or metastatic SCC of the skin, a multicenter trial will be required.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological SCC of the skin expressing (IHC) moderately or highly the EGFR (++ and +++, on a semiquantitative scale). Locally advanced or metastatic SCC of the skin not suitable for local surgery with documented progression. Presence of at least one measurable target lesion by RECIST criteria. At least one lesion accessible to biopsies. ECOG Performance status &lt; 2. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months. Age &gt; 18 years. Normal hematological (Neutrophils &gt; 1.5x109 cells/l, platelets &gt; 100x109 cells/l), hepatic (bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN); alkaline phosphatase and transaminases &lt; 5 x UNL in case of hepatic metastases or &lt; 2.5 x UNL in absence of hepatic metastases) and renal (serum creatinine &lt; 150 micromol/L) functions. Written informed consent. In case of second tumor,excepted carcinoma of the cervix and adequately treated basal or squamous cell skin carcinoma, the possibility for including a patient may be discussed with the principal investigator.

Patients (male and female) not using effective contraception if of reproductive potential. Females pregnant or lactating. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior to start each cycle of treatment.</criteria>
