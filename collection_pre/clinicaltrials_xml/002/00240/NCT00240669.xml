	<brief_summary>Primary objective : To evaluate the quality of fractures setting and osteotomy of the facial massif osteosynthesised with resorbable device PLLA/PGA compared with usual Titanium plates. Secondary objective : - To evaluate the resorbable device ergonomy versus Titanium. - To evaluate the clinical tolerance of resorbable device versus Titanium. Hypothesis : Osteosynthesis with resorbable device demonstrates a non inferiority success probability regarding the success observed in osteosynthesis with Titanium, with a less important probability of re-operation. Study duration : 14 months for each patient. Study treatment : - Group I : Resorbable device PLLA/PGA. - Group II : Titanium device. Study visits : - Screening visit - Baseline with randomization and surgery - Day1 - Day 21 - Day 45(Traumatology)/Day 90 (orthognatic) â€“ Month 6,12 and 14. Randomization : Stratification by centres, mono or bimaxillar surgery and traumatologic or orthognatic criteria.</brief_summary>
