	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of alemtuzumab after kidney transplantation as part of a multitherapy regimen to prevent kidney graft loss and death and to avoid steroids and chronic use of calcineurin inhibitors in pediatric renal transplant recipients 1 to 20 years of age.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety in Immunomodulatory Functions of Alemtuzumab (Campath) in Pediatric Kidney Transplantation Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation is widely considered to be the treatment of choice for children with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Improvements in surgical techniques, donor selection, and immunosuppression practices, as well as the enhanced experience of specialized pediatric transplant teams, have all led to marked improvements in patient and kidney graft survival in infants and young children ages 1 to 10. However, young children now have more infections following transplant previously. Also, improved graft survival is not observed in pediatric renal transplant recipients 11 to 17 years of age. Some studies do indicate that the poor long term outcome of patient and kidney survival observed in this age group may be caused by noncompliance with immunosuppressive medications. Therefore, protocols that minimize the use of immunosuppressive medications while retaining kidney function are necessary for improving graft and patient survival in children. This study will evaluate the safety of a regimen containing alemtuzumab after kidney transplantation, followed by steroid avoidance and calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal in pediatric renal transplant recipients 1 to 20 years of age. The accrual period is scheduled for 18 months. The study follow-up period will last 24 months. All participants enrolled will undergo this treatment schedule: 1.) All participants will receive intravenous alemtuzumab one day before transplantation and 1 day after transplantation. 2.) Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) will be administered orally no later than 2 days after transplantation. 3.) Participants will begin to take oral tacrolimus twice a day 1 to 3 days after transplantation until Weeks 8 through 12 when 4.) Sirolimus will be initiated. 5.) Sirolimus and MMF will be taken orally until Month 24. Blood collection will occur at baseline, 1 day before transplant, at Days 1 and 3, at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and at Months 3 through 24. Scheduled kidney (renal) biopsies will be performed at transplant, during Weeks 8 through 12, immediately before conversion to sirolimus, and at Months 6 and 24.</detailed_description>
