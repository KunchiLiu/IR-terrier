	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was test non-inferiority of telmisartan 80 mg + hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg in comparison to amlodipine 10 mg + HCTZ 12.5 mg in reducing ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval (determined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: ABPM) in elderly patients with predominantly systolic hypertension.</brief_summary>
