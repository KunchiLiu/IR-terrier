	<brief_title>Follow-up Study 16-20 Years After Primary Vaccination Against Hepatitis B of Newborns From HBeAg+ &amp; HBsAg+ Mothers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary study was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of hepatitis B vaccine in newborns of HBeAg+ and HBsAg+ mothers in comparison with a historical control group. The present study is carried out to evaluate the anti-HBs persistence 16-20 years after the first vaccine dose and to further investigate the prevalence and incidence of other hepatitis B markers and the clinical significance of these at all time points from Year 16-20. No additional subjects will be recruited during this long-term follow-up study and no vaccine will be administered.</detailed_description>
