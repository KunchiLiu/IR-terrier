	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to observe the effects of RA over a long period in order to learn which of the early characteristics of patients' early RA predict future joint damage and disability. We also investigate whether certain treatments can prevent or slow the development of joint damage and disability. Additionally, the costs and effects of RA on the patient are studied in order to improve the methods used to measure these effects. Clinical, demographic, radiographic, and laboratory measures are taken by the rheumatologist in the office. In addition, patient questionnaires are mailed &amp; completed by the patient and returned to the coordinating center at UCLA. All information obtained by these means will be studied in their effects on early, severe RA.</brief_summary>
