	<criteria>Clinical indication for coronary catheterization. Target Coronary Artery: The target vessel must have .50% reduction in lumen diameter by angiographic visual estimation throughout a segment of at least 40 mm in length (the target segment) and the vessel must be large enough to accommodate the IVUS catheter. A lesion of up to 60% is permitted distal to the target segment. Side branches of the target (imaged) vessel may be narrowed up to 70% by visual estimation, provided the target segment contains no lesion greater than 50%. Use of lipidlowering medication for more than 3 months within the previous 12 months. Longer periods of treatment are not permitted because of the potential effects of such therapy on coronary atherosclerosis. Subjects receiving treatment with a lipidlowering medication within the past 4 weeks require a 4week washout period following which a baseline lipid profile will be taken at visit 2. Clinically significant heart disease which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator (or designee), is likely to require coronary bypass surgery, cardiac transplantation, surgical repair and/or replacement during the course of the study.</criteria>
