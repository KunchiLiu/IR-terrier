	<brief_title>Bimodal Analgesia as Form of Pain Control Post Long Bone Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective, randomized, control trial looking at the benefit of bimodal analgesia in the treatment of long bone fractures. The traditional pain control regimen following fracture fixation typically involves a course of narcotics on an as-needed basis for pain relief. Recent data has shown that adding NSAIDS to the pain regimen as part of a bimodal approach to pain control, improves the efficacy of pain management and reduces narcotic use. Laboratory research on NSAIDs as it pertains to bone healing, however, has shown in animal models that there may be a positive association between NSAIDS and non-union rates. In other words, NSAIDS may prevent or delay bone healing. These results, however, have not been tested prospectively in humans. The purpose of this study is to look at the combination of NSAIDS and narcotics post long bone fracture and monitor the effects on narcotic use and healing rates to ultimately and conclusively establish the risk or benefit of NSAIDS after long bone fracture.</detailed_description>
