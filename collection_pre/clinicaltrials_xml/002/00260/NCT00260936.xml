	<brief_title>Metabolic Abnormalities - HIV Infected and Uninfected Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study involves a one-time collection of health and medical history data, blood and urine specimens, and physical assessments. This study will elucidate the need for a further in-depth study to understand the pathophysiological effects of protease inhibitor (PI)-based and non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based therapies in young men.</detailed_description>
