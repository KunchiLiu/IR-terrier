	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to see if subjects with Parkinson's disease who are experiencing motor fluctuations ("on" and "off" states) and dyskinesias (involuntary excessive movements) would benefit from a higher dose of Requip as compared to the maximum FDA approved dose of dopamine agonist drugs (including Requip, Mirapex, and Permax). Requip as used in this study is investigational, which means it has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at this dose level.</brief_summary>
