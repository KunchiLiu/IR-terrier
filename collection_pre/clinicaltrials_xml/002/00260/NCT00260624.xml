	<brief_title>Escitalopram Treatment of Patients With Agitated Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed for men and women over 60 who have an established diagnosis of mild to severe Alzheimer's disease and who also present behaviors of agitation such as restlessness, physical aggression, yelling and socially inappropriate interactions. While nonpharmacologic interventions are preferable, many times they are not effective alone. Each consented subject will be enrolled in a 12 week study with escitalopram, 10 or 20 mg per day. Each subject will be evaluated using rating scales designed for symptoms of Alzheimer's and agitated behavior. Each subject will also undergo physical and neurological examinations, laboratory tests and monitoring of side effects of escitalopram.</detailed_description>
