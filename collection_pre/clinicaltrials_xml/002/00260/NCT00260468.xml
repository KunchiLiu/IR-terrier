	<brief_summary>The objective of this project is to examine the state of the brain in people over 50 years old suffering from late-onset depression by means of an extensive clinical assessment programme, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neuropsychological testing, neurological examination, eye examination as well as blood and saliva samples. The results are to be compared with results from a control group matched for gender and age.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Abnormalities in Late-Onset Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depression is a frequent and serious disorder with different prognoses and complications with respect to lack of treatment response, recurrence and suicide. MRI of the brain can provide information about changes in the brain tissue with depression, e.g. lesions of nerve connections, small thrombi or changes in the blood flow. These changes appear primarily after the age of 50 and are seen in cases of diabetes and high blood pressure. Furthermore, the connection between disruptions in the body's stress response system and depression will be explored, which is very important since studies indicate that stress and depression can affect certain brain parts permanently. This will give us a better understanding of the connection between brain changes, neuropsychology and depression prognosis, which is decisive for accurate diagnostics, effective treatment and targeted prevention of the disease in the long run. The project is part of a larger clinical assessment programme in the Neuropsychiatric Unit under the Centre for Basic Psychiatric Research, Aarhus Psychiatric Hospital, Denmark, which gives us unique possibilities of combining research and daily clinical work. The hope is in the future to be able to offer patients in the risk group better assessment and treatment to prevent complications and recurrence.</detailed_description>
