	<brief_summary>Growing evidence supports the notion that Late-onset Dysthymic disorder in middle aged men may be associated with age-related HPG hypofunctioning. In this study we seek to examine the efficacy of Testosterone replacement for this condition. Hypothesis: Testosterone replacement will be more effective than placebo, in treating men with late onset Dysthymic Disorder and hypo-gonadism.</brief_summary>
