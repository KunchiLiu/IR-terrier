	<brief_summary>Excessive rise in pulmonary artery pressure induced by low oxygen tension (hypoxia) is one of the factors implicated in high-altitude pulmonary oedema. Plasma ET1 increases in subjects exposed to high altitude and is correlated to pulmonary artery pressure. The aim of the study is to investigate whether blockade of ET1 receptors would reduce the acute rise in systolic pulmonary artery pressure induced by hypoxia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will be examined on a variable load supine bicycle ergometer. The exercise table will be tilted laterally by 20 to 30 degrees to the left. PASP will be assessed using Doppler echocardiography at rest and during during supine bicycle exercise in NORMOXIA and hypoxia. Exposure to normobaric hypoxia will be performed by breathing a hypoxic gas mixture at sea level during 90 minutes (12,3 % O2 + 87.7 % N2) reproducing conditions at 4300 m altitude. Exercise will be started at an initial workload of 40 watts and increased by 10 watts every minute to reach a workload level defined by a heart rate (HR) corresponding to 50% of the estimated maximal aerobic power</detailed_description>
