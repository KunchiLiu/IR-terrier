	<brief_title>The Use of Anabolic Steroids to Improve Function After Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal cord injury results in significant loss of muscle mass. Oxandrolone, a derivative of testosterone, is an anabolic steroid shown to promote gain in body weight and muscle mass after trauma, severe illness, surgery, burns, and stress. To date there are no studies that have evaluated the effect of oxandrolone in persons with chronic spinal cord injury. This study will assess the effect of oxandrolone on strength, metabolic rate, lean body mass, pulmonary function, and ambulation in persons with chronic SCI. This study has the potential to yield valuable information concerning the use of oxandrolone after SCI.</detailed_description>
