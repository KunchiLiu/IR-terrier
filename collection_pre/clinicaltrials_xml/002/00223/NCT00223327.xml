	<brief_summary>This protocol is for a clinical trial to evaluate the reliability of the bite fork as a diagnostic instrument in subjects with pulpal necrosis and apical periodontitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurement of Bite Force in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial consists of two parts. We will first use the bite fork in normal volunteers to evaluate its test-retest and inter-rater reliability. We will then use the bite fork in subjects with differing endodontic diagnoses and compare these results with the standard clinical diagnostic test (percussion).</detailed_description>
