	<criteria>1. Patient is the recipient of a cadaveric or living donor renal transplant. 2. Patient was &gt; 12 years of age at the time of transplant. 3. Patient is at least 3 months posttransplant. 4. Patient has been on a calcineurin inhibitor based immunosuppression since the transplant. 5. Patient has one of the following risk factors for chronic renal allograft failure: I. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL 3 months or later posttransplant in males patients. II. Serum creatinine &gt; 1.7 mg/dL 3 months or later posttransplant in female patients. III. Serum &gt; 30% increased over post discharge nadir. 6. Patients had a renal biopsy that shows chronic allograft nephropathy. 7. Patient or legal guardian had signed and dated an IRB approved informed consent document and is willing and able to follow study procedures. 8. If female and of child bearing potential, patient has a negative pregnancy test and agrees to practice effective birth control while receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), Rapamycin and other immunosuppressants. 1. Patient is the recipient of a solid organ transplant other than the kidney. 2. Patient is dialysis dependent. 3. Patient has recurrence of primary renal disease, or de novo renal disease. 4. Patient has an estimated creatinine clearance &lt;25ml/min calculated using the Crockcroft/Gault formula. 5. Patient has changed maintenance immunosuppressant therapy (e.g., azathioprine to MMF) within three months of randomization. 6. Baseline biopsy shows acute rejection Banff Grade &gt; IIB. 7. Patient required antilymphocyte therapy to treat rejection found on baseline biopsy. 8. Patient has received an investigational immunosuppressant within three months. 9. Patient is pregnant or lactating. 10. Patient is a known carrier of any of the HIV viruses. 11. Patient has known hypersensitivity to Rapamycin, or any of the excipients of the drug.</criteria>
