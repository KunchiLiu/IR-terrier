	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to determine if a citicoline supplement is associated with a reduction in cocaine use and craving in patients with bipolar disorder (a mental disorder marked by alternating periods of mania and depression) or schizoaffective disorder/bipolar type (a psychotic disturbance in which there is a mixture of schizophrenic and manic-depressive symptoms) and cocaine abuse/dependence. This research also wants to explore if citicoline supplements are associated with greater improvement in symptoms of mania and on memory and cognition (the mental faculty of perception, reasoning, and judgement) in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Citicoline Therapy in Patients With Mania or Hypomania and Cocaine Abuse/Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty-four outpatients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled after completing an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent process. Baseline evaluation included a medical and psychiatric history, structured diagnostic interview using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV criteria, mood assessment with the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and cognitive assessment with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Alternate but equivalent versions of the RAVLT were used to minimize practice effects with repeated administration. Cocaine use was assessed at each biweekly visit with urine drug screens. Citicoline or placebo was given beginning at one tablet (500 mg)/day with an increase to two tablets (1000 mg/day) at week 2, three tablets (1500 mg/day) at week 4, and four tablets (2000 mg/day) at week 6. Doses were decreased, if needed, due to side effects.</detailed_description>
