	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to determine whether the memory impairment and manic symptoms (feelings of agitation, overexcitement or hyperactivity) typically seen in those on corticosteroid therapy is decreased with a seizure medication called levetiracetam compared to placebo (an inactive substance). Since increased levels of cortisol (the body's natural corticosteroid) in the body are frequently associated with memory impairment interventions that may prevent or reverse this are of great importance. It is hypothesized that patients who are scheduled to receive prescription corticosteroid therapy who are given levetiracetam pretreatment will show lesser memory impairment and manic symptoms than those receiving placebo.</brief_summary>
