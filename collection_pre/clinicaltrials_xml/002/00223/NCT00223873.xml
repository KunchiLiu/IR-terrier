	<brief_title>The Use of Penile Vibratory Stimulation to Decrease Spasticity Following Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal cord injury can result in mild to severe muscle spasms that can both inhibit functional capability and increase the likelihood of injury due to fall. Anecdotal reports and a recent study suggest that triggering the ejaculatory reflex in men with vibratory stimulation can result in a significant decrease in spasm activity over a period of 2 to 42 hours. This study examines the effects of penile vibratory stimulation on spasticity when conducted daily in the home setting.</detailed_description>
