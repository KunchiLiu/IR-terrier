	<brief_title>Cytokine Regulation of Periradicular Pain in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluates whether periradicular exudate concentrations of cytokines differ in patients experiencing pain and mechanical allodynia due to pulpal necrosis with an acute exacerbation of a chronic apical periodontitis, as compared to patients with pulpal necrosis with chronic apical periodontitis, but no pain or mechanical allodynia</detailed_description>
