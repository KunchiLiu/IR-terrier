	<brief_title>Clinical-Genetic Variation in GABA/Alcohol Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We want to find out if there are specific characteristics of a person's genes which will cause them to respond differently to alcohol. Genes are parts of the chromosomes found in the cells of our bodies which control our physical characteristics such the color of our hair, eyes, and other features. Genes are made up of molecules called "DNA" which carry the genetic information we receive from our parents. Just as genes control our physical characteristics, differences in genetic information may also explain why some people are more sensitive to alcohol or have problems drinking too much.</detailed_description>
