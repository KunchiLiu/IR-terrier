	<brief_summary>This study will examine if depression in a primary caregiver is associated with more hospitalization or ER visits in children with asthma. This study will also explore whether treatment for depression in the primary caregivers is associated with improvement in asthma in school-aged children. Asthma is a very common childhood disorder of airway inflammation. The causes include environmental irritants, cold temperature, and infection in the respiratory tract, and emotional factors can contribute to symptom exacerbation. However, asthma is a disease that can be well controlled if there is proper medication compliance and careful control of environmental conditions. Data suggests that psychiatric symptoms in the mothers of children with asthma are associated with more asthma related hospitalizations in children. Thus, we want to explore this question further using more specific diagnostic instruments in order to detect what types of symptoms are associated with increased asthma related service utilization. Also, we want to explore if effective treatment of the caregivers' symptoms is associated with decreased hospitalization and emergency room visits for the child.</brief_summary>
