	<brief_title>Suture Granuloma in Body Contouring Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bariatric surgery has evolved as an effective treatment for morbid obesity, inducing rapid and predictable weight loss within a period of 12 to 18 months following surgery. Consequently, body contouring after weight loss is emerging as the fastest growing field of plastic surgery. Patients seek consultation with a plastic surgeon to correct skin laxity of the abdomen, thighs, chest, back, and neck. A major problem in body contourinig is the extrusion of absorbable suture material used for dermal closure. Long incisions and high tension inherent to body contouring surgery mandate a secure dermal closure. While absorbable sutures are preferred, they can result in suture granuloma and extrusion.</detailed_description>
