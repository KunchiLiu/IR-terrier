	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a lower-dose and higher-dose therapy program for persons recovering from a recent stroke using mechanically-assisted upper limb movement with a device called MIME. A control group receives additional occupational therapy without the use of MIME.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assisted Movement Neuro-rehabilitation: VA Multi-site Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study continues our investigation of the optimal timing, intensity, and duration of robot-assisted training to improve motor performance in patients with hemiplegia following stroke. These hypotheses will be tested: 1) subjects receiving robot-assisted upper limb therapy with MIME in the initial phase of recovery from stroke experience greater functional gains than a control group receiving additional conventional therapy of equal intensity and duration, 2) robot-assisted therapy results in a dose-dependent response, and 3) robot-assisted therapy promotes greater control of movement, greater recovery of strength, and greater reduction of co-contraction than the control intervention. Research Plan - A multi-site clinical trial is in progress at the Houston VA Medical Center (VAMC), the VA Greater Los Angeles Health Care System (GLAHCS), the VA Palo Alto Rehabilitation Research and Development Center (RR&amp;DC), and the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System (CTVHCS). CTVHCS serves as the coordinating site. The RR&amp;DC provides training and technical assistance for the other sites. Methods - Subjects with hemiparesis due to a stroke are randomly assigned to 3 groups. Group 1 receives 1 hour/day of robot-assisted upper limb therapy in addition to usual physical and occupational therapy. Group 2 receives a total of 2 hours/day of robot-assisted therapy. Group 3 receives 1 hour/day of additional upper limb therapy that includes exposure to, but no manipulation by the robot. Outcome measures include assessment of strength, motor control, functional status, and patient satisfaction at intake, discharge, 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
