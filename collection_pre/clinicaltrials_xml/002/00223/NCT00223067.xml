	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients must meet all the following inclusion criteria to be considered for admission to the trial: 1. Male or female adult patients aged between 18 and 64 years (inclusive).

Patients with a malignancy or history of malignancy. 11. Patients with renal insufficiency due to a vasculitis. 12. Patients whose condition requires continuous systemic administration of immunosuppressives. 13. Missing immunosuppressive effect of the donor TAIC for the donorrecipient pair in vitro test. 14. Patients who are simultaneously participating or plan to participate in any other clinical study. 15. Psychiatric or emotional problems or lack of knowledge of the German language which would invalidate the giving of Informed Consent or limit the ability of the subject to comply with study requirements. 16.
