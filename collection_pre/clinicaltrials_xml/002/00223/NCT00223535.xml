	<brief_title>Cognitive Remediation and Social Skills Training in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects are 40 stable outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are receiving medication and routine follow-up care at community clinics in San Antonio, Texas. Patients receive baseline assessments and then are randomly assigned to either Cognitive Remediation (CR) or Keyboarding Skills (KS) for a period of 8 weeks. Following 8 weeks of treatment in either CR or KS, all patients participated in Social Skills Training (SST) for a period of 8 weeks. Assessments conducted by raters blinded to treatment condition are repeated following either remediation or control treatment, and again following SST. Treatment groups Cognitive Remediation (CR) -- The CR program is based upon teaching techniques developed within educational psychology that promote intrinsic motivation and task engagement. The program uses existing computer software packages (e.g., Oregon Trail) with engaging story lines or activities, and built-in reinforcement of correct responses to help patients with schizophrenia develop attention, memory, planning, and problem-solving skills. CR is delivered in a computer lab setting with a facilitator present to assist patients. Keyboarding Skills (KS) -- Control Treatment: The control treatment is an engaging self-paced software program designed to teach typing skills. KS is delivered in a computer lab setting with a facilitator present. Both the KS and CR are administered in small groups of three to five patients each. Social Skills Training (SST) -- SST is a manual-driven, behavioral rehabilitation program teaching basic conversation and social problem-solving skills (Bellack et al., 1997). SST runs for 8 weeks and is conducted in small groups that meet twice weekly.</detailed_description>
