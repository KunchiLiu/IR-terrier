	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this pivotal study is to determine if a new antimicrobial dressing, applied to the sternal incisions of cardiac surgical subjects, will demonstrate a decreased cumulative incidence rate(CI) of localized, superficial infections at the sternal incisional site as compared to the control group, regular, non-antimicrobial dressing.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Sign an informed consent form that has been approved by the Institutional Review Board. Adults at least 18 years of age. Be undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery with a median sternotomy. Be able to return to the study site, if needed, to have the sternal surgical incision site inspected. Be participating concurrently in another clinical trial that involves an investigational drug or device that would interfere with this study. Be in need of a left ventricular assist device. Have an active preoperative infectious process. Subject is to receive another topical antimicrobial agent (i.e., DermabondÂ® Topical Skin Adhesive) other than the study dressing (as assigned by the randomization schedule).</criteria>
