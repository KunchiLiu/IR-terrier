	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term treatment of patients with proximal venous thrombosis through the administration of subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (tinzaparin sodium) versus the standard care use of intravenous heparin followed by oral warfarin sodium.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of the Effect of Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH) Versus Warfarin on Mortality in the Long-Term Treatment of Proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) (Main LITE Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The accepted treatment for acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is initial continuous intravenous heparin followed by long-term oral anticoagulant therapy. Improvements in the methods of clinical trials and the use of accurate objective tests to detect venous thromboembolism have made it possible to perform a series of randomized trials to evaluate various treatments of venous thromboembolism. The specific objectives of the Main LITE Study are: - to determine if low-molecular-weight heparin, given subcutaneously once daily without laboratory monitoring, is more effective than adjusted oral warfarin sodium in the reduction of mortality rate. - to determine if such a low-molecular-weight heparin therapy is more cost-effective than present standard care methods. - to determine the incidence of Factor V Leiden and Prothrombin 20210A mutant genetic abnormalities.</detailed_description>
