	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate with that of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine on its own for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomised Efficacy Study of Combination Antimalarials to Treat Uncomplicated Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to anti-malarial drugs is a serious impediment to malaria control. In the South East African Combination Anti-malarial Therapy (SEACAT) evaluation, there is an evaluation of the phased introduction of combination anti-malarial therapy (CAT) in Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa. In order to facilitate formulation of effective regional drug policy and provide a database for decision-making on the implementation of CAT, it is essential that the in vivo response to CAT be investigated. This will be achieved through the SEACAT 01 protocol which is a component of the SEACAT evaluation described in another file on this website. However, in selected Mozambique sites where the intensity of malaria transmission is high, a direct parallel group comparison of monotherapy (SP) with CAT (artesunate, AS, plus SP) will be conducted according to a specific amendment (Amendment 4) to the SEACAT 01 protocol. Amendment 4 is presented in this separate file on the website for clarity.</detailed_description>
