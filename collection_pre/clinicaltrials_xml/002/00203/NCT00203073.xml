Able and willing to sign and date an informed consent form 1. Patients ever treated with Glatiramer Acetate or Mitoxantrone. 2. Patients treated with interferons or IV immunoglobulins (IV Ig) in the previous 4 weeks prior to screening visits. 3. Patients treated with methotrexate or azathioprine in the previous 6 months prior to screening visits. 4. Patients ever treated with cyclophosphamide or Total Lymphoid Irradiation (TLI), or cladribine for injection or anthracenediones or anthracyclines, or prior mediastinal radiotherapy. 5. Patients treated with intravenous or oral steroids within 28 days prior to initial MRI. 6. Female patients must be nonpregnant, nonlactating, have a negative screening pregnancy test, and must use contraceptive methods deemed reliable by the investigator. 7. Male patients and their partners must use contraceptive methods deemed reliable by the investigator 8. LVEF &lt; 50% 9. Patients using catheters or Foley catheters 10. Patients who have any other known significant systemic medical disease which may confound the evaluation of the study results such as: ALS, cervical spondylitic myelopathy, syphilis, arteritis, cerebellar syndrome (i.e., due to heredodegeneration), B12/folate deficiency, lyme disease, HTLV 1myelopathy 11. Patients with immune deficiency or other medical condition that would preclude treatment with Mitoxantrone or Glatiramer Acetate 12.

Patients with any medical or psychiatric conditions that would make the patient unsuitable for this research, as determined by the investigator.</criteria>
