	<brief_title>Maintenance Phase Treatment With Divalproex for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who have participated in the 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trial of divalproex for PTSD and have signed informed consent will be enrolled in a 24-week open-label divalproex continuation phase trial. Patients’ symptoms, side effects and compliance will be assessed every two weeks for 4 weeks, then every 4 weeks, thereafter, up to 24-weeks. Based on symptomology and occurrence of side effects, the investigator will titrate the medication in 500 mg (one tablet) increments every four days, as tolerated, until a maximum therapeutic benefit is achieved, not to exceed 3000 mg/day. The dosing is twice daily, with the higher dose at bedtime. Compliance will be assessed by monthly pill count and valproic acid levels at the week(s) 4, 12 and 24. Patients are given supportive clinical management during the clinic visits. An investigator is available by telephone 24 hrs a day in case of emergency. Patients may be seen more often if needed. Efficacy will be measured by the structured rating scales for depression, global function and assessment and PTSD. Results of this study will be used to evaluate the long-term efficacy of divalproex in the maintenance treatment of PTSD.</detailed_description>
