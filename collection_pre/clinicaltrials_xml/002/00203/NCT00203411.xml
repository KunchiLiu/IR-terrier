	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Plus Capecitabine (Xeloda) in Patients With Untreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will evaluate the tolerability, safety, and feasibility of combination bevacizumab and capecitabine in a small number of frail patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have a compromised performance status. Preclinical studies suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy offer an increased anti-tumor effect compared with either treatment alone.</detailed_description>
