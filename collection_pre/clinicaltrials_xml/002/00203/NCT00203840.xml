	<detailed_description>A sleep questionnaire will be administered to patients who present to the Pediatric Neurology Clinic and LaRabida Children's Hospital. The questions asked are those routinely obtained in the clinical practice of sleep medicine. Medical students, residents and faculty as part of their normal clinical responsibilities will administer the questionnaire. The database will be maintained in Filemaker Pro program for future research purposes. Collection of the data will require approximately 15 minutes. A database file number not related to the patient medical record number will be assigned to each patient. The investigator will keep a separate log linking patient database number and patient medical record number. The logbook will be kept under lock and key by the investigator.</detailed_description>
