	<brief_summary>The study drug levetiracetam is FDA approved as an add-on medication in the treatment of partial onset seizures in adults with epilepsy. The trade name is Keppra®. This is an "open-label" trial, which means that all participating patients will receive active study drug. The Jefferson Headache Center has developed this clinical study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of levetiracetam in preventing migraine headaches, with or without aura (visual disturbances). In addition, the study site will be performing a procedure called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). This procedure measures brain activity because it is thought that people with migraine experience periods of cortical hyperexcitability or over-activity in the brain. This information may help physicians in the future determine which preventive medications will work for which patients.</brief_summary>

Patients who, in the investigators opinion, have a history or have evidence of a medical or psychiatric condition that would expose them to an increased risk of a significant adverse event or would interfere with the assessments of efficacy and tolerability during this trial Patients with an abnormal ECG that, in the investigators opinion, would expose them to increased risk of adverse events or interfere with study drug and/or analysis of efficacy/tolerability Patients who take medication for acute treatment greater than 10 days per month over the past three months. Patients who are allergic to or have shown hypersensitivity to compounds similar to levetiracetam Patients with a history of significant drug or alcohol abuse within the past year Patients who have had a suicidal ideation in the 3 months prior to screening or has a history of attempted suicide Patients who currently have or have a history of significantly impaired renal function Patients who have participated in an investigational drug trial in the 30 days prior to the screening visit Patients who have a Beck Depression Inventory score of &gt; 18 at screening Patients who have &gt; 0 on question number 9 of Beck Depression Inventory (Suicidal Thoughts or Wishes question) Patients who have a defibrillator or pacemaker, an implanted medication pump, a metal plate in the skull, or metal objects inside the eye or skull (e.g. a shrapnel wound).</criteria>
