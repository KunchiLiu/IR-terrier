	<brief_summary>Subjects are scheduled to undergo a Greater Occipital Nerve Block (GONB) as treatment for your chronic daily headache (CDH). GONB has been used for many years in the treatment of headaches. The nerve block is done by injecting a liquid drug through the skin of the back of the head to the area of the greater occipital nerve. The nerve runs superficially in this area, therefore the drugs are injected just under the skin. The injected drugs block electrical transmission through the nerve, resulting in reduced head pain. There are treatment options for patients receiving a GONB, however, some clinicians use local anesthetics (lidocaine and /or bupivicaine) alone, and some use local anesthetics with local steroid injection. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether or not there is an observed difference between these two treatment approaches for GONB. We expect to enroll 60 patients into this research study at Thomas Jefferson University only.</brief_summary>
