	<detailed_description>NIMH Project Accept is an HIV prevention trial in which 48 communities (10 in Tanzania [Kisarawe], 8 in Zimbabwe [Mutoko], 8 in South Africa/Vulindlela, 8 in South Africa/Soweto and 14 in Thailand [Chiang Mai]) are being randomized to receive either a community-based HIV voluntary counseling and testing (CBVCT) intervention plus standard clinic-based VCT (SVCT), or SVCT alone. The CBVCT intervention has three major strategies: (1) to make VCT more available in community settings; (2) to engage the community through outreach; and (3) to provide post-test support. These strategies are designed to change community norms and reduce risk for HIV infection among all community members, irrespective of whether they participated directly in the intervention. A community-level intervention based on modifying community norms can change the environmental context in which people make decisions about HIV risk, and has the potential to alter the course of the HIV epidemic in developing countries. This is the first international randomized controlled Phase III trial to determine the efficacy of a behavioral/social science intervention with an HIV incidence endpoint.</detailed_description>
