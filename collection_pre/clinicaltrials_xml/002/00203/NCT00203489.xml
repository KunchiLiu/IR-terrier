	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a new antimicrobial gauze dressing is better than the current method of dressing open wounds with plain sterile gauze. It is hoped that the antimicrobial gauze will reduce the number of germs in the open wound and even improve the rate of healing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study of An Antimicrobial Gauze Dressing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Without adequate debridement, chronically infected wounds persist and form a nidus for the acquisition of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms. Multiple studies state that patients with chronic wounds were colonized with one or more resistant bacteria, and that the presence of a chronic wound or decubitus ulcer was associated with a statistically increased likelihood of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli (GNB),colonization and infection with ceftazidime-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Recently, a newly formulated gauze dressing impregnated with an antiseptic agent has become available. This product offers the promise of a combined benefit of wet-to-dry mechanical debridement, while providing high local concentrations of a potent antiseptic to prevent colonization and infection of the wound by resistant microorganisms, potentially enhancing wound healing. This study proposes to determine if use of the antimicrobial gauze in routine wound care results in a lower rate of chronic wound colonization with resistant microorganisms and prevalent microorganisms as compared to standard wound care (with non-antimicrobial gauze).</detailed_description>
