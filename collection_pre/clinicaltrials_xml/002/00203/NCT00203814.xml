	<brief_title>A Randomised Efficacy Study of Combination Antimalarials to Treat Uncomplicated Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to anti-malarial drugs is a serious impediment to the control of malaria. In order to facilitate formulation of effective regional drug policies and to provide a database for decision-making on the implementation of combination therapy (CAT), it is essential that the in vivo response to CAT be investigated. In the South East African Combination Anti-malarial Therapy (SEACAT) evaluation, there is a comprehensive evaluation of the phased introduction of combination anti-malarial therapy in Mozambique. As a component of this evaluation, in selected Mozambique sites where intensity of malaria transmission is high, a direct parallel group comparison of monotherapy (SP) with CAT (artesunate plus SP) will be conducted according to this protocol.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female, older than 12 months. Weight &gt; 10 kg. Diagnoses of pure uncomplicated acute P. falciparum malaria parasitaemia of up to 500 000 asexual parasite/mcl blood with axillary temperature of greater than or equal to 37.5Â°C or history of fever (defined as within the previous 24 hours). Documented informed consent. Lives close enough to the study site for reliable follow up. Has received antimalarial treatment in the past 7 days. Is infected with other malarial species (such subjects may be excluded retrospectively from the analysis). Severely ill (based on WHO Criteria for severe malaria ) or if patient is considered, in the opinion of the investigator or designee, to have moderately severe malaria (e.g. prostrate, repeated vomiting, dehydrated) or other danger signs. Has received cotrimoxazole, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, folate or tetracyclines (including doxycycline) in the past 7 days or is likely to require these during the study period. History of G6PD deficiency. Is pregnant or breastfeeding. Has a history of allergy to any of the study drugs (including other sulphonamides e.g. cotrimoxazole, other artemisinin derivatives e.g. coartemether). Serious underlying disease that in the opinion of the clinic team and/or Principal Investigator would make the patient unsuitable for the study in terms of their safety or study analysis.</criteria>
