	<brief_summary>Collect data to support “standard of care possibility” of extracardiac repair with closure of intracavitary communication and plication of the aneurysm as probably safest surgical repair for left ventricular aneurysms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Left Ventricular Aneurysms in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ventricular aneurysms in the pediatric population are rare and no standardized method of treatment exists. We plan on reviewing five patient charts between the dates of 6.30.02 and 6.30.04 as to causes of aneurysms. The patient charts selected will be in the following “aneurysm categories”: Mostly occur after: Ross/Ross-Konno procedures modified Rastelli-type interventricular tunnels repeated resections of subaortic stenosis and possibly after: myocardial ischemia trauma drainage of abscess in infective endocarditis progressive herniation of endocardium mostly located: in LV outflow tract We plan on collecting echocardiograms and / or cardiac catheterizations data in order to confirm the diagnosis of an aneurysm. We will also collect the following information: - Procedures including the dates performed - Medications - Physical Exam Findings - Weight - Gestational Age - Outcome</detailed_description>
