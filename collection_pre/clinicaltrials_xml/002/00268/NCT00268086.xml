	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to determine the clinical and radiographic findings with constrictive pericarditis in the adult congenital population and determine the degree of right heart failure and dilation from pulmonary insufficiency in the presence of constrictive pericarditis The secondary aim is to elucidate ways to better diagnose constrictive pericarditis and elucidate ways to diagnose right heart failure in the presence of constrictive pericarditis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Constrictive Pericarditis in the Adult Congenital Cardiac Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Constrictive pericarditis is a notoriously difficult diagnosis to reach. There are no signs, symptoms or pathognomonic diagnostic tests for pericardial constriction. In the adult congenital patients, it is also difficult. In addition, with pulmonary insufficiency, constrictive pericarditis may mask the findings of progressive right sided ventricular dilation and heart failure. The primary aim of this study is to determine the clinical and radiographic findings with constrictive pericarditis in the adult congenital population and determine the degree of right heart failure and dilation from pulmonary insufficiency in the presence of constrictive pericarditis The secondary aim is to elucidate ways to better diagnose constrictive pericarditis and elucidate ways to diagnose right heart failure in the presence of constrictive pericarditis. Study Design and Methodology: Retrospective chart review - approximately 15 patients Preoperative data: ECHO and cath findings Operative data: Operative findings Postoperative data: ECHO and cath findings</detailed_description>
