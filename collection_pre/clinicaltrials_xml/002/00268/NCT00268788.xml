	<brief_title>Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin Treatment for Multifocal Motor Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment is the only established treatment modality in Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN). In order to maintain neuromuscular performance patients require lifelong treatment. Hospital-based treatments have high cost and inconveniences to patients, particularly in chronic disorders. Immunoglobulin preparations are now available for subcutaneous use as IgG replacement therapy. The safety and efficacy of subcutaneous infusion is reported to be comparable to i.v. preparations, and has been applied successfully in other autoimmune disorders. However patients with MMN have not previously been treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin. Hypothesis: Subcutaneous immunoglobulin treatment is efficacious and safe with less patient inconvenience. Primary endpoint: Isokinetic muscle strength at the end of treatment A vs B (subcutaneous vs i.v.) Secondary endpoint: Medical research council score (MRC-score), 9-hole peg test, 10m walking, Nerve conduction parameters, SF-36.</detailed_description>
