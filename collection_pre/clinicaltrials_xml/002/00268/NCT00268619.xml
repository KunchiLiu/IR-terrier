	<brief_summary>Study objectives: - To demonstrate that the acute administration of ramipril will control the inflammation process in patients with high-risk Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) as assessed by the high sensitivity C-reactive protein blood levels. - To demonstrate that the normalization of blood glucose levels with intravenous insulin will improve the inflammation process during the acute phase of an ACS as assessed by Tumor necrosis factor alpha blood levels.</brief_summary>
