	<brief_summary>Approximately 207 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis will be entered into this study at approximately 26 centers in the United States. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate powder dosed once-a-day (QD) with the largest meal compared to sevelamer hydrochloride tablets dosed three-times-per-day (TID) with meals. The total length of participation is approximately 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
