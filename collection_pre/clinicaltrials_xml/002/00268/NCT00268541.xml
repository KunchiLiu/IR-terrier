	<brief_summary>Offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes have increased risk of developing diabetes and are typically more insulin resistant than their peers with no diabetes family history. We have recently demonstrated that, in contrast to their sedentary counterparts, physically active offspring are not insulin resistant. In the proposed controlled clinical study, we will examine the effects of a moderate exercise programme on insulin resistance, and other metabolic risk factors, in sedentary offspring and matched control subjects. We hypothesise that offspring will exhibit an augmented response to exercise, thereby normalising their predisposition to an adverse metabolic profile. We will also investigate expression of adipokines and other genes in adipose tissue to determine whether these contribute to the increased insulin resistance observed in offspring and whether they are influenced by exercise. The results will help to determine the efficacy of exercise in normalising metabolism in offspring and will help elucidate the mechanisms involved.</brief_summary>
