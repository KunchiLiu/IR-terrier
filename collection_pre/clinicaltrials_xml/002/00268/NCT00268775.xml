	<brief_title>Implementation Strategies for a Simple Intervention to Reduce Longterm Benzodiazepine Use in Dutch Community Pharmacies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Dutch community pharmacies many projects have been undertaken in the field of pharmaceutical care, with mixed results. It is not yet clear which elements exactly contribute to the success of these projects and to implementation of pharmaceutical care. One of the subjects to which attention is paid in community pharmacies, is the undesirable long-term use of benzodiazepines. Treatment methods for discontinuation of long-term benzodiazepine use have been studied rather extensively. A simple patient-directed discontinuation letter proved to be effective in several studies. Comparison: a minimal intervention group (pharmacists carrying out the intervention guided by a manual only) compared to a maximal intervention group (pharmacists receiving a manual, a training aimed at better cooperation and communication with family practitioners and some support in the management of the project).</detailed_description>
