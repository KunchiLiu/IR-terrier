	<brief_summary>The records of all the patients that underwent the Norwood-Sano operation at Childrenâ€™s Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2004 will be investigated. These patients will be compared with an equal number of consecutive cases treated by classic Norwood stage I operation in order to determine the incidence of neo-aortic valve insufficiency and the clinical outcome of these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incidence of Neo-Aortic Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neoaortic valve insufficiency after Norwood type palliation of single ventricle patients has not been well studied. Patients with mild insufficiency tolerate it well; moderate to severe insufficiency however is poorly tolerated and can result in the death of the patient or at least require re-operation. Re-operation for neo-aortic insufficiency in this small size child is a difficult operation and the operative options are very limited. The introduction of the Sano modification of the Norwood procedure introduced a new set of variables due to the presence of a ventricular incision and possible distortion of the neo-aortic valve. It is therefore critical to determine the incidence of neo-aortic insufficiency and compare it to the standard Norwood operation, as well as to determine the clinical consequences of the presence of this phenomenon immediately postoperatively as well as long-term, up to completion of the stage II of the Norwood procedure (Glenn stage).</detailed_description>
