	<brief_summary>Docetaxel (Taxotere) is an approved chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer. The aim of the study is to investigate whether addition of the investigational drug PI-88 will increase the efficacy of docetaxel in this disease. PI-88 inhibits cancer growth by inhibiting the development of new blood vessels and starving the tumour of oxygen and nutrients (anti-angiogenic). Because PI-88 and docetaxel have different mechanisms of action, they are expected to have increased (synergistic) activity when combined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Efficacy Study of PI-88 With Docetaxel to Treat Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial is a multi-centre, open-label randomised phase II study in patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC), with a lead-in combination tolerance study. The aim of the lead-in phase is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PI-88 administered either 4 days/week or 7 days/week) in combination with fixed doses of docetaxel (75 mg/m^2 every 21 days) and prednisone (5 mg twice daily). In the randomized phase II component, patients will receive PI-88 at the MTD, either 4 days/week or 7 days/week, in combination with docetaxel and prednisone. The patients will receive up to 10 treatment cycles of the combination therapy. Response to treatment will be assessed by measuring serum levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA). Other efficacy measures will include radiological assessment, progression-free survival, overall survival and quality of life.</detailed_description>
