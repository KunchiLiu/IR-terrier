	<brief_summary>Prostate cancers depend upon the male hormone testosterone for their growth. Lowering testosterone levels (either by removing all or part of both testes, or by giving anti-hormone treatment) slows the growth of prostate cancers. This type of treatment is called hormone treatment and is often used when prostate cancers have spread outside of the prostate gland. Although hormone treatment is usually successful at stopping the cancer growing for a period of time, the cancer will begin to grow again in most men. There are increasing numbers of treatments available for advanced prostate cancer. These treatments are usually used in prostate cancer when hormone treatment is no longer effective and the cancer has started to grow again. The aim of this trial, which is called STAMPEDE, is to assess five of these treatments, given earlier in the course of the disease in combination with hormone treatment. The treatments assessed during the trial are: 1. Zoledronic acid: Prostate cancer cells can spread to bones and weaken them. Zoledronic acid is a drug that reduces bone destruction and hardens bones. This may make them more resistant to attack by cancer cells. 2. Docetaxel: A drug that stops cells replicating, Docetaxel is currently being used to treat a range of cancers including lung, breast and ovarian cancer as well as prostate cancer. Docetaxel is already known to prolong survival in men with relapsed metastatic prostate cancer. 3. Celecoxib: An aspirin-like drug that is used to treat arthritis. Celecoxib slows down the growth of cancer cells in the laboratory. We wished to see if it had the same effect on cancer cells in patients. Recruitment to new patients for the evaluation of this drug is finished as a pre-planned interim analysis failed to demonstrate sufficient activity. 4. Abiraterone (included from protocol version 8.0): An inhibitor of steroid hormone synthesis that blocks prostate cancer cells from generating their own male hormones. This is thought to be a major way in which prostate cancer cells resume growth following castration based therapies. This agent is given along with prednisolone and is already known to prolong survival when given to men following failure of docetaxel chemotherapy. 5. Prostate radiotherapy (included from protocol version 9.0): Treatment with high-energy x-rays targeted to the prostate gland. This treatment is now mandatory for patients with cancer that is confined to the prostate gland as large trials have shown it improves survival times. We are interested in whether we should give radiotherapy to the prostate if the cancer has already spread. 6. Enzalutamide (included from protocol version 12.0): This is a blocker of androgen receptors. These stimulate the cancer when hormone therapies have failed. Enzalutamide may be mutually complementary to abiraterone in terms of blocking mechanisms of resistance. The agent prolongs survival when given to men following failure of docetaxel chemotherapy. STAMPEDE will look at the effect of combining one or two of the treatments described above with hormone treatment. A computer program will be used to allocate which treatment the patient receives, using a chance process. The trial will look at the effects of the combined treatments on quality of life and find out whether the new treatment combinations increase the time when the cancer is not growing and ultimately results in patients living longer. The study will also look at which treatment provides the greater value for money for the health service. More than 8,000 patients will join the trial with answers becoming available over 7 to 12 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>STAMPEDE: Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy: A Multi-Stage Multi-Arm Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the safety of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) alone vs ADT in varying combinations with enzalutamide and abiraterone and/or radiotherapy to the prostate (and previously celecoxib, zoledronic acid, docetaxel and abiraterone alone) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. - Compare failure-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter, pilot study. Patients are currently randomised to 1 of 3 treatment arms (A, H and J). The other arms are now closed to recruitment. - Arm A (Androgen Deprivation Therapy [ADT] (plus RT for newly-diagnosed non-metastatic disease) [control]): Patients undergo bilateral orchidectomy or receive luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues to achieve castration levels of testosterone. - Arm B (ADT and zoledronic acid): Patients undergo ADT (+/- RT) as in arm A. Patients also receive zoledronic acid IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses and then every 4 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (no longer recruiting). - Arm C (ADT, docetaxel, and prednisolone): Patients undergo ADT (+/- RT) as in arm A. Patients also receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and oral prednisolone twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (no longer recruiting). - Arm D (ADT and celecoxib): Patients undergo ADT as in arm A. Patients also receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (no longer recruiting). - Arm E (ADT, zoledronic acid, docetaxel, and prednisolone): Patients undergo ADT (+/- RT) as in arm A. Patients also receive zoledronic acid as in arm B and docetaxel and prednisolone as in arm C (no longer recruiting).. - Arm F (ADT, zoledronic acid, and celecoxib): Patients undergo ADT as in arm A. Patients also receive zoledronic acid as in arm B and celecoxib as in arm D (no longer recruiting). - Arm G (ADT and abiraterone): Patients undergo ADT (+/- RT) as in arm A. Patients also receive oral abiraterone once daily together with prednisolone or prednisone 5mg daily to prevent secondary ACTH excess (no longer recruiting). - Arm H (ADT and radiotherapy to the prostate): Patients (newly-diagnosed-metastatic only) undergo ADT, as in arm A. Patients also receive radiotherapy to the prostate. Two radiotherapy dose-fractionation schedules are permitted. In either case, radiotherapy is prescribed such that at least 95% of the PTV receives the prescribed dose: 36Gy in 6 fractions of 6Gy, administered weekly over 6 consecutive weeks or 55Gy in 20 fractions of 2.75Gy, administered daily, five days per week, over 4 consecutive weeks. - Arm J (ADT, enzalutamide and abiraterone): Patients undergo ADT, as in arm A. Patients also receive oral enzalutamide once daily and abiraterone once daily together with prednisolone or prednisone 5mg daily to prevent secondary ACTH excess. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically thereafter. Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK.
