	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine the safety of giving a patient's own bone marrow-derived stem cells delivered with a catheter (tube) into the coronary arteries (blood vessels of the heart). Stem cells are simple cells produced by the bone marrow that can develop into many types of cells. It is possible that these cells will decrease the size of damage caused to the heart from a heart attack and increase the pumping efficiency of the heart; which can be decreased due to a heart attack. The stem cells will be taken from bone marrow and then given back into the heart vessels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Marrow Stem Cell Infusion Following a Heart Attack</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol will test the hypothesis that an intracoronary infusion of autologous, unfractionated, bone marrow mononuclear cells will attenuate infarct size and improve left-ventricular function in 60 patients following an acute anterior myocardial infarction who have undergone successful revascularization with PTCA/stenting.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients age at least 21 years of age Patients with an acute anterior myocardial infarction limited to the proximal or midLAD with an artery diameter of at least 2.5 mm. Ability to undergo cell therapy procedure within 2 to 7 days following acute MI and PTCA/stenting. Ejection fraction following reperfusion with PTCA/stenting is between 30% and 50% as assessed by leftventriculography or echocardiography.
