	<brief_title>A Study of Vaginal MicroFlora and Immune Profiles of Patients With Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrent urinary tract infections, which occur mostly in the female population, can be potentially harmful if not treated and significantly reduce quality of life. By characterizing the vaginal microflora and immune profiles of women that suffer recurrent UTIs in contrast to a healthy age matched normal group of women (with no history of recurrent UTIs), we can better understand the differences. This in turn can lead to development of better quality probiotics that will be based on their scientific basis, clinical efficacy, and quality in terms of shelf life and delivery to target sites. The reduction in only one third of UTI cases seen each year would have a significant impact on reducing health care costs.</detailed_description>
