	<brief_summary>The purpose of the trial is to study the safety and efficacy of long term use of once daily applications, as needed, of calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel, as compared to calcipotriol alone in the same gel. The primary response criteria will be the incidence of adverse drug reactions of any type, and the incidence of adverse events of concern associated with long-term corticosteroid use on the scalp.</brief_summary>
