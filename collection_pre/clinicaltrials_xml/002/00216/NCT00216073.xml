	<brief_summary>In vitro data suggest synergy between oxaliplatin and 5-FU. The combination of oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil produced objective response rates ranging from 27-34% in two studies of patients with prior chemotherapy. Capecitabine was designed as an orally administered, tumor selective fluoropyrimidine, preferentially converted to 5-FU at the tumor site by the higher levels of pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase (PyNPase) in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. The end result is higher concentrations of 5-fluorouracil in tumor relative to surrounding normal tissue. Trastuzumab is synergistic in vitro with multiple chemotherapeutic agents including the platinum compounds. Studies have shown the efficacy of trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy in patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. This trial will investigate the activity of capecitabine and oxaliplatin administered with trastuzumab (CAPOX-T) in patients with HER2 overexpressing in patients with advanced disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study. - CAPOX-T (21 day cycle):Capecitabine 825 mg/m2 orally twice daily Days 1-14Oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously Day 1 - Trastuzumab : 6 mg/kg intravenously Day 1.8mg/kg loading dose should be given in cycle 1 for patients without previous trastuzumab therapy only. Patients may continue combination therapy until progression or toxicity intervenes. Patients who discontinue either or both cytotoxic agents due to toxicity may, at the investigators discretion, continue therapy with the remaining agents on study until progressive disease ECOG performance status 0 or 1 Hematopoietic:· - ANC &gt; 1,200/mm3· - Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3 Hepatic:· - Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN· - AST &lt; 2 x ULN (up to 5 x ULN in patients with known liver involvement) Renal:· - Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN and estimated creatinine clearance &gt;50ml/min as calculated with Cockroft-Gault equation Cardiovascular:· - No clinically significant cardiac disease (e.g. congestive heart failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias not well controlled with medication) or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months.· - LVEF &gt; LLN by MUGA or ECHO</detailed_description>
