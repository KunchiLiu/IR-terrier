	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether once daily topical treatment for up to 8 weeks of calcipotriol 50 mcg/g plus betamethasone 0.5 mg/g (as dipropionate) gel is safe and more effective than betamethasone 0.5 mg/g (as dipropionate) in the gel vehicle and calcipotriol 50 mcg/g in the gel vehicle in patients with scalp psoriasis. The primary response criterion is the number of patients with absence of disease and very mild disease after 8 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
