	<brief_summary>Evidence for the beneficial effects of bisphosphonates on bone resorption in multiple myeloma has been reported extensively, showing reductions in skeletal events and improvement of several biochemical variables in bone resorption. Zoledronic acid (ZometaÂ®, CGP42446) is the most potent clinically available bisphosphonates, with the largest therapeutic ratio between the desired inhibition of calcium resorption and the unwanted inhibition of mineralization in vitro of all the bisphosphonates. This trial will investigate the efficacy of zoledronic acid in preventing skeletal events in patients with asymptomatic/early stage Multiple Myeloma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zoledronic Acid in the Management of Patients With Asymptomatic/Early Stage Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study. - Patients will be randomly assigned by study number to receive 4mg of zoledronic acid every three months or to be observed. Performance status: ECOG performance status 0-3 (KPS 30 - 100) Life expectancy: 12 months Hematopoietic: - Hb &gt;10 g/dl within 14 days prior to registration Hepatic: - Not specified Renal: - Serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl within 14 days prior to registration Cardiovascular: - Not specified Pulmonary: - Not specified</detailed_description>
