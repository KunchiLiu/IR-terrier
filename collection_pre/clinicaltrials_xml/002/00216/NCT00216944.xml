	<brief_summary>The study aim is to compare a balanced anesthesia of the medicines used in all other age groups with the routine premedication in use for premature's with regards to the success in the intubation procedure, the need for analgesia during and after intubation and the stress reaction. In addition a pain scale for prolonged stress/pain for premature neonates in NICU-care will be validated, and the individual pharmacogenetic profile in relation to the need of morphine after the intubation will be investigated. The hypothesis is that balanced anesthesia before intubation facilitates the procedure, decreases the amount of stress and pain related to it, and causes a decreased need for analgesia after the intubation.</brief_summary>
