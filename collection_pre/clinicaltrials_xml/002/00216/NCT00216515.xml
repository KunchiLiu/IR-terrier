	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of galantamine on the attention of patients with Alzheimer's Disease, how an improvement of attention of Alzheimer's Disease patients affects their activities of daily living, and the global benefit of galantamine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Galantamine on the Attention and the Frontal Function of the Patients With Dementia of Alzheimer Type</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent studies suggest that an attention deficit occurs at early stage of Alzheimer's disease and affects patients' activities of daily living. In other words, some patients without language or visuospatial dysfunction have severe impairment of activities of daily living, which might result from attention deficit. Another recent clinical study showed that galantamine is more effective in attention and vigilance of Alzheimer's disease patients than donepezil. The study hypothesis is that galantamine will improve attention and frontal executive function in Alzheimer's disease patients and is well-tolerated. 8 mg/day for the first 4 weeks, 16 mg for the next 8 weeks</detailed_description>
