	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis is currently treated with a 6-month course regimen. During this time many patients might fail to adhere to treatment and default, increasing the risk of recurrent disease which might be multidrug resistant. A shorter duration of treatment is expected to provide improved patient compliance and at least equal or better clinical outcome. The aim of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a gatifloxacin-containing regimen of four months duration for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis,</brief_summary>
