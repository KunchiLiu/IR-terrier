	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this randomized trial was to investigate whether early initiation of treatment with Risperdal Consta after an acute episode was not inferior to the routine approach (oral treatment for 12 weeks followed by treatment with Risperdal Consta). .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-acting Injectable Risperidone in Patients With Schizophrenia After an Acute Episode</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although many schizophrenia patients currently take oral antipsychotic medications, it is estimated that up to 75% of them have difficulty adhering to the daily oral regiment. Long-acting injectable formulations may eliminate the need for daily medication and enhance patient compliance with the treatment regimen. Traditionally, patients experiencing an episode of schizophrenia are first treated with oral medications until they are stabilized, and then injectable long-acting formulations are given. This is an open, multicenter, randomized Phase IV trial in patients after an acute episode of schizophrenia. Patients will be in the trial for 6 months. One treatment group will receive injections starting at baseline (early initiation); the other group will start with treatment as usual at baseline and begin injections at Week 12 (late initiation). Assessment of effectiveness include Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), in order to measure symptoms of schizophrenia; Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S), measuring overall severity of illness; Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), assessesing overall psychological, social, and occupational functioning; and Quality of Life Questionnaire SF-12, measuring overall health status. Safety evaluations include the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS), incidence of adverse events throughout the study, and vital signs (pulse, blood pressure). The study hypothesis is that early initiation of long-acting risperidone injections is not inferior to late initiation as measured by changes in PANSS total score from baseline through endpoint (after 6 months). Risperidone, long-acting formulation for intramuscular injections (25 to 50 mg (maximum)), given every 14 days through 6 months, starting at baseline or Month 3. Treatment as usual for 3 months for late initiation group</detailed_description>
