	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Symptomatic Remission in Schizophrenia With Long Acting Risperidone Microspheres</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although most of Korean schizophrenic patients currently take oral antipsychotic medications, it is estimated that up to 75% of them have difficulty adhering to daily oral regimen. Long-acting injectable formulation may eliminate this need for daily medication. This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter study to determine the long-term efficacy, especially symptomatic remission rate of long-acting risperidone microspheres administrered in the muscle at 2 week intervals in patients with schizophrenia. The patients will receive intramuscular injections either 25, 37.5, 50 mg equivalent of risperidone at every 2 weeks for 1 year</detailed_description>
