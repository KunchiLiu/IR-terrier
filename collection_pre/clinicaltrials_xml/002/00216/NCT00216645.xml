	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride injection in Japanese patients with Mullerian carcinoma. This clinical study is a multi-center, non-randomized, open-label study in Japanese patients with Mullerian carcinoma (including epithelial ovarian carcinoma, primary carcinoma of fallopian tube, peritoneal carcinoma) with a prior history of platinum-based chemotherapy. Eighty patients will be administered intravenously at least two cycles of 50 mg/m2 of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride every 4 weeks to investigate the effectiveness and safety of the treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Clinical Study of Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Injection as 2nd-line or Later Therapy in Patients With Mullerian Carcinoma (Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma, Primary Carcinoma of Fallopian Tube, Peritoneal Carcinoma) Having Prior Platinum-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pegylated liposomal Doxorubicin hydrochloride is intended to change the pharmacokinetics of conventional doxorubicin in the blood and to improve the safety and effectiveness of the drug. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride has been approved in many countries including US and EU, becoming a standard drug for 2nd-line therapy in ovarian cancer and AIDS-related Kaposi's Sarcoma. This clinical study was planned to assess effectiveness and safety for Japanese patients with Müllerian carcinoma (including epithelial ovarian carcinoma, primary carcinoma of fallopian tube, peritoneal carcinoma), who had a prior history of receiving platinum-based chemotherapy such as Cisplatin (which is considered to be the standard chemotherapy for ovarian carcinoma). In this study, at least two cycles of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride 50 mg/m2 will be intravenously administered to 80 patients every 4 weeks. These patients include twenty 2nd-line "platinum-sensitive" and sixty "platinum-resistant" 2nd-line or 3rd-line patients. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride 50 mg/m2 will be given by intravenous drip infusion on day 1. After this, a 27-day drug-free period will be followed as one cycle. At least two cycles will be given as long as the patient does not meet the discontinuation criteria.</detailed_description>
