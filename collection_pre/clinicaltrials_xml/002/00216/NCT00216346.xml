	<brief_summary>Symptomatic Visceral Leishmaniasis(VL)is fatal; Due to the increasing resistance to standard therapy with antimonials, there is a need for new safe, efficacious, low-cost therapies for the treatment of VL. Paromomycin is an off-patent aminoglycoside antibiotic with anti-leishmaniasis activity. This study will test the safety and efficacy of paromomycin in the treatment of patients with VL in India.</brief_summary>

Clinical signs and symptoms compatible with VL: fever of over two weeks duration and splenomegaly. Biochemical and haematological test values as follows: Haemoglobin &gt; 5.0g/100mL White blood cell count &gt; 1 x109/L Platelet count &gt; 50 x 109/L AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase &lt; 3 times upper normal limit Prothrombin time &lt; 5 seconds above control Serum creatinine levels within normal limits Serum potassium levels within normal limits HIV negative A history of intercurrent or concurrent diseases (e.g. chronic alcohol consumption or drug addiction; renal, hepatic, cardiovascular or central nervous system disease; diabetes; tuberculosis or other infectious or major psychiatric diseases) that may introduce variables affecting the outcome of the study. Any condition which the investigator thinks may prevent the patient from completing the study therapy and subsequent followup.
