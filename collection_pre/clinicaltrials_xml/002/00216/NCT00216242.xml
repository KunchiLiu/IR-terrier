	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine whether Fluviral, an inactivated, injectable trivalent influenza vaccine (flu shot) is effective in preventing respiratory illnesses that are severe enough to limit normal daily activities and that are shown by virus culture to be caused by influenza viruses. The study will also examine the safety of the vaccine and collect measurements of the immune system responses produced by the vaccine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Protective Effect of an Injectable Influenza Vaccine Against Influenza Illness in Adults Under 50 y.o.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Yearly influenza (flu) epidemics cause a large burden of lost work and school time among younger persons and excess hospitalizations and deaths among the elderly. Injectable flu vaccines are generally believed to be effective, but formal studies using modern culture methods to prove this are limited. This study will compare the rate of respiratory illnesses associated with positive influenza virus cultures in healthy younger adults (a group at low risk for serious influenza complications) who have received Fluviral (an injectable flu vaccine) with the rate of such illnesses in healthy younger adults who have received an injection of saline (salt water). The rate of local vaccine reactions and other symptoms will be compared between the vaccine and salt water groups, and the immune responses to the vaccine measured.</detailed_description>
