	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether once daily treatment for up to 8 weeks of calcipotriol 50 mcg/g plus betamethasone 0.5 mg/g (as dipropionate) gel is safe and more effective than betamethasone 0.5 mg/g (as dipropionate) in the gel vehicle, calcipotriol 50 mcg/g in the gel vehicle or the gel vehicle used alone in patients with scalp psoriasis. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with absence of disease or very mild disease after 8 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
