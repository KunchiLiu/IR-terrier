	<brief_title>Shorter Radiation Schedule for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare the efficacy of a shorter radiation fractionation schedule to the prostate (5250 cGy/20 fractions over 28 days) with a conventional schedule (6600 cGy/33 fractions over 45 days) in men receiving radiotherapy for Stage T1a moderately or poorly differentiated, or T1b, T1c, or T2 prostate cancer. The primary outcome is local control in the prostate and secondary outcomes include toxicity, disease free survival, survival, quality of life and economics.</detailed_description>
