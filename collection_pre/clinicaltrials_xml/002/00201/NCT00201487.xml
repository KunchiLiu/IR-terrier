	<brief_summary>Choline has been found in increased concentration in breast cancer patients. Hypothesis: The choline signal as observed by MRS is sensitive to treatment, and a positive response to treatment will give a reduction in choline concentration. The purpose of this study is to establish methods for quantification of choline in breast cancer by MRS</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Choline Quantification in Breast Cancer by MRS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Establishment of new MRS sequence for choline quantification of choline. This sequence is choline-selective, and signals from water and lipids are suppressed simultaneously. 2. Compare to different methods for choline quantification. The first method is quantification through an external phantom standard, containing a known concentration of choline. The other method is based on the utilisation of internal water signal as a reference. Both calculations can be performed from the same MR exam. Ten patients will be included in the study.</detailed_description>
