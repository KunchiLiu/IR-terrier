	<brief_title>Liposomal Doxorubicin, Vincristine, &amp; Dexamethasone Plus Arsenic Trioxide in Untreated Symptomatic Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: The chemotherapy combination of doxorubicin, vincristine and dexamethasone (DVd) has been used with some efficacy in patients with multiple myeloma. However, DVd's efficacy is primarily considered palliative for patients with this condition. The current study adds arsenic trioxide to the DVd combo to assess if all of the treatments together improve patient outcomes. Previous studies suggest that arsenic trioxide may enhance the efficacy of specific chemotherapy agents including those in DVd; however, research in people has not yet demonstrated this improved effectiveness. Because the safety of arsenic trioxide has been tested in this patient population, this phase II study will gather more information about safety and also measure efficacy through various measures. Purpose: This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of doxorubicin, vincristine and dexamethasone plus arsenic trioxide in untreated patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma. The biology of the tumor and other molecular changes will also be assessed in patients through collections of blood and marrow samples. Treatment: Patients in this study will receive arsenic trioxide, doxorubicin, vincristine and dexamethasone. During the first five days of the study, patients will be given arsenic trioxide each day through an intravenous infusion. No treatments will be provided on days six and seven. After this first week, patients will then receive study drugs on the following schedule every four weeks: doxorubicin and vincristine on day one, dexamethasone on days one through four, and arsenic trioxide twice each week. This schedule can be repeated up to four times for a total of approximately four months. Several tests and exams will be given throughout the study to closely monitor patients. Supportive care will be provided to help regulate side effects from study drugs and maintain quality of life in patients. Treatments will be discontinued due to disease growth or unacceptable side effects.</detailed_description>
