	<brief_title>Exemestane With Celecoxib as Neoadjuvant Treatment in Postmenopausal Women With Stage II, III, and IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: In postmenopausal women, the main source of estrogen is through the conversion of androgens, or sex hormones produced by the adrenal glands. An enzyme called aromatase carries out this process. Exemestane, an aromatase inhibitor, blocks production of estrogens. Research indicates that the gene responsible for aromatase activity is CYPO19. Therefore, exemestane helps to inhibit aromatase activity through CYP019. Along with CYP019, another gene associated with breast cancer is an overexpression of COX-2 enzymes. Research suggests that COX-2 overexpression can cause cancer cell division, increased blood flow to tumors, and metastases. Celecoxib blocks COX-2 activity and produces fewer side effects compared with other non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This study builds on previous research to test the combination of exemestane and celecoxib for breast cancer. Purpose: This study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of exemestane and celecoxib before surgery for stage II, III, and IV breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Tests will analyze the CYP019 gene after these treatments. Treatment: Patients in this study will receive exemestane and celecoxib. Both drugs will be given to patients as oral pills. Exemestane will be taken daily for sixteen weeks. Starting in week 9, celecoxib will be taken twice daily for eight weeks. Therefore, during weeks 9-16, patients will be taking both exemestane and celecoxib. Several tests and exams will be given throughout the study to closely monitor patients, including a biopsy performed after the first 8 weeks on exemestane. After sixteen weeks on exemestane and celecoxib, patients will have breast surgery.</detailed_description>
