	<brief_summary>We want to compare Taxol given weekly with Taxotere given every 3 week both in comination with Xeloda. We are going to compare time to treatment failure and quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Weekly Taxol Plus Xeloda® vs Taxotere q3wk Plus Xeloda® in the Treatment of Metastatic BC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open labeled randomized multicentre phase II/III trial. It is intended to include patients who are not usually included into clinical trials because they are not having disease with measurable lesions. In breast cancer the bulk of patients with metastatic disease is presenting with bone metastases which is difficult to evaluate with respect to response. In this study it is one of the main objectives to include this kind of everyday patients that we see in the clinic. Because of this we will be using TTF as the primary endpoint. Skeletal events requiring radiotherapy or major changes in pain medications are defined as treatment failures causing stop in treatment even in the absence of radiological findings. A: weekly Taxol® plus Xeloda® on days 1-14 q 3w B: Taxotere® q 3w plus Xeloda® on days 1-14 q 3w Patients are randomized equally between the two arms. Concomitant therapy: Simultaneous use of bisphosphonates is allowed, if this treatment has been initiated at least four weeks before study entry.</detailed_description>

Evaluable metastases. Lytic bone metastases as only site of recurrence are allowed and can be evaluated for response according to the WHOcriteria for reporting on response in bone metastases.
