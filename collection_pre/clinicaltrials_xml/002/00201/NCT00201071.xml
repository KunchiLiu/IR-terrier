	<brief_title>Asthma Surveillance and Education in Preschool Settings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Proposed is a non-randomized, controlled, prospective trial to test the efficacy of a bilingual intervention to improve asthma care for low-income inner-city children enrolled in subsidized preschool childcare programs. Because of high rates of asthma prevalence, subsidized preschool childcare programs offer ideal settings to test innovative strategies to improve asthma care within communities at highest risk of morbidity. DESIGN NARRATIVE: The study will comprise three arms. Arm 1 is surveillance, in which children with asthma are identified. In Arm 2, children with asthma are identified and given written Asthma Action Plans (monitoring). Arm 3 consists of surveillance, monitoring, and education.</detailed_description>
