	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Tinzaparin may stop the growth of kidney cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of tinzaparin and to see how well it works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tinzaparin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the effect of tinzaparin sodium on fibrin formation (prothrombin fragment F1.2), thrombin generation (thrombin-antithrombin complexes), and fibrinolysis (D-Dimer) from baseline to 2 weeks and at nadir or disease progression in patients with unresectable metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Secondary - Determine the effect of tinzaparin sodium treatment on circulating angiogenesis markers, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). - Determine the proportion of patients developing venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage. - Determine the tolerability of tinzaparin sodium treatment for up to 6 months in these patients. - Establish the feasibility of undertaking a multicenter renal cell carcinoma trial with specialized coagulation test collection, shipping, and processing. - Obtain more accurate and specific mean, median, and variability in biomarker data in advanced RCC patients treated with tinzaparin sodium for purposes of planning larger future trials. - Estimate the progression-free survival at 4 months in patients treated with tinzaparin sodium. - Correlate progression-free survival with changes in markers of coagulation activation or angiogenesis. - Correlate the anticoagulant activity of tinzaparin sodium (anti-Xa activity) with change in coagulation markers, angiogenesis markers, and progression-free survival. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot, multicenter study. Patients receive a treatment dose of tinzaparin sodium subcutaneously (SC) once daily for 14 days followed by a prophylactic dose of tinzaparin sodium SC once daily for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
