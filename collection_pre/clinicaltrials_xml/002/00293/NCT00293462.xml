	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: GM-CSF may protect normal cells from the side effects, such as mucositis, of radiation therapy and may help damaged tissue heal faster after radiation therapy. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well GM-CSF works in preventing and treating mucositis in patients who are undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GM-CSF Mouthwash for Preventing and Treating Mucositis in Patients Who Are Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the incidence of radiotherapy (RT)-induced oral mucositis of any grade, using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (RTOG ARMSC)-Mucous Membrane, in patients treated with 1 of 2 mouthwashes (sargramostim [GM-CSF] or salt and soda). (prevention portion of the study) - Compare the effectiveness of the 2 mouthwashes in treating oral mucositis as defined by the incidence of RTOG ARMSC-Mucous Membrane grade 3 and 4 mucositis in patients in 1 of 3 groups (salt and soda, continuing GM-CSF, or new GM-CSF). (treatment portion of the study) Secondary - Compare the effectiveness of the 2 mouthwashes in preventing RT-induced oral mucositis by the following direct indices: - Cumulative RT dose prior to onset of oral mucositis (prevention portion only) - Severity of RT-induced oral mucositis at onset and during treatment (using Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale [OMAS]) - Severity of oral mucositis-related pain at onset and during treatment (using OMAS) - Incidence of oral mucositis-related infection at onset and during treatment (using OMAS) - Severity of oral mucositis-related problems with ingestion of food and fluids at onset and during treatment (using OMAS) - Time to healing of RT-induced oral mucositis. - Evaluate patients using the following indirect indices of oral mucositis morbidity during the prevention and treatment portions of the study. - Tolerance to RT regimen - Functional status - Quality of life. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blinded study. Patients are stratified according to radiotherapy dose schedule (standard vs hyperfractionation vs intensity modulation) and concurrent chemotherapy (yes vs no). - Prevention (no mucositis): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral sargramostim (GM-CSF) mouthwash, holding it in their mouths and swallowing it in intervals over 1 hour once daily. - Arm II: Patients receive oral salt and soda mouthwash, holding it and swallowing it in intervals over 1 hour once daily. Treatment in both arms continues during 6-7 weeks of radiotherapy and/or the onset of mucositis. Patients also perform PRO-SELF: Mouth Aware (PSMA) twice daily. - Treatment (onset of mucositis): Patients who are currently using GM-CSF mouthwash continue use as in prevention. Patients who are currently using salt and soda mouthwash are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm III: Patients receive GM-CSF mouthwash as in arm I. - Arm IV: Patients receive salt and soda mouthwash as in arm II. In both arms, treatment continues until the mucositis heals. Patients perform PSMA four times daily during and for 3 months after radiotherapy. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and periodically after radiotherapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every once a month for 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 222 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
