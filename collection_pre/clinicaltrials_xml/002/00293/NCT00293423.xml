	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells, such as gp96 heat shock protein-peptide complex, may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gp96 heat shock protein-peptide complex vaccine and to see how well it works in treating patients with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GP96 Heat Shock Protein-Peptide Complex Vaccine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety and best tolerated dose and frequency of gp96 heat shock protein-peptide complex vaccine in patients with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma. (phase I [closed to accrual as of 7/25/2007]) - Determine the clinical response to treatment, time to disease recurrence and progression, and overall survival of patients treated with this vaccine. (phase II) Secondary - Determine the immune response in patients treated with this vaccine. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, phase I study (closed to accrual as of 7/25/2007) followed by a phase II study. - Phase I (closed to accrual as of 7/25/2007): Patients undergo surgical resection. Viable tumor tissue is used to generate the gp96 heat shock protein-peptide complex (HSPPC-96) vaccine. Patients with primary disease receive standard adjuvant therapy after surgery. Patients whose disease progresses during or after standard adjuvant therapy receive the HSPPC-96 vaccine. Patients with recurrent disease receive the HSPPC-96 vaccine between 2-8 weeks after surgery. The HSPPC-96 vaccine is administered intradermally every 1-3 weeks for 4 doses and then every 2-3 weeks thereafter in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or vaccine depletion. Cohorts of 6 patients receive the HSPPC-96 vaccine at escalating dose frequencies until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase II: Patients receive the HSPPC-96 vaccine as in phase I at the appropriate dose frequency determined in phase I (closed to accrual as of 7/25/2007). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
