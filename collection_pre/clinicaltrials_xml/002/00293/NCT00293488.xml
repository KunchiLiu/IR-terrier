	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as SL-11047, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of SL-11047 in treating patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SL-11047 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SL-11047 in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma. - Describe and quantify the toxicity of SL-11047 administered to patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma. Secondary - Describe the pharmacokinetics of SL-11047 administered as a 30-minute IV infusion. - Assess the response rate and duration of response in patients treated with SL-11047. - Assess the level of SL-11047 within tumor tissues following intravenous administration of the drug. - Determine the sensitivity of abnormal circulating macrophages to SL-11047. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation study. Patients receive SL-11047 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SL-11047 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
