	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of MS-275 in treating patients who have hematologic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MS-275 in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxic effects and pharmacokinetics of MS-275 in patients with poor-risk hematologic malignancy. - Determine whether this drug induces changes in hematologic differentiation, in terms of changes in morphology, cell surface marker expression, and acetylation status, in these patients. - Determine whether this drug induces clinical response in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral MS-275 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MS-275 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
