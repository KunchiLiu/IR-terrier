	<brief_summary>Objective: To determine if the calcium channel blockers, amlodipine can augment the effect of botulinum toxin injections in the treatment of focal dystonia. Study Population: 20 patients with cervical dystonia Design: Double-bind, placebo-controlled clinical trail. Outcome measures: For patients: dystonia rating scales (Twistrs, Fahn-Marsden dystonia scale, NINDS subjective patient rating scale), and hand grip strength. For healthy volunteers: Amplitude of EDB MEP.</brief_summary>
