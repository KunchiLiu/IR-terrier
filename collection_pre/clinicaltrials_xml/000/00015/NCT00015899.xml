	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: SCH 66336 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of SCH 66336 in treating children with recurrent or progressive brain tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SCH 66336 in Treating Children With Recurrent or Progressive Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of SCH 66336 in children with recurrent or progressive brain tumors. - Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients. - Describe the pharmacokinetics of this drug with and without dexamethasone in these patients. - Investigate the efficacy of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral SCH 66336 twice daily. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of SCH 66336 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which it is predicted that 20% of patients may experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 6 patients are treated at the determined MTD. Patients are followed within 30 days of the last administration of the study drug and then for up to 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
