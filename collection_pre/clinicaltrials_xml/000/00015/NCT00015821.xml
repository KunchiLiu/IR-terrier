	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating patients who have myelofibrosis. Thalidomide may stop the growth of myelofibrosis by stopping blood flow to the cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thalidomide in Treating Patients With Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To investigate whether thalidomide, a potent inhibitor of angiogenic and fibrogenic growth factors, is an effective therapeutic agent in patients with MMM. Specifically, to assess whether thalidomide improves anemia and/or organomegaly in patients with MMM. II. To assess the effects of thalidomide on the myelofibrotic stroma with respect to microvascular architecture and angiogenesis, collagen and reticulin deposition, and the expression of the mediating growth factors bFGF, TGF-b, and PDGF, and their respective receptors. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive 1 additional year of therapy. Patients are followed every 6 months until 5 years from study entry.</detailed_description>
