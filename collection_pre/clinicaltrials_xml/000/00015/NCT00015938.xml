	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining docetaxel, vinorelbine, and filgrastim in treating women who have stage IV breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0102: Docetaxel, Vinorelbine, and Filgrastim in Treating Women With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the 1-year survival of women with HER-2-negative stage IV breast cancer treated with docetaxel, vinorelbine, and filgrastim (G-CSF). - Determine the response rate (both complete and partial response) and time to progression in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1, vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 8 and 15, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 2-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-5 months.</detailed_description>
