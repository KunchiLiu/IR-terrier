	<brief_title>Resperine, Gabapentin, or Lamotrigine for the Treatment of Cocaine Dependence: 2 - 7</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Considerable progress in preclinical research has provided a basis for hypothesis driven clinical trials in cocaine dependence. A greater mechanistic understanding of both cocaine and many clinically approved medications has led to the identification of many promising medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence. For this reason NIDA has developed a CREST (Clinical Rapid Evaluation Screening Trial) protocol to provide a needed incremental medication screening step between preclinical research and full blown expensive Phase III pivotal trials. While patients receive manual based psychotherapy, three medications are screened compared to unmatched placebo in an eight-week, 60-subject, four cell design trial. Other important features of the CREST protocol include collecting baseline measurements over a two week period and analyzing primary outcome measures (quantitative urine toxicology and clinical global improvement scales) in terms of a composite score of overall individual patient improvement. The three medications being evaluated in this trial include reserpine, gabapentin and lamotrigine. Reserpine is being screened because of its well-known preclinical ability to functionally antagonize cocaine (by depleting neurochemicals elevated by cocaine). Gabapentin and lamotrigine are hypothesized to interfere with glutamatergic cocaine sensitization/kindling mechanisms relevant to addiction.</detailed_description>

Females who are pregnant or lactating or having had three or more days of amenorrhea beyond the time of expected menses at the time of the first dose of study medication. 7. Subjects who have clinically significant abnormal laboratory values as determined by the principal investigator. 8. Subjects who have any disease of the gastrointestinal system, liver, or kidneys which could result in altered metabolism or excretion of the study medication. 9. Chronic therapy with any medication which could interact adversely with one of the medications under study. 10.
