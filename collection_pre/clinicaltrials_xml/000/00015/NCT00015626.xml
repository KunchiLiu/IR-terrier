	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to aggressively treat insulin resistance and its clinical manifestations when they first appear in childhood, and to prevent the subsequent progression towards impaired glucose tolerance and type-2 diabetes. In the process of this clinical trial, we will learn more about the early manifestations of insulin resistance, its treatment, and its relationship to obesity and type-2 diabetes through parallel in-vivo and in-vitro studies.</brief_summary>
