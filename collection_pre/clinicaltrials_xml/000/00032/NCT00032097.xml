	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs such as motexafin gadolinium may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness motexafin gadolinium in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme who are undergoing radiation therapy to the brain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Motexafin Gadolinium in Treating Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme Who Are Undergoing Radiation Therapy to the Brain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity of 2 different schedules of motexafin gadolinium as a radiosensitizer in patients with glioblastoma multiforme receiving cranial radiotherapy. - Determine the maximum tolerated doses of this drug on these 2 schedules in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the biodistribution of this drug in both neoplastic tissue and normal brain parenchyma in these patients. - Determine the effect and accumulation of this drug in both normal brain parenchyma and neoplastic tissue in these patients. - Correlate the effect and accumulation of this drug in both normal brain parenchyma and neoplastic tissue with the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of motexafin gadolinium (PCI-0120). Patients are sequentially assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. - Group I: Patients receive PCI-0120 IV over 30-60 minutes once every other day for 6 weeks. Patients concurrently undergo cranial radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks. - Group II: Patients receive PCI-0120 IV over 30-60 minutes once daily concurrently during radiotherapy. Patients undergo cranial radiotherapy as in group I. Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each group receive escalating doses of PCI-0120 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
