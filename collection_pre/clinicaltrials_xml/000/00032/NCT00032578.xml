	<brief_summary>This project is a program-wide genetic tissue databank for the Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program (CSP). The genetic tissue bank has four components: a central repository for DNA and other genetic tissue specimens; a Scientific Advisory Committee of individuals with expertise in the genetics and epidemiology of diseases with special importance to the VA (including cardiovascular, neurologic, respiratory, psychological and other disorders); an Ethics Oversight Committee of individuals with expertise in bioethics and the law, as they apply to the collection and use of genetic tissue, and a Coordinating Center that administers the tissue bank, coordinates the scientific and ethics oversight committees, maintains central access to clinical study data linked to the tissue bank, and provides statistical analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VA Genetic Tissue Banking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention: No intervention. Primary Hypothesis: It is feasible and cost-effective to create a CSP-wide facility for banking genetic tissue in CSP studies. Study Abstract: This is a program-wide genetic tissue databank for the Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program (CSP). The study has five components: a central repository for DNA and other genetic tissue specimens; a Scientific Advisory Committee of individuals with expertise in the genetics and epidemiology of diseases with special importance to the VA (including cardiovascular, neurologic, respiratory, psychological and other disorders); an Ethical Oversight Committee of individuals with expertise in bioethics and the law, as they apply to the collection and use of genetic tissue, A Veteran's Advisory Group, and a Coordinating Center administers the tissue bank, coordinates the three oversight committees, maintains central access to clinical study data linked to the tissue bank, and provides statistical analysis.</detailed_description>
