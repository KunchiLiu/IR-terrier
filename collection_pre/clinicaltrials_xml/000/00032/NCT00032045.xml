	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining vaccine therapy with a monoclonal antibody may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining vaccine therapy with monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have stage IV melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy and Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the clinical response in patients with stage IV melanoma when treated with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody combined with gp100:209-217 and gp100:280-288 peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA-51. - Determine a safety and adverse event profile of this regimen in these patients. - Determine improved immunologic response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody IV over 90 minutes immediately followed by gp100:209-217 and gp100:280-288 peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously on days 1, 22, 43, and 64. Treatment repeats every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 68 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
