	<detailed_description>It is proposed a randomized, blinded, controlled trial comparing vestibular rehabilitation (VR) to Tai Chi (TC). Our overall goal is to explore whether, and if so, how TC can improve functional, dynamic stability in persons with vestibulopathy (VSP). It is hypothesized that the TC group will demonstrate significantly greater improvement in performing functional activities than the VR group. Sixty subjects will be randomly assigned into either TC instruction or VR. Both treatment groups will receive identical duration treatment once a week for 10 weeks, with supplemental home exercises. It is hypothesized that 1) TC improves whole-body dynamic locomotor stability more than does VR; 2) TC improves gait coordination during planned and unplanned obstacle encounters more than does VR; 3) TC improves whole-body speed related movement control more than does VR.</detailed_description>
