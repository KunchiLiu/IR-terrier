	<brief_summary>Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining bryostatin 1 with interleukin-2 may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells. Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining interleukin-2 and bryostatin 1 in treating patients who have advanced kidney cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 and Bryostatin 1 in Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and bryostatin 1. II. Compare the toxicity of 3 different doses of bryostatin 1 given in combination with a fixed dose of IL-2 in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of three dose levels of bryostatin 1. ARM I: Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously on days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18. For the second and subsequent courses of IL-2, patients also receive lowest dose bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive IL-2 as in arm I and middle dose bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM III: Patients receive IL-2 as in arm I and highest dose bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive 3 additional courses of therapy. An additional cohort of patients receives treatment as above at a higher dose to evaluate toxicity. Patients are followed for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-65 patients (8-16 per bryostatin 1 dose level) will be accrued for this study within 14-27 months.</detailed_description>
