	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying how older women make treatment decisions and how these decisions affect the outcome of treatment may help doctors plan more effective treatments and improve patient quality of life. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how a patient's treatment preferences and decisions about chemotherapy affect the outcome of treatment in older women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Decisions and Outcomes in Older Women With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the relationship between preferences and chemotherapy decisions in women age 65 and over with operable, newly diagnosed breast cancer. - Determine how factors that could be targets for intervention affect the relationship between preferences and chemotherapy decisions in these patients. - Determine the relationships between preference-based chemotherapy decisions, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment decisions in these patients. - Determine the disease-free survival and competing causes of mortality of these patients. - Determine the types of physician providers who care for older breast cancer survivors after initial cancer treatment is completed and explore how women decide about which physicians to see. - Measure quality indicators for the survivorship phase of care and evaluate if quality varies by type of physician provider model. - Determine if long-term patient-reported satisfaction varies as a function of physician model for providing follow-up care post-treatment. - Determine whether physician-patient communication and coordination of care after treatment ends mediate follow-up quality and outcomes post-treatment. OUTLINE: This is a cohort study. Patients participate in interviews over 30-45 minutes at baseline, at 6 months, and at 1 and 2 years. Patients are followed annually for at least 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,296 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.</detailed_description>
