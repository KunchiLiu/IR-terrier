	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well erlotinib works in treating patients with unresectable or metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0330 Erlotinib in Treating Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine response (confirmed, complete, and partial) in patients with unresectable or metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor when treated with erlotinib. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Correlate, preliminarily, indicators of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) function (e.g., expression, phosphorylation, or markers of signal transduction downstream of EGFR) with response and progression-free and overall survival in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the feasibility of accruing these patients in the cooperative group setting. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve at least a confirmed partial response and become resectable undergo surgical resection (with or without radiotherapy) and then receive 2 additional courses of erlotinib. Patients with responding disease who do not become resectable continue erlotinib as above. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of erlotinib beyond the CR. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
