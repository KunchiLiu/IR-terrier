	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Moving a salivary gland out of the area that will undergo radiation therapy may protect the gland from side effects of radiation therapy and may prevent xerostomia (dry mouth). PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of salivary gland surgery in preventing xerostomia in patients who are undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Salivary Gland Surgery Before Radiation Therapy in Preventing Radiation-Caused Xerostomia in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the reproducibility of the surgical technique of submandibular salivary gland transfer in patients with head and neck cancer. - Determine the rate and severity of radiation-induced xerostomia after this surgery in these patients. - Determine the pattern of recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this surgery followed by radiotherapy. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo surgical transfer of the submandibular salivary gland to the submental space. Within 4-6 weeks after surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week for 5 ½ to 7 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Salivary scans are performed before surgery, at 2-3 weeks after surgery, and then at 6 months from the start of radiotherapy. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months from the start of radiotherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years and then annually. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-48 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.6 years.</detailed_description>
