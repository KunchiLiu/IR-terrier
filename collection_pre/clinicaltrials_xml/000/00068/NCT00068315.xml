	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when given together with fludarabine with or without rituximab in treating patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving bortezomib together with fludarabine with or without rituximab may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib and Fludarabine With or Without Rituximab in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and toxicity of bortezomib and fludarabine with or without rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib in combination with fludarabine in these patients. III. Determine the biological effect of this regimen on apoptotic markers, cell cycle kinase inhibitors, and DNA repair in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bortezomib. Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3 or 1-5. Patients may also receive rituximab IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
