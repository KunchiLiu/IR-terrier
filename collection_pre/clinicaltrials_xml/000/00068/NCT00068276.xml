	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Cholecalciferol (vitamin D) may improve quality of life by increasing blood counts, decreasing fatigue, and improving other symptoms of myelodysplastic syndrome. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well cholecalciferol works in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cholecalciferol in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of cholecalciferol, in terms of hematological improvement, in patients with low- or intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. - Determine the effect of this drug on disease symptoms, fatigue, and the overall health-related quality of life of these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study. Patients receive oral cholecalciferol once daily. Treatment continues for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
