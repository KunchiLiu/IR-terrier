	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as methotrexate and temozolomide use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells. Combining methotrexate, temozolomide, and rituximab with radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of temozolomide when given together with methotrexate and rituximab followed by radiation therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of temozolomide in combination with methotrexate and rituximab before fractionated whole brain radiotherapy in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma. - Compare the 2-year survival rate of patients receiving this chemotherapy regimen before radiotherapy and temozolomide after radiotherapy to that of patients treated on protocol RTOG-9310. - Compare the tumor response rates of patients treated with this chemotherapy regimen before radiotherapy to that of patients treated on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), RTOG-9310. - Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the acute and long-term neurologic toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of temozolomide in combination with methotrexate and rituximab before radiotherapy, followed by a phase II study. Phase I - Pre-radiotherapy chemotherapy: Patients receive rituximab IV 3 days prior to the first course of methotrexate. Patients then receive methotrexate IV over 4 hours on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 (for a total of 5 doses). Patients also receive oral temozolomide daily for 5 days on weeks 4 and 8. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 0 of 3 or 1 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Radiotherapy: Patients undergo whole brain radiotherapy daily for 5 days on weeks 11, 12, and 13. - Post-radiotherapy chemotherapy: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5 beginning at week 14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 10 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Phase II - Patients receive treatment as in phase I at the MTD of temozolomide. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at weeks 10 and 13, every 2 months during post-radiotherapy temozolomide therapy, at the end of therapy, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52-64 patients (up to 18 patients for phase I and 46 patients for phase II) will be accrued for this study within 19 months.</detailed_description>
