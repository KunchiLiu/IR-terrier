	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Lonafarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining lonafarnib and trastuzumab with paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lonafarnib when given together with trastuzumab and paclitaxel in treating patients with HER2/neu-overexpressing stage IIIB, stage IIIC, or stage IV breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lonafarnib, Trastuzumab, and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With HER2/Neu-Overexpressing Stage IIIB, Stage IIIC, or Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of lonafarnib in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and paclitaxel in patients with HER2/neu-overexpressing stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV breast cancer. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this regimen in these patients. Secondary - Determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of these drugs in these patients. - Correlate the pharmacodynamics with the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. - Correlate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this regimen with observed toxicity in these patients. - Determine the response to this regimen in patients with measurable disease. OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of lonafarnib. - Course 1: Patients receive a loading dose of trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and over 30 minutes on days 8 and 15. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. - Course 2: Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 2. Patients also receive oral lonafarnib twice daily on days 3-21. - Course 3 and all subsequent courses: Patients receive oral lonafarnib twice daily on days 1-21; trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15; and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of lonafarnib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
