	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory extensive-stage small cell lung cancer that was previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (such as cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Previously Treated With Platinum-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of bortezomib, in terms of response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial), in patients with recurrent or refractory extensive stage small cell lung cancer previously treated with platinum-based therapy. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Correlate selected molecular markers with outcomes in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to platinum-sensitivity status (platinum sensitive [temporarily closed to accrual as of 8/1/04] vs platinum refractory [temporarily closed to accrual as of 6/1/04]). Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-80 patients (20-40 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 0.5-1 year.</detailed_description>
