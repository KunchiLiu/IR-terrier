	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor are rejected by the body's normal cells. Ultraviolet-B light therapy given before and after allogeneic stem cell transplantation may help prevent this from happening. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of combining ultraviolet-B light therapy with allogeneic stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have hematologic malignancies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultraviolet-B Light Therapy and Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety of ultraviolet-B light therapy and allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancies by demonstrating 100-day mortality no greater than 15% and 1-year mortality no greater than 40%. - Determine the frequency of treatment-related toxicity leading to death and frequency of disease relapse resulting in death in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients treated with this regimen. Secondary - Determine the rates of donor allogeneic hematologic engraftment in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the rate and quality of immune reconstitution in the peripheral blood and the composition of immune cells in the skin before and after transplantation in these patients. - Determine the event-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: - Preparative regimen: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -8 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -3 to -2. Patients also receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4 hours on days -2 to -1. Patients undergo ultraviolet-B (UVB) light therapy every other day between days -10 and -2 for a total of 3 days. - Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation: Patients undergo PBSC transplantation on day 0. - Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive oral cyclosporine on days -1 to 100 and methylprednisolone (oral or IV) on days 5-15. - Posttransplantation UVB light therapy: Following PBSC transplantation, patients undergo UVB light therapy twice weekly on week 1 (at least 1 day apart) and three times weekly on weeks 2-4. Donor lymphocyte infusion is performed per institutional guidelines for patients in whom emerging donor chimerism post allogeneic PBSC transplantation is not progressing (consistently below 50% during first 3 months), for whom donor chimerism is receding (to below 25%) despite cessation of cyclosporine, or who relapse within 24 months after allografting. Patients are followed at least monthly for 3 months and then at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-36 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
