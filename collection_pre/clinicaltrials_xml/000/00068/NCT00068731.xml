	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Lycopene, a substance found in tomatoes, may lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and slow or prevent the development of prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of lycopene in treating patients who have asymptomatic metastatic prostate cancer and a rising PSA level.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lycopene in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the percentage of patients with asymptomatic androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer and an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level who sustain a decline in PSA after 4 months of treatment with lycopene. Secondary - Determine the response duration of PSA decline in patients treated with this therapy. - Determine the time to the first consistent PSA increase in patients treated with this therapy. - Determine whether a decline in PSA coincides with evidence of disease regression on physical examination or radiographic assessment in patients treated with this therapy. - Determine the adverse event profile of this therapy in these patients. - Determine the factors that motivate prostate cancer patients to enroll in a nutritional-based therapy study. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral lycopene twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days for at least 4 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
