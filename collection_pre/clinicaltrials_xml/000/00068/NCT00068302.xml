	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as sirolimus use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sirolimus in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sirolimus in Treating Young Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemia or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of sirolimus in pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the trough levels produced by this drug in these patients. - Determine the anti-leukemia/lymphoma activity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral sirolimus once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of sirolimus until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
