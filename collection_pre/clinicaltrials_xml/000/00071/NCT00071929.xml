	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating patients who have persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of oxaliplatin in terms of response rate in patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial carcinoma that is refractory to curative or established therapy. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
