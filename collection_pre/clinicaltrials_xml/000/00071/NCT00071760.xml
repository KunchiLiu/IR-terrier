	<brief_title>Study Of An Investigational Regimen Including FDA Approved HIV Drugs In HIV-Infected Pediatric Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 48 week, Phase II, open-label, 2-cohort, multicenter study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of GW433908 and GW433908/RTV when administered to HIV-1 infected protease inhibitor (PI) naive and PI-experienced pediatric subjects aged 4 weeks to &lt;2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female 4 weeks to &lt;2 years of age. Cohort 1 (6 months &lt;2 years): Subjects must be &lt;2 years of age at the Week 2 visit therefore the maximum age at screening is 22 months. Cohort 2 (4 weeks &lt;6 months): Subjects must be &lt;6 months of age at the Week 2 visit, therefore the maximum age at screening is 4 months for entry into this cohort. Parent or legal guardian is willing and able to provide written informed consent for the subject to participate in the trial. Screening plasma HIV1 RNA level &gt;=400copies/mL. Subjects who, in the investigator's opinion, and following viral resistance testing if conducted, are able to construct an active Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI) backbone regimen consisting of 2 NRTIs. Subjects must meet one of the following criteria: Therapynaïve or PInaïve subjects (defined as having received less than one week of any PI). PIexperienced subjects defined as having prior experience with no more than three PIs. Prior RTVboosted PI therapy will be considered as only one PI as long as the RTV dose was lower than that recommended for use of RTV as an antiretroviral agent. Prior history of having received APV. NonNucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) therapy within 14 days prior to study drug administration (single or multiple dose) or anticipated need for concurrent NNRTI therapy during the study period. PI therapy within 5 days prior to study drug administration (applicable only for subjects undergoing single dose visits) Subjects and/or parents/legal guardians who, in the investigator's opinion, are not able to comply with the requirements of the study. Subject is in the initial acute phase of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Clinical Category C event or infection (per 1994 classification) at Baseline. Subject may be enrolled provided they are receiving treatment for the infections, such treatment not being contraindicated with FPV, and subjects are clinically improving at the Baseline visit. Presence of a malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal dysfunction which might interfere with drug absorption or render the subject unable to take oral medication. Presence of any serious medical condition (e.g., hemoglobinopathy, chronic anemia, diabetes, cardiac dysfunction, hepatitis, or clinically relevant pancreatitis) which, in the opinion of the investigator, might compromise the safety of the subject. Any acute laboratory abnormality at screen which, in the opinion of the investigator, should preclude the subject's participation in the study of an investigational compound. If subjects are found to have an acute Grade 4 laboratory abnormality at screening, this test may be repeated once within the screening window. Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality would exclude a subject from study participation. Grade 3 or higher (&gt;10x ULN) serum aminotransferase levels (alanine aminotransferase, ALT and/or aspartate aminotransferase, AST) within 28 days prior to study drug administration and / or clinically relevant hepatitis within the previous 6 months. Treatment with radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents within 28 days of study drug administration or an anticipated need for such treatment within the study period. Treatment with immunomodulating agents (e.g., systemic corticosteroids, interleukins, interferons) or any agent with known antiHIV activity (e.g., hydroxyurea or foscarnet) within 28 days of study drug administration. Treatment with any of the following medications within 28 days prior to receiving study medication or the anticipated need during the study: Amiodarone, astemizole, bepridil, bupropion, cisapride, clorazepate, clozapine, diazepam, dihydroergotamine, encainide, ergonovine, ergotamine, estazolam, flecainide, flurazepam, lovastatin, meperidine, methylergonovine, midazolam, pimozide, piroxicam, propafenone, propoxyphene, quinidine, simvastatin, terfenadine, and triazolam (these drugs have been excluded for safety reasons). Carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin, St Johns Wort, (these drugs have been excluded because they have the potential to decrease plasma protease inhibitor concentrations). Treatment with other investigational drugs/therapies within 28 days prior to receiving study medication (note: treatments available through a Treatment IND or other expandedaccess mechanism will be evaluated on a casebycase basis in consultation with the sponsor). History of drug or other allergy which, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation in the trial or known hypersensitivity to any study medications (e.g. documented hypersensitivity to a nucleoside analogue).</criteria>
