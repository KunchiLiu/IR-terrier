	<brief_summary>Insulin is a chemical that the body needs in order to use or store sugar. It is made by a type of cell called a beta cell which resides in an organ known as the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes is a disease where the beta cells are unable to meet a person's insulin needs. Sugar levels rise in the blood as a result. INGAP-Peptide is being tested to attempt to create new beta cells in the pancreas, and to improve the ability to produce insulin in type 2 diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
