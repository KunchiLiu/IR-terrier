Histologicallyconfirmed and MRI diagnosed recurrent or progressive GBM after previous resection (surgical or biopsy) and radiation therapy. Medically capable of undergoing the planned surgical gross total resection and the catheter placement. Age ≥ 18. Karnofsky Performance Status of ≥ 70%. Life expectancy of ≥ 3 months. Patients must already be taking or begin taking corticosteroids at a stable dose of 4 mg every 6 hours for at least 72 hours prior to catheter placement.

Patients who have received more than two chemotherapy regimens (single therapy or combination therapy) are ineligible. Any form of brain radiation within 10 weeks of the start of the infusion. Previous gamma knife radiosurgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, and/or internal radiotherapy, unless the recurrence/progression is histologically confirmed (fineneedle biopsy). Prior intracavitary biologic response modifiers or monoclonal antibodies. Uncontrolled seizures. Bilateral or multifocal tumors. Evidence of cerebral uncal herniation. Midline brain shift on MRI scan of &gt; 0.5 cm prior to resection; patients with subfalcine herniation may be enrolled. Tumors involving the brainstem or cerebellum. Diffuse subependymal or CSF disease. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding. All women of childbearing potential should be excluded unless they have a negative pregnancy test and are using adequate contraceptive measures or are surgically sterile. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing.

Prior or concurrent investigational treatment within 30 days of study entry. Active infection requiring treatment or having an unexplained febrile illness. Systemic diseases or other conditions which may be associated with unacceptable anesthetic/operative risk and/or which would not allow safe completion of this study protocol. Prior or concurrent malignancy (curatively treated carcinomainsitu or basal cell carcinoma or patients who have been disease free for at least 5 years are eligible).</criteria>
