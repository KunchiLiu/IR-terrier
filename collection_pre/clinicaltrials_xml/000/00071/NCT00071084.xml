	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to determine the effect of HuMax-CD4, as a treatment for advanced stage (late stage) cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Almost all patients who are affected by late stage CTCL have many cancerous cells which bear a receptor called CD4. HuMax-CD4 is an investigational drug directed against this receptor. There is no placebo in this trial; all patients will be treated with HuMax-CD4. The response rates, duration of responses, relief of symptoms, and safety profile of HuMax-CD4 will be evaluated during this trial.</brief_summary>
