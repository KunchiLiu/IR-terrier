	<brief_title>Medication Adherence in Older People With Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psychoses are among the most common and serious psychiatric disorders. Currently, the most effective treatment for psychoses involves the use of antipsychotic or neuroleptic medications. Unfortunately, pharmacologic regimens often do not achieve their goals because of poor medication adherence. Nonadherence to antipsychotic treatment is a considerable public health problem that leads to myriad clinical and economic burdens, including psychotic relapse, increased clinic and emergency room visits, and rehospitalization. Participants in this study are randomly assigned to receive either MAT or supportive treatment for 12 weeks. MAT is given in 15 sessions and consists of motivational interviewing, education, and social skills and behavior modification. Individual MAT sessions are held in Weeks 1 and 12; small group sessions take place in Weeks 2 through 11. Three monthly booster group sessions begin in Week 16. Participants are assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Medication adherence, psychopathology, quality of life, medication side effects, health beliefs, and functioning are assessed.</detailed_description>
