	<brief_summary>Insulin is a chemical that the body needs in order to use or store sugar. It is made by a type of cell called a beta cell which resides in an organ known as the pancreas. Type 1 diabetes is a disease where the beta cells have been destroyed so that little or no insulin is made. Sugar levels rise in the blood as a result. INGAP-Peptide is being tested to attempt to create new beta cells in the pancreas, and to restore the ability to produce insulin in type 1 diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
