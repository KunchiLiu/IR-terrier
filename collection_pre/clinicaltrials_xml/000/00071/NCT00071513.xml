	<brief_title>Middle School to High School Transition Project: Depression and Substance Abuse Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The transition from middle school to high school presents important challenges for adolescents. Programs that enhance personal efficacy and social support resources may prevent at-risk students from developing behaviors that can lead to substance use, academic failure, and depression. This study will implement a skills-based program called Coping and Support Training for the Transition (CAST-T) as a preventive intervention for at-risk students. At-risk students in eighth grade will be randomly assigned to receive either CAST-T or school as usual. The CAST-T program will initially be delivered in twelve sessions over 6 weeks in the middle school setting. The program includes booster sessions, case management, structured home-based parent education, and support and skills training throughout the transition period. Participants will be assessed from the beginning of eighth grade to the end of ninth grade. Vulnerability to academic problems and depression will be assessed with school records and self-report scale scores.</detailed_description>
