	<brief_title>Treatment and Outcome of Early Onset Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In children and adolescents, bipolar disorder is often accompanied by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia that require acute treatment with a combination of an atypical antipsychotic medication and a mood stabilizer. It is not known if it is necessary to continue treatment with the atypical antipsychotic medication after the child's symptoms have remitted. Participants in this study are treated with lithium, divalproex (Depakote), and one of the following atypical antipsychotic medications: olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal) or quetiapine (Seroquel) for at least 24 weeks. Participants who have already begun combination therapy with at least one of the mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotic medications listed above are also encouraged to enroll in this study. After participants have been on combination therapy for at least 24 weeks they will then be randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first group will continue to receive active mood stabilizer and atypical antipsychotic medication. The second group will receive active mood stabilizer and placebo. Participants are assessed weekly and followed for up to 18 months.</detailed_description>
