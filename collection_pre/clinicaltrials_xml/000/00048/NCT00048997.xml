	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known if giving radiation therapy to the head is effective in preventing CNS metastases in patients who have stage III non-small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well radiation therapy to the head works in preventing CNS metastases in patients who have been previously treated for stage III non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether prophylactic cranial irradiation improves survival after effective locoregional/systemic therapy in patients with stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. - Determine the neuropsychologic impact of this therapy in these patients. - Assess quality of life of patients receiving this therapy. - Determine the impact of this therapy on the incidence of CNS metastases in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage (IIIA vs IIIB), histology (non-squamous cell vs squamous cell), and prior surgery (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation 5 days a week for 3 weeks. - Arm II: Patients undergo observation. Patients are followed 3 months during the first year, every 6 months for 2-3 years and then annually thereafter. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at months 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,058 patients (529 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 36 months.</detailed_description>
