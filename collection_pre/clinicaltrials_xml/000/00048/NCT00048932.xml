	<brief_title>A Phase III Study of BMS-188667 in Subjects With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, parallel-dosing designed study. The treatment period was 12 months. Eligible participants were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups: abatacept fixed dose approximating 10 mg/kg (based on participant's body weight; 500 mg for participants weighing &lt; 60kg; 750 mg for participants weighing 60 to 100 kg; and 1 gram for participants weighing &gt; 100 kg, monthly) or placebo intravenous (IV) infusion. All participants continued their background therapy(ies) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (non-biologic or biologic disease-modifying drugs [DMARDs], or combination) throughout the double-blind treatment period. Double-blind study medication (abatacept or placebo) was administered on Days 1, 15, 29, and every 28 days thereafter, for a total of 14 doses. All participants who completed the 12-month double-blind study period (Day 1 through Day 365), were eligible to continue into the open-label period. All eligible participants (active or placebo) were re-allocated to receive abatacept at a weight-tiered dose that approximated 10 mg/kg, based on their Day 365 body weight. Participants continued to receive infusions every 28 days.</detailed_description>
