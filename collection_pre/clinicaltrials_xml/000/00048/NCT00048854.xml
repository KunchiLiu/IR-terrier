	<detailed_description>Moderate to severe premenstrual disturbances afflict up to 20 percent of women. Studies have shown the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle to be effective in improving symptoms in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Unfortunately, SRI treatment has only been evaluated in controlled clinical trials, and evidence suggests that patients in these clinical trials are not representative of women commonly seen in clinical practice. Thus, the real-world feasibility of intermittent dosing is questionable. Patients in this study receive sertraline (Zoloft) during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle every month for 6 months. The dose may be modified based on structured interviews with the patients. Assessments include questionnaires and interviews which take place at study start, at midpoint, and at the end of the study.</detailed_description>
