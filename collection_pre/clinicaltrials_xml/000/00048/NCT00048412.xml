	<brief_summary>1. To assess the treatment related mortality of allogeneic stem cell transplantation with non-myeloablative therapy incorporating the lymphodepleting MAb CAMPATH-1H, in patients with hematological diseases and renal cell carcinoma not eligible for conventional (myeloablative) therapy. 2. To assess the time to engraftment and incidence of graft failure in patients receiving this transplant regimen. 3. To assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and immunologic activity of CAMPATH-1H when used as part of a subablative conditioning regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stem Cell Transplant for Patients With Blood Malignancy Using Donors and Less Toxic Chemotherapy With CAMPATH 1H</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two arm study in which outcomes will be assessed independently in recipients of HLA matched sibling transplants and recipients of unrelated or mismatched family donor transplants, although both groups will receive identical treatments. The following will be given to the patient after admission: Day - 6: Total body irradiation Day - 5 to - 2: Fludarabine and Campath 1H Day - 1: Day of rest Day 0: Stem cell transplant (infusion)</detailed_description>
