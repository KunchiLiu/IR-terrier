	<brief_summary>Objectives: 1. Determine the toxicity of infusions of allogeneic donor lymphocytes activated by acute leukemia derived dendritic cells (DC/ADL) in relapsed patients after allo-stem cell transplants. 2. Quantitate the alloreactivity of DC/ADL and circulating immune effector cells in patients after infusion. 3. Assess efficacy of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in Blastic Crisis (CML-BC) derived dendritic cells and activated lymphocytes in promoting and sustaining remission in patients with relapse after allo-BMT or stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
