	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprotective drugs such as carboxypeptidase-G2 may protect normal cells from the toxic effects of chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of carboxypeptidase-G2 in treating nervous system toxic effects in patients given an accidental overdose of intrathecal methotrexate.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effectiveness of carboxypeptidase-G2 rescue in patients who develop life threatening methotrexate (MTX) neurotoxicity following accidental intrathecal MTX overdose. - Study the CSF pharmacokinetics of MTX following rescue. OUTLINE: Patients undergo a lumbar puncture as soon as possible after methotrexate overdose to remove methotrexate and receive a single dose of carboxypeptidase-G2 intrathecally over 5 minutes. Patients are followed for at least 1 month. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
