	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. It is not yet known which regimen of interleukin-2 is most effective for kidney cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of different regimens of interleukin-2 in treating patients who have metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and overall survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with either low-dose or high-dose intravenous interleukin-2 (IL-2) or subcutaneous IL-2. II. Compare the toxic effects of these 3 regimens in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to presence of renal tumor (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive low dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV every 8 hours for up to 15 doses. Treatment repeats in 7-10 days for one complete course. Arm II: Patients receive high dose IL-2 IV every 8 hours for up to 15 doses. Treatment repeats in 7-10 days for one complete course. Arm III: Patients receive IL-2 subcutaneously daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease receive an additional complete course of therapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
