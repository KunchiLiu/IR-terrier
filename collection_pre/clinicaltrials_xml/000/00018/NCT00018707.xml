	<brief_title>Follow-up of Psychological and Neurocognitive Gulf War Outcome: Relation to Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 800 deployed and 250 nondeployed veterans were originally administered psychological assessment instruments shortly after the cessation of the Gulf War. These veterans are currently being followed to evaluate longer-term psychological outcomes in relation to war-zone stress, intervening life stress, and individual difference factors and personal resources, such as coping and social support. Approximately 75 of these veterans, oversampled for post-traumatic stress disorder, were administered a specialized neuropsychological battery emphasizing attention and memory. This sample will also be followed to evaluate longitudinal neuropsychological outcome in relation to PTSD status. A cross-sectional study will also be conducted examining visual, hierarchical attention in relation to PTSD diagnosis.</detailed_description>
