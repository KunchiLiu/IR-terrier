	<brief_title>A Self-Management Intervention for Mild to Moderate Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a major disabling disease for American adults, affecting an estimated 4.9 million individuals. Heart failure is associated with enormous health care expenditures. This is because it is a progressive chronic condition that is characterized by disabling symptoms that limit independence and result in multiple hospitalizations and referrals to long-term care. The emergence of heart failure as a major public health problem is related to the unintended result of both an aging population and the success in reducing mortality from cardiovascular disease. Non-adherence to medications is a key problem in the treatment of heart failure, with adherence rates ranging from 20% to 90%. There is a clear need, therefore, to develop interventions that improve adherence in patients with heart failure. DESIGN NARRATIVE: This is a single-site, partially blinded, randomized clinical trial of 900 patients with systolic or diastolic dysfunction, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III. Patients will be recruited over a period of 2 years from seven hospitals. Patients will be randomly assigned to either a SM intervention or attention control. The SM group will meet 18 times for 2 hours over 1 year. These group sessions will teach patients how to use five basic self-management skills (self-monitoring, environmental restructuring, social support, cognitive restructuring, and the relaxation response) to help build self-efficacy and maintain it after the treatment has been discontinued. The attention control arm will consist of an educational intervention which includes 18 mailings of the American Heart Association Tip Sheets over the course of the first year, plus a telephone follow-up with the patient after each mailing to check receipt and comprehension of the Tip Sheet, and to address any questions about the Tip Sheet. Treatment effects will be evaluated using the primary outcome of hospitalization for heart failure or death, and the secondary outcomes of progression of heart failure, quality of life, and health care costs. Potential mediators of effectiveness will include improved adherence and improved psychosocial function.</detailed_description>
