	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of PS-341 in treating patients who have metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PS-341 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response rate of patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors treated with bortezomib. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in this patient population. - Determine the pharmacodynamics to correlate proteasome inhibition and efficacy of this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.</detailed_description>
