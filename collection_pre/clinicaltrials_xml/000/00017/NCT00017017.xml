	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of CT-2103 in treating patients who have recurrent ovarian epithelial or fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT-2103 in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial or Fallopian Tube Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate and time to treatment failure in patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma treated with CT-2103. - Determine the tolerability and safety of the previously established dose and schedule of CT-2103 in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive CT-2103 IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If no more than 1 of the first 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity, then the remaining patients receive a higher dose of CT-2103. Patients are followed between 1-3 months and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
