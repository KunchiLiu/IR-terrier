	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory stage II or stage III multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of patients with relapsed or refractory stage II or III multiple myeloma treated with arsenic trioxide. II. Determine the overall and relapse-free survival rates of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses. Patients are followed at 4 weeks after the last treatment dose. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
