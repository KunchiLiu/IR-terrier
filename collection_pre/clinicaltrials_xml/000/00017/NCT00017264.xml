	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of atrasentan in treating patients who have progressive or recurrent malignant glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atrasentan in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of atrasentan in patients with progressive or recurrent malignant glioma. - Describe the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Assess preliminary evidence of therapeutic activity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive oral atrasentan once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 2-10 patients receive escalating doses of atrasentan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 1 patient experiences dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
