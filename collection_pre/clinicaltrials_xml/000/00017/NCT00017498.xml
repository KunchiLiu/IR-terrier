	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine in treating patients who have recurrent or metastatic adenoid cystic cancer of the head and neck.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Cancer of the Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the therapeutic activity of gemcitabine, in terms of objective response and duration of response, in patients with recurrent or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma of the head and neck. - Determine the acute toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 12 weeks until disease progression and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-29 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
