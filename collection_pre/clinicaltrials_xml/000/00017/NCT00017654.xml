	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of supplementation with donor T-cell depleted, CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells on durable engraftment and incidence of graft-versus-host disease in patients with aplastic anemia undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Allogeneic Bone Marrow and T-Cell Depleted, CD34+ Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With Aplastic Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested from a HLA identical or 1 antigen mismatched related donor. PBSC are selected for CD34+ cells and T cells are depleted. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -6 to -3 and anti-thymocyte globulin IV with methylprednisolone IV over 10-12 hours on days -5 to -3. T-cell depleted PBSC and bone marrow are infused on day 0. Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 12-24 hours on days -1 to 120 followed by a taper and methylprednisolone IV on days 7-64 for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. Patients are followed every 30 days for 1 year, every 60 days for 2 years, and then as needed for a minimum of 3 years.</detailed_description>
