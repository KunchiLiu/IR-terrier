	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine and epirubicin in treating patients who have malignant mesothelioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine and Epirubicin in Treating Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of gemcitabine and epirubicin in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. - Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Assess quality of life in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and epirubicin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to course 3, at 3 months, and then at 1 year. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
