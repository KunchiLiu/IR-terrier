	<brief_title>PS-341 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of PS-341 in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive PS-341 IV over 3-5 seconds twice weekly for 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-19 months.</detailed_description>
