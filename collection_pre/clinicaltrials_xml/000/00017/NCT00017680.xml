	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response, disease-free survival, and overall survival of patients with primary light chain amyloidosis treated with high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of High-Dose Melphalan and Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With Primary Light Chain Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients may receive induction chemotherapy before study entry. Patients then receive filgrastim (G-CSF) or another growth factor for 4-6 days as peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization. PBSC (or bone marrow) is harvested over 2-3 days. Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV over 30 minutes twice daily on days -2 and -1. PBSC and/or bone marrow is reinfused on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. This course may be repeated 4-12 weeks later. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then annually for 5 years.</detailed_description>
