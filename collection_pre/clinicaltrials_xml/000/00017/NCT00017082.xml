	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating patients who have recurrent metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the overall response rate, onset and duration of partial and complete responses, and duration of stable disease in patients with recurrent metastatic colorectal cancer treated with oxaliplatin. II. Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the proportion of patients with tumor-related symptomatic improvement and time to tumor-related symptomatic worsening in patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug. V. Determine the proportion of patients achieving stable disease when treated with this drug. VI. Determine the safety of this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression. Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 8 weeks for 10 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
