	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of exatecan mesylate in treating patients who have metastatic stomach cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DX-8951f in Treating Patients With Metastatic Stomach Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response rate of patients with previously untreated metastatic gastric cancer treated with exatecan mesylate (DX-8951f). - Determine the time to tumor progression in this patient population when treated with this drug. - Determine the survival at 6 and 12 months in this patient population when treated with this drug. - Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in this patient population. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in the plasma of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive exatecan mesylate (DX-8951f) IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
