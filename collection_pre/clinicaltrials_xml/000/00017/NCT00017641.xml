	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of immune ablation with high-dose cyclophosphamide and anti-thymocyte globulin followed by peripheral blood stem cell support in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of Immune Ablation and CD34+ Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Support in Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour for 2 doses. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning 24 hours after completion of cyclophosphamide and continuing until leukapheresis is complete. Leukapheresis continues daily until target number of cells is harvested. CD 34+ cells are isolated from peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in vitro. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2, anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 10 hours on days -4 to -2, and G-CSF SC beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients undergo reinfusion of CD34+ PBSC on day 0. Patients are followed weekly for 90 days, monthly for 1 year, and at 2 years.</detailed_description>
