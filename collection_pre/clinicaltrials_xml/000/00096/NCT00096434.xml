	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer. Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth and by stopping blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the tumor response rate in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with an anthracycline- and/or taxane-containing regimen receiving sorafenib. II. Assess the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. III. Determine time to disease progression and survival time of patients treated with this drug. IV. Correlate pre-treatment levels of activated ERK1/2 with tumor response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months until disease progression and then every 3 months for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
