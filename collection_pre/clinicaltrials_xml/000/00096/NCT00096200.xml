	<brief_summary>Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth and by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving sorafenib together with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving sorafenib together with paclitaxel and carboplatin works in treating patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer. (Sorafenib only group closed as of 10/10/2008).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib With or Without Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Cancer, Primary Peritoneal Cancer, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Compare the progression-free and overall survival rate of patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer treated with sorafenib with or without carboplatin and paclitaxel. (Arm I [sorafenib only] closed to accrual 10/01/2008) II. Evaluate the response rate and time to disease progression in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to performance status and participating center. ARM I (closed to accrual 10/01/2008): Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28.Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression crossover to arm II. ARM II: Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 2-19. Patients also receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
