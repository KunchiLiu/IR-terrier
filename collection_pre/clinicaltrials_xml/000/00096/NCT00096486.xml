	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Gefitinib and everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Giving gefitinib together with everolimus may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects, best way to give, and best dose of giving gefitinib with everolimus and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib and Everolimus in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV or Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus when administered with gefitinib in patients with stage IIIB or IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. (Phase I) - Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II) Secondary - Assess the pharmacokinetics of everolimus, alone and in combination with gefitinib, in these patients. (Phase I) OUTLINE: This is an open-label, phase I, dose-escalation study of everolimus followed by a phase II study. - Phase I: Patients receive oral everolimus once on day 1. Beginning on day 8, patients receive oral gefitinib once daily. Beginning on day 22, patients receive oral everolimus once daily. Both drugs are then given concurrently for the rest of the treatment. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of everolimus until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase II: Patients receive oral everolimus at the MTD determined in phase I and oral gefitinib once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
