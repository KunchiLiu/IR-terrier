	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies pentostatin and donor lymphocyte infusion in preventing graft rejection in patients who have undergone donor stem cell transplant. Giving pentostatin and an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte infusion) after a donor stem cell transplant may stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving pentostatin before donor lymphocyte infusion may stop this from happening.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and efficacy of the combined use of pentostatin and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in patients with low or falling donor T-cell chimerism to prevent graft rejection after transplantation both from matched related donors (MRDs) or unrelated donors (URDs). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) infections and disease response, if persistent disease is present. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of donor lymphocyte infusion. GROUP I: Patients receive pentostatin intravenously (IV) over 20-30 minutes on day -2 and DLI over 15-30 minutes on day 0. Treatment may repeat once beginning with an escalated or same cluster of differentiation (CD)3-dose at least 4 weeks if persistent donor T-cells are documented, no GvHD has developed, and the chimerism status worsens or, if chimerism status is unchanged after at least 8 weeks with two subsequent tests of chimerism 4 weeks apart. GROUP II (initiated if patients in group I do not achieve sustained engraftment and improved chimerism): Patients receive treatment as in group I. Patients also receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 56 and mycophenolate mofetil PO once daily (QD) on days 0 to 27. Treatment continues in the absence of GvHD. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
