	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: CP-547,632 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth and by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well CP-547,632 works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CP-547,632 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Ovarian Cancer, Primary Peritoneal Cancer, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of CP-547,632, in terms of clinical response benefit (CA 125 response [complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)] or stable disease ≥ 16 weeks), in patients with recurrent or persistent small-volume ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal serous, or fallopian tube cancer. Secondary - Determine progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine CA 125 response (CR or PR) rate in patients treated with this drug. - Determine duration of CA 125 response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. - Correlate the steady state plasma concentration of this drug with efficacy and toxicity in these patients. - Correlate clinical outcome with an angiogenic profile derived from measurement of serum vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin-8 in patients treated with this drug. - Determine changes in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive oral CP-547,632 once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 3 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-29 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
