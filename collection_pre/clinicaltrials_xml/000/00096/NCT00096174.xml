	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Cetuximab may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Giving monoclonal antibody therapy together with chemoradiotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab and cisplatin together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with locally advanced or regional stage IV head and neck cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Concurrent C225, Cisplatin and Radiation in Stage IV Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine 2-year progression-free survival in patients with unresectable locally advanced or regional stage IV squamous cell or undifferentiated carcinoma of the head and neck treated with cetuximab, cisplatin, and definitive radiotherapy. Secondary - Determine response rate and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Correlate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression by immunohistochemistry, EGFR phosphorylation, map kinase, Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and other tissue and serum tests with toxicity of this regimen and outcomes in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor site (hypopharynx vs. oropharynx vs. oral cavity vs. larynx), primary tumor stage (T1-3 vs. T4), and nodal status (N0 vs. N1 vs. N2-3). - Cetuximab therapy: Patients receive an initial loading dose of cetuximab IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients then receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour on days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, and 57. - Chemoradiotherapy: Beginning on day 15 of cetuximab therapy, patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for at least 7 weeks. Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours on days 15, 36, and 57. - Cetuximab maintenance therapy: After the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients continue to receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour once weekly for 6-12 months. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for 10 years. ACCRUAL: A total of 69 patients were accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
