	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess disease-free survival at 4.5 years postoperatively for women with apparent Stage 1 endometrial cancer, comparing patients who are randomised to receive Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH) and patients who are randomised to receive Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Approach to Cancer of the Endometrium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase III international, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial is an equivalence study with the hypothesis is that Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH) is associated with equivalent disease-free survival when compared to the standard treatment of Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH) for women with apparent Stage I endometrial cancer. The secondary hypotheses are: - TLH is associated with equivalent or improved Quality of Life (QoL) at 6 months; - TLH is associated with reduced treatment-related morbidity; - TLH is associated with shorter hospital stay; - TLH is associated with less analgesic consumption; - TLH is cost effective; - TLH is associated with improved pelvic floor function.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who may be included for this study must have the following: Histologically confirmed primary endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium; Clinical stage I disease; ECOG Performance status of 01; Signed written informed consent; Females, aged 18 years or older. Patients will be excluded from participating from the study if they have any of the following: Other histologic type than endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium; Clinically advanced disease (stages IIIV); Uterine size larger than 10 weeks gestation; Estimated life expectancy of less than 6 months; Enlarged aortic lymph nodes; Unfit for Surgery: serious concomitant systemic disorders incompatible with the study (at the discretion of the investigator); Patient compliance and geographic proximity that does not allow adequate followup; Unfit to complete QoL measurements.</criteria>
