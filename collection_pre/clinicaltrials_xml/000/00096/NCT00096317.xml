	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone and ketoconazole, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving ixabepilone with ketoconazole may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving ixabepilone together with ketoconazole and to see how well they work in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixabepilone and Ketoconazole in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of ixabepilone in patients with advanced solid tumors. Secondary - Determine the safety of ixabepilone when administered alone and in combination with ketoconazole in these patients. - Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of ixabepilone. During course 1, patients receive oral ketoconazole on days 0-5 and ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1. During course 2 and subsequent courses, patients receive only ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of at least 3 patients receive escalating doses of ixabepilone during course 1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 12 patients are treated at the MTD. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
