	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open label extension study. Subjects who have completed treatment in the parent study of pertuzumab, either alone or with a combination agent, and who received at least one dose of pertuzumab in the parent study are eligible for inclusion in this trial if they are continuing to receive clinical benefit.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed informed consent ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Completion of treatment in a previous Genentech sponsored, Phase II cancer study with pertuzumab, either alone or with a combination agent, in which at least one dose of pertuzumab was received in the parent study Less than 3 months since last dose of pertuzumab on the parent study Use of an effective means of contraception for men or for women of childbearing potential Granulocyte count &gt;= 1500/uL Platelet count &gt;= 75,000/uL Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL (hemoglobin may be supported by transfusion or erythropoietin or other approved hematopoietic growth factors; darbepoetin [Aranesp(R)] is permitted) Serum bilirubin less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless due to Gilbert's disease) Alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT &lt;= 2.5x ULN (&lt;= 5x ULN for subjects with liver metastases; no alkaline phosphatase upper limit for subjects with bone metastases) Serum creatinine &lt;= 1.5x ULN International normalized ratio (INR) &lt; 1.5 and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) &lt; 1.5x ULN (except for subjects receiving warfarin) Recent (within the last 3 months), current, or planned participation in a experimental drug study other than a Genentechsponsored pertuzumab cancer study Any unresolved or irreversible NCICTC Grade 3 or 4 adverse event or clinically meaningful cardiac adverse event (any grade) that is pertuzumabrelated and ongoing from the parent study Recent (within the last 3 months) or current treatment with HER pathway inhibitors other than pertuzumab (e.g., Herceptin(R) [Trastuzumab], Iressa&lt;TM&gt; [gefitinib], Tarceva&lt;TM&gt; [erlotinib hydrochloride], C225, CI1033, or TAK165) or other monoclonal antibodies Clinical evidence of central nervous system or brain metastases Ejection fraction â‰¤50%, as determined by ECHO (or MUGA) Uncontrolled hypercalcemia (&gt; 11.5 mg/dL) Recent anthracycline exposure (within the last 3 months) or cumulative exposure of &gt; 360 mg/m^2 doxorubicin or equivalent (i.e., liposomal doxorubicin, &gt; 120 mg/m^2 mitoxantrone, or &gt; 90 mg/m^2 idarubicin) Ongoing corticosteroid use (except for subjects who are on stable doses of &lt; 20 mg of prednisone daily [or equivalent] or who are taking corticosteroids for reasons other than cancer) Other malignancies (except for adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, or basal or squamous cell skin cancer) Serious systemic disease, including active infection, uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg on two consecutive occasions), unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction or unstable symptomatic arrhythmia requiring medication (subjects with chronic atrial arrhythmia [i.e., atrial fibrillation], paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, or controlled hypertension are eligible) Liver disease (including viral or other hepatitis), current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis Known human immunodeficiency virus infection Pregnancy or lactation Major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 3 weeks prior to Day 1 Inability to comply with study and followup procedures Any diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the continued use of an investigational drug or that may render the subject at high risk from treatment complications</criteria>
