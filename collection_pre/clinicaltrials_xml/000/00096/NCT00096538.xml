	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Herpesvirus is found in the lesions of most patients with Kaposi's sarcoma, and may have a role in causing Kaposi's sarcoma. Valganciclovir is an antiviral drug that acts against many types of herpesviruses and may be an effective treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well valganciclovir works in treating patients with classic non-HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Valganciclovir in Treating Patients With Classic Non-HIV-Associated Kaposi's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the antitumor activity of valganciclovir in patients with classic non-HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Secondary - Determine the effect of this drug on lytic and latent human herpesvirus-8 gene expression in KS lesions of these patients. - Determine the effect of this drug on the markers of angiogenesis in KS lesions of these patients. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients receive oral valganciclovir twice daily for 3 weeks and then once daily for 21 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients are followed for 1 month after completion of therapy. Patients with responding disease are followed monthly for up to 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
