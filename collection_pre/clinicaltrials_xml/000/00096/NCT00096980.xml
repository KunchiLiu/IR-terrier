	<brief_summary>This study is an open label, randomized, multicenter study designed to compare the efficacy of 12 weeks of subcutaneously administered efalizumab (monotherapy) with that of combination therapy (Efalizumab and a topical corticosteroid ointment) in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy. The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of 30 months of continuous efalizumab treatment in those subjects who derive benefit from the initial 12 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
