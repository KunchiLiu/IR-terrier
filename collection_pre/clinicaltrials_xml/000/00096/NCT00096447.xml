	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well lapatinib works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer. Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the 6-month progression-free survival of patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma treated with lapatinib. II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this drug. II. Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the effects of prognostic factors, such as initial performance status and tumor grade, in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral lapatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-82 patients will be accrued for this study within 30-67 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed endometrial carcinoma Recurrent or persistent disease Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required Refractory to curative therapy or standard treatments Measurable disease At least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion ≥ 20 mm by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain xray, CT scan, or MRI OR ≥ 10 mm by spiral CT scan Must have at least 1 target lesion Tumors within a previously irradiated field are considered nontarget lesions Disease in an irradiated field as the only site of measurable disease is considered a target lesion provided there has been clear progression of the lesion since the completion of prior radiotherapy Must have received 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for endometrial carcinoma Initial therapy may have included highdose therapy, consolidation, or extended therapy administered after surgical or nonsurgical assessment No more than 1 additional prior cytotoxic regimen for recurrent or persistent disease Tumor accessible to guided core needle or fine needle biopsy Ineligible for a higher priority GOG protocol (e.g., any active GOG phase III protocol for the same patient population) Performance status GOG 02 (for patients who have received 1 prior treatment regimen) Performance status GOG 01 (for patients who have received 2 prior treatment regimens) Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm^3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm^3 Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) SGOT ≤ 2.5 times ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN Cardiac ejection fraction normal by echocardiogram or MUGA No gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication No malabsorption syndrome No requirement for IV alimentation No uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's or ulcerative colitis) Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception No active infection requiring antibiotics No sensory or motor neuropathy &gt; grade 1 No history of allergic reaction attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition to lapatinib No other invasive malignancy within the past 5 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer At least 4 weeks since prior immunologic agents for the malignant tumor No prior trastuzumab (Herceptin^®) or any targetspecific therapy directed to the HER family (e.g., gefitinib, erlotinib, or cetuximab) At least 6 weeks since prior nitrosoureas or mitomycin for the malignant tumor and recovered No prior noncytotoxic chemotherapy for recurrent or persistent disease At least 1 week since prior hormonal therapy for the malignant tumor Concurrent hormone replacement therapy allowed Recovered from prior radiotherapy Recovered from prior surgery No prior surgery affecting absorption At least 4 weeks since other prior therapy for the malignant tumor No prior lapatinib No prior anticancer treatment that would preclude study treatment Concurrent oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) allowed provided there is increased monitoring of INR No concurrent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors No concurrent combination antiretroviral therapy for HIVpositive patients</criteria>
