	<brief_summary>This is an open label study where each patient will receive TOCOSOL(R) Paclitaxel 120mg/m2 every week for first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Patients will be followed to determine the efficacy of treatment (as measured by objective response rate), and the safety associated with weekly administration of TOCOSOL Paclitaxel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of TOCOSOL(R) Paclitaxel as Initial Treatment for Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, non-randomized Phase 2 study of weekly administration of TOCOSOL Paclitaxel at a dose level, 120mg/m2, known to be tolerated based on Phase 2a studies of this investigational agent in patients with other histological diagnoses. This study is a fixed sample size design with no planned early stopping decision. The goals of the study include the determination of the safety of TOCOSOL Paclitaxel, and the objective response rate, defined by RECIST criteria as complete responses plus partial responses.</detailed_description>
