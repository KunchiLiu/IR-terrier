	<brief_summary>This was a multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 333 subjects. These subjects were 12-75 years old with atopic asthma, had elevated serum total Immunoglobulin E (IgE), had a baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥ 80% predicted, and were on inhaled corticosteroids with or without other controller asthma medications (e.g., long-acting β2-agonists [LABAs], leukotriene receptor antagonist [LTRA], or immunotherapy).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Have a documented history of asthma as well as evidence of ≥ 12% reversibility of FEV1. Evidence of ≥ 12% reversibility of FEV1 may be obtained by any one of the following measures: 1) Documentation of ≥ 12% reversibility of FEV1 after albuterol administration at any time during the preceding 24 months; 2) Documentation of ≥ 12% improvement in FEV1 with two separate measurements obtained within a 4week period surrounding an asthma exacerbation during the preceding 24 months; 3) Demonstration of ≥ 12%reversibility of FEV1 after albuterol administration at the time of screening Have baseline FEV1 ≥ 80% predicted normal value prior to randomization Have a positive skin test (diameter of wheal ≥ 3 mm vs. control) or in vitro radioallergosorbent test (RAST(R)) or ImmunoCap(R) to one relevant perennial aeroallergen such as cat or house dust mites documented within the previous year Be receiving at least an inhaled corticosteroid dosage of fluticasone dry powder inhaler (DPI) ≥ 200 ug/day or equivalent exvalve dose during the 12 weeks prior to the screening visit During the 4week runin period prior to randomization, demonstrate evidence of inadequate asthma symptom control despite inhaled corticosteroids with or without other controller asthma medications (e.g., LABA, LTRA, immunotherapy). Inadequate asthma symptom control is defined as at least one of the following reported on the subject diary card during the 4week runin period: Daytime asthma symptoms as a score of ≥ 1 (scale of 04) on at least 20 of 28 days (missing data to be treated as a day with no symptoms) and a mean symptom score of ≥ 1.5 (mean will be calculated based on only data supplied; missing values will not be considered) or Nighttime awakening because of asthma symptoms (more than 4 times during the 4week runin period) Meet the study drugdosing table eligibility criteria (serum baseline IgE level ≥ 30 to ≤ 1300 IU/mL and body weight ≥ 20 to ≤ 150 kg) If a female of childbearing potential, use an effective method of contraception (in the opinion of the investigator) to prevent pregnancy and agree to continue to practice an acceptable method of contraception for the duration of their participation in the study Have received chronic systemic corticosteroids (oral or intravenous) within 3 months or have received a burst of oral corticosteroids within the last 2 weeks prior to screening Have received Xolair therapy at any time within 12 months prior to screening Are pregnant or lactating Have a known hypersensitivity to any ingredients of Xolair, including excipients (sucrose, histidine, polysorbate 20) Have a lifetime history of smoking &gt; 10pack years Have active lung disease other than asthma (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Have a history of upper respiratory infection or lower respiratory infection within the 30 days prior to randomization Have a diagnosis of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory druginduced asthma Have taken immunosuppressants or other investigational drugs within the 30 days prior to screening Have a significant medical illness other than asthma</criteria>
