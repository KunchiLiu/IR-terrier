	<brief_title>Long Term Safety Study of Levalbuterol and Racemic Albuterol in Subjects Twelve Years of Age and Older With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a randomized, open-label, active controlled, multicenter, parallel-group safety study in subjects 12 years of age and older with asthma. Subjects of appropriate age who completed the Phase III levalbuterol HFA MDI trials (Studies 051-353 or 051-355) were eligible to participate. Studies 051-353 and 051-355, both entitled "An Efficacy and Safety Study of Levalbuterol, Racemic Albuterol and Placebo in Subjects Twelve Years of Age and Older with Asthma" were multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group studies of up to nine weeks in duration (a one-week single-blind placebo run in period followed by an eight-week double-blind treatment period). Subjects who completed Studies 051 353 and 051 355 but who were not immediately eligible to rollover into the current study could also participate but only after a 30-day washout. New subjects and subjects who participated in the Phase III trials who were not immediately eligible (ie, had a &gt;30-day washout) were considered to be de novo subjects.Study participation included 10 study visits over a 12 month period. This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.</detailed_description>
