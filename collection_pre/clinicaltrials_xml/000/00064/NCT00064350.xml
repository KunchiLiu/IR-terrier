	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Preclinical studies indicate that sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of Raf kinase in vitro and in vivo, with significant dose-dependent, anti-tumor activity in four different human tumor types including colon, pancreatic, lung, and ovarian. This activity was cytostatic in nature and was maintained if dosing was continued. That is, tumor growth is suspended while the drug is administered but returns to baseline rates when the agent is withdrawn. Therefore, the optimal schedule will be an uninterrupted one. To assess the activity of sorafenib in a timely manner and with a meaningful interpretation, a randomized discontinuation design was adopted in the present trial, conducted in a population who were potentially sensitive to sorafenib. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying sorafenib to see how well it works compared to placebo in treating patients with refractory non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the percent of patients maintaining stable disease or objective response two months after randomization with continued sorafenib treatment, compared to patients switched to placebo. - To determine progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to number of prior chemotherapy regimens (2 vs more than 2) and prior epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor treatment (yes vs no). - Induction: All patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment continues for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease proceed to randomization. Patients with responding disease continue to receive sorafenib for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression. - Randomization: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop disease progression within 1 year after randomization cross over to arm I. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 311 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 3 years.</detailed_description>
