	<brief_title>UMCCOP 02-01 Ginger in Treating Nausea and Vomiting in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the prevalence and severity of delayed nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy treated with lower-dose ginger vs higher-dose ginger vs placebo. Secondary - Compare the prevalence and severity of acute nausea and vomiting in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients. - Determine whether patients can determine if they are receiving placebo or study drug, and by which variable (e.g., taste, smell, or decrease in nausea and vomiting). OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Patients are stratified according to concurrent antiemetic type (5-HT_3 antagonist vs NK1 antagonist). - Arm I: Patients receive lower-dose oral ginger twice daily. - Arm II: Patients receive higher-dose oral ginger twice daily. - Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In all arms, treatment begins immediately after the chemotherapy treatment and continues for 3 days. Patients are followed at 1 week. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
