	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Paricalcitol is a form of vitamin D that may help myelodysplastic cells develop into normal bone marrow cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paricalcitol in treating patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paricalcitol in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the clinical effects of paricalcitol in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. - Determine whether this drug can improve RBC, WBC, or platelet counts in these patients. - Determine whether this drug can decrease the risk of development of leukemia without causing undue toxicity in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral paricalcitol daily for 4 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months.</detailed_description>
