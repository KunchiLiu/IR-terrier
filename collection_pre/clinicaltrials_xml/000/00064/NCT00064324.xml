	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perifosine in treating patients who have advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as perifosine use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perifosine in Treating Patients With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the 6-month progression-free rate in patients treated with perifosine and having advanced soft tissue sarcoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate survival and time to progression. II. To evaluate objective tumor response status and duration. III. To evaluate adverse event rates. IV. To evaluate patterns of treatment failure. V. To evaluate pharmacokinetics. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive a loading dose of oral perifosine every 6 hours for a total of 4 doses on day 1 and once daily on days 2-28 of course 1 only. For all subsequent courses, patients receive oral perifosine once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-12 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed advanced soft tissue sarcoma Measurable disease; measurable disease lesions that are being monitored for response and have been previously irradiated must have progressed &gt; 25% since completion of radiation therapy Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/uL PLT &gt;= 100,000/uL Total bilirubin =&lt; upper normal limit (UNL) AST =&lt; 2.5 x UNL Creatinine =&lt; UNL or calculated creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min (i.e. using the CockcroftGault or Jeliffe methods) Life expectancy &gt;= 12 weeks ECOG performance status (PS) 0 or 1 Capable of understanding the investigational nature, potential risks and benefits of the study and able to provide valid informed consent Any of the following as this regimen may be harmful to a developing fetus or nursing child: Pregnant women Breastfeeding women Men or women of childbearing potential or their sexual partners who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception (condoms, diaphragm, birth control pills, injections, intrauterine device [IUD], surgical sterilization, subcutaneous implants, or abstinence, etc.) NOTE: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because perifosine is an alkylphospholipid with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with perifosine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with perifosine Any of the following: &gt;= 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for metastatic sarcoma Chemotherapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry Nitrosoureas or mitomycin C =&lt; 6 weeks prior to study entry Radiotherapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry Immunotherapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry Biologic therapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry Failure to recover from acute, reversible effects of prior therapy regardless of interval since last treatment Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy considered investigational (utilized for a nonFDAapproved indication and in the context of a research investigation) Uncontrolled brain metastases; NOTE: these patients are excluded because of the poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events; however, if brain metastasis are treated and controlled for &gt; 8 weeks, the patient would be eligible for this study History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to perifosine Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia despite appropriate therapy, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements HIVpositive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy; NOTE: these patients are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with perifosine; appropriate studies may be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated Prior malignancy, except for the following: Adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer Adequately treated noninvasive carcinoma Other invasive cancer from which the patient has been diseasefree for 5 years</criteria>
