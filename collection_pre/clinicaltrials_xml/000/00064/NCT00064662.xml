	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this clinical trial is to compare the treatment success for two surgical procedures that are frequently used and have similar cure rates, yet have not been compared directly to each other in a large, rigorously conducted randomized trial. The secondary aims of the trial are to compare other outcomes for the two surgical procedures, including quality of life, sexual function, satisfaction with treatment outcomes, complications, and need for other treatment(s)after surgery. Follow-up will be a minimum of two years and up to four years.</brief_summary>
