	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as soblidotin use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of soblidotin in treating patients who have advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Soblidotin in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma with prior exposure to anthracycline-based chemotherapy when treated with soblidotin. - Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the median survival time and 12-month survival rate of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive soblidotin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
