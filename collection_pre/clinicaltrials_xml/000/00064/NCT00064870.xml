	<brief_summary>The purpose of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Study is to identify the genes that are responsible for causing Alzheimer's Disease (AD). One of the ways in which the risk factor genes for late onset AD can be investigated is by identifying and collecting genetic material from families with multiple members diagnosed with AD or dementia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Study is to help identify the genes that may be responsible for causing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by collecting genetic material from families with multiple members diagnosed with AD. Qualifying families will have two living blood-related individuals who have been diagnosed with or are showing symptoms of AD or dementia. Local study sites are located all over the United States, and arrangements may be made for eligible families who do not live near a participating site. The biological samples and data from these families will be made available to qualified researchers, who must sign a Materials Transfer Agreement (MTA) in order to protect the privacy rights of study participants before receiving DNA and data.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Two living family members diagnosed with AD or other dementia with any age of onset Biological samples available Fresh blood, or Immortalized lymphoblastic cell lines, or 35 grams of frozen cerebral cortex; fixed samples are not accepted Please note: this study does not include genetic counseling; because no personal identifying information such as name or date of birth is attached to samples, results of individual tests are not available to participants or family members.
