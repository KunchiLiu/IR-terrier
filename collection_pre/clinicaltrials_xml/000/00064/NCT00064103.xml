	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gene therapy and to see how well it works in preventing cancer in patients with premalignant carcinoma of the oral cavity or pharynx. Inserting the p53 gene into a person's tumor cells may improve the body's ability to kill the tumor cells</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Therapy in Preventing Cancer in Patients With Premalignant Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity or Pharynx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the acute toxic effects of Ad5CMV-p53 gene administered as an oral rinse and as an intramucosal injection in patients with diffuse premalignant carcinoma of the oral cavity or oral pharynx. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the topical transduction efficiency of adenoviral-mediated wild type p53 gene transfer in patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the efficacy of this drug in reversing the histology of oral premalignancies in these patients. V. Determine the distribution of transgenic protein within the area of the premalignant lesion in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of Ad5CMV-p53 gene administered as an oral rinse. Phase I: Patients receive Ad5CMV-p53 gene by intramucosal injection into the area of the lesion followed at least 2 hours later by Ad5CMV-p53 gene as an oral rinse on day 1. Patients then receive Ad5CMV-p53 gene as an oral rinse twice daily on days 2-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Ad5CMV-p53 gene as an oral rinse until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Phase II: Patients receive treatment with intramucosal Ad5CMV-p53 gene as in phase I and Ad5CMV-p53 gene as an oral rinse at the MTD. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3 years. Patients then receive long-term follow-up annually for an additional 10 years.</detailed_description>
