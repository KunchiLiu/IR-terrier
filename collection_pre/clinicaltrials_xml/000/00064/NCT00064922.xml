	<brief_title>Incentive Programs for Female Substance Abusers Who Smoke - 3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will determine the influence of voucher-based CM on reducing smoking (and other drug) use during pregnancy or in post-partum women with children under 1 year of age living with them, or in non-pregnant females who smoke. We are targeting smoking cessation since cigarette use is so prevalent in our service. We will compare a control group to two different voucher-based contingent-reinforcement procedures: one that targets smoking abstinence alone vs. one that offers additional incentives for negative BAL and urinalysis results.</detailed_description>
