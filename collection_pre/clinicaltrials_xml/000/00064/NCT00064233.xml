	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: BMS-354825 may stop the growth of cancer cells by stopping the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of BMS-354825 in treating patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia that is resistant to imatinib mesylate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-354825 in Treating Patients With Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia That Is Resistant to Imatinib Mesylate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose, maximum administered dose, dose-limiting toxicity, and a recommended phase II dose of BMS-354825 in patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia who have hematologic resistance to imatinib mesylate. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. - Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this drug, in terms of hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive oral BMS-354825 once daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 7 days for at least 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive further treatment in the absence of disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-354825 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 20 additional patients receive treatment as in phase I at the MTD of BMS-354825. Patients are followed for at least 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients (30 for phase I and 20 for phase II) will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
