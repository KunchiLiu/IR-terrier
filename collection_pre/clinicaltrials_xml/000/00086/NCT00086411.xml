	<brief_title>Comparing Smoking Treatment Programs for Lighter Smokers - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study compared a minimal level counseling model to a higher level counseling model plus one of two types of FDA approved smoking cessation products (bupropion or the nicotine patch)used to achieve long term abstinence among lighter smokers. Each participant received both products under blinded conditions meaning that neither the participant nor the counselor knew which product was real or a placebo. The primary goal was to determine the combination or combinations of high or low intensity counseling and pharmacotherapy (either bupropion or the nicotine patch) that were most effective for lighter smokers. The main hypothesis was that higher level counseling would contribute to improved outcomes meaning that more counseling would be associated higher abstinence rates following the completion of treatment and at longer term follow-up.</detailed_description>
