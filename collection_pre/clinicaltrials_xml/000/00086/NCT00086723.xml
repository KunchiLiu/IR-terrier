	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Tissue plasminogen activator and captopril may help the body generate angiostatin. Angiostatin may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tissue plasminogen activator and captopril and to see how well they work in treating patients with progressive metastatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In Vivo Angiostatin Generation Using Tissue Plasminogen Activator and Captopril in Treating Patients With Progressive Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of captopril and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in patients with progressive metastatic cancer. - Determine the in vivo generation of angiostatin by western analysis in patients treated with this regimen. Secondary - Determine the antitumor effect of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) IV over 6 hours and oral captopril twice daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 14 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tPA and captopril until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified.</detailed_description>
