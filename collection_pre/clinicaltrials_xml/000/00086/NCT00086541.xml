	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of two dose levels of Infergen (interferon alfacon-1, CIFN) plus Ribavirin administered daily for 48 weeks and no treatment in patients chronically infected with hepatitis C who are nonresponders to previous pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin therapy. Patients are randomized 1:1:1 to receive Interferon Alfacon-1 (9 or 15 µg) + Ribavirin (both administered daily) or no treatment for up to 48 weeks. The protocol and informed consent form that will be used must be approved by the Investigator’s Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) before the study is initiated.</brief_summary>

Any history of decompensated liver disease 2. Any of a variety of laboratory abnormalities assessed through blood sample at screening 3. Patients who prematurely discontinued, interrupted, or reduced the dose of their previous pegylated interferon alphabased combination therapy due to noncompliance or safety and/or tolerability issues 4. Patients who had undetectable HCV RNA levels during prior pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin treatment but who relapsed during followup 5. Significant depression in the last 2 years 6. Patients treated for HCV infection within 3 months before screening (w/the exclusion of overthecounter therapies) 7. Patients who have been on any experimental protocol or therapy within 28 days before screening 8. Use of colonystimulating factor agents or other therapeutic agents that might artificially elevate laboratory parameters within 3 months before screening 9. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or positive HIV antibody test at screening 10. Chronic hepatitis B infection or positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at screening 11.
