	<brief_title>Acupuncture for the Treatment of Chronic Daily Headaches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acupuncture has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of some types of headaches, but the efficacy of acupuncture for chronic daily headaches has not been studied. The long-term goals of this study are to reduce the symptoms that are associated with recurrent headaches and to collect data that can be used for future acupuncture studies. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive 8 weeks of either standard care or ten acupuncture treatments in addition to medical care. Self-report questionnaires will be used to assess headaches and daily pain severity.</detailed_description>
