	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is as follows: - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of XL647 administered orally as a single dose and as repeat doses in subjects with solid tumors. The secondary objectives of this study are as follows: - To evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of XL647 administered orally as a single dose and as repeat doses in subjects with solid tumors, - To estimate renal elimination of XL647 administered orally as a single dose in subjects with solid tumors. The exploratory objective of this study is as follows: - To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of XL647 administration in plasma and peripheral blood cells. In addition, subjects may be eligible to enter a Treatment Extension Period. The following information will be obtained from this part of the study: - Long-term safety and tolerability of XL647 after repeat administration, - Tumor response after repeat administration of XL647.</brief_summary>
