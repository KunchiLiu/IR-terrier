	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Atiprimod for Patients With Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation study intended to identify the MTD of atiprimod alone and the MTD of atiprimod when given in combination with ursodiol. The atiprimod dose will be escalated in sequential cohorts. Ten dose levels of atiprimod are planned for the atiprimod alone dose escalation: 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420, and 480 mg/day to be given orally. Six dose levels of atiprimod are planned for the atiprimod in combination with ursodiol dose escalation: 180, 240, 300, 360, 420, and 480 mg/day to be given orally. The dose of ursodiol will remain constant for all cohorts (300 mg ursodiol orally three times a day everyday). Up to 105 patients will participate depending on the level at which toxicity is observed. Patients will be assigned to dose level in the order of study entry.</detailed_description>
