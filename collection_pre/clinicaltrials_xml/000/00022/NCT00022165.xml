	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether daily supplementation with selenium significantly reduces total cancer incidence and site-specific cancer incidence in the general population. II. Determine whether this regimen has a beneficial effect on mood. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Participants are stratified according to age (60-64 vs 65-69 vs 70-74). Participants are randomized to one of four arms. Arm I: Participants receive oral placebo once daily. Arm II: Participants receive low-dose oral selenium once daily. Arm III: Participants receive moderate-dose oral selenium once daily. Arm IV: Participants receive high-dose oral selenium once daily. Treatment in all arms continues for up to 2 years in the absence of unacceptable side effects or diagnosis of cancer. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 510 patients (170 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 9-12 months.</detailed_description>
