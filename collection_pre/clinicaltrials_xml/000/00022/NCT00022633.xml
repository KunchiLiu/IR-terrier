	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine and paclitaxel in treating patients who have advanced or recurrent cancer of the urinary tract.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0028, Gemcitabine and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Cancer of the Urinary Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of enrolling patients aged 70 years and older with advanced or recurrent urothelial cancer to a structured phase II study. - Determine the anticancer efficacy of gemcitabine and paclitaxel, in terms of objective response rate and 2-year survival, in these elderly patients. - Assess the toxicity and tolerability of this regimen in these elderly patients. - Determine the feasibility of using standardized self-report measures of comorbidity, depression, and functional status in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these elderly patients and validate this data against similar parameters in patients aged under 60 years. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (70 and over vs under 60). Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (60 age 70 and over and 20 under age 60) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
