	<brief_title>Gabapentin For the Control of Hot Flashes in Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the effectiveness and side effects of 2 different doses of gabapentin vs placebo for the control of hot flashes and other vasomotor symptoms in women with breast cancer. - Compare quality of life, anxiety, and depression in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center and duration of hot flash symptoms (less than 9 months vs 9 or more months). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo 3 times a day. - Arm II: Patients receive oral gabapentin at a low dose 3 times a day. - Arm III: Patients receive oral gabapentin as in arm II for 3 days and then at a high dose 3 times a day. Treatment on all arms continues for 8 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. After week 8, patients may receive open-label gabapentin at the discretion of their physicians. Hot flashes are assessed at baseline and then during weeks 3 and 7 of the study. Quality of life, anxiety, and depression are assessed at baseline and then at weeks 4 and 8. Patients are followed at week 12. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 408 patients (136 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
