	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of recombinant vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine in patients with metastatic melanoma. - Determine the clinical toxic effects of this vaccine in these patients. - Determine the safety of this vaccine in these patients. - Determine the clinical response of these patients to this vaccine. - Determine evidence of host anti-melanoma immune reactivity in these patients after treatment with this vaccine. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive recombinant vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine once every 4 weeks for a total of 3 vaccinations. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive an additional course of vaccinations. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of recombinant vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at each vaccine administration, and at study completion. Patients are followed at 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12 months.</detailed_description>
