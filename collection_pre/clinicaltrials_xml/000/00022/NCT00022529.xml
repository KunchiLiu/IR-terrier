	<brief_summary>Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-214662 plus trastuzumab in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-214662 Plus Trastuzumab in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of BMS-214662 when combined with trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. Ii. Determine, in a preliminary manner, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BMS-214662. Patients receive BMS-214662 IV over 1 hour on days 2, 8, 15, and 22 and trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-214662 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are accrued to receive treatment with BMS-214662 and trastuzumab at the recommended phase II dose. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-28 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
