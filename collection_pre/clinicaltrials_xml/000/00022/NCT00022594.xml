	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal lurtotecan in treating patients who have metastatic or locally recurrent head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liposomal Lurtotecan in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Locally Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the therapeutic activity of lurtotecan liposome in patients with metastatic or loco-regionally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. - Determine the objective response, duration of response, and time to progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the possible pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to presence of a target lesion in a previously irradiated field (within vs outside). Patients receive lurtotecan liposome IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 38-72 patients (19-36 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
