	<brief_title>AE-941 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the confirmed tumor response rate in patients with early relapse or refractory multiple myeloma treated with AE-941 (Neovastat). - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. - Evaluate the time to progression in patients treated with this drug. - Evaluate the duration of tumor response (partial response, response, and complete response) in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study. Patients receive oral AE-941 (Neovastat) twice daily. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 125 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
