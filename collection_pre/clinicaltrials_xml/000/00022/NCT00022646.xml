	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving more than one drug and giving the drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of three different regimens of pemetrexed disodium plus gemcitabine in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Disodium Plus Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the tumor response rates in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated with 3 different schedules of pemetrexed disodium and gemcitabine. - Compare the duration of response, time to progressive disease, time to treatment failure, and survival time in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are stratified according to stage of disease (IIIB vs IV) and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1). Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1 followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. - Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. - Arm III: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive up to 6 additional courses of therapy. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 20 months.</detailed_description>
