	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who have liver cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of alpha-fetoprotein peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells in HLA-A*0201-positive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. - Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the immunological effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the progression-free survival and clinical responses in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive alpha-fetoprotein peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells intradermally on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for a total of 3 doses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-12 patients receive escalating doses of vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 or 2 of 12 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at weeks 1, 4, and 12 and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-18 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
