	<brief_title>Vitamin E and Pentoxifylline in Treating Women With Lymphedema After Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effects of vitamin E and pentoxifylline on lymphedema in patients previously treated with radiotherapy for breast cancer. II. Compare the normal tissue injury and quality of life in patients treated with this regimen vs placebo. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral vitamin E and oral pentoxifylline twice daily for 6 months. Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 6 months. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
