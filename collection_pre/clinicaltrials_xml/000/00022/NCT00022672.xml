	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study assessed the safety and efficacy of adding intravenous trastuzumab (Herceptin®) to daily oral anastrozole (Arimidex®) tablets as first- and second-line treatment in postmenopausal patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (ER+ve and/or PR+ve). Patients were randomized to receive either anastrazole 1 mg per os (po) daily, or anastrazole 1 mg po daily + a loading dose of Herceptin® 4 mg/kg intravenous (iv) followed by weekly doses of Herceptin® 2 mg/kg iv. The anticipated time on study treatment was until disease progression, and the target sample size was 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
