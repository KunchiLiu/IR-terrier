	<brief_title>Phenoxodiol in Treating Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of phenoxodiol in patients with refractory solid tumors. - Determine the steady-state pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the tumor response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients receive phenoxodiol IV continuously over days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of phenoxodiol until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-36 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
