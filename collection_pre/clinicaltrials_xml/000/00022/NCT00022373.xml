	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Iseganan hydrochloride may be effective in preventing or lessening oral mucositis in patients who are receiving radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. It is not yet known if iseganan hydrochloride is effective in preventing oral mucositis. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of iseganan hydrochloride in preventing oral mucositis in patients who are receiving radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iseganan Hydrochloride in Preventing Oral Mucositis in Patients Who Are Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy and safety of iseganan HCl oral solution vs placebo in patients undergoing radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy for head and neck cancer. II. Compare the effects of these treatments on mouth pain, ability to swallow, weight loss, and the distribution of oral mucositis in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to radiotherapy (conventional fractionating radiotherapy vs hyperfractionating or concurrent boost radiotherapy) and concurrent chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms. Arm I: Patients rinse with iseganan HCl oral solution 6 times daily. Treatment continues for the duration of the scheduled radiotherapy. Arm II: Patients rinse with oral placebo 6 times daily. Treatment continues for the duration of the scheduled radiotherapy. Arm III: Patients receive standard-of-care supportive treatment. Oral cavity pain, ability to swallow, and weight loss are assessed twice weekly and on follow-up days 28 and 56. Patients are followed on days 28 and 56. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 504 patients (252 for arm I, 168 for arm II, and 84 for arm III) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
