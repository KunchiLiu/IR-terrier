	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients who have refractory or recurrent endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Refractory or Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the therapeutic activity of paclitaxel in patients with refractory or recurrent endometrial papillary carcinoma. - Determine the objective response and duration of response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the acute side effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 12 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 16-29 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
