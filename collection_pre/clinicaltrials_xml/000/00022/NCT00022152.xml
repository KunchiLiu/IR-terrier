	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vinorelbine in treating older women who have stage IV breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vinorelbine in Treating Older Women With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response rate in elderly women with stage IV breast cancer treated with oral vinorelbine. - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug. - Assess individual variation in responses (toxicity and/or activity), pharmacokinetic parameters, and/or biologic correlates due to genetic differences in enzymes involved in the transport, metabolism, and/or mechanism of action of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral vinorelbine once weekly. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then after completion of the second course. Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.</detailed_description>
