	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as epratuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of epratuzumab in treating patients who have low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has not responded to chemotherapy or rituximab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epratuzumab in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety of epratuzumab in patients with rituximab-refractory low-grade follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Confirm the convenient administration of this drug in this patient population. - Determine the efficacy of this drug in terms of objective response rate in these patients. - Determine the duration of response and time to progression in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive epratuzumab IV over 15-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 10 months and then every 3 months for up to 4 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-100 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed lowgrade follicular Bcell nonHodgkin's lymphoma Small cleaved cell OR Mixed cell The following are ineligible: Primary CNS lymphoma HIV lymphoma Richter's lymphoma Bulky disease (any single mass greater than 10 cm) Pleural effusion with positive cytology for lymphoma Failed prior standard chemotherapy for nonHodgkin's lymphoma Refractory to at least 1 prior treatment with rituximab Disease progression or failure to achieve objective response within 6 months of beginning rituximab therapy At least 1 bidimensionally measurable lesion At least 1.5 cm by CT scan NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
