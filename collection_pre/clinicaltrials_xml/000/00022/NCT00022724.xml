	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of CCI-779 in treating patients who have malignant glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CCI-779 in Treating Patients With Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CCI-779 in patients with malignant glioma. - Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the efficacy of this drug, in terms of survival and objective response, in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients in phase II are stratified according to use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (yes vs no) and disease type (glioblastoma multiforme with stable neuro-imaging after radiotherapy vs recurrent malignant glioma). Patients in phase I must be currently receiving EIAEDs. - Phase I: Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes once weekly. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CCI-779 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase II: Patients receive CCI-779 as in Phase I. Patients who are candidates for surgical resection of recurrent disease receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes 2 hours prior to surgery and then once weekly, as above, once recovered from surgery. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for phase I of this study within 12 months. A total of 87 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
