	<brief_title>Capecitabine and Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced, Recurrent, or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary: - Determine the overall objective response rate in patients with locally advanced, locally recurrent, or metastatic colorectal cancer treated with capecitabine and irinotecan. Secondary: - Determine the time to treatment failure, time to overall response, duration of overall response, duration of overall complete response, and time to progression in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the 1-year survival and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity and safety profile of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the feasibility of predicting responses to this regimen by the molecular profile of tumor tissue in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 2-15 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients maintaining a response or stable disease after 12 courses may continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months.</detailed_description>
