	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CCI-779 in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CCI-779 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the anti-tumor activity of CCI-779, in terms of progression-free survival, in patients with metastatic melanoma. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 7 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
