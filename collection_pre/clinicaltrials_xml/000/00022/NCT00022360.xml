	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of taurolidine in treating patients who have recurrent or progressive glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Taurolidine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of taurolidine in patients with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma. II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive taurolidine IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of taurolidine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4-24 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
