	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-247550 in treating patients who have recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-247550 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response rate in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer treated with BMS-247550. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the duration of response, median and overall survival, and time to progression in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-10 months.</detailed_description>
