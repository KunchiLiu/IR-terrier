	<brief_title>Doxercalciferol Before Surgery in Treating Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether doxercalciferol modulates intermediate endpoint biomarkers in the development of prostate cancer in patients with localized prostate cancer. - Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of 2 arms. - Arm I: Patients receive doxercalciferol once daily for 28 days. Patients then undergo prostatectomy. - Arm II: Patients undergo observation for 28 days. Patients then undergo prostatectomy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
