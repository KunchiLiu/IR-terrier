	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irofulven, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well irofulven works in treating patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irofulven in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer treated with irofulven. - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive irofulven IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or static disease after 4 courses in the absence of clinical benefit. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-9 months.</detailed_description>
