	<brief_summary>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common liver disease that resembles alcoholic hepatitis but occurs in persons who drink little or no alcohol. The etiology of NASH is unclear, but it is commonly associated with diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance. Several pilot studies, including a study of pioglitazone at the NIH Clinical Center (01-DK-0130), have shown that the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones lead to decreases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and improved liver histology. Once therapy is stopped, however, ALT levels rapidly return to pre-treatment values. Inaddition we are currently enrolling patients with NASH in a pilot study of metformin therapy for 48-weeks, however our results in 3 patients thus far have not been very encouraging. In the current study, patients who have completed the pilot study of pioglitazone and have been off therapy for 48 weeks will be offered re-treatment for 3 years. We also propose to treat patients who have not had a satisfactory response to metformin with pioglitazone for the same duration. After a repeat medical and metabolic evaluation and liver biopsy, patients with moderate-to-severe NASH (activity score greater than or equal to 4) will restart pioglitazone at a dose of 15 mg daily. If after 48 weeks, ALT levels are not normal or improved to the degree identified during the pilot study, the dose will be increased to 30 mg daily at the end of 3 years, all patients will undergo repeat medical and metabolic evaluation and liver biopsy. The primary end point will be improvement in liver histology. Secondary end points will be improvements in insulin sensitivity, reduction in visceral fat, liver volume, and liver biochemistry. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether long-term pioglitazone therapy can safely achieve and maintain biochemical and histological improvements in NASH.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Completion of a 48week course of pioglitazone in protocol 01DK0130 or completion of 48weeks of metformin in protocol 03DK0233. At least 48 weeks of follow up on no thiazolidinedione therapy after completion of protocol 01DK0130. At least 24weeks follow up on no metformin theray after completion of protocol 03DK0233. Written informed consent. Patients who participated in protocol 01DK0130 will also have to meet the following inclusion criteria: Demonstrated improvements in liver histology and/or serum ALT levels during the 48week course of pioglitazone therapy in protocol 01DK0130. Elevations in serum ALT levels. Liver biopsy showing NASH with a total NASH activity score of at least 4 (of a total possible score of 16) including a score of at least 1 each for parenchyma inflammation, cellular injury and steatosis on liver biopsy taken 48 weeks after stopping pioglitazone. Willingness to receive pioglitazone for 3 years. Patients who participated in protocol 03DK0233 will also have to me the following inclusion criteria: Demonstrated no significant improvement in liver histology and/or serum ALT levels during the 48week course of metformin treatment in protocol 03DK0233. Elevations in serum ALT levels. Liver biopsy showing NASH with a total activity score of at least 4 (of a total possible score of 16) including a score of at least 1 each for parenchymal inflammation, cellular injury and steatosis on liver biopsy taken at the end of the 48week course of metofrmin. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Evidence of another form of liver disease (these largely will have been excluded based upon enrollment in the previous study, 01DK0130 and 03DK0233). Hepatitis B as defined as presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Hepatitis C as defined by presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in serum. Autoimmune hepatitis as defined by antinuclear antibody (ANA) of 1:160 or greater and liver histology consistent with autoimmune hepatitis or previous response to immunosuppressive therapy. Autoimmune cholestatic liver disorders as defined by elevation of alkaline phosphatase and antimitochondrial antibody of greater than 1:80 or liver histology consistent with primary biliary cirrhosis or elevation of alkaline phosphatase and liver histology consistent with sclerosing cholangitis. e. Wilson disease as defined by ceruloplasmin below the limits of normal and liver histology consistent with Wilson disease. Alpha1antitrypsin deficiency as defined by alpha1antitrypsin level less than normal and liver histology consistent with alpha1antitrypsin deficiency. Hemochromatosis as defined by presence of 3+ or 4 iron on liver biopsy stain and homozygosity for C282Y or compound heterozygosity for C282Y/H63D. Druginduced liver disease as defined on the basis of typical exposure and history. Bile duct obstruction as shown by imaging studies. History of excess alcohol ingestion, averaging more than 30 gm/day (3 drinks per day) in the previous 10 years, or history of alcohol intake averaging greater than 10 gm/day (1 drink per day: 7 drinks per week) in the previous one year. Contraindications to liver biopsy: platelet counts less than 75,000/mm(3) or prothrombin time greater than 16 seconds. Decompensated liver disease, ChildPugh score greater than or equal to 7 points. History of gastrointestinal bypass surgery or ingestion of drugs known to produce hepatic steatosis including corticosteroids, highdose estrogens, methotrexate, tetracycline or amiodarone in the previous 6 months. Preexistent diabetes mellitus or the development of diabetes mellitus during the study requiring the use of another drug in addition to pioglitazone for glycaemic control.
