	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to examine the safety and immunogenicity of a therapeutic vaccine regimen with recombinant DNA and adenovirus expressing L523S protein in patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer. The vaccine regimen will consist of two fixed doses of recombinant DNA (pVAX/L523S) followed by two doses of recombinant adenovirus (Ad/L523S). The trial will evaluate the dose escalation of Ad/L523S through three cohorts of patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of the vaccine regimen administered as two doses of pVAX/L523S and two doses of Ad/L523S. The secondary objectives of the study are: - To provide initial evidence as to whether CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses specific for L523S protein can be elicited by two doses of pVAX/L523S followed by two doses of Ad/L523S - To provide initial evidence as to whether antibody responses specific for L523S protein can be elicited by two doses of pVAX/L523S followed by two doses of Ad/L523S - To investigate the extent to which dose escalation of Ad/L523S affects the elicited immune response</detailed_description>
