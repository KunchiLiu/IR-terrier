	<brief_title>Interleukin-7 in Treating Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and dose-limiting toxicity of biologically active doses of interleukin-7 in patients with refractory solid tumors. - Determine a range of biologically active doses of this drug in these patients. - Determine the biological effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the antitumor effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients receive interleukin-7 (IL-7) subcutaneously on days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 (for a total of 8 doses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IL-7 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and "biologically active dose" (BAD) are determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The BAD is defined as the dose that produces a sustained 50% increase in CD3+ count over the patient's baseline without unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months and at 1 year after study completion. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.75-10 months.</detailed_description>
