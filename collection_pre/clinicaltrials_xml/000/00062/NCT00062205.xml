	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well imatinib mesylate works in treating patients with recurrent Ewing's family of tumors or desmoplastic small round-cell tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ewing's Family of Tumors or Desmoplastic Small Round-Cell Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in patients with recurrent Ewing's family of tumors or desmoplastic small round-cell tumor. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the duration of disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
