	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as alanosine use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well alanosine works in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma, sarcoma of the bone, mesothelioma, non-small cell lung cancer, or pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alanosine in Treating Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rates in patients with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deficient cancer when treated with alanosine. - Determine the time to response and duration of response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the pharmacodynamic activity of this drug in these patients, based on special imaging to measure tumor adenosine triphosphate depletion. - Determine the pharmacokinetic activity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive alanosine IV continuously on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 28 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50-145 patients (10-29 per tumor type) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
