	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Using computer systems that create a 3-dimensional picture of the tumor to plan treatment may enable doctors to provide more effective radiation therapy that will cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of high-dose 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy in treating patients with inoperable stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose 3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Inoperable Stage I, Stage II, or Stage IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the optimal dose of high-dose 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in patients with inoperable stage I, II, or IIIA non-small cell lung cancer who are treated according to the total lung volume irradiated. - Determine the feasibility of this regimen, in terms of local control rates and incidence of distant metastases, in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 strata according to the total lung volume irradiated (less than 25% vs 25-37% vs over 37%). - Stratum I: Patients undergo high-dose 3-dimensional (3-D) conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks. - Stratum II: Patients undergo high-dose 3-D conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.5-7 weeks. - Stratum III: Patients undergo high-dose 3-D conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.5-6.5 weeks. Cohorts of 6-15 patients in each stratum receive escalating dose intensities of high-dose 3-D conformal radiotherapy (either by increasing the total dose or by shortening treatment time) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6, 2 of 15, or 3 of 30 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month, at least every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54-135 patients (18-45 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
