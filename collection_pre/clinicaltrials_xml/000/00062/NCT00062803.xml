	<brief_summary>Patients who have a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung) will be treated in this study. The purpose of the study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of a new injectable anticoagulant (blood-thinning) drug, SR34006, with the standard way of treating a pulmonary embolism. The standard treatment includes injections or infusions of an anticoagulant drug, (LMW)heparin, for about a week followed by anticoagulant tablets (warfarin or acenocoumarol) which are taken by mouth. Assignment to either SR34006 or (LMW)heparin plus warfarin or acenocoumarol will be purely by chance and will be known by both patients and their doctors.</brief_summary>
