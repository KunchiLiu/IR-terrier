	<criteria>1. Adults at least 18 years of age. 2. CD4 cell count of &gt;300 cells. 3. HIV1 plasma RNA &gt;500 and &lt;30,000 copies/ml. A qualifying ("screening") HIV1 RNA level &gt;500 and &lt;30,000 copies/ml must be documented at least once within 40 days prior to starting Baseline while patient is receiving a HAART regimen containing at least two of the following antiretroviral drugs: Abacavir (Ziagen) Zidovudine (Retrovir) AZT Zalcitabine (Hivid) ddC Didanosine (Videx) ddI Stavudine (Zerit) d4T Efavirenz (Sustiva) Indinavir (Crixivan) Ritonavir (Norvir) Nelfinavir (Viracept) Amprenavir (Agenerase) The patient must have been taking this HAART regimen for four months or longer at the time of the qualifying HIV1 RNA determination. 4. History of prior treatment (including the current HAART regimen) with at least one protease inhibitor (PI) and at least two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and/or at least one nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and at least two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). 5. Karnofsky performance status of at least 70. 6. The following laboratory parameters within 14 days prior to treatment: Hemoglobin &gt; 9.2 g/dL for men and &gt; 8.9 g/dL for women Neutrophil count &gt; 1000 Platelet count &gt; 75,000 AST/ALT &lt; 4.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN or a creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min. 7. For females with child bearing potential: A negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to randomization. Males and females of child bearing potential agree to use an effective means of contraception.</criteria>
