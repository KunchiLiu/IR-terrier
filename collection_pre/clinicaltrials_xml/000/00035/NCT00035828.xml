	<brief_title>A Blinded Study Comparing the Safety and Efficacy of a Fully Human Anti-IL8 Monoclonal Antibody (ABX-IL8) to Placebo in Patients With Chronic Bronchitis and COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is defined as a disease state characterized by the presence of airflow obstruction due to chronic bronchitis or emphysema. The airflow obstruction is generally progressive, may be accompanied by airway hyper-reactivity, and may be partially reversible. Inflammation in the lungs is triggered by exposure to inhaled toxic substances that can lead to tissue damage, mucous secretion, airways narrowing and tissue destruction. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) plays a major role in elevating sputum in patients with COPD and may contribute to tissue destruction. Therefore, the highly specific antibody to IL-8 (such as ABX-IL8) may help to reduce mucous production and tissue destruction.</detailed_description>
