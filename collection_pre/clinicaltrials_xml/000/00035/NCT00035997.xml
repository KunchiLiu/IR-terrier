	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial with Zometa is to investigate the effect ZOMETA 4 mg (zoledronic acid for injection in 100mg solution ) has in preventing associated bone loss in prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis when administered in conjunction with hormonal cancer therapy. This trial will seek to determine the effect of ZOMETA in stabilizing and increasing bone mineral density in these patients. This prospective, open-label, single arm, multicenter study will enroll approximately 200 prostate cancer patients with a history of at least one documented bone lesion documented by bone scan or radiograph. Patients must already be receiving hormone therapy and meet the following additional criteria: - 18 years of age or older - Histologically confirmed diagnoses of prostate cancer - Confirmed objective evidence of metastatic bone disease as evidenced by bone scan or radiograph - Received or will receive hormonal treatment also know as androgen deprivation therapy with an LHRH agonist or other hormonal treatments Throughout the course of this 12-month trial, patients will be identified based on the duration of established hormonal treatment at the time of enrollment. Each patients duration of participation will be up to 56 weeks including a 4 week screening, 48 week treatment and a 4 week follow up.</brief_summary>
