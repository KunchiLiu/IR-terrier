	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with Belatacept (BMS-224818) is as efficacious as treatment with cyclosporine at preventing acute rejection and with a superior safety/tolerability profile (better kidney function and blood pressure, fewer lipid problems, less diabetes mellitus).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key inclusion criteria Recipients of first kidney transplant Key exclusion criteria Those at high risk for acute allograft rejection, including those who receive a second or more renal transplant, those with a history of panel reactive antibody levels &gt;20%, and those considered by investigators to be at relatively higher risk for acute rejection Human leukocyte antigenidentical donorrecipient pairs Cold ischemia time &gt;36 hours (donor kidney) Participants who are positive for hepatitis C antibody, on polymerase chain reaction, for hepatitis B surface antigen, and for human immunodeficiency virus A positive purified protein derivative tuberculosis test (test performed within 1 year of enrollment), unless previously vaccinated with BacilleCalmetteGu√©rin or those who had a history of adequate chemoprophylaxis Any active infection that would normally exclude transplantation Recipients of multiple organ transplants Donor age &gt;60 or &lt;6 years or donors whose hearts were not beating Recipients with underlying renal disease of (due to risk of rapid disease recurrence in the allograft): focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, Type I or II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, or hemolytic uremic syndrome/ thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura A positive Tcell lymphocytoxic crossmatch using donor lymphocytes and recipient serum A history of true allergy to intravenous iodinated roentgenographic contrast agents Participants with life expectancy severely limited by disease state or other underlying medical condition A history of cancer (other than nonmelanoma skin cell cancers cured by local resection) within the last 5 years Mammogram film with any clinically significant abnormality requiring further investigation or biopsies History of substance abuse (drug or alcohol) or psychotic disorders that were not compatible with adequate study followup A currently functioning, nonrenal transplant Previous treatment with basiliximab for any reason Active peptic ulcer disease, chronic diarrhea, or gastrointestinal malabsorption Those who had used any investigational drug within 30 days before the Day 1 visit.</criteria>
