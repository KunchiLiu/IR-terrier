	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Chemoprotective drugs such as amifostine may protect normal cells from the side effects of chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with or without amifostine in treating patients with recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease who are undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Amifostine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Hodgkin's Disease Undergoing Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the role of amifostine in reducing hematologic toxicity and improving mobilization of peripheral progenitor stem cells in patients with recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease who are undergoing platinum based salvage chemotherapy. II. Evaluate the role of amifostine in preventing renal toxicity in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an randomized, open label study. Patients are randomized to receive salvage chemotherapy with intravenous dexamethasone/cisplatin/cytarabine (DHAP) with or without amifostine. Patients receive cisplatin IV over 3 hours followed by cytarabine IV for 2 doses. Patients also receive dexamethasone orally or IV. Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks for 2-6 courses. Arm I: Patients receive amifostine IV over 15 minutes prior to all courses of DHAP, as a 15 minute infusion, beginning 30 minutes prior to cisplatin administration. Arm II: Patients do not receive amifostine. On day 3 of the last DHAP course, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) until the last day of progenitor stem cell (PSC) mobilization. PSC transplant continues daily for 4-10 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
