	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of flavopiridol in treating patients with recurrent intermediate-grade or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flavopiridol in Treating Patients With Recurrent Intermediate-Grade or High-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate to flavopiridol by patients with previously treated intermediate and high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. II. Determine the toxicity of flavopiridol administered as a continuous infusion every 2 weeks in these patients. III. Study the pharmacokinetics of flavopiridol in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open label, multi-institutional study. Patients receive treatment on an outpatient basis. Flavopiridol is administered as a continuous infusion over 72 hours every 2 weeks. Patients receive a minimum of 4 cycles of therapy unless unacceptable toxicity or disease progression occurs. Patients are followed until death.</detailed_description>
