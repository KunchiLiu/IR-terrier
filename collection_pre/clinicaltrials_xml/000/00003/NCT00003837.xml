	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of 506U78 in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>506U78 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia or T-cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Provide an investigational agent, 506U78, to physicians for the management of individual patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic (lymphocytic) leukemia or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma who are not candidates for entry onto ongoing research clinical trials of higher priority. - Evaluate the toxic effects of 506U78 when administered as a 2 hour IV infusion 3 days a week every 21 days in these patients. - Evaluate the antitumor efficacy of this regimen in terms of rate of complete responses in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive 506U78 over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for one year and then every 6 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
