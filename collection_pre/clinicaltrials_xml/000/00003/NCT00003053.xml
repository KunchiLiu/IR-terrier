	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare cisplatin and etoposide with no chemotherapy in treating patients who have stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer that has been surgically removed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage I, II, or IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Been Surgically Removed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the efficacy of the combination of cisplatin and etoposide after radical surgery in prolonging the relapse free and overall survival for stages I, II, and IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. OUTLINE: This a randomized study (treatment vs no treatment). Patients are stratified according to sex and to stage of disease (I vs II vs IIIA). Patient receives cisplatin and etoposide on days 1-3, every 28 days, for 3 cycles. Patient may receive radiation therapy after surgery at the discretion of the physician. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 750 patients will be accrued over 3 years.</detailed_description>
