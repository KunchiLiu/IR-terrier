	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating patients with advanced mesothelioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Provide treatment with antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 to patients with stage IV mesothelioma. - Describe the response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1 IV six times per day until the maximum dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 3 months, patients with stable or responding disease may continue treatment. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for at least 8 months beyond CR. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for the second year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
