	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may help the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of vaccination with monoclonal antibody BEC2 and BCG with that of no further therapy in treating patients who have limited-stage small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccination Therapy in Treating Patients With Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the impact of adjuvant monoclonal antibody BEC2 and BCG on survival of patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine progression-free survival and quality of life of these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center, Karnofsky performance status (60-70% vs 80-100%), and response to first-line combined modality treatment (complete vs partial). Within 3-7 weeks after completion of prior induction chemoradiotherapy, responding patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive best supportive care and are observed until disease progression is documented. Arm II: Patients receive adjuvant monoclonal antibody BEC2 and BCG intradermally on day 1 of weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 10. Treatment consists of 5 vaccinations over a period of 10 to 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at weeks 6, 12, and 24, and then every 6 months thereafter. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 500 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.</detailed_description>
