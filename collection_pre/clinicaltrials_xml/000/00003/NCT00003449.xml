	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of dexamethasone plus paclitaxel and gemcitabine in treating patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Platinum-Resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate, progression time, and survival of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer treated with weekly paclitaxel and gemcitabine. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Evaluate the toxic effects and safety profile of premedication with steroids with this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment with paclitaxel (none or relapse more than 6 months after paclitaxel versus progressive disease or relapse less than 6 months after paclitaxel). Patients receive dexamethasone IV, then paclitaxel IV followed by gemcitabine IV, for 3 consecutive weeks on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment is continued every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients are followed until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
