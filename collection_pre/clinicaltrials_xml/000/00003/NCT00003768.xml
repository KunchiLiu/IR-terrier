	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combretastatin A4 phosphate in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors that have not responded to previous therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combretastatin A4 Phosphate in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of combretastatin A4 phosphate when administered at single doses every 21 days in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine both the toxicity and dose limiting toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the plasma and urine pharmacokinetics of combretastatin A4 and combretastatin A4 phosphate. IV. Gather preliminary data regarding possible antitumor effects in those patients with measurable disease. OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive combretastatin A4 phosphate IV over 10-60 minutes. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of combretastatin A4 phosphate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 21 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
