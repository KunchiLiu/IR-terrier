	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>6-Hydroxymethylacylfulvene in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (HMAF) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. II. Investigate the safety of HMAF given to this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene intravenously for 5 minutes every day for 5 consecutive days. Treatment is repeated every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed after every 2 treatment courses. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-19 months.</detailed_description>
