	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells in patients with primary or advanced glioma. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells in treating patients who have primary, recurrent, or refractory malignant glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Primary or Advanced Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Confirm the antitumor efficacy of intracavitary interleukin-2 plus autologous lymphokine-activated killer cells in patients with primary, recurrent or refractory malignant gliomas. - Determine whether the induction of a regional, intracavitary, eosinophilia is a prognosticator of response to immunotherapy and long term survival in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive cytoreductive tumor surgery and/or biopsy and implantation of intracavitary Ommaya reservoir prior to therapy induction. Patients undergo outpatient leukapheresis on day -4 or -5, and cells are incubated ex vivo with interleukin-2 (IL-2). Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and IL-2 are infused on day 1. Bolus infusions of low-dose IL-2 are administered on days 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12, followed by a rest period on days 13-24. The course is repeated on day 25 starting with leukapheresis. Therapy courses are repeated for up to 1 year for stable disease or response to therapy. Maintenance doses repeat every 4-6 months thereafter. Disease restaging is done every 8-12 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients per year will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
