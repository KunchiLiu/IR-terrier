	<brief_title>Radiolabeled Folic Acid and Imaging to Detect Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the effectiveness of folic acid conjugated with indium In 111 to diagnose ovarian cancer and locate metastatic disease. OUTLINE: This is a diagnostic study. Patients receive an injection of folic acid conjugated with indium In 111. The patient then undergoes imaging studies at various time points (e.g., 1, 4, and 24 hours). Patients then undergo exploratory surgery, the results of which are then compared to the imaging studies. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
