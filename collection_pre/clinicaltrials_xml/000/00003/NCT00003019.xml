	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy with vinblastine and methotrexate in treating children who have desmoid tumors that are recurrent or untreatable with surgery or radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vinblastine and Methotrexate in Treating Children With Desmoid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the efficacy and toxicity of vinblastine and methotrexate for newly diagnosed or recurrent desmoid tumors in children who are not good candidates for treatment with surgery or radiation therapy. OUTLINE: Patients receive vinblastine and methotrexate IV weekly for 26 weeks, then every 2 weeks for an additional 26 weeks. Treatment continues for a maximum of 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with a complete response receive an additional 8 doses of chemotherapy. Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
