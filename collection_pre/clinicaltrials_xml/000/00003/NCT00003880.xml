	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with gene therapy using SCH-58500 may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II/III trial to determine the effectiveness of paclitaxel plus carboplatin with or without SCH-58500 in treating patients who have newly diagnosed stage III ovarian or stage III primary peritoneal cancer with residual disease following surgery to remove the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Plus Carboplatin With or Without SCH-58500 in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage III Ovarian or Stage III Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the effect of paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without SCH 58500 on progression free survival, overall survival, safety, response, and CA-125 levels in patients with newly diagnosed stage III ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients receive treatment of IV paclitaxel and IV carboplatin. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment groups: Arm I: Patients receive IV paclitaxel over 3 hours, immediately followed by IV carboplatin, on day 1. Courses are repeated every 21 days. Arm II: Patients receive IV paclitaxel over 3 hours, immediately followed by IV carboplatin, on day 1. Patients receive intraperitoneal SCH 58500 on days 1-5. Courses are repeated every 21 days. Patients are followed every 6 weeks for 36 months, then every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients (180 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
