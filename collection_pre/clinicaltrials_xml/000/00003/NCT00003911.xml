	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Stereotactic radiosurgery may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy followed by stereotactic radiosurgery in treating patients who have brain metastases from malignant melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S9903: Whole Brain Radiotherapy Followed By Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Limited Malignant Melanoma Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the 6 month intracranial progression rate and 6 month overall survival rate in patients with limited brain metastases from malignant melanoma undergoing whole brain radiotherapy followed by stereotactic radiosurgery boost. II. Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo whole brain radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3 weeks, followed 3-5 weeks later by stereotactic radiosurgery. Patients are followed every 3 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
