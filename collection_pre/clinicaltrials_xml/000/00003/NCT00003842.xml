	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL immunotoxin may locate tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells. This may be an effective treatment for recurrent malignant astrocytoma. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL immunotoxin in treating patients who have recurrent malignant astrocytoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL Immunotoxin in Treating Patients With Recurrent Malignant Astrocytoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intratumorally infused IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL immunotoxin in patients with recurrent malignant astrocytoma. II. Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine preliminarily any efficacy of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients undergo a stereotactic biopsy under MR/CT guidance. Catheters are then placed into the tumor under stereotactic guidance. The catheter is filled with IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL immunotoxin (IL-4 toxin), with infusion beginning 24 hours after catheter insertion. The IL-4 toxin is infused over 4 days. The catheter is removed 45 minutes after the infusion is completed and a MR scan is performed. Cohorts of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of IL-4 toxin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding the dose at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 weeks for 16 weeks, then every 8 weeks for up to 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
