	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of MEN-10755 in treating patients who have solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MEN-10755 in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of MEN-10755 in patients with solid tumors. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug and study the predictability, duration, intensity, onset, reversibility and dose relationship of the toxic effects in this patient population. III. Propose a safe dose for phase II study. IV. Study the pharmacokinetics of this drug at different dose levels in this patient population. V. Document any possible antitumor activity of this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive MEN-10755 IV over 15 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment continues every 4 weeks, or upon recovery of toxicity, whichever comes later. Treatment continues for at least 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MEN-10755 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for at least 3 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.</detailed_description>
