	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs such as capecitabine may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of capecitabine in combination with radiation therapy in treating patients who have unresectable, residual, or recurrent colorectal cancer located in the pelvis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Unresectable, Residual, or Recurrent Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral capecitabine administered in combination with pelvic radiotherapy in patients with unresectable, residual, or locally recurrent cancer localized in the pelvis. II. Determine the tolerance of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the preliminary evidence of therapeutic acticivity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of capecitabine. Patients receive oral capecitabine twice a day 7 days a week for 6 weeks with concurrent radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is initiated on the same day as the initiation of capecitabine and is administered 5 days a week for 5.5-6 weeks. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 51 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
