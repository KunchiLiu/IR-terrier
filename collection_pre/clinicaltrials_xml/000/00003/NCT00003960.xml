	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Bone marrow transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus donor bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who have hematologic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donor Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the 1-year survival rate of patients with hematologic malignancies after treatment with HLA-matched allogeneic bone marrow transplantation after high-dose chemotherapy. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral busulfan four times a day on days -8 to -5, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -4 to -1, and methylprednisolone IV over 1 hour every 12 hours on days -2 to 0. CD34+ stem cell augmented donor bone marrow is infused on day 0. Methylprednisolone is administered IV over 1 hour on days 5-16, and then tapered. Patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
