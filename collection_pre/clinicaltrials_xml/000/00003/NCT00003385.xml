	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin in treating patients who have untreated ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Untreated Ovarian, Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of doxorubicin HCl liposome when administered with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with previously untreated ovarian epithelial, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. - Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients. - Evaluate measurable disease in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of doxorubicin HCl liposome (LipoDox). Patients receive LipoDox IV on day 1, carboplatin IV over 3 hours on days 1 and 22, and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Treatment repeats every 42 days for 4 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of LipoDox until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional cohort of 12 patients receives LipoDox at the MTD with carboplatin and paclitaxel as above. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 48 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
