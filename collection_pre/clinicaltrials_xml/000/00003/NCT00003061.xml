	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of methotrexate and cytarabine plus radiation therapy in treating patients who have primary CNS lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Primary CNS Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of methotrexate and cytarabine chemotherapy in combination with whole-brain radiation therapy for patients with non-AIDS related primary central nervous system lymphoma. II. Assess the response rate and safety of this chemotherapy regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive the first course of chemotherapy as soon as possible after diagnosis and staging. Methotrexate (MTX) IV is administered over 40-60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cytarabine (AraC) is administered intrathecally on days 1 and 15. The second course of chemotherapy begins on day 29 or after bone marrow recovery. Radiation therapy begins no later than 3 weeks after completing chemotherapy. Patients are followed until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued.</detailed_description>
