	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of dolastatin 10 in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent liver, bile duct, or gallbladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dolastatin 10 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Or Recurrent Liver, Bile Duct, or Gallbladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate, time to progression, and survival of patients with previously untreated advanced hepatobiliary cancer treated with dolastatin 10. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive dolastatin 10 IV bolus every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-35 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months.</detailed_description>
