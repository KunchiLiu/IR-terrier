	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Capsaicin lozenges may be effective treatment for mucositis caused by radiation therapy. It is not yet known whether capsaicin lozenges are more effective than no treatment for mucositis caused by radiation therapy. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of capsaicin lozenges in treating patients with mucositis caused by radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capsaicin Lozenges in Treating Patients With Mucositis Caused by Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of capsaicin lozenges in terms of frequency, duration, and severity of mouth pain caused by radiation therapy to the oral cavity. II. Evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are stratified according to dentures (yes vs no), smoking history (none vs currently vs past only), radiation therapy (primary vs postoperative adjuvant), planned radiation dose (5000-6000 cGy vs greater than 6000 cGy), planned fluoride use (yes vs no), and amount of oral mucosa in radiation field (one- to two-thirds vs greater than two-thirds). Patients receive one lozenge orally of capsaicin or placebo four times daily. Treatment begins within the first 3 days of radiation therapy and continues during and for two weeks after radiation therapy is completed.</detailed_description>
