	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel and cisplatin plus flavopiridol in treating patients who have refractory or recurrent solid tumors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol when administered in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin in patients with refractory adult solid tumors. II. Investigate the clinical pharmacokinetics of intravenous flavopiridol when administered in combination with paclitaxel in these patients. III. Obtain preliminary data on the therapeutic activity of flavopiridol when administered in combination with paclitaxel in these patients. IV. Evaluate surrogate markers of activity such as inhibition of PKC or CDK1 in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. On day 2, patients receive cisplatin IV over 20 minutes followed by a 24 hour infusion of flavopiridol. Courses are repeated every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Sequential dose escalation of flavopiridol is followed by sequential dose escalation of cisplatin. Dose escalation in cohorts of 3-6 patients each continues until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 46-73 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 more months.</detailed_description>
