	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and cisplatin with or without paclitaxel and G-CSF in treating patients who have stage III, stage IV, or recurrent endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With or Without G-CSF in Treating Patients With Stage III, Stage IV, or Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether the addition of paclitaxel, using filgrastim (G-CSF) support, to standard doxorubicin/cisplatin chemotherapy produces improvement in the frequency of objective response, progression-free survival, or overall survival in patients with stage III, stage IV, or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. - Compare the toxicities of these two regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 15-30 minutes, followed immediately by cisplatin IV over 1 hour. - Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin and cisplatin as in arm I on day 1. On day 2, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 3 and continuing for at least 10 days. Courses are repeated every 21 days. Treatment continues for up to 7 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients (120 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 21 months.</detailed_description>
