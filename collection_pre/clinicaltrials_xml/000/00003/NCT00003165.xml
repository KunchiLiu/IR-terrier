	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving drugs in different forms may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of doxorubicin in treating women with advanced metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxorubicin in Treating Women With Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity of doxorubicin-HPMA conjugate (PK1) in women with advanced breast cancer. OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive doxorubicin-HPMA conjugate (PK1) by intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks. Patients may receive a total of 6 courses of treatment in the absence of toxicity and progressive disease. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
