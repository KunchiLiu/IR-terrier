	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill kidney cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 in treating patients with stage III or stage IV kidney cancer that has been removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Kidney Cancer That Has Been Removed With Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the disease free survival and overall survival of patients with resected stage III or IV renal cancer treated with interleukin-2. II. Measure the degree of rebound lymphocytosis generated by this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive interleukin-2 IV over 15-30 minutes on 3 consecutive days weekly for 6 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of rest. Patients receive 2 treatment courses, each 8 weeks in duration. Patients are followed every 6 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued within 1 to 2 years.</detailed_description>
