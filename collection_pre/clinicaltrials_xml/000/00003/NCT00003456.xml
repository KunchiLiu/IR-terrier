	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston therapy in treating patients who have glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response rate to escalating doses of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. - Assess tolerance to and side effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 2 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional 8 months after CR. Tumors are measured after 1 month, every 1-2 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.
