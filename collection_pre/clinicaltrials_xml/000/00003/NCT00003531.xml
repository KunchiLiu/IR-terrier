	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in patients with incurable stage IV adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. - Describe response, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 by intravenous injection 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 3 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional 8 months after reaching CR. Tumors are measured every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
