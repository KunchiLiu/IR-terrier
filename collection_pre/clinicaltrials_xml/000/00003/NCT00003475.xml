	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Current therapies for adults with primary malignant brain tumors that have not responded to standard therapy provide very limited benefit to the patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of adults with primary malignant brain tumors that have not responded to standard therapy. PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that Antineoplaston therapy has on adults with primary malignant brain tumors that have not responded to standard therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Primary Malignant Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with primary malignant brain tumors that have not responded to standard therapy, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial response or stable disease). - To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with a primary malignant brain tumor. OVERVIEW: This is a single arm, open-label study in which adults with malignant brain tumors that have not responded to standard therapy receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 months, patients with a complete or partial response or with stable disease may continue treatment. To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued to this study</detailed_description>
