	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of CHS 828 in treating patients who have solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CHS 828 in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral CHS 828 in patients with solid tumors. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine a safe dose of this regimen for phase II evaluation. - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients. - Determine any antitumor activity in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral CHS 828 every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CHS 828 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for up to 4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
