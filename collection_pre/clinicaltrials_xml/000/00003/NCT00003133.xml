	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy following surgery in treating patients with advanced bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Following Surgery in Treating Patients With Advanced Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and toxicity of sequential dose intensive adjuvant systemic therapy consisting of gemcitabine, then doxorubin, followed by paclitaxel and cisplatin with filgrastim (granulocyte colony stimulating factor; G-CSF) for patients with completely resected, locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium. II. Assess the disease free and overall survival of these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV on weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 for a total of 6 doses. A 1 week rest period occurs after the third dose of gemcitabine. At least 14 days after the last dose of gemcitabine, during the ninth week, patients receive doxorubicin at 2 week intervals (weeks 9, 11, 13, and 15) for a total of 4 doses. Filgrastim (granulocyte colony stimulating factor; G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously on days 3-10 of each cycle of doxorubicin. At least 14 days after the last dose of doxorubicin, during week 17, patients receive the combination of paclitaxel IV (3 hour infusion) and cisplatin, at 2 week intervals (weeks 17, 19, 21, and 23) for a total of 4 doses. G-CSF is again administered on days 3-10 of each of these cycles. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, then annually until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 25-30 patients in 1.5-2 years.</detailed_description>
