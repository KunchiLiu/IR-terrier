	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as hydroxyurea use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well hydroxyurea works in treating patients with unresectable benign meningioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S9811 Hydroxyurea in Treating Patients With Unresectable Benign Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the partial and complete response rates in patients with unresectable benign meningioma treated with hydroxyurea. - Assess the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral hydroxyurea twice daily for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 months, 6 months, and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 38 patients will be accrued for this study within 13 months.</detailed_description>
