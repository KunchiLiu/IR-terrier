	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow patients to tolerate higher doses of chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have germ cell tumors that have not responded to previous chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Germ Cell Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the complete response rate (chemotherapy complete response, pathological complete response, or surgical complete response) to intensive chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell support in patients with cisplatin resistant germ cell tumors. II. Determine duration of complete response and survival of these patients after this therapy. III. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen and the relationship between these pharmacokinetics, nature and duration of response to treatment, and the toxic effects in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive epirubicin IV over 15 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1, then filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SQ) on days 5-14. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected on days 13 and 14. This course is repeated beginning on day 15. Patients then undergo a three part intensification regimen. Part I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and thiotepa IV by continuous infusion on days 34 and 35. PBSC are reinfused on day 38, and G-CSF SQ is administered from day 39 until blood cell counts recover. Part II: Patients receive etoposide IV over 2 hours, ifosfamide IV over 4 hours, and carboplatin IV over 6 hours on days 62-66. PBSC are reinfused on day 70, and eventually G-CSF begins on day 71. Part III: Patients receive etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin on days 90-94 as in part II. PBSC are reinfused on day 98 and eventually G-CSF begins on day 99. Patients are followed every month for the first year, every 2 months for the second year, every 6 months for the third and fourth years, then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
