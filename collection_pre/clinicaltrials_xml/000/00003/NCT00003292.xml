	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ifosfamide in treating patients with meningeal tumors that have recurred or that cannot be removed surgically.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S9624 Ifosfamide in Treating Patients With Meningeal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Estimate failure free survival, overall survival, and response in patients with residual or recurrent/progressive aggressive meningeal tumors (malignant meningioma, hemangiopericytoma, and primary nervous system sarcoma) treated with ifosfamide. - Evaluate toxicities of ifosfamide in this patient population. OUTLINE: All patients receive ifosfamide IV continuously over 72 hours on days 1-3 of each 21 day treatment course. Patients are evaluated for response/progression after every 2 courses. Patients with stable disease receive up to 8 courses of therapy. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
