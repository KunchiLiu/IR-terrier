	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of cladribine when given with bryostatin 1 in treating patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bryostatin 1 Plus Cladribine in Treating Patients With Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of cladribine when administered after bryostatin 1 in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of cladribine. Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV continuously on days 1-3 immediately followed by cladribine IV continuously on days 4-8. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete remission (CR) receive 2 additional courses past CR. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating dose levels of cladribine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
