	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antiemetic drugs may help to reduce or prevent nausea and vomiting in patients treated with chemotherapy. It is not known whether receiving dexamethasone with granisetron is more effective than receiving dexamethasone with metoclopramide for reducing the side effects of chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of dexamethasone with either granisetron or metoclopramide in patients treated with chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the clinical efficacy and safety of Granisetron or Metoclopramide in combination with Dexamethasone in the prophylaxis of delayed nausea and vomiting induced by emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in patients with or without emesis in the acute phase. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are stratified by prior chemotherapy (yes vs no), regular alcohol consumption (yes vs no), and prior chemotherapy regimen (cisplatin/carboplatin vs others). Patients receive dexamethasone and granisetron by mouth bid on day 0. Patients are then randomized to receive either granisetron or metoclopramide with dexamethasone concurrently with chemotherapy. Arm I: Patients receive granisetron by mouth bid on days 1-5. Dexamethasone and a placebo are administered by mouth once daily on days 1-5. Arm II: Patients receive metoclopramide by mouth tid on days 1-5. Dexamethasone is administered by mouth once daily on days 1-5. Patients must complete a diary card daily for 6 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 360 patients.</detailed_description>
