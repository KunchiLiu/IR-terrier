	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from the HER2/neu antigen may make the body build an immune response and kill tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as GM-CSF increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of HER-2/neu vaccine plus GM-CSF in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV breast cancer, stage III or stage IV ovarian cancer, or stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HER-2/Neu Vaccine Plus GM-CSF in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Breast, Ovarian, or Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of serial intradermal vaccinations of HER-2/neu derived peptides with sargramostim (GM-CSF) as an adjuvant in patients with stage III or IV HER-2/neu expressing breast, ovarian, or nonsmall cell lung cancer. II. Determine whether immunity can be elicited with peptides derived from the intracellular domain of the HER-2/neu protein. III. Determine whether immunity can be elicited with peptides derived from the extracellular domain of the HER-2/neu protein. IV. Determine whether cytotoxic T cells specific for the HER-2/neu protein can be elicited in patients with HLA-A2 by immunization with peptides derived from the HER-2/neu protein. OUTLINE: Patients receive one of three HER-2/neu peptide vaccine formulations that also contain sargramostim (GM-CSF) as the vaccine adjuvant. Each vaccine is studied in 20 patients. A maximum of 3 patients receive a vaccine each month for 6 months to monitor the potential toxicity associated with sequential immunizations. Patients receive a follow-up evaluation 1 month after the last vaccination. Those patients who have an immune response related to the vaccine will continue to have immunologic evaluations performed every 2 months while immune responses can still be detected. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 60 patients will be accrued.</detailed_description>
