	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether ifosfamide or doxorubicin is more effective for advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of ifosfamide with that of doxorubicin in treating patients who have advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ifosfamide or Doxorubicin in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the progression free survival rate in patients with advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma treated with either of two different regimens of ifosfamide or doxorubicin. II. Assess the toxic effects of these therapies and response rate in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized into one of 3 arms (continuous ifosfamide, ifosfamide daily for 3 days, or doxorubicin). Patients are stratified by performance status (0 vs 1), liver involvement (no vs yes), histological type (leiomyosarcoma vs synovial sarcoma vs other), and histological grade (1 vs 2 vs 3). Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin by bolus infusion for 5-20 minutes once every 3 weeks. Arm II: Patients receive ifosfamide by intravenous infusion for 4 hours on days 1, 2, and 3 every three weeks. Arm III: Patients receive ifosfamide by intravenous infusion for 72 hours every 3 weeks. Patients are assessed after every 2 courses of therapy. Each course of therapy consists of 3 weeks of treatment. Patients may receive a maximum of 6 courses of therapy in the absence of toxicity and disease progression. Patients are followed every 12 weeks for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 780 patients (260 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
