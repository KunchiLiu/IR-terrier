	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vinorelbine in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vinorelbine in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of vinorelbine in patients with metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer. II. Evaluate the toxicity of vinorelbine in these patients. III. Evaluate the quality of life of these patients, and correlate quality of life with PSA response. OUTLINE: Patients receive a 5-10 minute intravenous infusion of vinorelbine on day 1 and day 8 of a 21-day course. Patients with stabilization of their disease, partial response, or complete response, receive a maximum of 12 courses of treatment. Patients showing disease progression or severe toxic side effects discontinue treatment. Quality of life and pain are assessed prior to treatment, at days 1 and 8 of each course, and at end of the treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
