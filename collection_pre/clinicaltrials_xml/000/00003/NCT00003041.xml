	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of pyrazoloacridine in treating women who have refractory metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pyrazoloacridine in Treating Women With Refractory Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of pyrazoloacridine in patients with refractory breast cancer. II. Determine the toxic effects of pyrazoloacridine in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive pyrazoloacridine IV over 3 hours. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
