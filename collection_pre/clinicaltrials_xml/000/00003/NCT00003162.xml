	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known which radiation therapy regimen is more effective for bone metastases. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare different radiation therapy regimens in treating patients who have bone metastases from breast or prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Bone Metastases From Breast or Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the ability of a single fraction of radiation therapy vs multiple fractions to provide complete pain relief in patients with painful bone metastases from breast or prostate cancer. - Determine the frequency and duration of pain relief and narcotic relief after these treatments in these patient populations. - Compare the effect on quality of life of these two treatments in these patient populations. - Compare the incidence of pathologic fracture within the treatment fields after these two treatments in these patient populations. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I consists of radiation therapy delivered in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. Arm II consists of a single dose of radiation therapy. Any retreatment does not occur until at least 4 weeks after prior treatment unless there is an increase of 2 points on the pain score. Patients are followed and quality of life is assessed at 2 and 4 weeks, then at 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, every 6 months for the next 3 years, then annually until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 938 patients within 2 years.</detailed_description>
