	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antifungal therapy with voriconazole or amphotericin B may be an effective treatment for aspergillosis. It is not yet known whether voriconazole is more effective than amphotericin B in treating patients with aspergillosis. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of voriconazole with amphotericin B in treating patients with aspergillosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Voriconazole and Amphotericin B in Treating Patients With Aspergillosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy, safety, and toleration of voriconazole versus amphotericin B (CAB) in the treatment of acute invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. II. Compare the efficacy, safety, and toleration of voriconazole versus CAB followed by other antifungal therapy in the treatment of acute invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. III. Compare survival in patients treated with voriconazole versus CAB with or without other antifungal therapy. IV. Investigate resource utilization in patients treated with voriconazole versus CAB with or without other antifungal therapy. OUTLINE: This is an open label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center, site of infection, underlying disease, and baseline neutrophil count. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive voriconazole IV every 12 hours for 7-28 days and continue with oral voriconazole twice a day for a maximum total duration of 12 weeks of therapy. Arm II: Patients receive intravenous amphotericin B daily for at least 2 weeks; treatment continues for a maximum of 12 weeks. Patients discontinued from study drug treatment because of toxicity, intolerance or clinical failure may receive alternative (nonstudy) antifungal therapy. All patients are monitored for a total of 16 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A sufficient number of patients will be accrued so that 212 patients (106 per study arm) will be eligible for the study.</detailed_description>
