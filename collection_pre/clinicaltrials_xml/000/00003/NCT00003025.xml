	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to and kill tumor cells. Combining vaccine therapy with surgery may be an effective treatment for pancreatic cancer. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients with stage I or stage II pancreatic cancer that has been surgically removed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage I or Stage II Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Study the safety of autologous tumor derived gp96 heat shock protein peptide complex (HSPPC-96) in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. II. Examine the immune response to HSPPC-96 in this group of patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Six weeks after surgery patients are given autologous tumor derived gp96 heat shock protein peptide complex (HSPPC-96) subcutaneously once a week for 4 weeks. Five patients are initially enrolled at each of two dose levels. An additional three patients may be enrolled at each dose level to determine the optimal dose of HSPPC-96. Patients are followed at weeks 1, 4, and 12 after treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 16 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
