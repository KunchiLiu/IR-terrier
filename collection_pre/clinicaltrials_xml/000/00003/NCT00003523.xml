	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of aminocamptothecin in treating patients with recurrent or refractory ovarian epithelial cancer or primary cancer of the peritoneum.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aminocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Ovarian Epithelial Cancer or Primary Cancer of the Peritoneum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the antitumor activity of aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent or refractory ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal carcinoma who have failed on higher priority treatment protocols. II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion IV over 120 hours weekly for two of every three weeks. Courses are repeated every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 23-56 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-12 months.</detailed_description>
