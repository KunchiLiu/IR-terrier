	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells. Umbilical cord blood transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy and kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and umbilical cord blood transplantation in treating patients with hematologic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy, Radiation Therapy, and Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, efficacy, and toxicity of using cord blood as a source for stem cell transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancies. OUTLINE: Patients undergo autologous bone marrow harvesting or peripheral stem cell collection prior to transplant regimen, unless the patient has acute leukemia in relapse, aplastic anemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome. Arm I: Patients eligible to undergo total body irradiation (TBI) first receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -5 and -4, then undergo TBI twice a day on days -3 to -1. Patients also receive antithymocyte globulin (ATG) IV over 10 hours on days -3 to -1. Cord blood is infused on day 0. Arm II: Patients not eligible to receive TBI receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 for a total of 16 doses. Cyclophosphamide, ATG, and cord blood are then administered as in arm I. All patients receive cyclosporine on days -2 to 180, methylprednisolone on days 5-180, and filgrastim (G-CSF) from day 1. Patients are followed weekly until day 180 and then monthly for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 patients per arm) will be accrued for this study within 4 years.</detailed_description>
