	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of two combination chemotherapy regimens in treating patients with Hodgkin's disease and HIV infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Hodgkin's Disease and HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Investigate the effects on survival, life expectancy and quality, toxicity, and immunological status in low risk patients with Hodgkin's Disease and HIV infection treated with the Stanford V regimen and in high risk patients treated with epirubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and prednisone. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified into 2 groups designated as low and high risk on the basis of ECOG performance status (0-2 vs 3-4), presence or absence of AIDS before the diagnosis of Hodgkin's Disease, and immune status (CD4+ cell count greater vs no greater than 100/mm^3). - Low risk patients (those with no risk factors) receive the EBVP regimen, as follows: - Epirubicin intravenously on day 1 - Bleomycin intramuscularly or intravenously on day 1 - Vinblastine intravenously on day 1 - Prednisone orally on days 1-5 - Patients also receive daily injections of filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF) on days 6-15. This schedule is repeated every 3 weeks for 6 courses. - High risk patients (those with one or more risk factors) receive the Stanford V regimen, as follows: - Doxorubicin and vinblastine intravenously on days 1 and 15 - Mechlorethamine intravenously on day 1 - Vincristine and bleomycin intravenously on days 8 and 22 - Etoposide intravenously on days 15 and 16 - Prednisone orally daily - Patients also receive daily injections of G-CSF on days 3-7, 9-13, 17-21, and 23-26. This schedule is repeated every 28 days for 3 courses. Patients are followed every 2 months the first year and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20-30 patients will initially be accrued in this study.</detailed_description>
