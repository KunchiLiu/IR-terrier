	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CMA-676 in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first relapse.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CMA-676 in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia in First Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy of CMA-676 in terms of the number of patients with acute myeloid leukemia attaining a complete remission. II. Assess the safety of CMA-676 in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is an open label, single arm, multicenter study. Patients receive CMA-676 IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients may receive 1 additional dose of therapy 15 to 28 days later. Patients who achieve complete or morphologic remission are followed for an additional 6 months and every 3-6 months thereafter until relapse and/or death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 55 evaluable patients will be accrued. Enrollment will then be extended for up to an additional 55 patients.</detailed_description>
