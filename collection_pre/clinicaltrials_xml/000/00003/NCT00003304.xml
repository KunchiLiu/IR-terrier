	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients with recurrent oligodendroglial tumors following combination chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Recurrent Oligodendroglial Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and duration of response in oligodendroglial tumors to temozolomide treatment in patients with progressive disease during or after procarbazine/lomustine/vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy. II. Determine the feasibility and toxicity of temozolomide chemotherapy following PVC chemotherapy in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter trial. Temozolomide is administered orally on days 1-5 of each 4-week course; treatment continues for a maximum of 12 courses. Patients are followed every 2 months for the first 6 months and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-29 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
