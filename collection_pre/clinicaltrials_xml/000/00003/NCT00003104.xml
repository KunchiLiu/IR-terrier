	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Computer systems that allow doctors to create a 3-dimensional picture of the tumor in order to plan treatment may result in more effective radiation therapy. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy that has been planned with a computer works in treating patients with prostate cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Establish the efficacy of high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in patients with intermediate prognostic risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate. - Determine the PSA relapse-free survival rate of this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 4-5 days per week for at least 9 weeks. Patients are evaluated at least weekly during radiotherapy and at 2 and 4 months after treatment completion. Thereafter, patients are followed every 6 months for a total of 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
