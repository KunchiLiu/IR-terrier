	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Chemoprotective drugs, such as enalapril, may protect normal cells from the toxic effects of chemotherapy. It is not known whether enalapril is more effective than a placebo in treating heart damage in patients who received anthracycline chemotherapy for childhood cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of enalapril with a placebo in treating heart damage in patients who received anthracycline chemotherapy for childhood cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enalapril in Treating Heart Damage Patients Who Received Anthracycline Chemotherapy for Childhood Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether enalapril treatment results in a reduction in body surface area-adjusted left ventricular mass in anthracycline-treated survivors of childhood cancer. II. Determine whether improvement in ventricular function achieved by enalapril is sustained and alters the course of late cardiotoxicity. III. Determine the impact of enalapril therapy on quality of life. OUTLINE: This is a double blind, placebo controlled, randomized study. Patients are stratified based on the cumulative anthracycline dose, age at cancer diagnosis, and the duration of time since cessation of anthracycline therapy. Patients are administered enalapril or placebo by mouth bid. Patients undergo a series of cardiac tests after administration of drug. Follow-up occurs at 2, 6, and 12 months and every year thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 75 patients in each treatment arm will be accrued.</detailed_description>
