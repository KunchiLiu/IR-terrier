	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carmustine in treating adults with recurrent supratentorial low-grade glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carmustine in Treating Adults With Recurrent Supratentorial Low-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of Gliadel wafers (carmustine) in the treatment of recurrent supratentorial low grade glioma. - Assess the toxicity of this therapy in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease (fibrillary astrocytoma vs oligodendroglioma or mixed glioma). Patients receive up to 8 Gliadel wafers (containing carmustine) implanted in the resected tumor cavity. Patients are followed every 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue a maximum of 68 patients within 18-24 months.</detailed_description>
