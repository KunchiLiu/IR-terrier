	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with lomustine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and procarbazine in treating patients with stage IIB, stage III, or stage IV AIDS-related Hodgkin's disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With AIDS-Related Hodgkin's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response rate, response duration, and survival of patients receiving lomustine/etoposide/cyclophosphamide/procarbazine (CECP) for stage IIB-IV AIDS-related Hodgkin's disease. - Assess the feasibility and toxic effects of CECP in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral lomustine on day 1, oral etoposide on days 1-3, and oral cyclophosphamide and procarbazine on days 22-31. Filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) is given subcutaneously on days 5-21 and 33-42. The course is repeated every 6 weeks. Patients with a complete or partial response after 1 course of treatment receive two additional courses, but lomustine is omitted in the second course. Patients with partial response or stable disease receive radiation therapy and/or continued chemotherapy. Patients failing to respond after 1 course are removed from the study. Patients will be followed every 3 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 16 evaluable patients will be accrued.</detailed_description>
