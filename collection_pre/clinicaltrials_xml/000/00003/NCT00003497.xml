	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston capsules in treating patients who have stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Demonstrate the antitumor activity of antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 capsules in patients with non-small cell lung cancer by determining the proportion of patients who experience an objective tumor response. - Evaluate the adverse effects of and tolerance to this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 capsules orally six to seven times a day. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumors are measured every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
