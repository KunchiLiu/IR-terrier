	<brief_summary>Troglitazone may help liposarcoma cells develop into normal cells. This was a single arm, open-label study with a two-stage design to evaluate troglitazone in patients with liposarcoma stratified by histologic subtype.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Troglitazone in Treating Patients With Liposarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the clinical activity of troglitazone in patients with malignant liposarcoma stratified by histologic subtype. II. To perform correlative imaging, biological, and biochemical testing of patients in order to define the degree to which in vivo terminal differentiation may be promoted by this therapeutic intervention. III. To evaluate the tolerance and safety of troglitazone in this patient population. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Initially, 14 patients of each of the 5 histologic subtypes of liposarcoma will be accrued. If 1 or more patients show evidence of biological response, an additional 16 patients of each subtype will be accrued for a total of 30 patients per subtype. If 4 or more of 30 patients achieve biological response then troglitazone will be deemed promising in that histologic subtype.</detailed_description>
