	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel plus carboplatin in treating patients who have advanced cancer of the esophagus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Plus Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer of the Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the objective response rate in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus treated with carboplatin and docetaxel. II. Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Assess the time to progression and overall survival of this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1, followed by carboplatin IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1. Treatment is repeated every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until year 2, every 6 months during years 2-5, and then annually thereafter until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study at a rate of 30 patients per year.</detailed_description>
