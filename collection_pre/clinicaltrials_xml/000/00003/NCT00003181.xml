	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Combining chemotherapy with interleukin-2 and GM-CSF may be a more effective treatment for kidney cancer. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of low-dose interleukin-2, vinblastine, and GM-CSF in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2, Vinblastine, and GM-CSF in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF) in combination with interleukin-2 and vinblastine on the response rate of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. II. Assess the potential toxicities of this treatment combination in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a single arm, nonrandomized study. Patients receive vinblastine as an IV bolus once every 2 weeks. Interleukin-2 is administered by subcutaneous injection on days 1-5 each week for 9 weeks. Sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF) is administered by subcutaneous injection on days 1-5 each week for 9 weeks. Each 9 week cycle is followed by 3 weeks of rest. Patient may continue treatment for a maximum of 5 cycles in the absence of disease progression. Patients are assessed every 12 weeks for the duration of treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20-35 patients will be accrued into this study.</detailed_description>
