	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of CCI-779 in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CCI-779 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CCI-779 in patients with advanced solid tumors (part I) who are not receiving anticonvulsant therapy. - Determine the safety, tolerability, and MTD in patients with recurrent gliomas or brain metastases (part II) who are receiving anticonvulsant therapy. - Determine the preliminary pharmacokinetic profile and antitumor activity of CCI-779 in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study. - Part I: Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5, followed by a 9 day rest period. Treatment courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose for part I is defined as the dose level at which 33% of patients experience dose limiting toxicity. - Part II: Patients receive the same treatment schedule as part I. Three patients with CNS tumors are entered at the dose of CCI-779 determined to be the MTD in Part I. At least 3 patients are entered at each dose level in part II. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for part I for this study within 8 months, and 12 patients will be accrued for part II within 7 months.</detailed_description>
