	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of carmustine given together with O(6)-benzylguanine in treating patients with stage I or stage II cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that has not responded to previous treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>O6-benzylguanine and Carmustine in Treating Patients With Stage IA-IIA Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the kinetics of AGT depletion in CTCL skin lesions. II. To determine the toxicity of low dose BCNU plus O6BG. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carmustine. Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour followed by topical carmustine once every 2 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of carmustine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
