	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 506U78 in treating patients with refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>506U78 in Treating Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia or Lymphoblastic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the complete and partial remission rates, as well as the remission duration, in patients with refractory or relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma receiving 506U78 on an alternate day schedule (days 1, 3, 5). II. Determine the safety and toxicity of 506U78 administered on this schedule to this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. If residual leukemia/lymphoma is present on day 22, then patients receive a second course of 506U78. If day 22 marrow is hypocellular, then a repeat bone marrow biopsy should be obtained on day 29 to assess response. For day 22 or 29 marrow that is in complete response, patients receive 506U78 for two more courses on days 1, 3, and 5, administered every 21 days. Patients are followed every 3 month for 1 year, then every 6 months for a maximum of 10 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed diagnosis of Tcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) Leukemia or lymphoma cells should express at least two of the following cell surface antigens: CD1a, CD2, CD3 (surface or cytoplasmic), CD4, CD5, CD7, and CD8 Leukemia cells should be negative for myeloperoxidase or Sudan Black B If the only T cell markers present are CD4 and CD7, the leukemic cells should be demonstrated to lack the myeloid markers CD33 and/or CD13 Refractory to at least one induction treatment regimen or in first or later relapse after achieving a complete remission No CNS leukemia or lymphoma requiring intrathecal or craniospinal radiotherapy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 16 and over Bilirubin no greater than 2 times upper limit of normal (unless due to leukemia) Creatinine clearance at least 50 mL/min (unless due to leukemia) No neurologic toxicity of grade 3 or greater during prior treatment of ALL/LBL No preexisting neuropathy of grade 2 or greater regardless of causality No history of seizure disorder Not pregnant or nursing Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No concurrent erythropoietin No other concurrent chemotherapy No concurrent dexamethasone or other steroidal antiemetics No concurrent hormone therapy, except for nondiseaserelated conditions</criteria>
