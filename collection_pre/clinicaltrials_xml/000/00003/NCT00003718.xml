	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who have advanced soft tissue sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy, as measured by the response rate, of temozolomide in patients with unresectable, stage IV, or recurrent soft tissue sarcoma who have failed no more than 2 prior treatment regimens. II. Determine the clinical and laboratory toxicities, as well as patient tolerance, of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), prior surgery (yes vs no), prior radiotherapy (yes vs no), and prior chemotherapy regimens (0 vs 1 vs 2). Patients receive oral temozolomide every 12 hours for 5 days. Courses repeat every 4 weeks for at least 18 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 18 months, every 6 months for the next 18 months, and then annually thereafter until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
