	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston therapy in treating patients who have advanced head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Provide treatment with antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 to patients with incurable cancer of the head and neck. - Describe response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1 by intravenous injection six times per day until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 2 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 2 months, patients with stable or responding disease may continue treatment. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for 8 months beyond CR. Tumors are measured every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
