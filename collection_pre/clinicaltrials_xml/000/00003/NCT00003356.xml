	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining rituximab and interleukin-2 intreating patients who have low-grade mantle cell lymphoma or follicular lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Plus Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate in patients with low-grade, mantle cell, or follicular B-cell lymphoma treated with a combination of rituximab and low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2). II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of IL-2 when given in conjunction with rituximab in this patient population. III. Assess whether antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is enhanced by in vivo exposure to IL-2 and whether ADCC activity correlates with clinical response in these patients. IV. Assess the incidence of antirituximab antibody formation in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously on days 1-5 and rituximab IV on day 3. Courses repeat weekly for up to 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks and then every 3 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-29 patients with low-grade/follicular lymphoma and 14-29 patients with mantle cell lymphoma will be accrued for this study within 2-5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed stage IIIV lowgrade, mantle cell, or follicular Bcell lymphoma Stage I disease is eligible only if radiotherapy is not considered feasible due to location of disease or previous radiation treatments No chronic lymphocytic lymphoma No small lymphocytic lymphoma with lymphocyte count greater than 5,000/mm3 Must be either firstline therapy or no more than 4 relapses after standard therapies, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, autologous bone marrow transplantation, and/or immunotherapy Eligible if refractory to first treatment with a standard therapy Patients refractory to autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) or relapsed after ABMT are eligible Patients with lowgrade or follicular lymphoma must have failed at least one chemotherapy regimen Patients with mantle cell lymphoma are eligible even if no prior treatment Bidimensionally measurable disease Demonstrable monoclonal CD20positive Bcell population in lymph nodes or bone marrow No prior diagnosis of intermediate or highgrade nonHodgkin's lymphoma No CNS, pericardial, pleural, or peritoneal involvement by lymphoma No AIDSrelated lymphoma No pleural effusion No ascites A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
