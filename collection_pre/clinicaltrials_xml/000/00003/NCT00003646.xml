	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Injecting allovectin-7 into a person's melanoma cells may make the body build an immune response that will kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma that has not responded to previous treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Demonstrate an objective clinical response (partial or complete) with a median duration of at least 4 months in 15% of patients with stage III or IV melanoma treated with Allovectin-7. Allovectin-7 is a direct gene transfer immunotherapeutic agent. II. Determine the benefits, risks, and side effects of Allovectin-7 in this patient population. PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive an intratumoral injection of Allovectin-7 once weekly for 6 weeks. At week 9, a complete disease status assessment is performed. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive additional courses of 6 injections. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
