	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan plus raltitrexed in treating patients who have refractory solid tumors that have not responded to previous therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Plus Raltitrexed in Treating Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan in combination with raltitrexed in patients with refractory solid tumors. II. Describe and quantify the toxic effects of this combination treatment regimen in a minimally pretreated patient population. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this combination treatment regimen. IV. Document any antitumor activity of this combination treatment regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of irinotecan and raltitrexed. Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by raltitrexed IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of irinotecan and raltitrexed until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Additional cohorts receive raltitrexed on day 2 rather than day 1 near the final dose levels of the combination drugs. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
