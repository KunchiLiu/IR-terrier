	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-12 in treating patients with previously treated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease. Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill lymphoma cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-12 in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Hodgkin's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of interleukin-12 in previously treated patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease. II. To determine the in vivo regulatory effect of interleukin-12 on Fas lingand (FasL) expression on patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease characteristics: low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (follicular small cleaved, follicular mixed, small lymphocytic, and variants) versus intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (follicular large, diffuse large, diffuse mixed, immunoblastic, peripheral T-cell, and mantle cell) versus Hodgkin's disease. Patients receive interleukin-12 subcutaneously twice a week. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-105 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
