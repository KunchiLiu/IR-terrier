	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interferon-alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Giving interferon-alfa following chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation may be an effective treatment for Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of interferon alfa-2b following chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interferon Alfa-2b Following Chemotherapy and Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Hodgkin's Disease or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of interferon alfa-2b in reducing the relapse rate in patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in second remission following high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. II. Compare the time to disease progression and survival in this patient population treated with interferon alfa-2b vs no further treatment. III. Assess the tolerability of these treatment regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to lymphoma subtype. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive no further therapy following high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Arm II: Beginning 4 weeks after high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, patients receive interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously three times a week. Treatment continues for 18 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients (180 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 4-5 years.</detailed_description>
