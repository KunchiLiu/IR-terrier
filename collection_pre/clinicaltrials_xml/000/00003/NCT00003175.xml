	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of fluorouracil given as a continuous infusion in treating patients with recurrent or metastatic bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorouracil in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and toxic effects of continuous fluorouracil in patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell urinary tract carcinoma. II. Determine the feasibility of this treatment in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive continuous intravenous fluorouracil by a Baxter Infusor for 24 weeks. Patients are evaluated for complete and partial response at 8, 16, and 24 weeks after the start of intravenous fluorouracil. Patients experiencing disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects are removed from the study. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months post treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued.</detailed_description>
