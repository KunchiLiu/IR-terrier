	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the activity of temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed, progressive, or recurrent anaplastic oligodendroglioma. II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease characteristics (newly diagnosed anaplastic oligodendroglioma versus recurrent anaplastic oligodendroglioma). Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days. Patients with progressive or recurrent disease (at baseline) continue treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with newly diagnosed disease continue treatment for a maximum of 4 courses before radiotherapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease may receive an additional 6 courses after completion of radiotherapy. (Radiotherapy is not part of study treatment.) Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
