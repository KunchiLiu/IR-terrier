	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the relationship between disease free survival, overall survival, and tumor replication error status for patients who have received adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer on CALGB protocol 8896. - Determine the prognostic and predictive values for response to this therapy in these patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Patients who received chemotherapy for colon cancer as part of CALGB protocol 8896 Underwent an initial resection for adenocarcinoma of the colon and were determined to have a high risk of tumor recurrence based upon nodal disease or local extension of tumor with obstruction or perforation due to tumor Surgical specimen blocks available, including tumor tissue and normal tissue</criteria>
