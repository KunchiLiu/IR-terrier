	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving methotrexate and zidovudine together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with HIV-related primary central nervous system lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With HIV-Related Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the treatment of HIV-related primary CNS lymphoma patients. - Evaluate the toxicity and overall survival of these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive chemotherapy consisting of high-dose methotrexate IV administered on day 1 and high-dose zidovudine IV administered on days 1-3 every 2 weeks. Patients receive 3 courses of therapy. Following chemotherapy, patients receive radiation therapy to the lesion site daily. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 14 patients.</detailed_description>
