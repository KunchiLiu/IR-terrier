	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Cyclosporine may relieve the diarrhea caused by irinotecan. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan and cyclosporine in treating patients who have metastatic, advanced, or locally recurrent colorectal cancer that has not responded to fluorouracil.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan and Cyclosporine in Treating Patients With Metastatic, Advanced or Locally Recurrent Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of patients with metastatic, advanced, or locally recurrent fluorouracil refractory adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum treated with irinotecan and cyclosporine. II. Determine antitumor activity, safety, tolerance, and toxicity of this combination treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 6 hours and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes weekly for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 6 weeks. Patients receive at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-45 patients will be accrued for this study over 14 months.</detailed_description>
