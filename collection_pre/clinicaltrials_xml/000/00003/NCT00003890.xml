	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of MG98 in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MG98 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of MG98 in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Assess the safety, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in this patient population. - Evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive MG98 IV over 2 hours twice weekly for 3 weeks. Courses are repeated every 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The dose of MG98 is escalated in cohorts of 1-6 patients until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at week 4, then at least every 3 months until relapse of disease. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-12 months.</detailed_description>
