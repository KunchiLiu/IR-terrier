	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and deliver tumor-killing substances, such as radioactive iodine, to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody after radiation therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed primary brain tumors that can be surgically resected.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody Therapy After Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Primary Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 81C6 delivered via the intracranial resection cavity in patients with newly diagnosed primary malignant brain tumors after surgery and radiotherapy. - Determine objective therapeutic responses of these patients to this treatment. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of iodine I 131 antitenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6 (I 131 MAb 81C6). Within 2-4 weeks after completion of external beam radiotherapy, patients undergo surgical resection of the tumor or brain metastasis, at which time an indwelling intracranial resection cavity catheter is placed. A single dose of I 131 MAb 81C6 is delivered via the intralesional catheter. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of I 131 MAb 81C6 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. After the MTD has been established, patients in the phase II portion of the study receive therapy as in phase I. Beginning 4 weeks after the monoclonal antibody treatment, patients begin chemotherapy. Patients receive carmustine IV over 1 hour on day 1 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes once weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment is repeated every 6 weeks for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression. Patients are followed initially at 4 weeks, then every 6 weeks for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
