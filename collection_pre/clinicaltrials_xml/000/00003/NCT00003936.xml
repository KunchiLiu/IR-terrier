	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bryostatin 1 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Hodgkin's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease treated with bryostatin 1. II. Determine qualitative and quantitative toxicities of bryostatin 1 in these patients. III. Determine duration of response and survival in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive bryostatin 1 by continuous IV infusion over 72 hours. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for at least 4 courses. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) are treated with 4 additional courses beyond CR. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
