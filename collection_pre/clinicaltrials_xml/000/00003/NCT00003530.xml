	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston therapy in treating patients who have primary liver cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Primary Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response, tolerance to, and side effects of antineoplaston A10 in patients with incurable primary liver cancer. OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive gradually increasing doses of antineoplaston A10 by arterial infusion daily until the final dose level is reached. Therapy continues for at least 2 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional 2 months after reaching CR. Tumors are measured every month for the first 2 months, every 2 months for the first year, and every 3 months for the second year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
