	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with docetaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplatin as induction therapy in treating patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy as Induction Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and schedule of docetaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplatin as induction chemotherapy in patients with Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) scheduled to undergo subsequent surgical resection or irradiation. II. Determine the major objective response rate of this combination therapy in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Docetaxel in administered as a 1 hour IV infusion at week 1, 5, and 9. Gemcitabine is administered as a 30 minute IV infusion at weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11. Cisplatin is administered as a 20 minute IV infusion at weeks 3, 7, and 11. In addition, G-CSF is administered subcutaneously on days 2 through 6 of each 28 day cycle following each dose of docetaxel. Three patients are entered at each dose level and must complete one cycle of therapy. If no patient experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then 3 patients are treated at the next higher dose level. If 1 patient experiences DLT, then 3 more patients are treated at that same dose level. If 2 of 6 patients experience DLT, then that dose is declared the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Once the MTD is determined, the Phase II portion of the study begins and additional patients are treated at the dose level just below the MTD. Patients who show complete or partial response, or no change, after chemotherapy, undergo surgical resection or radiotherapy to remove or reduce their tumor. Patients are assessed for disease progression and unacceptable toxicities every 4 weeks till end of treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: An estimated 40 patients will be accrued in this study.</detailed_description>
