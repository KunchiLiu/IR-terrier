	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known what preparation of vaccine therapy is most effective for treating melanoma. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of tyrosinase/gp100 peptide vaccine in treating patients who have stage II melanoma that can be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage II Melanoma That Can Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine immune reactivity in HLA-A2 positive patients with resectable stage IIA or IIB melanoma treated with vaccine comprising tyrosinase peptide and gp100 antigen emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 (ISA-51) alone or in combination with sargramostim (GM-CSF). OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to stage (IIA vs IIB). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive vaccine comprising tyrosinase peptide and gp100 antigen emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 (ISA-51) alone subcutaneously (SQ) once a week on weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, and 26. Arm II: Patients receive treatment as in arm I followed by sargramostim (GM-CSF) SQ for 5 days after each vaccination. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
