	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of topotecan and paclitaxel in treating patients who have recurrent or metastatic cancer of the cervix.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topotecan and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Cancer of the Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response, time to progression, disease free survival, and overall survival of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cancer of the cervix treated with a combination of topotecan and paclitaxel. - Determine the feasibility and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered on days 6-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
