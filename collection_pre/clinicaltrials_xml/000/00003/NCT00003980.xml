	<brief_title>BIBX 1382 in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral BIBX 1382 in patients with solid tumors. II. Determine qualitative and quantitative toxicities of oral BIBX 1382 in these patients. III. Determine predictability, duration, intensity, onset, reversibility, and dose relationship of the toxicities of oral BIBX 1382 in these patients. IV. Determine safe and optimal doses of oral BIBX 1382 for a Phase II study. V. Assess the pharmacokinetics of oral BIBX 1382 in these patients. VI. Document any antitumor activity in these patients treated with oral BIBX 1382. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive BIBX 1382 IV over 1 hour followed 7 days later by oral BIBX 1382. Beginning 3 days later, patients receive oral BIBX 1382 daily for 28 days. Courses of daily oral BIBX 1382 repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oral BIBX 1382. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose at which dose limiting toxicity occurs in at least 2 of 6 patients. Patients are followed for up to 4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-80 patients will be accrued for this study over 18 months.</detailed_description>
