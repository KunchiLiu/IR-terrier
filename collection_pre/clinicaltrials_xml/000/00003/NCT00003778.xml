	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of dolastatin 10 in treating patients who have recurrent or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dolastatin 10 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent or metastatic soft tissue sarcomas treated with dolastatin 10. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center, prior therapy, histologic subtype, stage of disease at diagnosis, and current status of disease (recurrent vs metastatic). Patients receive dolastatin 10 IV over 10 minutes. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month.</detailed_description>
