	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating patients with colon cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon by determining the proportion of patients who experience an objective tumor response. - Evaluate the adverse effects of and tolerance to this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive gradually escalating doses of oral antineoplaston A10 and oral antineoplaston AS2-1 6-7 times a day. If the patient has not achieved a partial or complete response after 3-4 months of treatment, the investigator may discontinue treatment. Patients with stable disease may continue to receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed. Tumors are measured every 4 months during the first 2 years, then every 6 months during years 3 and 4, and yearly during years 5 and 6. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
