	<brief_title>Irofulven in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the antitumor activity of 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (MGI-114) when given daily for 5 days every 28 days to patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. II. Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of MGI-114 given on this schedule in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (MGI-114) IV over 5 minutes daily for 5 consecutive days. Courses are repeated every 28 days. The minimum treatment period is 2 courses. Treatment continues indefinitely in the absence of unacceptable toxic effects or disease progression. Patients are followed at the end of every other course while on the study, and then every 3 months thereafter until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-10 months.</detailed_description>
