	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ISIS 3521 in treating patients who have advanced, unresectable, or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer or unresectable or metastatic melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ISIS 3521 in Treating Patients With Advanced, Unresectable, or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer or Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the complete and partial response rates and duration of response in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer or unresectable or metastatic melanoma treated with ISIS 3521. II. Determine safety of ISIS 3521 in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by disease type. Patients receive ISIS 3521 IV over 21 days followed by 7 days of rest. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-50 patients (14-25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
