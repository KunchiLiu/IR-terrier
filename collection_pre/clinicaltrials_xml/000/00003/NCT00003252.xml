	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Chemoprotective drugs, such as amifostine, may protect normal cells from the side effects of chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Phase IV trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine in treating patients with cancer who have neurological changes caused by chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amifostine in Treating Patients With Cancer Who Have Neurological Changes Caused by Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility and tolerability of administering amifostine by intravenous infusion over 5 minutes in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. OUTLINE: This is an open label, controlled study. Patients receive intravenous amifostine over 5 minutes 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. Patients are followed for one month post treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
