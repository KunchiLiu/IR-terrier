	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-184476 in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-184476 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, recommended phase II dose, and safety of BMS-184476 in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BMS-184476 and its metabolites in these patients. III. Determine preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of BMS-184476 in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive BMS-184476 IV over 1 hour. Treatment is repeated every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the second part of the study, patients receive BMS-184476 IV over 1 hour weekly. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at escalating doses of BMS-184476. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which fewer than 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until toxicity is resolved. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
