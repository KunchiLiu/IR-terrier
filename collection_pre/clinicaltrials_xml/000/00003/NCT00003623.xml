	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. The use of high-dose multivitamins may be an effective way to prevent the recurrence of early stage bladder cancer. It is not yet known whether high-dose vitamins are more effective than no further therapy in decreasing the risk of early-stage bladder cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of high-dose multivitamins with a placebo in preventing the recurrence of cancer in patients with early stage bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Multivitamins Compared to a Placebo in Preventing the Recurrence of Cancer in Patients With Early Stage Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE: I. Determine whether high dose multivitamins have chemopreventive efficacy beyond standard therapy in reducing the risk of recurrence in patients with resected stage 0 and I (Ta, T1, and Tis) transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are randomized to receive multivitamins or placebo orally once daily for 3 years. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
