	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients with metastatic, recurrent, or unresectable cancer of the esophagus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Metastatic, Recurrent, or Unresectable Cancer of the Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate of paclitaxel administered as a weekly one hour infusion in patients with metastatic, locally recurrent, or unresectable squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. II. Evaluate the safety of paclitaxel in this patient population. III. Assess the overall survival and quality of life of these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive intravenous paclitaxel over 1 hour weekly. Each course consists of four weeks. Patients receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects is observed. Patient response is assessed every 2 courses during the first year and then every 3 months in subsequent years. Quality of life is assessed prior to treatment, prior to each course for 6 courses, then every 2 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
