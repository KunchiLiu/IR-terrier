	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. Chemoprotective drugs such as amifostine may protect normal cells from the side effects of high-dose chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine in protecting from the side effects of peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have high-risk or relapsed solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amifostine to Protect From Side Effects of PSCT in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of amifostine chemoprotection with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation plus chemotherapy in patients with high-risk or relapsed solid tumors or brain tumors. - Determine response or time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of amifostine. Patients are stratified according to age (1 to 18 vs 19 to 45 years). All patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV for 1 week. On day 6 of G-CSF administration, patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest followed by chemotherapy. Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -8 to -6 followed by melphalan IV over 30 minutes on days -5 and -4 and thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2. Patients receive amifostine IV over 5 minutes beginning 30 minutes prior to melphalan and thiotepa administration on days -5 to -1. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of amifostine until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed on day 50; at 3, 6, and 9 months; and at 1, 2, and 3 years post PBSC transplantation. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
