	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the antitumor activity of docetaxel as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. II. Assess the tumor response, toxic effect, and survival rate of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment is repeated every 3 weeks for 3 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months posttreatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
