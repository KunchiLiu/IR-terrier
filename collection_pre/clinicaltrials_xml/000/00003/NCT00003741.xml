	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients with refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Refractory Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma or Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of monoclonal antibody HeFi-1 in patients with CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in this patient population. - Evaluate the efficacy, in terms of correlating immunologic parameters and immunogenicity, of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody HeFi-1 IV over 30 minutes 3 times a week for 2 weeks. Treatment may continue for 2 additional weeks in the absence of anti-HeFi-1 response. Responding patients may continue treatment at monthly intervals for one year. Cohorts of 3-4 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody HeFi-1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 4 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
