	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells in the cervix. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-12 in treating patients who have advanced or recurrent cancer of the cervix.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-12 in Treating Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Cancer of the Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rates, duration of response, and survival in women with advanced, recurrent, or inoperable cervical cancer treated with interleukin-12. II. Determine the toxic effects of systemic interleukin-12 in these patients. III. Correlate response to therapy and survival with the presence or absence of human papilloma virus (HPV), and the specific subtype of HPV, in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients receive induction interleukin-12 IV over 5-20 seconds on day -13 and then daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients (39 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 26 months.</detailed_description>
