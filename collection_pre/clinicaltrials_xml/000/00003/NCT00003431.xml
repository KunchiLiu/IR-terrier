	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Flt3L may stimulate a person's immune system and help kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of flt3L given to patients before undergoing surgery to remove metastases from colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flt3L in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering flt3 ligand to patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer prior to surgical resection. OUTLINE: Patients receive flt3 ligand subcutaneously for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest. This course of therapy may be repeated for a total of 3 courses. Leukapheresis is performed on day 15 of the last course of Flt3 ligand. Patients undergo restaging and metastasis resection. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months for the second year, and yearly thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 12 patients in 1 year.</detailed_description>
