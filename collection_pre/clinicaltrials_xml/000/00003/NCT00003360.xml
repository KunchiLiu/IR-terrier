	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and deliver tumor-killing substances, such as radioactive iodine, to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody in treating patients with advanced colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody in Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Define the toxicity and determine the maximum tolerated dose of iodine I 131 humanized monoclonal antibody A33 (131I-huAb A33) in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. II. Describe pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of 131I-huAb A33 by external imaging in these patients. III. Determine the effect of human antihuman antibody response on pharmacokinetics and targeting of 131I-huAb A33 in this patient population. IV. Determine whether the dose planning methodology used here can adequately and safely be applied to routine radioimmunotherapy planning. OUTLINE: Patients receive iodine I 131 humanized monoclonal antibody A33 (131I-huAb A33) by IV infusion over 20 minutes every 6-8 days for up to 8 weeks (depending on dosage). Patients receive a minimum of 6 weeks of treatments. In the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, patients are retreated no sooner than 6 weeks after the previous course. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 131I-huAb A33 to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for 6 weeks after the last treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 3-24 patients accrued into this study over 16 months.</detailed_description>
