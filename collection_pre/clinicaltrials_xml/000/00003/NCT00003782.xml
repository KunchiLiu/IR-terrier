	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving combination chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells remaining following surgery. It is not yet known which regimen of combination chemotherapy is more effective in treating breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of different regimens of combination chemotherapy in treating women who have undergone surgery for stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Women With Stage I, Stage II, or Stage IIIA (cT1-3, N0-1, M0) Breast Cancer and Positive Axillary Lymph Nodes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the efficacy of adjuvant doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel given concurrently vs adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel, in terms of overall survival and disease-free survival, of women with breast cancer and positive axillary lymph nodes. - Compare the efficacy of adjuvant doxorubicin and docetaxel vs regimens containing cyclophosphamide in these patients. - Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. (Quality of life substudy closed to accrual as of 7/20/01.) - Compare the differences in amenorrhea in premenopausal women in each treatment arm and its relationship to symptoms, quality of life (quality of life substudy closed to accrual as of 7/20/01), disease-free survival, and overall survival. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, number of positive nodes (1-3 vs 4-9 vs at least 10), sequential tamoxifen or anastrozole administration (yes vs no), and type of prior surgery and radiotherapy plan (mastectomy with no local or regional radiotherapy vs mastectomy with local and/or regional radiotherapy vs lumpectomy with local radiotherapy vs lumpectomy with local and regional radiotherapy). Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms. - Arm 1: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes every 21 days for 4 courses. Three weeks after the last dose of this combination, patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour every 21 days for 4 courses. - Arm 2: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes and docetaxel IV over 1 hour every 21 days for 4 courses. - Arm 3: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes, cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes, and docetaxel IV over 1 hour every 21 days for 4 courses. Patients in all arms who are estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive receive oral tamoxifen daily for 5 years beginning within 3-12 weeks of completion of chemotherapy. Patients who are postmenopausal may receive alternative hormonal therapy at the discretion of the treating physician. Some patients may receive postmastectomy radiotherapy on SWOG-S9927 or NCIC-MA.20 after recovery from chemotherapy. Quality of life and menstrual history are assessed before randomization, on day 1 of course 4, and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. (Quality of life substudy closed to accrual as of 7/20/01.) Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5,300 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast Confined to the breast and ipsilateral axilla on clinical exam Stage I, II, or IIIA (cT13, N01, M0) At least one axillary lymph node with evidence of tumor on histologic exam Sentinel node biopsy allowed if followed by axillary dissection No suspicious palpable nodes in the contralateral axilla or palpable supraclavicular or infraclavicular nodes, unless proven on biopsy to not be involved with tumor No bilateral malignancy or mass in the opposite breast, unless mass is histologically proven to be benign Must have undergone either a prior total mastectomy and axillary dissection (modified radical mastectomy) OR Prior lumpectomy and axillary dissection Patients must receive radiotherapy after randomization (not before) AND after chemotherapy Margins must be clear No ipsilateral lymph nodes that are fixed to one another or to other structures (N2 disease) and/or any positive nonaxillary lymph nodes (intramammary nodes are considered axillary nodes) No histologically evident invasive tumor or ductal carcinoma in situ No diffuse tumors by mammography that would not be surgically amenable to lumpectomy No other dominant mass in the ipsilateral breast remnant unless one of the following is true: Histologically benign Surgically removed with clear margins if malignant No ulceration, erythema, infiltration of the skin or underlying chest wall (complete fixation), peau d'orange, or skin edema of any magnitude Tethering or dimpling of the skin or nipple inversion allowed No metastatic disease Skeletal pain allowed if bone scan negative for metastases Hormone receptor status: Estrogen and progesterone status determined PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: greater than or equal to 18 years Sex: Female Menopausal status: Not specified Performance status: Not specified Life expectancy: At least 10 years, excluding diagnosis of cancer Hematopoietic: Absolute neutrophil
