	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of E7070 in treating patients who have solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>E7070 in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of E7070 in patients with solid tumors. II. Assess the qualitative and quantitative toxicity in terms of predictability, duration, intensity, onset, reversibility, and dose relationship of this treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Determine a safe dose for phase II evaluation. IV. Assess the pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in these patients. V. Determine any possible antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive E7070 IV over 1 hour once every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of E7070 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
