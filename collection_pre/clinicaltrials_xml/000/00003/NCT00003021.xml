	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of bizelesin in treating patients who have advanced cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bizelesin in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bizelesin in patients with advanced cancer. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this therapy in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this therapy in these patients. IV. Determine the recommended dose of this drug for phase II trials. V. Determine the antitumor effects of this therapy in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive bizelesin IV on day 1. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bizelesin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
