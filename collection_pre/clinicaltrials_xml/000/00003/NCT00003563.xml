	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Gadolinium texaphyrin may increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy by making tumor cells more sensitive to radiation. It is not yet known whether giving gadolinium texaphyrin with radiation therapy is more effective than radiation therapy alone in treating brain metastases. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy with or without gadolinium texaphyrin in treating patients who have brain metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Plus Gadolinium Texaphyrin in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of gadolinium texaphyrin administered prior to whole brain radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases. II. Compare the efficacy and toxicity of whole brain radiotherapy with or without gadolinium texaphyrin in these patients. III. Assess the quality of life of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, two stage, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to RTOG recursive partitioning analysis class (RPA class 1 vs class 2) and tumor type (breast vs lung vs other). Stage 1 (lead-in): All patients receive gadolinium texaphyrin IV over 5-10 minutes on the 10 days that they receive radiotherapy. Approximately 2-5 hours later, patients undergo whole brain radiotherapy. Stage 2 (randomization): Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients in arm I undergo whole brain radiotherapy for 10 days. Patients in arm II receive gadolinium texaphyrin and radiotherapy as in stage 1. Quality of life is assessed on days 10 and 28, then monthly for 5 months, and then every 3 months thereafter. Patients are followed at day 28, then monthly for 5 months, and then every 3 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: The lead-in phase will accrue at least 25-30 patients and the randomization phase will accrue 400 patients (200/arm) over a 12 month period.</detailed_description>
