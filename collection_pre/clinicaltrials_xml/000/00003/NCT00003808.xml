	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of theophylline in treating patients who have in situ, stage I, or stage II chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Theophylline in Treating Patients With In Situ, Stage I, or Stage II Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate in asymptomatic patients with stage 0, I, or II B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with theophylline. II. Determine the toxicity of this treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral theophylline daily. Daily treatment continues for a maximum of 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study over approximately 10 months.</detailed_description>
