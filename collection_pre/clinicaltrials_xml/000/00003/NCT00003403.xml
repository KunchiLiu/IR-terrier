	<brief_title>GPX-100 in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of GPX-100 in outpatients with incurable, solid tumors who are not candidates for effective systemic therapy. II. Evaluate and quantify the toxicity of GPX-100 in this patient population. III. Identify any changes in disease status in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter, dose escalation study. Patients receive GPX-100 IV once every 3 weeks. Patients receive 2 courses of treatment in the absence of disease progression or dose limiting toxicity. Treatment may continue for up to 6 courses (4 courses with prior doxorubicin) in patients with responding or non-progressing disease. One patient is entered at each of the first 3 dose levels. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are entered at subsequent dose levels. The maximum tolerated dose of GPX-100 is defined as the dose at which no more than 2 instances of dose limiting toxicity are observed in 6 patients. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
