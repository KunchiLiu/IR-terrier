	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of aminocamptothecin in treating patients with stage III, stage IV, or recurrent kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aminocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, duration of response, and survival of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion. II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of aminocamptothecin in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion intravenously for 120 hours weekly for 2 weeks followed by 1 week of rest. Courses are repeated every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and yearly thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-29 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
