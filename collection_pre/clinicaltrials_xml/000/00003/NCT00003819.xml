	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy given with QS21 in treating patients who have progressive prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Plus QS21 in Treating Patients With Progressive Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the optimal dose of Thompson-Friedenreich [TF(c)]-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) conjugate plus adjuvant QS21 that induces an antibody response in patients with prostate cancer. II. Determine the safety of the TF(c)-KLH conjugate prepared using an MBS heterobifunctional linker plus QS21. III. Assess postimmunization changes in prostate specific antigen levels and other objective parameters of disease in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive TF(c)-KLH conjugate with adjuvant QS21 subcutaneously weekly for 3 weeks, then once during weeks 7 and 19. Cohorts of 5 patients each receive escalating doses of TF(c)-KLH vaccine until the optimal dose, based on antibody response, is reached. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, then every 3 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
