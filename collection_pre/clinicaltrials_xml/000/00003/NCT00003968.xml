	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 in treating patients who have metastatic kidney cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bryostatin 1 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate to bryostatin 1 in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. II. Assess the toxicities of this treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Determine the time to disease progression in patients receiving this treatment regimen. IV. Determine the overall survival of this patient population treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progresssion. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
