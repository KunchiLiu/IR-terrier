	<brief_title>Genetic Study in Patients With Stage II or Stage III Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the adverse prognostic significance of 8p allelic imbalance (AI) in patients with colon cancer. - Determine if patient prognosis is dependent on the region of 8p AI. - Perform fine mapping studies to further localize the putative tumor suppressor gene(s) on 8p. - Perform multicolor FISH to examine the role that 8p loss and 8q gain play in the prognosis of patients whose tumors exhibit 8p AI. OUTLINE: Matched normal and tumor DNA is analyzed for 8p allelic imbalance with at least 8 markers: D8S262 and D8S1825 localized to 8p23, D8S254 and D8S261 at 8p22, D8S560 and D8S136 at 8p21, and D8S1820 and D8S283 at 8p12. Normal/tumor tissue pairs are used for fine mapping studies.</detailed_description>
