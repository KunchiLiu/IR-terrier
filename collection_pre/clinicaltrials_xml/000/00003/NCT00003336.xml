	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Umbilical cord blood transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy and kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well umbilical cord blood transplantation works in treating patients with severe aplastic anemia, malignant thymoma, or myelodysplasia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Of Unrelated UCB Transplant for Non-Malignant Hematologic Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the rates of durable engraftment in patients with severe aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, inborn errors of metabolism, or inherited hematopoietic disorders, refractory to medical management, who are undergoing high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by unrelated cord blood (UCB) transplantation. - Evaluate the rate and quality of immunologic reconstitution in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to weight (under 45 kg vs over 45 kg). Patients receive high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy as a conditioning regimen beginning 6-9 days before the umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT). The regimen varies according to the underlying cause of the anemia, but could include busulfan, cyclophosphamide or melphalan, anti-thymocyte globulin or methylprednisolone, and/or radiation therapy. One day after the conditioning regimen is completed, patients receive the UCBT. Patients are followed weekly for 3 months, at 6 months, then every 6 months for 2.5 years, then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4-90 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.</detailed_description>
