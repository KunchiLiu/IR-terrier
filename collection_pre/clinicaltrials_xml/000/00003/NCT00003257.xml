	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Inserting the gene for p53 into a person's tumor may improve the body's ability to fight cancer or make the cancer more sensitive to chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy in treating patients who have recurrent head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the objective response rate of Ad5CMV-p53 in patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. II. Evaluate the duration of response, time to disease progression, and overall survival of these patients after this treatment. III. Evaluate the effectiveness of Ad5CMV-p53 in reducing cancer morbidity (pain assessment, analgesic consumption, and Karnofsky performance status). IV. Assess the quality of life of these patients receiving this treatment. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open label study. All patients receive direct intratumoral injections of Ad5CMV-p53 on days 1, 2, and 3 of each 4-week treatment course. Patients are treated for at least 2 courses barring local disease progression or unacceptable adverse events; patients with responding or stable disease receive a maximum of 12 courses. Patients are evaluated for safety 4 weeks from the completion of the last treatment. Quality of life is assessed before, during, and after treatment. Patients are followed every 2 months for up to 18 months or until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 39 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
