	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab in treating patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Hodgkin's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate (complete or partial) to rituximab in previously untreated patients with stage III or IV CD20+ B-cell follicular small cleaved cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine the response rate (complete or partial) to rituximab in patients with relapsed CD20+ Hodgkin's disease. III. Determine the time to progression and time to chemotherapy in these patients after treatment with rituximab. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (follicular small cleaved cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma vs relapsed Hodgkin's disease). Patients receive rituximab IV over 4-6 hours on day 1 weekly for 4 weeks. Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, then every 6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-32 patients will be accrued for each arm of this study within 7-10.5 months.</detailed_description>
