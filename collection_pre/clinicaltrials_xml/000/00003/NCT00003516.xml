	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston therapy in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 capsules in patients with stage III or IV adenocarcinoma of the prostate by determining the proportion of patients who experience an objective response. - Evaluate the adverse effects of and tolerance to this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1 capsules 6 to 7 times a day until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumors are measured every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
