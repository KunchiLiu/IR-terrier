	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating patients with recurrent or refractory oligodendroglioma after previous chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or biological therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Oligodendroglioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in patients with recurrent or refractory oligodendroglioma. - Describe response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1 by intravenous injection 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 3 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional 8 months after reaching CR. Tumors are measured every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for the second year, every 3-4 months for the third and fourth years, every 4-6 months for the fifth year, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued into this study.</detailed_description>
