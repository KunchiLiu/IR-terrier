	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antibiotics may decrease the side effects of neutropenia and fever caused by chemotherapy. Colony-stimulating factors such as G-CSF may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether antibiotic therapy plus G-CSF is more effective than antibiotic therapy alone for treating side effects caused by chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy with or without G-CSF in treating children who have neutropenia and fever that are caused by chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antibiotic Therapy With or Without G-CSF in Treating Children With Neutropenia and Fever Caused by Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether filgrastim (G-CSF) used in addition to standard antibiotic therapy accelerates time to resolution of febrile neutropenia in children receiving chemotherapy. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive standard antibiotic therapy. - Arm II: Patients receive treatment as in arm I. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV once a day until at least 2 consecutive afebrile days have passed and absolute neutrophil count is at least 500/mm3. Patients are followed for 3 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
