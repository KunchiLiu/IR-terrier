	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug with surgery may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with docetaxel and cisplatin followed by surgery in treating patients with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Followed by Surgery in Treating Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy and toxic effects of docetaxel plus cisplatin in patients with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. II. Assess the clinical and pathological response rate to this therapy in this patient population. III. Compare the benefit of surgery in terms of overall survival of responding and nonresponding patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive infusions of docetaxel over 1 hour on day 1, followed by infusions of cisplatin over 1 hour on days 1-2. Treatment is repeated for three 21 day courses. Patients undergo tumor resection and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Patients are to receive postoperative radiotherapy within 4 weeks of resection if the tumor reaches the resection margins and/or the first mediastinal lymph node levels are involved. Patients will be followed until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 5-40 patients will be accrued within 3 years.</detailed_description>
