	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Low-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in patients with serious or immediately life-threatening low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Describe the response, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1 6 times per day until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity. After 12 months, patients with responding or stable disease may continue treatment. Tumors are measured every 8 weeks for the first 6 months, every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for years 3 and 4, and yearly for years 5 and 6. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven stage II, III, or IV low grade nonHodgkin's lymphoma that is unlikely to respond to existing therapy or for which no established therapy exists NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology. PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: Karnofsky 60100% Life expectancy: At least 2 months Hematopoietic: WBC greater than 2,000/mm^3 Platelet count greater than 20,000/mm^3 Hepatic: Bilirubin normal Renal: Creatinine normal No history of renal conditions that contraindicate high dosages of sodium Cardiovascular: No hypertension No history of congestive heart failure No history of other cardiovascular conditions that contraindicate high dosages of sodium Other: Not pregnant or nursing Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 4 weeks after study No serious active infections PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: At least 4 weeks since immunotherapy and recovered No concurrent immunomodulating agents (e.g., interferon, interleukin2) Chemotherapy: At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas) and recovered Endocrine therapy: At least 4 weeks since prior corticosteroids No concurrent corticosteroids Radiotherapy: At least 8 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery: Not specified Other: No prior antineoplaston therapy No other concurrent antineoplastic agents No concurrent antibiotics, antifungals, or antivirals</criteria>
