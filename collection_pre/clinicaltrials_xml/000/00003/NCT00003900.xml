	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining irinotecan and docetaxel in treating patients who have recurrent or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan With Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response rate of previously treated patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer after treatment with irinotecan and docetaxel. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the overall survival in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes immediately followed by docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment is repeated every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years or until death.</detailed_description>
