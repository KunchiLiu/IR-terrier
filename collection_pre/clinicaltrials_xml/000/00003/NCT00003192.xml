	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of aminocamptothecin in treating patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent cancer of the stomach or esophagus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aminocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Stomach Cancer or Cancer of the Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate of a 120 hour continuous infusion of aminocamptothecin (9-AC) in chemotherapy naive patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction. II. Characterize the nature of the toxicity of 9-AC on this schedule in this patient population. III. Determine the duration of response, time to progression, and survival of this patient population. IV. Study the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 9-AC on this schedule in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive intravenous aminocamptothecin by continuous infusion over 120 hours on days 1-5 and 8-12 followed by 1 week of rest for a 3 week cycle. Therapy continues for a minimum of 6 weeks (2 full cycles) unless there are unacceptable toxic effects or rapid disease progression. Dose escalation may occur in patients who complete 3 cycles of therapy without unacceptable toxicity. All patients will be followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 14-40 patients within 18 months.</detailed_description>
