	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether four-drug combination chemotherapy is more effective than two-drug combination chemotherapy in treating bladder cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two combination chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the recurrence rates and overall survival of patients treated with postoperative adjuvant methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin (M-VAC) to those treated with combination paclitaxel and carboplatin for muscle invasive bladder cancer at particularly high risk of relapse. II. Compare the relative toxicities of postoperative M-VAC versus those encountered with postoperative paclitaxel and carboplatin. III. Compare the quality of life scores during and following completion of treatment of patients in these two treatment arms. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by N stage (N0 vs N+) and performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to receive methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (arm I) or paclitaxel and carboplatin (arm II). Arm I: Patients receive methotrexate IV push on days 1, 15, and 22; vinblastine IV push on days 2, 15, and 22; doxorubicin IV push on day 2; and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses. Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on days 1 followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses. Quality of life assessments are completed pretreatment, prior to course 3, 6 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy, and at 6, 12, and 24 months from the end of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months until year 2, every 6 months for years 2-5, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 490 patients accrued into this study within 2.6 years.</detailed_description>
