	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of T138067 sodium in treating patients with advanced refractory cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T138067 Sodium in Treating Patients With Advanced Refractory Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of T138067 sodium that can be given to patients with advanced refractory cancer on a 28-day schedule and establish a dose for further study. II. Evaluate the safety and dose limiting toxicity of T138067 sodium in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters after a single intravenous dose of this agent in these patients. IV. Obtain safety data and preliminary efficacy information after repetition of single doses of T138067 sodium in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive T138067 sodium by IV over 3 hours. Patients may be retreated every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses (6 months total) in the absence of disease progression or dose limiting toxicity (DLT). At least 3 patients are treated at each dose level in the absence of DLT. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose level where 2 of 3-6 patients experience DLT. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-24 patients will be accrued into this study.</detailed_description>
