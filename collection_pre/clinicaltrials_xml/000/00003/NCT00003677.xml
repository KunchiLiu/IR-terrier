	<brief_title>Dolastatin 10 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the antitumor activity of dolastatin 10 in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. II. Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this therapy in these patients. III. Investigate the clinical pharmacology of this treatment. OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive dolastatin 10 IV bolus once every 21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 12-37 patients within 18.5 months.</detailed_description>
