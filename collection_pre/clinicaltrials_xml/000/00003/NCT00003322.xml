	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether intravenous two-drug combination chemotherapy is more effective than intravenous and intraperitoneal infusions of three-drug combination chemotherapy for treating primary peritoneal or stage III epithelial ovarian cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of intravenous two-drug combination chemotherapy with intravenous and intraperitoneal three-drug combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have primary peritoneal or stage III epithelial ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Primary Peritoneal or Stage III Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare pathological response, recurrence-free interval, and survival in patients with optimal stage III epithelial ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal carcinoma receiving intravenous (IV) paclitaxel and cisplatin vs IV paclitaxel and intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin plus IP paclitaxel. II. Compare the toxic effects and complications of these 2 treatment regimens in these patients. III. Determine the frequency and prognostic significance of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in these patients. IV. Determine the effect of non-genetic risk factors on the course of disease in BRCA1- and BRCA2-related ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal carcinoma. V. Compare the quality of life of these patients receiving these treatments. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to gross residual disease (present vs absent) and whether second-look surgery will be performed at the end of treatment (yes vs no). Blood is drawn for BRCA mutation analysis and DNA extraction before the start of chemotherapy, but after randomization. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients in arm I receive IV paclitaxel by 24-hour infusion on day 1 followed by IV cisplatin on day 2. Patients in arm II receive IV paclitaxel by 24-hour infusion on day 1 followed by intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin on day 2, plus IP paclitaxel on day 8. Treatment for both arms repeats every 3 weeks for a total of 6 treatment courses. Following chemotherapy, second look surgery is performed if selected by the patient. Quality-of-life assessments are performed prior to randomization, prior to course 4, 3-6 weeks after the completion of course 6 and prior to second look surgery if selected, 6 months after treatment is completed, and 12 months after treatment is completed. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 384 patients will be accrued for this study within 16 months.</detailed_description>
