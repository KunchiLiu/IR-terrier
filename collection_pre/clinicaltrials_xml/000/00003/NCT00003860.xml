	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility of the administration of intensive chemotherapy with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide followed by peripheral blood stem cell support in patients with small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the rate and duration of response in these patients after this treatment. III. Determine the progression free and overall survival of these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive 4 courses of intensive chemotherapy consisting of ifosfamide IV over 24 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously beginning on day 2 and continuing until blood cell counts recover. Courses repeat every 14 days. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected after course 1. PBSC are reinfused on day 3 of courses 2 and 3. Patients who experience a complete response receive prophylactic cerebral irradiation on day 71. Patients are followed every 2 months for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
