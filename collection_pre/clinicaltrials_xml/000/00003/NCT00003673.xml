	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CMA-676 in treating older patients who have acute myeloid leukemia that has recurred for the first time following at least 3 months of complete remission.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CMA-676 in Treating Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia in First Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy of CMA-676 in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first relapse in terms of the number of patients attaining a complete remission. II. Assess the safety of CMA-676 in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is an open label, single arm, multicenter study. Patients receive 1 course of CMA-676 IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by a 6 hour observation period. Patients may receive 1 additional course of therapy 15 to 28 days later. There is a 28 day follow-up period after the last dose of study medication. Patients are followed for an additional 6 months, then every 3 months for 18 months, and then every 6 months until relapse and/or death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-55 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months. Enrollment will then be extended for up to an additional 55 patients.</detailed_description>
