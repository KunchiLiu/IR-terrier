	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: New imaging procedures such as the use of gadolinium texaphyrin with MRI may improve the ability to detect the extent of gliomas. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gadolinium texaphyrin used with MRI-guided surgery in treating patients with high-grade glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Motexafin Gadolinium With MRI-Guided Surgery in Treating Patients With High-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gadolinium texaphyrin as a tumor retained contrast agent in MRI guided neurosurgery in patients with radiological diagnosis of high grade glioma. I. Determine the intratumoral pharmacology and quantitative pharmacokinetics of gadolinium texaphyrin using MRI imaging in these patients. II. Develop a scale that will relate MRI signal characteristics from intratumoral gadolinium texaphyrin with absolute intratumoral levels of gadolinium texaphyrin in these patients. III. Investigate the distribution of gadolinium texaphyrin in high grade gliomas in comparison with biologically active tumor as delineated by elevated choline-containing material detected by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive gadolinium texaphyrin by IV infusion 20 minutes to 2 hours prior to magnetic resonance imaging and surgery. The maximum tolerated dose for a single dose of gadolinium texaphyrin is determined by cohorts of 3 patients who are treated at one of five escalating doses. Patients in each cohort are followed for a minimum of 4 weeks each before the next cohort begins. If good contrast enhancement is assessed at the fourth dose level (cohort 4), dose escalation stops. Patients are followed at days 1 and 2, at weeks 1, 2, and 4, and at 3 months after surgery. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-18 patients will be accrued into this study.</detailed_description>
