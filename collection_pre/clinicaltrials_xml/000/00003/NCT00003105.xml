	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients with metastatic or locally advanced bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Locally Advanced Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and toxicity of doxorubicin, gemcitabine, and filgrastim (G-CSF) followed by ifosfamide, paclitaxel, cisplatin, and G-CSF in patients with metastatic or locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium. - Determine the efficacy of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine. Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 30 minutes and gemcitabine IV on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 3-11. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 5 courses. After completion of the fifth course, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, and G-CSF SC daily on days 6-17. Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks for 4 courses. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are treated at the MTD. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20 patients will be accrued for phase I and a maximum of 10 patients will be accrued for phase II within 2-3 years.</detailed_description>
