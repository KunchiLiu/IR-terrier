	<brief_summary>Hyperthermia therapy may kill prostate cancer cells by heating them to several degrees above body temperature. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining hyperthermia with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of hyperthermia when combined with radiation therapy and in some patients hormonal therapy to control prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperthermia Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Nonmetastatic Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of hyperthermia (heat treatments produced by sound waves) when combined with radiation therapy and in some patients hormonal therapy to control prostate cancer. Hyperthermia refers to the use of temperatures 42 oC (107-6oF) or higher to treatment malignant tumors. Laboratory and some clinical reports have demonstrated a tumor killing effect if tumors are heated to 43oC (109oF) for 30-60 minutes. Many studies have shown that hyperthermia improves the killing effect of radiation treatments for many tumors. In clinical studies, the addition of hyperthermia has shown to be beneficial for tumors of the breast, urinary bladder and the head and neck region with combined with radiation therapy. Investigators found an improvement in tumor response rates and a lengthened duration of response. The proposed study is one of the first controlled studies to attempt to prove the usefulness of hyperthermia for patients with prostate cancer.</detailed_description>
