	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating patients who have progressive or recurrent malignant glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and the dose limiting toxicities of irinotecan in patients with progressive or recurrent malignant glioma. II. Define the safety profile of every 3 week dosing of irinotecan in these patients. III. Characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients. IV. Assess evidence of antitumor activity in these patients. V. Determine the efficacy of irinotecan in these patients as measured by 6 month progression-free survival and objective tumor response. VI. Evaluate further the safety profile of irinotecan in these patients during phase II study. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs)(yes vs no). Group A (without EIAEDs): Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1, followed by up to 3 weeks of rest. Group B (with EIAEDs): Patients receive the same treatment but dose escalation is performed in cohorts of 3 patients. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose below that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. The Phase I MTD is the starting dose recommended for use in the Phase II portion of the study. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, then every 6 months until disease progression. Patients are then followed every 4 months for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 patients will be accrued for phase I within 10 months. A total of 48 patients will be accrued for phase II within 6-8 months.</detailed_description>
