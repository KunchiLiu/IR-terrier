	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine, fluorouracil-uracil and leucovorin in treating patients who have advanced cancer that has not responded to previous therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy In Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated doses of gemcitabine, fluorouracil-uracil (UFT), and leucovorin calcium in patients with advanced refractory cancer. - Assess the toxicity of this combination regimen in this patient population. - Evaluate this regimen in terms of response rate, response duration, and overall survival in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of gemcitabine and fluorouracil-uracil. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients receive oral leucovorin calcium immediately followed by oral fluorouracil-uracil (UFT) three times a day on days 1-21. Courses are repeated every 28 days. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine and UFT until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
