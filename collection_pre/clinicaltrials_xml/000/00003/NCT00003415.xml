	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Chemoprotective drugs such as amifostine may protect normal cells from the side effects of chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine plus topotecan in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amifostine Plus Topotecan in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the hematologic and cytogenetic response to treatment with amifostine plus topotecan in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. II. Evaluate the toxic effects of this treatment in these patients. III. Evaluate the effects of this treatment on bone marrow recovery in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan. Patients receive amifostine IV followed by topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 every 4-8 weeks for at least two courses. Patients who are responding after two courses of induction receive maintenance courses every 6-8 weeks for up to ten courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at each dose level of topotecan. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 26 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
