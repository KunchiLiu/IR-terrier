	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as genetic testing, may improve the ability to detect acute myeloid leukemia and determine the extent of disease. PURPOSE: Diagnostic study to try to detect changes in the genes of patients who have acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Study of Gene Alterations in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the frequency of partial tandem duplication of ALL1 (MLL) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). - Determine the predictive value of partial tandem duplication of ALL1 to identify a subset of AML patients who have a short duration of complete remission. OUTLINE: All samples are obtained from specimens collected on CALGB-9665. No additional blood or bone marrow samples are collected. Samples are examined by Southern blot analysis for gene rearrangement at 11q23. Samples showing evidence of ALL1 gene rearrangement are further analyzed by reverse transcription PCR amplification and/or cytogenetic analysis to detect partial tandem duplication of ALL1.</detailed_description>
