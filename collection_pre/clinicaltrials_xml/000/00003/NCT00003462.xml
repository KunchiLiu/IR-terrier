	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving drugs into the thin space between the lining of the spinal cord and brain may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of intrathecal busulfan in treating patients with recurrent, refractory, or metastatic leptomeningeal tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrathecal Busulfan in Treating Patients With Recurrent, Refractory, or Metastatic Leptomeningeal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intrathecal busulfan by a limited escalation dosage schedule in patients with recurrent or refractory leptomeningeal tumors. - Determine the cerebrospinal fluid and serum pharmacokinetics of busulfan administered via intralumbar or intraventricular routes in these patients. OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation study. Patients receive intrathecal busulfan via intralumbar or intraventricular routes twice a week for 2 weeks (4 treatments). Any patient with objective or significant clinical response may continue treatment by receiving the same dose once a week for 2 consecutive weeks, once a week every other week for 3 weeks (2 treatments), and then once a month thereafter until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of intrathecal busulfan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 12 weeks for 1 year or until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.</detailed_description>
