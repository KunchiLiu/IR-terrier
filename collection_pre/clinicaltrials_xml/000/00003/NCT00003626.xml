	<brief_title>Dolastatin 10 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Previous Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer treated with dolastatin 10. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive dolastatin 10 IV bolus every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
