	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy and chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not known whether receiving radiation therapy plus cisplatin is more effective than receiving radiation therapy plus fluorouracil in treating patients with cancer of the cervix. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus cisplatin or fluorouracil in treating patients with primary stage IIB, stage IIIB, or stage IVA cancer of the cervix.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With or Without Cisplatin or Fluorouracil in Treating Patients With Cancer of the Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the progression-free survival and survival of patients with advanced cervical cancer limited to the pelvis receiving either radiotherapy alone, or radiotherapy plus weekly cisplatin, or radiotherapy plus prolonged venous infusion (PVI) of fluorouracil. [Radiotherapy alone regimen closed 8/18/98] II. Determine the relative toxic effects of radiation therapy plus chemotherapy with either weekly cisplatin or PVI fluorouracil compared to radiation alone. [Radiotherapy alone regimen closed 8/18/98] IV. Compare the progression-free survival and survival of patients with advanced cervical cancer limited to the pelvis and who smoke at the time of diagnosis versus non-smokers and those who smoke during radiation therapy versus those who quit. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by stage, performance of para-aortic lymphadenectomy, and brachytherapy method (HDR vs LDR). Prior to treatment patients complete a questionnaire regarding past and present smoking history and exposure to secondhand smoke. In arm I, patients undergo external radiation therapy to the pelvis once daily 5 times a week for 5 weeks. Then, patients receive either low dose rate or high dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy in one or two applications or 5 fractions once or twice a week, respectively. If intracavitary radiation therapy cannot be performed, then shrinking field technique is executed. In addition, patients receive parametrial boost once daily for 3 to 5 days during intracavitary brachytherapy. Concurrently, patients receive IV cisplatin once a week for 5 weeks beginning on day 1 of external radiation therapy and once during the parametrial boost. Patients in arm II receive external radiation therapy and brachytherapy as previously described. [Arm II closed 8/18/98] In arm III, patients undergo external radiation therapy as described in arm I. In addition, patients receive prolonged venous infusion (PVI) fluorouracil daily for 5 days during external beam radiation therapy (whole pelvis and parametrial boost). If all 6 courses of cisplatin or fluorouracil cannot be administered during external radiation therapy, then the sixth course of chemotherapy will be given during brachytherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 3 years, then annually until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue a maximum of 870 patients over 66 months.</detailed_description>
