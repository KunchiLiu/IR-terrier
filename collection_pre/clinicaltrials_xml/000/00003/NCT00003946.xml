	<brief_title>Danazol in Treating Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the antitumor activity of danazol in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. II. Determine the nature and toxicity of danazol in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral danazol 4 times per day for at least 4 weeks. Patients with partial response, complete response, or stable disease continue treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-56 patients will be accrued for this study within 26 months.</detailed_description>
