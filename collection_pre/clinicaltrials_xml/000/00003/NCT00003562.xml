	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining docetaxel and carboplatin in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Plus Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effectiveness of low dose docetaxel and carboplatin by response rate, response duration, and time to progression in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the side effects and toxicity profile of docetaxel when given in combination with carboplatin in these patients. OUTLINE: This is open label study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes once a week for 4 weeks. Patients receive at least 2 courses (8 weeks) of treatment. Courses are further repeated in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 20-38 patients accrued into this study.</detailed_description>
