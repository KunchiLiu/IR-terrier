	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as hu14.18-interleukin-2 fusion protein use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of hu14.18-interleukin-2 fusion protein in treating children who have refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma or other tumors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of hu14.18-interleukin-2 fusion protein in children with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma or other GD2-positive tumors. - Determine the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of the fusion protein in these patients. - Determine the effect of the fusion protein on systemic immune modulation in these patients. - Quantitate the antifusion protein antibodies in patients treated with fusion protein. - Evaluate antitumor responses resulting from this fusion protein regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive hu14.18-interleukin-2 (hu14.18-IL2) fusion protein IV over 4 hours once daily on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
