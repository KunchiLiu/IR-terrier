	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of UCN-01 in treating patients with advanced cancer that has not responded to previous treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>UCN-01 in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity profile, dose limiting toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of UCN-01 administered as a 3, 2, or 1 hour infusion every 4 weeks for patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies and chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. II. Investigate the pharmacokinetics and cellular pharmacodynamics of UCN-01 administered on this schedule in these patients. III. Obtain preliminary evidence of the antitumor activity of UCN-01 in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is dose escalation study. Patients receive UCN-01 by intravenous infusions over 3, 2 or 1 hour(s) every 4 weeks. The first dose level is administered over 3 hours, the next dose level is administered over 2 hours, and the next and subsequent dose levels are administered over 1 hour. One patient is treated at each dose level until unacceptable toxicity is observed. An additional 2 patients are then entered at that dose level. If dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is experienced in 1 of 3 patients, 3 additional patients are accrued at that dose level. If 2 or more patients experience DLT, the maximum tolerated dose has been surpassed and a total of 6 patients must be treated at the previous dose level. If no patients develop DLT, the dose is escalated in successive cohorts of 3 patients per dose level. Patients are followed for 4 weeks after each drug administration before subsequent patients can be entered at the next higher dose level. Patients are followed for 2 months after their last dose of UCN-01. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36 patients will be accrued into this study over 18 months.</detailed_description>
