	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bexarotene in treating patients who have metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bexarotene in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of oral bexarotene (LGD1069) at two different dose levels in patients with advanced breast cancer. II. Assess the safety and tolerability of this treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Evaluate the efficacy of oral bexarotene in terms of induction of differentiation and decreased aberrant cell proliferation in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior therapy for metastatic disease. Patients are randomized to one of two dose levels. All patients receive oral bexarotene once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every week for the first month, at weeks 6 and 8, then monthly thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 84-180 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
