	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of topotecan in treating children who have recurrent, relapsed, or refractory sarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy in Treating Children With Recurrent or Refractory Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate in children with recurrent or refractory brain tumors, sarcomas, or neuroblastomas treated with topotecan. (Brain tumor and neuroblastoma strata closed to accrual effective 07/02/2001) II. Assess the toxicity of this regimen in a larger group of patients treated at the currently defined maximum tolerated dose. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive topotecan IV continuously on days 1-21. Treatment continues at least every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months.</detailed_description>
