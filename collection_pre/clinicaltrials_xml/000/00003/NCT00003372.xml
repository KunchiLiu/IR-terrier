	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of topotecan in treating patients with recurrent brain tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topotecan in Treating Patients With Recurrent Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of topotecan in patients with recurrent anaplastic oligodendroglioma or anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of topotecan in this patient population on this schedule. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive intravenous topotecan over 30 minutes daily for 5 days every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be followed every 3 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 evaluable patients will be accrued within 2-3 years.</detailed_description>
