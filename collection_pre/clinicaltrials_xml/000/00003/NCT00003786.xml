	<brief_title>Irofulven in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate of patients with metastatic or locally recurrent adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum treated with 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (MGI-114). II. Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Study pharmacokinetics of MGI-114 in these patients. IV. Determine the relationship between pharmacokinetics of MGI-114 and clinical outcomes including toxicity and response to therapy in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive 6-hyroxymethylacylfulvene (MGI-114) IV over 5 minutes daily for 5 days. Courses are repeated every 4 weeks. Treatment continues for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxic effects or disease progression. Patients are followed until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12 months.</detailed_description>
