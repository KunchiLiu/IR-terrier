	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Umbilical cord blood transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy or radiation therapy that was used to kill cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of umbilical cord blood transplantation plus combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have hematologic cancer or nonmalignant hematologic disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer or Nonmalignant Hematologic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of umbilical cord blood transplantation, as measured by durable neutrophil engraftment, in patients with malignant or nonmalignant hematological disease. - Determine the disease-free survival and long-term survival in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the incidence of neutrophil engraftment, primary and secondary graft failure, platelet engraftment, and RBC engraftment in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, complications (infection, veno-occlusive disease, interstitial pneumonitis), relapse, other malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and posttransplantation myelodysplasia in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the immune reconstitution in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease group (malignant vs nonmalignant). Patients with malignant disease are further stratified according to quality of HLA match (1 or 2/6 vs 3/6 vs 4/6 vs 5/6 or 6/6), cell dose, and age. Patients are assigned to one of three conditioning regimens, depending on disease. - Group A (malignant disease ): Patients undergo total body irradiation (TBI) once on day -8 and twice daily on days -7 to -4. Male patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) undergo radiotherapy boost to testes. Patients receive cyclophosphamide (CTX) IV on days -3 and -2 and methylprednisolone (MePRDL) IV and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) IV on days -3 to -1. - Group B (inborn errors of metabolism/storage disease): Patients receive oral busulfan (BU) every 6 hours on days -6 and -5, CTX IV on days -4 and -3, and MePRDL IV and ATG IV every 12 hours on days -2 and -1. - Group C (other nonmalignant diseases): Patients receive oral BU every 6 hours on days -9 to -6, CTX IV on days -5 to -2, and MePRDL IV and ATG IV on days -3 to -1. Patients in all groups receive cord blood IV over a maximum of 30 minutes on day 0. Patients also receive MePRDL IV with the first half of the infusion administered immediately before the cord blood infusion and filgrastim (G-CSF) IV beginning 4 hours after transplantation and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients are followed at 30, 60, and 90 days; at 6 months; and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 390 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.</detailed_description>
