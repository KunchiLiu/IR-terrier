	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well gemcitabine and cisplatin work in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Plus Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the response rate of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin. - Assess toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 29-38 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
