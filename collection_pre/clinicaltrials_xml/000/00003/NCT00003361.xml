	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of decitabine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) to decitabine. OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by disease (low risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) vs. high risk MDS vs. chronic myelomonocytic leukemia). Patients receive decitabine as a 4 hour infusion every 8 hours on days 1-3. Treatment continues every 6-8 weeks for 4-6 courses. Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 75 patients will be accrued for this study over 1 year.</detailed_description>
