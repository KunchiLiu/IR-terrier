	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether cisplatin, etoposide, and paclitaxel are more effective than cisplatin and etoposide alone in treating patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of cisplatin plus etoposide with or without paclitaxel in treating patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin Plus Etoposide With or Without Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether the addition of paclitaxel to standard chemotherapy treatment comprising etoposide and cisplatin improves the survival of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. II. Compare the tumor response rate and failure-free survival of these patients treated with these regimens. III. Describe and compare the toxic effects associated with these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to performance status and gender. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and cisplatin and etoposide as in arm I. Patients then receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 4-18. Treatment repeats in both arms every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at least every 2 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, and then at least every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 670 patients (335 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 16 months.</detailed_description>
