	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Umbilical cord blood transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy and kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying allogeneic umbilical cord blood transplantation to see how well it works when given with chemotherapy or radiation therapy in treating patients with high-risk hematologic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation in Treating Patients With High-Risk Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the rates of hematologic and immune reconstitution in patients with high risk hematologic malignancies who are undergoing high dose chemoradiotherapy followed by unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation. - Determine the incidence of graft-versus-host-disease in this setting. - Describe the incidence of recurrent disease in these patients post UCB transplant. - Describe the incidence of serious infections and secondary lymphoproliferative diseases following transplantation with UCB in these patients. - Determine specifically whether larger recipients can be durably engrafted with unrelated UCB, and determine whether nucleated cell or progenitor cell content of the graft is predictive of hematological engraftment. OUTLINE: Patients may undergo a back-up peripheral blood stem cell collection prior to treatment. Patients receive 9 fractions of total body irradiation (TBI) on days -9 to -5 followed by melphalan IV for three days on days -4 to -2 and antithymocyte globulin IV or methylprednisolone IV for three days on days -3 to -1. On day 0, patients receive umbilical cord blood infusion. If TBI is not tolerated, busulfan is substituted and administered orally every 6 hours for 4 days on days -8 to -5. Cyclosporine and methylprednisolone begin on day -2 and continue for 6 months. Patients are followed at least monthly for 1 year, then every 6 months for the second year, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be a maximum of 48 patients accrued into this study over 4 years.</detailed_description>
