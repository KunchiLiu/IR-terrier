	<brief_summary>Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy in treating patients with ovarian cancer that has not responded to previous treatment. Inserting the p53 gene into a person's cancer cells may improve the body's ability to fight cancer or make the cancer cells more sensitive to treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated doses of adenovirus p53 in patients with platinum- and paclitaxel-resistant ovarian epithelial cancer. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Document the observed anti-tumor activity of this regimen in these patients. IV. Evaluate the biological endpoints (e.g., induction of apoptosis, p53 expression) of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients undergo laparoscopy for p53 assessment and catheter placement. Patients receive daily intraperitoneal injections of adenovirus p53 (Ad-p53) for 5 days every 3 weeks. Treatment is repeated every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients each are treated at each dose level of Ad-p53. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicity.</detailed_description>
