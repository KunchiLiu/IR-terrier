	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase III trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating older patients who have solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel in Treating Older Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether there is a relationship between pharmacokinetic measurements of paclitaxel and aging. - Determine whether there is a relationship between the toxic effects of paclitaxel and aging. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age (cohort 1: patients 55 to 64 vs cohort 2: patients 65 to 75 vs cohort 3: patients 75 and over).</detailed_description>
