	<brief_title>High-Dose Melphalan Plus Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Primary Systemic Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the response rate and overall survival of patients with biopsy proven primary amyloidosis following treatment with myeloablative chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell reconstitution. II. Evaluate the toxicity of high dose melphalan in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on day 1 of the peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection period and continuing until PBSC collection is completed. PBSC are collected beginning on day 5 of the collection period and continuing until the final target cell count is reached or for up to a maximum of 7 collections. If sufficient PBSCs are not harvested within a maximum of 7 collections, the patient is removed from the study. Within 30 days of PBSC collection, patients receive melphalan IV on day -1 of the infusion period and PBSC infusion on day 0. The infusion period continues until day 30. Patients receive G-CSF subcutaneously daily starting on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 3 additional years, and yearly thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 33 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.</detailed_description>
