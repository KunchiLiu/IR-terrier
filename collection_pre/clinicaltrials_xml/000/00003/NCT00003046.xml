	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-12 in treating patients with cancer in the abdomen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-12 in Treating Patients With Cancer in the Abdomen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intraperitoneal interleukin-12 in patients with Mullerian carcinoma (closed to accrual as of 8/23/01), gastrointestinal carcinoma, or peritoneal mesothelioma (closed to accrual as of 8/23/01). II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive intraperitoneal interleukin-12 over 30 minutes once weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with stable or responsive disease may receive an additional 6 courses. Patients receive escalating doses of intraperitoneal interleukin-12 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is established, additional patients are accrued to receive interleukin-12 at the recommended dose. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
