	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill acute myeloid leukemia cells. Histamine dihydrochloride may prolong remission and reduce the risk of relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia in remission. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of interleukin-2 plus histamine dihydrochloride in treating patients who have acute myeloid leukemia that is in remission following previous therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 Plus Histamine Dihydrochloride in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of interleukin-2 plus histamine dihydrochloride (Maxamine) vs no further therapy in prolonging the leukemia free survival in patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first or subsequent complete remission (CR) following consolidation therapy. II. Compare the relapse rate, overall survival, and quality of life in this patient population treated with interleukin-2 plus Maxamine vs no further therapy. III. Compare the remission inversion rate in patients in subsequent CR with this treatment regimen vs no further therapy. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, parallel, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to complete remission (first vs subsequent). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Following consolidation chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation, patients receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously followed by histamine dihydrochloride subcutaneously over 5-7 minutes twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 3 courses and then every 9 weeks for 7 courses in the absence of disease relapse or unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive no further therapy following consolidation chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation. Quality of life is assessed prior to study, and at visits 6, 7, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 22. Patients are followed for relapse and survival every 3 months for 2.5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
