	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating patients with cancer of the esophagus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Cancer of the Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Provide antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 as treatment for patients with incurable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. - Describe the response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1 by intravenous injection 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 2 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) continue treatment for at least 8 months beyond CR. Patients achieving a partial response or stable disease continue treatment until disease progression. Tumors are measured every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for the second year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
