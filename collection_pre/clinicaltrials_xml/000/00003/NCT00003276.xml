	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating patients with advanced gallbladder or bile duct cancer that cannot be removed surgically.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Advanced Gallbladder or Bile Duct Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the objective tumor response rate in patients with advanced gallbladder or bile duct tumors treated with irinotecan. II. Evaluate time-to-progression, survival, and toxic effects associated with irinotecan given weekly for 4 weeks every 6 weeks in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive a 90 minute continuous infusion of irinotecan on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for 4 weeks, followed by a 2 week rest period. Courses of treatment are repeated every 42 days. Patients continue treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for the next 4 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 22-40 patients will be accrued for this study over 2-4 years.</detailed_description>
