	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Quality-of-life assessment in cancer survivors may help determine the long-term effects of having had gynecologic cancer and may help improve the quality of life for future cancer survivors. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the quality of life in survivors of gynecologic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality of Life in Survivors of Gynecologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Describe the significant quality of life (QOL) concerns and long term survivorship issues of women diagnosed and treated for early stage ovarian and endometrial cancer five or more years ago. - Identify mechanisms which contribute to a gynecologic cancer survivorship model through comparison and prediction of high versus low QOL associated with long term adjustment and survivorship. Examine social support, coping efforts, self-efficacy, meaning associated with survivorship, performance status, and age at diagnosis as potential predictors. - Identify and compare factors that predict high versus low QOL for women with early stage endometrial cancer completing participation in GOG-99 clinical trial. Conduct exploratory analysis examining long term QOL concerns of survivors randomized to surgery arm with or without radiotherapy. OUTLINE: Patients complete one telephone interview with a professional female interviewer. The interview lasts approximately 60 minutes and is audiotaped. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 197 early stage endometrial cancer survivors and 114 early stage ovarian cancer survivors will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
