	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rebeccamycin analog in treating children who have relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rebeccamycin Analog in Treating Children With Relapsed or Refractory Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate to rebeccamycin analogue in children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Identify and establish in vitro biologic correlates of clinical responses and toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour once on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue up to 30 patients within 1.5 years.</detailed_description>
