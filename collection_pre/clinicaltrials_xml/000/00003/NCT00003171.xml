	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bryostatin 1 in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of bryostatin 1 in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of bryostatin 1. III. Determine the duration of response and survival of patients receiving this therapy. OUTLINE: This is a two stage study. Patients receive bryostatin 1 by continuous infusion over 72 hours every 14 days for 4 cycles. Responding patients may continue treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response receive 2 additional cycles. Patients with no response receive 4 additional cycles. Patients are re-evaluated after every 4 cycles. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 14 to 27 patients will be accrued within 2 years into this 2 stage study.</detailed_description>
