	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vinorelbine in treating children with recurrent or refractory cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vinorelbine in Treating Children With Recurrent or Refractory Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of children with recurrent or refractory malignancies treated with vinorelbine. II. Assess the toxic effects of this drug in these children. OUTLINE: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes weekly on weeks 1-6. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for a total of 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
