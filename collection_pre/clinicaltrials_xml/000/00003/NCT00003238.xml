	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different way to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perillyl alcohol in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy with androgens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perillyl Alcohol in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the clinical effectiveness of oral perillyl alcohol given to patients with androgen independent metastatic prostate cancer. II. Assess the toxicity of this treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral perillyl alcohol 4 times a day for 4 weeks. Patients continue treatment in the absence of severe toxicity and disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for survival after disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 20-40 patients in approximately 2 years.</detailed_description>
