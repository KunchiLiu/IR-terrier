	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have lymphoma or leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Lymphoma or Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficiency of tumor cell removal by immunomagnetic technique in patients with B cell malignancies. II. Determine toxicity of mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) components of enriched CD34+ and depleted B cells in this patient population. III. Compare recovery with the use of this treatment regimen to the use of unmanipulated PBSC or CD34+ PBSC components in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to one of two treatment arms for chemotherapy (chemotherapy protocol following FHCRC-506.2). Patients undergo mobilization and isolation of CD34+ cells as described in FHCRC-506.2. Peripheral blood stem cells are collected by apheresis and the CD34+ cells are isolated using magnetic beads. Monoclonal antibodies to CD19 and CD20 are added to the CD34+ cells to sensitize any remaining tumor cells. Patients undergo transplantation on day 0, according to applicable transplant protocols, one month after mobilization. Some patients may receive posttransplant interleukin-2 after achieving durable engraftment. Patients are followed at day 30, 80, 180, 365, and 395. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
