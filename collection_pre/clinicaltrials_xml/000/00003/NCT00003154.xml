	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of aminocamptothecin in treating patients with stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion (AC/CD) administered as a 120 hour weekly infusion is an effective treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. II. Observe any toxicities associated with this treatment in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive a 120 hour continuous infusion of aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion (AC/CD) once a week for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest. Patients are assessed after every 2 courses of therapy. Treatment with aminocamptothecin continues indefinitely if there is tumor shrinkage or stable disease and no significant toxicity is experienced. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-36 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
