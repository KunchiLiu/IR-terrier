	<brief_summary>Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of O6-benzylguanine and carmustine in treating children who have refractory CNS tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>O6-benzylguanine and Carmustine in Treating Children With Refractory CNS Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and the dose limiting toxicity of carmustine administered after O6-benzylguanine in children with refractory primary CNS tumors. II. Determine a safe and tolerable dose of carmustine administered after O6-benzylguanine to be used in phase II studies. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of O6-benzylguanine and its metabolite, O6-benzyl-8-oxoguanine, in these patients. IV. Seek preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. V. Evaluate the acute and chronic toxicities, and describe cumulative toxicity, in patients treated with multiple courses of this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of carmustine. Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour, then, 1 hour later, carmustine IV is administered over 1 hour. Treatment is repeated every 6 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of carmustine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose level at which fewer than 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT). If myelosuppression is the DLT, stratum 1 is closed and patients are accrued to stratum 2. If neutropenia is the DLT in stratum 2, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 2 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years, then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
