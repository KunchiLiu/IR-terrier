	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining more than one drug and combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy in treating adult patients with brain cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Adult Patients With Brain Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the complete and partial response rate of patients with adult medulloblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, or disseminated ependymoma treated with preradiation combination chemotherapy. - Determine the progression free survival and overall survival of these adult patients treated with combination chemotherapy followed by craniospinal radiation. - Determine the toxic effects associated with this treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours, etoposide IV, and vincristine IV over 1-2 minutes on day 1; etoposide IV and cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days 2-3; filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 4-13; and vincristine IV over 1-2 minutes on day 15. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 4-6 weeks after the last chemotherapy course, patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 to 7 weeks. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5-10 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
