	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of ovarian cancer cells. Hormone therapy using toremifene may fight ovarian cancer by reducing the production of estrogen. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of toremifene in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Toremifene in Treating Patients With Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effects of toremifene in terms of response rate, duration of response, duration of survival, and toxicity in patients with chemotherapy resistant papillary carcinoma of the ovary. - Assess whether a dose response effect is likely for this regimen in these patients. - Assess quality of life of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients receive one of two doses of oral toremifene daily for 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed before therapy and then every 4 weeks during therapy. Patients are followed every 12 weeks until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
