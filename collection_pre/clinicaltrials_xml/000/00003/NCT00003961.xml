	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim, may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of sargramostim after bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sargramostim After Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effect of sargramostim (GM-CSF) on the progression-free 1-year survival of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome who have undergone T-cell-depleted CD34+ augmented allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. OUTLINE: All patients receive elutriated, CD34+ stem cell augmented donor bone marrow according to another protocol on day 0. Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days 5-60. Patients are followed on days 120, 180, 360 and periodically thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-4 years.</detailed_description>
