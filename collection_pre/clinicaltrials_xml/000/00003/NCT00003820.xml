	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab in treating patients who have Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab in Treating Patients With Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the partial and complete response rates in patients with untreated or recurrent/refractory lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with rituximab. - Determine the efficacy of this regimen in terms of duration of disease free survival and time to progression in this patient population. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV over several hours once a week for 4 weeks followed by maintenance rituximab at 6, 12, and 18 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 18 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease that is of Bcell lineage and expresses the CD 20 antigen. Patients are eligible with either untreated disease or refractory/relapsed disease. Patients must be &gt;= 3 years. Patients must have a performance status of 02. Patients must have an ANC &gt; 1500/ml and a platelet count &gt; 50,000/ml. A biopsy or fine needle aspirate sample must show expression of the CD20 antigen on the L adnH cells. Patients must have measurable disease (at least one tumor mass measuring &gt;1.0 cm in largest dimension). Patients must have no evidence of active infection. Patients must read and sign IRB approved informed consent. Adequate renal function as indicated by serum creatinine (Cr) &lt; 1.5X the upper limit of normal. Adequate liver function as indicated by alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, AST, and ALT &lt; 2X upper limit of normal unless related to primary disease. Patients at high risk of HBV infection should be screened prior to enrollment. Concomitant or recent treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Four weeks must pass from radiotherapy or cytotoxic therapy to enroll (six weeks for nitrosourea compounds). Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 4 weeks. Female patients must be of nonchildbearing potential or using adequate contraception with a negative pregnancy test at study entry. Serious nonmalignant disease (e.g., congestive heart failure, or active uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections), or other conditions which, in the opinion of the investigator and/or sponsor, would compromise other protocol objectives. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 halflives (of the study drug with the longest halflife) prior to entry into the study, whichever is longer. Evidence of other active malignancies other than cured carcinomas in situ of the cervix or basal cell carcinoma of the skin. Life expectancy&lt;= 12 weeks. Concurrent treatment with prednisone or other systemic steroid medication. Active HBV infection or hepatitis.</criteria>
