	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy used high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet know whether chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy is more effective than chemotherapy given with radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two different regimens of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients who have unresectable stage I, stage II, or stage III non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Cannot Be Surgically Removed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare survival, disease-free survival, local control, and pattern of recurrence in patients with unresectable stage I, II, or low-volume stage III non-small lung cancer treated with high-dose radiotherapy either preceded by induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin or combined with daily cisplatin. - Compare the acute and late toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. - Determine the quality of life of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to performance status (0 vs 1), TNM stage, and participating center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV over 3-6 hours on day 2. Treatment is repeated once 21 days later. Patients undergo high-dose accelerated conformal radiotherapy beginning on week 9 (day 57), 5 days a week, for 24 fractions, using a concurrent boost technique up to 66 Gy. - Arm II: Patients receive low-dose cisplatin IV followed 1-2 hours later by high-dose accelerated conformal radiotherapy. Treatment continues daily, 5 days a week, for 24 fractions, using a concurrent boost technique up to 66 Gy. Quality of life is assessed before treatment and at weeks 9-11, 19, 27, and 35. Patients are followed at 3 weeks, 6-7 weeks, and then every 8 weeks thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 418 patients (209 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 5 years.</detailed_description>
