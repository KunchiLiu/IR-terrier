	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating adults with newly diagnosed primary malignant glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide in Treating Adults With Newly Diagnosed Primary Malignant Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of temozolomide in adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. - Define the relationship between tumor O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase activity and tumor response in these patients. - Define the relationship between tumor DNA mismatch repair activity and tumor response to temozolomide. OUTLINE: Patients receive temozolomide orally once daily on days 1-5. Treatment courses are repeated every 28 days. In the absence of disease progression and toxicity, patients receive up to 4 courses of treatment prior to radiation therapy. After radiation therapy, patients demonstrating partial or complete response may receive an additional 12 courses of treatment. Patients are followed every 8-12 weeks for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 50 patients.</detailed_description>
