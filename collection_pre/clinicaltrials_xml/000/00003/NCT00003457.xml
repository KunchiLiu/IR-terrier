	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Current therapies for adults with persistent or recurrent brain tumors provide very limited benefit to the patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of adults with persistent or recurrent brain tumors. PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that Antineoplaston therapy has on adults with persistent or recurrent brain tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in adults with persistent or recurrent brain tumors as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial response or stable disease). - To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in adults with persistent or recurrent brain tumors. OVERVIEW: This is a single arm, open-label study in which adults with persistent or recurrent brain tumors receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 months, patients with a complete or partial response or with stable disease may continue treatment. To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued to this study</detailed_description>
