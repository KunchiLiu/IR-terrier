	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of pyrazoloacridine in treating patients who have metastatic skin or eye melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pyrazoloacridine in Treating Patients With Metastatic Skin or Eye Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the antitumor activity of pyrazoloacridine (PZA) in chemotherapy naive patients with metastatic cutaneous or ocular melanoma. - Determine the toxic effects of PZA in this patient population. - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of PZA in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified into cutaneous or ocular melanoma treatment groups. Patients receive pyrazoloacridine IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 28-70 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
