	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs such as epoetin alfa may relieve anemia caused by chemotherapy. The best time for giving epoetin alfa during chemotherapy is not yet known. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of epoetin alfa in treating anemia in patients with lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or multiple myeloma who are receiving chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epoetin Alfa in Treating Anemia in Patients With Lymphoma, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, or Multiple Myeloma and Anemia Caused By Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the hematologic response and transfusion requirements of patients with malignant lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or multiple myeloma with chemotherapy related moderate anemia treated with epoetin alfa. - Determine the effect of moderate anemia on quality of life of these patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate changes in quality of life with changes in anemia associated with treatment with epoetin alfa in these patients. - Determine the effect of changing quality of life on health care resource utilization among these patients treated with epoetin alfa. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are evaluated for anemia during their prescribed chemotherapy regimens at either 3 or 4 week intervals beginning week 3 or 4. Patients with hemoglobin levels of 10.0-12.0 g/dL are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients with hemoglobin levels greater than 12.0 g/dL are not randomized until their hemoglobin levels decrease to 12.0 g/dL or below. - Arm I: Patients immediately receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously each week. - Arm II: Patients are observed for 6-8 weeks and then hemoglobin levels are reevaluated. Patients whose hemoglobin levels decrease below 9.0 g/dL receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously each week. Patients whose hemoglobin levels are at least 9.0 g/dL are observed for another 3-4 weeks and then hemoglobin levels are reevaluated. Patients receive epoetin alfa treatment for up to 15 or 16 weeks. Qualify of life questionnaires are completed every 3 or 4 weeks until week 30 or 32. Patients are followed through week 36. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 275 patients (at least 130 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed nonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or multiple myeloma Low grade, intermediate grade, or high grade (diffuse large cell immunoblastic only) NHL OR Histologically confirmed Hodgkin's disease with prior chemotherapy Evaluable lesion Must be scheduled for at least 1 myelosuppressive cytotoxic regimen (experimental chemotherapy regimens allowed) for at least 46 months No anemia predominantly due to factors other than cancer or chemotherapy (i.e.,iron or folate deficiencies, hemolysis, or gastrointestinal bleeding) NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
