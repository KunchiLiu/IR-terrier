	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether SU-101 is more effective than procarbazine in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of SU-101 with that of procarbazine in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme that has recurred.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SU-101 Compared With Procarbazine in Treating Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the median survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme in first relapse treated with intravenous leflunomide (SU101) administered as a loading dose with weekly maintenance therapy versus oral, single-agent procarbazine administered daily for 28 days every 56 days. II. Compare the median time to progression for these regimens in these patients. III. Assess the objective response of these patients. IV. Assess the safety of SU101 given on this schedule. V. Describe the health-related quality of life of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to performance status (Karnofsky 60-80% vs 90-100%), age (less than 50 vs 50 and over), and time from initial diagnosis to recurrence (6 months or greater vs less than 6 months). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive leflunomide (SU101) IV over 6 hours daily on days 1-4, again 4-8 days later, and weekly thereafter for a total of 4 loading dose infusions and six maintenance infusions in course 1. Patients receive 7 weekly maintenance infusions of SU101 in courses thereafter. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks. Arm II: Patients receive procarbazine orally once or twice daily for 4 weeks. Treatment is repeated every 8 weeks. All patients complete a health-related quality-of-life questionnaire every 8 weeks and at study withdrawal. Treatment courses continue up to a maximum of 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 2 months, beginning 30 days after study completion. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 380 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
