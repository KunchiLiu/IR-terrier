	<brief_title>A Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of Infliximab (Remicade) in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer Related Cachexia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cachexia is a condition that occurs in cancer patients and other chronically ill patients and is characterized by rapid loss of fatty tissue and skeletal muscle. The key feature of this condition is weight loss, but other symptoms, such as anorexia (loss of appetite), fatigue, vomiting and anemia (low numbers of red blood cells) may also occur.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of infliximab, the active ingredient in Remicade, for the treatment of cachexia in pancreatic cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy with gemcitabine. In cycle 1 (8wks), patients will receive weekly infusions of gemcitabine from wk 0 to 6 and infusions of infliximab or placebo at wks 0, 2, and 4. For additional cycles, patients will receive an infusion of gemcitabine for the first 3wks and infliximab or placebo at wk 0 of each 4 wk cycle for a maximum of 5 cycles. Patients with stable disease may receive extended dosing if qualified.Safety evaluations will be performed at specified intervals throughout the study and will consist of laboratory tests, vital signs (such as blood pressure), physical examinations and the occurrence and severity of adverse events as well as other study specific procedures. In cycle 1 (8wks), patients will receive weekly infusions of gemcitabine from wk 0 to 6 and infusions of infliximab or placebo at wks 0, 2, and 4. For additional cycles, patients will receive an infusion of gemcitabine for the first 3wks and infliximab or placebo at wk 0 of each 4 wk cycle for a maximum of 5 cycles.</detailed_description>
