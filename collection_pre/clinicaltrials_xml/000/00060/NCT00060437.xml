	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as perifosine use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perifosine in treating patients who have prostate cancer that no longer responds to androgen ablation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perifosine in Treating Patients With Metastatic, Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the 4-month progression-free survival rate, as measured by prostate-specific antigen and clinical criteria, in patients with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer treated with perifosine. - Determine the side-effect profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: - Course 1: Patients receive oral perifosine twice on day 1 and once daily on days 2-21. - All subsequent courses: Patients receive oral perifosine once daily on days 1-21. In all courses, treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-46 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 1.5 years.</detailed_description>
