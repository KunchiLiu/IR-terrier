	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Pomegranate juice may contain substances that decrease or slow the rise of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and may be effective in delaying or preventing recurrent prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well pomegranate juice works in decreasing or slowing the rise of PSA levels in patients who have undergone radiation therapy or surgery for prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pomegranate Juice in Treating Patients With Recurrent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether pomegranate juice can decrease or slow rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral pomegranate juice once daily. Treatment continues for 18 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 29-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
