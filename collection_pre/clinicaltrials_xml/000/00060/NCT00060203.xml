	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as brostallicin use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of brostallicin in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brostallicin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective tumor response rate (confirmed complete response and confirmed partial response) of brostallicin in patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients. - Determine the time to and duration of response, time to treatment failure, time to tumor progression, and survival in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Correlate baseline whole blood levels and activity of glutathione with clinical outcome in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study. - Phase I: Patients receive brostallicin IV over 10-30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of brostallicin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase II: Additional patients are accrued and treated at the MTD of brostallicin as in phase I. Patients are followed every 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-52 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
