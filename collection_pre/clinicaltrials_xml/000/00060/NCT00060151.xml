	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: GW786034 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth and by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of GW786034 in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GW786034 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and tolerability of GW786034 in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this drug. - Evaluate the effect of this drug on biomarkers of angiogenesis activity in order to estimate activity and to determine the minimum biologically active dose in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive oral GW786034 twice daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 2-6 patients receive escalating doses of GW786034 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 21 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
