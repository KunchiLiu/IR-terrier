	<criteria>Histopathologically confirmed recurrent or persistent CTCL as determined by reference pathology lab; Patient must have had 1 to 3 prior CTCL therapies. Repeated use of the same agent is considered to be 1 therapy unless it is part of a different combination regimen. Only 1 prior combination cytotoxic regimen is permitted. Topical or systemic steroids are not considered a therapy; Interleukin2 receptor (IL2R) expression on at least 20% of tumor cells as determined by immunohistochemistry. Stage IA III disease and unlikely to progress during the first month on study. Life expectancy of at least 12 months. Measurable or evaluable disease. Lymph node involvement no greater than LN2. No CTCL involvement of bone marrow. No active CNS disease, kidney or liver disease, significant pulmonary disease, or cardiac disease. No systemic infections; Willingness to be randomized to a placebo treatment only arm; ECOG performance status 0 or 1; â€¢ Patients must not have previously received treatment with DAB389IL2 or DAB486IL 2 (previous candidate compound evaluated in a clinical setting).</criteria>
