	<brief_title>Docetaxel and Gemcitabine With Filgrastim-SD/01 Support in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Docetaxel and Gemcitabine given on day 1 and 8 of a 21-day schedule has substantial activity in non-small cell lung cancer. Both first and second-line patients have response rates comparable to or better than other standard combination regimens. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurs in up to half of patients not given growth factor support. Studies demonstrate that a single dose of Filgrastim-SF/01 at 100 mg/kg effectively enhances post chemotherapy neutrophil recovery in a manner similar to that of daily Filgrastim. This current study is designed to characterize the incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia when a fixed dose of Filgrastim-SD/01 is added to a well-studied myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimen consisting of Gemcitabine and Docetaxel.</detailed_description>
