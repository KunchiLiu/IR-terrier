	<brief_title>Evaluation of Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Targretin Capsules in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluates the use of Targretin capsules (bexarotene) in combination with Carboplatin and Paclitaxel for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy for their lung cancer. Every patient receives a platinum-containing chemotherapy every three weeks for at least four chemotherapy cycles (approximately four months). Half of the patients are randomly assigned to receive Targretin capsules once daily in addition to the chemotherapy. The other half is randomized to receive a standard platinum-containing chemotherapy without Targretin capsules.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have: Pathologic (histologic or cytologic) confirmation of NSCLC Stage IIIB with malignant pleural effusion or Stage IV disease At least one measurable or evaluable NSCLC lesion that has not been previously irradiated unless radiation therapy was more than three weeks prior to entry in the study and the lesion has been shown to have progressed subsequent to the radiation therapy ECOG performance status 0 or 1 Adequate organ system function Fasting serum triglycerides that are within the ageadjusted normal range (or normalized with appropriate intervention such as antilipid therapy prior to the initiation of Targretin capsule therapy). Patients must be able to complete at least four cycles of combination chemotherapy (i.e., approximately four months) Patients must not have had: Brain metastasis Prior chemotherapy for NSCLC Prior platinumbased chemotherapy for any indication</criteria>
