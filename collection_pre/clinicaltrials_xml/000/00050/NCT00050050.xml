	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ADHD, previously believed to be a disorder of childhood, affects as many as 5 percent of adults. Adults with ADHD are at high risk for academic and occupational underachievement, relationship difficulties, and reduced quality of life. This study will determine whether CBT is more effective than drug therapy in treating ADHD symptoms in adults who have been resistant to previous drug therapies. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 12 to 15 weekly sessions of either CBT or drug therapy which may include new or previously taken drugs. Questionnaires will be used to assess participants' ADHD symptoms at study start and at study completion.</detailed_description>
