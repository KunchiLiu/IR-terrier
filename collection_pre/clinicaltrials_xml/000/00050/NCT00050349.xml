	<criteria>Patients with biopsyproven metastatic carcinoid tumors or other neuroendocrine tumors (Islet cell, Gastrinomas and VIPomas) with at least one measurable lesion (other than bone) that has either not been previously irradiated or if previously irradiated has demonstrated progression since the radiation therapy The patient has no major impairment of renal or hepatic function, as defined by the following laboratory parameters: total bilirubin &lt;1.5 X ULN; AST, ALT&lt;2.5X ULN (&lt;5 X ULN if liver metastases are present) Patients on Sandostatin Lar (long acting somatostatin analogue) must be on a stable dose for 30 days prior to study entry and short acting somatostatin analogues must be judged to be on a clinically stable dose by the investigator prior to study entry Must have a life expectancy of greater than three (3) months Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 60 Female patients must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening. (Not applicable to patients with bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy or to those patients who are postmenopausal.) Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases or leptomeningeal involvement Patients with known brain metastases, unless these metastases have been treated and/or have been stable for at least six months prior to study start. Subjects with a history of brain metastases must have a head CT with contrast to document either response or progression. Patients with bone metastases as the only site(s) of measurable disease Patients with hepatic artery chemoembolization within the last 6 months (one month if there are other sites of measurable disease) Patients who have been previously treated with radioactive directed therapies Patients who have been previously treated with epothilone Patients with any peripheral neuropathy or unresolved diarrhea greater than Grade 1 Patients with severe cardiac insufficiency patients taking Coumadin or other warfarincontaining agents with the exception of low dose warfarin (1 mg or less) for the maintenance of indwelling lines or ports Patients taking any experimental therapies history of another malignancy within 5 years prior to study entry except curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, prostate cancer, or cervical cancer in situ Patients with active or suspected acute or chronic uncontrolled infection including abcesses or fistulae Patients with a medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude study or informed consent and/or history of noncompliance to medical regimens or inability or unwillingness to return for all scheduled visits HIV+ patients Pregnant or lactating females.</criteria>
