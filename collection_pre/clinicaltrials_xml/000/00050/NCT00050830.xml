	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically documented diagnosis of progressive or recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC; a tumor that expresses at least one member of the erbB family of receptors; failed or relapsed after receiving a platinumcontaining regimen as therapy; at least one measurable target lesion as defined by RECIST that has not been irradiated. Prior exposure to agents that target the erbB receptor family; unknown response to prior platinumcontaining chemotherapy regimen; cytotoxic chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to baseline disease assessments (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin); more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens: immunotherapy or other biologic therapy within 2 weeks prior to baseline disease assessment; prior irradiation to areas encompassing greater than 30% of marrowbearing bone; brain metastases.</criteria>
