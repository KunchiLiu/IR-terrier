	<brief_title>Behavioral Treatment, Drug Treatment, and Combined Treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants attend a summer treatment program each Monday-Friday for 9 weeks. They participate in group recreational and classroom activities, with 12 children and 5 staff per group. Three behavioral conditions (no behavioral modification, low-intensity behavioral modification, and high-intensity behavioral modification) are delivered in random order, with each condition lasting 3 weeks. Along with the behavioral treatment conditions, children receive 1 of 4 medication doses (placebo, 0.15 mg/kg methylphenidate, 0.3 mg/kg methylphenidate, or 0.6 mg/kg methylphenidate) in random order, with each dose varied daily and repeated 3 or 4 times within each behavioral treatment condition. Measures include frequency counts of positive and negative behaviors, academic productivity and accuracy in the classroom, and counselor, parent, and teacher ratings of benefits and side effects. Parents attend training sessions and implement behavioral programs at home.</detailed_description>
