	<brief_title>Effects of Therapeutic HIV Vaccination on Control of HIV After Discontinuation of Anti-HIV Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a rollover study for patients who participated in A5058s: Augmentation of HIV-Specific Helper and CTL Responses Through Therapeutic Vaccination in Individuals Receiving Potent Suppressive Antiretroviral Therapies. In A5058s, patients received a series of therapeutic vaccinations to elicit HIV-specific immune responses. This study will examine whether these vaccine-induced responses can control viral load in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Upon study entry, patients will discontinue ART. During the first 6 weeks of the study, viral load will be monitored weekly and CD4+ T-cell counts will be monitored every other week. Viral load and CD4+ T-cell counts will be measured every other week from Week 6 through Week 24, then monthly until patients restart ART or until Week 48. Patients who reinitiate ART for any reason will be registered to Step 2 and followed for 10 weeks.</detailed_description>
