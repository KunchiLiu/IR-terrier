	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as MDX-060 can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of MDX-060 monoclonal antibody in treating patients who have refractory or relapsed lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MDX-060 Monoclonal Antibody in Treating Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and tolerability of MDX-060 monoclonal antibody in patients with refractory or relapsed CD30-positive lymphoma. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy (antilymphoma activity) of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients receive MDX-060 monoclonal antibody IV over 90 minutes once weekly for 4 weeks. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MDX-060 monoclonal antibody until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 16 patients are accrued and receive MDX-060 monoclonal antibody at the MTD. Patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then every 3 months for 18 months or until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
