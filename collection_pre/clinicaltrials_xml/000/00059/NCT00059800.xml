	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Boron neutron capture therapy may selectively kill tumor cells without harming normal tissue. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of boron neutron capture therapy in treating patients who have melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Boron Neutron Capture Therapy in Treating Patients With Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the clinical response, by serial objective measurements, in patients with melanoma treated with boron neutron capture therapy. - Determine the time course, uniformity, and severity of acute dermal reactions in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the late dermal reactions in patients who are followed for at least 6 months after treatment with this regimen. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to tumor size (no greater than 15 cc vs greater than 15 cc). Patients undergo boron neutron capture therapy. Patients are followed for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
