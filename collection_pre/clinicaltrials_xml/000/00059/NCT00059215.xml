	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a drug known as CS-747 (also known as prasugrel) on subjects having a procedure called a percutaneous coronary intervention (also referred to as PCI) in which a doctor will attempt to open a blocked vessel (or vessels) in the heart using a catheter (a long thin tube) that has a small balloon on the end. In many cases, patients who have this procedure receive a stent, a small wire spring that helps keep the vessel open.</brief_summary>
