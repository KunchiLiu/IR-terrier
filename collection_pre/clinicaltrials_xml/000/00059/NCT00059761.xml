	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effect on the body when combining irinotecan and cisplatin with radiation therapy in treating patients who have limited-stage small cell lung cancer that could not be completely removed during surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Combined With Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan administered with cisplatin and thoracic radiotherapy (given at two different schedules) in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and non-dose-limiting toxicity of these regimens in these patients. - Determine the reversibility of all toxic effects associated with these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, dose-escalation study of irinotecan. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 radiotherapy (RT) treatment groups. - Radiotherapy: - Group I: Patients undergo thoracic RT twice daily, 5 days a week, for 3 weeks. - Group II: Patients undergo thoracic RT once daily, 5 days a week, for 7 weeks. - Concurrent chemotherapy: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 60-90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 1 course for group I and 2 courses for group II. - Post RT chemotherapy: Patients receive irinotecan and cisplatin as above for 3 courses for group I and 2 courses, beginning after RT is complete, for group II. Sequential cohorts of 6 patients per group receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then 6 months for 4 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-36 patients (6-18 per group) will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
