	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well docetaxel works in treating older patients with metastatic breast, lung, or prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel in Treating Older Patients With Metastatic Breast, Lung, or Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel in older patients with metastatic breast, lung, or prostate cancer. - Determine the response of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the short-term changes in functional status, in terms of activities of daily living, independent activities of daily living, and Karnofsky performance status, in patients treated with this drug. - Correlate the number of comorbid conditions at baseline with declines in functional status in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
