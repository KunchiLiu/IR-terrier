	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Perifosine may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perifosine in treating patients who have locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perifosine in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced, Unresectable, or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the activity of perifosine, in terms of objective response, in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer. - Determine the response duration, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral perifosine every 6 hours for a total of 6 doses and then once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35-84 patients will be accrued for this study within 21 months.</detailed_description>
