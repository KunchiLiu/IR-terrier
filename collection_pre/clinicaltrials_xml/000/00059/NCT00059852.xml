	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as gemcitabine work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Combining gemcitabine with erlotinib may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine with erlotinib in treating patients who have metastatic breast cancer that has been previously treated with an anthracycline and/or a taxane.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib and Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Previously Treated With An Anthracycline and/or a Taxane</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the anti-tumor activity of erlotinib and gemcitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracycline and/or taxane. - Determine the adverse event profile of this regimen in these patients. - Determine whether epidermal growth factor receptor and HER-2 receptor intensity and serum concentrations have an impact on clinical response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the impact of genetic differences in proteins involved in drug response (transport, metabolism, and mechanism of action) on clinical response and adverse events associated with gemcitabine in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV on days 1 and 8 and oral erlotinib on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response are followed every 6 weeks for up to 5 years or until disease progression (PD). Patients discontinuing study therapy for any other reason are followed every 3 months until PD and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
