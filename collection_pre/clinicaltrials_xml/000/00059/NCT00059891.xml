	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: An anal sphincter prosthesis may replace the need for a permanent colostomy and may improve the quality of life of patients who are undergoing surgery for anal or rectal cancer. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of an anal sphincter prosthesis in treating patients who have anal or rectal cancer and are undergoing surgery to remove the anus and rectum.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the risk of complications and feasibility of total anorectal reconstruction using the Acticon Neosphincter prosthesis after abdominoperineal resection in patients with anal or rectal cancer. - Determine continence, bowel function, and quality of life of patients treated with this surgery. OUTLINE: Patients undergo abdominoperineal resection (APR) with perineal colostomy and diverting loop ileostomy. At least 3 months after APR, patients undergo placement of the Acticon Neosphincter prosthesis. At least 6 weeks after prosthesis placement, the prosthesis is activated. When the patient demonstrates the ability to operate the prosthesis, the ileostomy is reversed. Quality of life is assessed at 6 and 12 months and then annually thereafter. Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
