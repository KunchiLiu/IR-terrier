	<brief_title>Zidovudine Levels in HIV Infected Patients Being Treated for HCV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimated 50,000 people in Puerto Rico are infected with HCV. HIV and HCV have similar routes of transmission, and HCV co-infection occurs in 8% to 23% of HIV infected patients. Researchers have shown that treatment for HCV with Rebetron (ribavirin plus interferon alfa-2b) significantly decreases HCV viral load without affecting HIV viral load. However, measurements of intracellular levels of the active forms of zidovudine (ZDV-MP and ZDV-TP) were not performed. Such measurements are needed to provide a more rational basis for dosing in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. This study will investigate the intracellular exposure to active ZDV metabolites prior to and after treatment with Rebetron or treatment with PEG-Intron (pegylated interferon) and ribavirin. Participants in this study will remain on their usual antiretroviral regimen; no changes may be made to that regimen for the first 4 weeks of the study. Upon study entry, participants will have intracellular pharmacokinetic studies. During Week 2, participants will start either Rebetron or PEG-Intron plus ribavirin therapy, will have intracellular pharmacokinetic studies, and will undergo liver biopsy. Additional intracellular pharmacokinetic studies will be performed at Weeks 12 and 24. Rebetron or PEG-Intron plus ribavirin will be given for 48 weeks. A second liver biopsy will be performed 24 weeks after discontinuing Rebetron or PEG-Intron plus ribavirin therapy. Participants will be followed for 72 weeks.</detailed_description>
