	<criteria>Critical leg ischemia (CLI) defined as distal extremity pain at rest, or peripheral ischemic ulcer(s), with severe hemodynamic impairment as diagnosed by ankle systolic pressure, toe systolic pressure or TcPO2 Subjects will already be scheduled to receive a revascularization procedure (e.g., bypass graft, endovascular procedure, etc.) involving a distal target artery below the knee joint (e.g., below the knee joint popliteal, anterior/posterior tibial, peroneal, plantar, pedal, etc.) as part of their normal standard of care. Subjects with a previous major amputation (at or above ankle) Subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) defined as significant renal dysfunction evidenced by estimated creatinine clearance of &lt; 20 cc/min, or receiving chronic hemodialysis therapy.</criteria>
