	<brief_summary>To recruit 150 adult patients with cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) without fasting hyperglycemia for a multi-center, twelve month, placebo-controlled intervention trial testing the ability of insulin or repaglinide to improve body mass index (BMI) and stabilize pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis (CF).</brief_summary>
