	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as anakinra, may interfere with the growth of the tumor cells and slow the growth of metastatic tumors that express the interleukin-1 gene. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of anakinra in treating patients with metastatic cancer that expresses the interleukin-1 gene.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anakinra in Treating Patients With Metastatic Cancer Expressing the Interleukin-1 Gene</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of anakinra in patients with metastatic cancer expressing the interleukin-1 gene. - Determine the steady state pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Determine the antitumor efficacy of this drug in these patients. - Determine gene expression changes in tumor biopsies and circulating leukocyte and cytokine levels in these patients before and after treatment with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive anakinra subcutaneously 1-3 times daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of anakinra until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 6 patients are treated at that dose. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.</detailed_description>
