	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development of cancer. Celecoxib may be effective in preventing cervical cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in preventing cervical cancer in patients who have high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0212 Celecoxib in Treating Patients With High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions of the Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the complete response rate in patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix treated with celecoxib vs placebo. - Compare the toxicity of these drugs in these patients. - Determine, preliminarily, the effect of celecoxib on cyclooxygenase-2 expression and human papilloma virus expression in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion status (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 2 vs CIN 3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 1 month. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 1 month. In both arms, treatment repeats monthly for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients then undergo loop electrosurgical excision procedure or cone biopsy to determine response. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.</detailed_description>
