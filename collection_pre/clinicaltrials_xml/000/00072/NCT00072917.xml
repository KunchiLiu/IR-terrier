	<brief_summary>This is a longitudinal cohort study of how the responses to a 3 day period of controlled overfeeding relate to subsequent weight gain. We hypothesize that thin individuals are resistant to weight gain because they respond to periods of overfeeding by increasing fat oxidation, reducing food intake, and increasing physical activity relative to those who gain weight over time.</brief_summary>
