	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Inserting the interleukin-12 gene into a person's cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of interleukin-12 gene when injected into the tumors of patients with liver metastases secondary to colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
