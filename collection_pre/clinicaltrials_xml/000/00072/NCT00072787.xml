	<brief_summary>The purpose of the phase 1 portion of the study is to determine the safe dose of S-1 and cisplatin that can be administered in gastric cancer patients. The purpose of the phase 2 portion of the study is to determine the antitumor activity of the S-1 and cisplatin regimen established from phase 1 in patients with advanced gastric cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1/2 Study of S-1 and Cisplatin in Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine which combines tegafur (a 5-FU prodrug) with two classes of modulators which: - inhibit dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and - block phosphorylation of 5-FU in gastrointestinal tissues. S-1 is designed to enhance the the clinical utility of an oral fluoropyrimidine while ameliorating the disadvantage of gastrointestinal toxicity. 5-Fu and cisplatin have been used as a standard treatment in gastric cancer and preliminary data indicate that S-1 plus cisplatin may result in superior tolerability and efficacy in advanced gastric cancer. S-1 is currently approved in Japan for treatment of gastric cancer and head and neck cancer.</detailed_description>
