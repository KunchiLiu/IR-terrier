	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is to see if combining bevacizumab with low-dose cyclophosphamide works in treating patients with ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back or spread to other parts of the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining bevacizumab with cyclophosphamide may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab and Low-Dose Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary I. Determine the time to progression in patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer treated with bevacizumab and low-dose cyclophosphamide. Secondary I. Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine molecular correlates for response and outcomes in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study. Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 for the first course and on days 1 and 15 for all subsequent courses. Patients also receive low-dose oral cyclophosphamide on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-55 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.</detailed_description>
