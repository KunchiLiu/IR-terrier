	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab in treating patients who have refractory or relapsed primary CNS lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab in Treating Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Primary CNS Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the radiographic response proportion in patients with refractory or recurrent primary CNS lymphoma treated with rituximab. Secondary - Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive additional courses of rituximab off study at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients are followed every 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-9 months.</detailed_description>
