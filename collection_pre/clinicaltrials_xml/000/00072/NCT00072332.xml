	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as edotecarin and cisplatin, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining edotecarin with cisplatin may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining edotecarin with cisplatin in treating patients who have advanced or metastatic solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Edotecarin and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of edotecarin when administered with cisplatin (administered in 2 different schedules) in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Secondary - Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of edotecarin. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 schedules. - Schedule A: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30 minutes and edotecarin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. - Schedule B: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours and edotecarin IV over 1 hour on day 1. In both schedules, courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each schedule receive escalating doses of edotecarin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 10 additional patients with metastatic esophageal or gastric cancer receive treatment as above at the MTD. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year or until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 80 patients (40 per schedule) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
