	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and cisplatin, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy with radiation therapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel and cisplatin together with chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery works in treating patients with locally advanced, resectable esophageal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Docetaxel and Cisplatin Plus Chemoradiotherapy Followed By Surgery in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced, Resectable Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the effectiveness of neoadjuvant docetaxel and cisplatin and chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, in terms of pathological response rate, in patients with locally advanced, resectable esophageal cancer. - Determine the feasibility of this regimen, in terms of successful completion of therapy and survival at 30 days postoperatively, in these patients. Secondary - Determine the parameters of disease control in these patients and toxicity of this regimen and compare these parameters with published results. - Correlate early improvement of dysphasia after 1-2 courses of chemotherapy with predictive value with regard to tumor response and long-term disease control in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the clinical benefit of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 22. - Chemoradiotherapy: Beginning 21 days after the last dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV over 1 hour once a week and undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks. - Surgery: Patients undergo surgery 3-8 weeks after the final administration of radiotherapy. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, day 22 of chemotherapy, day 1 of chemoradiotherapy, before surgery, and then every 3 months for 1 year. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 22-66 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
