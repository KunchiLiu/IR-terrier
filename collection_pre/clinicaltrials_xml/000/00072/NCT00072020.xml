	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Zoledronate may delay or prevent the formation of bone metastases. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy are more effective with or without zoledronate in preventing cancer recurrence and bone metastases in women with breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy together with zoledronate to see how well they work compared to chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy alone in preventing cancer recurrence and bone metastases in women with stage II or stage III breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy and/or Hormone Therapy With or Without Zoledronate in Treating Women With Stage II or Stage III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare disease-free survival of women with stage II or III breast cancer at high risk of relapse treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy with vs without zoledronate. Secondary - Compare time to bone metastases, as first recurrence, in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare time to bone metastases, per se, in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare time to distant metastases in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare overall survival in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the reduction in skeletal-related events (fractures, spinal cord compression, radiotherapy to the bone, surgery to the bone, and hypercalcemia) before and after the development of bone metastases in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the safety and toxicity of zoledronate in patients treated with these regimens. - Correlate prognostic factors, such as estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor status, TNM stage, tumor grade, HER2/neu status, and menopausal status with treatment outcome in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine more specific prognostic indicators for the development of bone metastases and factors that are able to predict specific benefit from bisphosphonate treatment using proteomics, tissue micro-array, and other modern techniques in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy. Patients also receive concurrent zoledronate IV over 15 minutes every 3-4 weeks for 6 doses, every 3 months for 8 doses, and then every 6 months for 5 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy alone. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed annually for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,300 patients (1,650 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
