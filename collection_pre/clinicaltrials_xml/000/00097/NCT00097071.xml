	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in the United States of America (USA). It is demonstrated that intensive insulin therapy resulting in good glycaemic control can reduce or delay the incidence of complications secondary to Type 1 Diabetes. Insulin Aspart (NovoLog®) is an ideal insulin to use in an intensive insulin regimen using continuous subcutaneous insulin injection (CSII) therapy in the pediatric and adolescent age population. This trial compares the safety and efficacy of Insulin Aspart (NovoLog®) and Insulin Lispro (Humalog®) delivered by CSII in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.</brief_summary>
