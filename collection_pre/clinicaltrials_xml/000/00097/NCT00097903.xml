	<brief_title>Trial of Oral Karenitecin in Patients With Solid Tumors and Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initially, the safety, side effects and recommended phase 2 dose of oral Karenitecin in patients with advanced solid tumors will be determined. When the recommended phase 2 dose has been determined, the specified dose will be used to determine if Karenitecin is effective in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory non-small cell lung cancer.</detailed_description>
