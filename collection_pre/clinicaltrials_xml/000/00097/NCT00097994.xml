	<brief_title>Does Menopause Matter?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Menopause affects every woman as she ages, yet every woman's experience is different. We are seeking to enroll 720 women from the University of Pittsburgh's Division of General Internal Medicine Outpatient practice (GIMO) at all stages of menopause (pre-, peri-, and post-menopausal), between 40 and 65 years old. They will be followed for 5 years as they progress through menopause. Women will complete yearly questionnaires during their usual doctor's visit (or by phone or online if necessary) regarding general health, menopause and menopausal symptoms, health related quality of life, traditional and alternative therapy use, social support, and attitudes towards menopause and aging. We will combine this information with information from women's medical charts to look at how menopause and health related quality of life impact the use of health care resources. Additionally, some women may be asked about the use of health care resources, such as doctor's visits, hospitalizations and lab tests.</detailed_description>
