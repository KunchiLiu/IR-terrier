	<brief_summary>Standard antipsychotic drug regimens do not fully address the impact of cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia. The NMDA receptor has been connected to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Memantine is an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist. It is hypothesized that adjunctive therapy with memantine will reduce NMDA receptor hyperactivity, improving signal to noise ratio and thereby improving cognitive symptoms.</brief_summary>
