	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Single Intravenous Doses of Peginesatide in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of peginesatide, an erythropoiesis stimulating agent, with approximately 7 treatment cohorts and 7 healthy volunteer participants per cohort. In each cohort of 7 participants, a ratio of 5:2 participants was randomly assigned to receive a single dose of peginesatide or placebo, respectively, administered as an intravenous infusion. Planned peginesatide dose levels were to escalate by cohort. The study was conducted at a single clinical center.</detailed_description>
