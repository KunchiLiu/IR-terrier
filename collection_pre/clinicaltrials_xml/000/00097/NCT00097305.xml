	<brief_title>Body-Oriented Therapy for Sexual Abuse Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women who have experienced child sexual abuse often display symptoms of dissociation and lack of bodily self-awareness which hinder the recovery process. Mind-body researchers have examined alternative therapeutic approaches to eliminating these factors. This study will compare a standardized therapeutic message to body-oriented therapy which involves a combination of hands-on bodywork and verbal therapy focused on somatic and emotional awareness.</detailed_description>
