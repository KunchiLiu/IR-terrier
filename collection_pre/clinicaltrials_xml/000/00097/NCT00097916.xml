	<brief_summary>About 65% of patients with severe Alzheimer's Disease (AD) will have symptoms of agitation. There are drawbacks associated with the currently available therapeutic interventions for agitation associated with Alzheimer's Disease. In a recent trial, in the group of patients with moderate to severe AD treated with memantine, there were fewer incidences of agitation. It is hypothesized that memantine will be effective in reducing the symptoms of agitation associated with moderate to severe Alzheimer's Disease.</brief_summary>
