	<brief_summary>Everolimus is an immunosuppressive drug that is being studied for preventing acute rejection that can happen after heart transplantation. It is usually used in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the change in kidney function after beginning everolimus, while determining the most effective Neoral® (cyclosporine) dose to take with everolimus, in adult cardiac transplant patients who have had their transplanted heart for at least 1 year and who have cardiac allograft vasculopathy.</brief_summary>
