	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: BL22 immunotoxin can locate tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells. BL22 immunotoxin may be effective in treating relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of BL22 immunotoxin in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BL22 Immunotoxin In Treating Young Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the toxic effects of BL22 immunotoxin in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients. - Determine the immunogenicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Determine the in vitro cytotoxicity of this drug against lymphoblasts from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. - Determine the therapeutic efficacy of this drug in inducing remissions in these patients. - Determine changes in lymphocyte subsets, immunoglobulin levels, serum cytokines, and soluble cytokine receptor levels in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, dose-escalation study. Patients receive BL22 immunotoxin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 OR on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) or unconfirmed CR (CRu) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR or CRu for a maximum of 6 courses. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BL22 immunotoxin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, the cohort is expanded and a total of 12 patients are treated at that dose. Patients are followed weekly for at least 1 month and then every 1-3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 95 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
