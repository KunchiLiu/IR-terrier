	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combretastatin A4 phosphate may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Combining doxorubicin and cisplatin with radiation therapy and combretastatin A4 phosphate may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving induction chemotherapy using doxorubicin and cisplatin together with radiation therapy and combretastatin A4 phosphate works in treating patients with newly diagnosed regionally advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Chemotherapy Using Doxorubicin and Cisplatin Followed by Combretastatin A4 Phosphate and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Regionally Advanced Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the objective response rate in patients with newly diagnosed regionally advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer treated with induction chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin and cisplatin followed by combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P) and radiotherapy. - Determine whether this regimen alters the natural history of anaplastic thyroid cancer by virtue of doubling the median survival of these patients from 10 to 20 months. Secondary - Determine a tolerable dose of CA4P when administered with radiotherapy in these patients. (Phase I portion of the study closed as of 5/6/04; patients now receive a fixed dose of CA4P) - Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients. - Determine clinical predictors of response (e.g., pretreatment tumor microvessel density and immature vessel staining, changes in sICAM-1 levels and tumor blood flow, and pharmacokinetic parameters) in patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate the diminution in blood flow with tumor pain and response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study of combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P). (Phase I portion of the study closed as of 5/6/04; patients now receive a fixed dose of CA4P) - Induction phase: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 5-10 minutes and cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 3-21 or pegfilgrastim SC on day 2. - Combined modality phase: Beginning on day 22, patients undergo radiotherapy twice daily, 5 days a week, for 3-4 weeks. Patients also receive CA4P IV over 10 minutes weekly on the fifth day of radiotherapy. Cohorts of 6 patients receive 1 of 2 escalating doses of CA4P to determine a tolerable dose. The tolerable dose is defined as the dose at which less than 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. (Phase I portion of the study closed as of 5/6/04; patients now receive a fixed dose of CA4P) - Consolidation phase: Beginning 4-6 weeks after the completion of the combined modality phase, patients receive CA4P IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses. Treatment in all phases continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 2 years from study entry. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
