	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 3-AP and gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving 3-AP together with gemcitabine as second-line therapy works in treating patients with recurrent stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3-AP and Gemcitabine as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the objective response rate in patients with stage III or IV recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treated with 3-AP (Triapine®) and gemcitabine as second-line therapy. Secondary - Determine the response duration, median time to progression, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the effect of 3-AP (Triapine®) on gemcitabine pharmacokinetics and cellular uptake into peripheral mononuclear cells in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center. Patients receive 3-AP (Triapine®) IV over 4 hours and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15*. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *For course 1 only, gemcitabine is administered alone on day 1 and in combination with 3-AP (Triapine®) on days 8 and 15. Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-31 patients will be accrued for this study within 7.5-21 months.</detailed_description>
