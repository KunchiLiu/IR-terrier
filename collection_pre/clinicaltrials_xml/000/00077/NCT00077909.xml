	<brief_summary>This study will examine the different types of proteins present in the lungs of patients with pneumonia to explore the causes of different types of the disease. Pneumonia is a condition that causes lung inflammation AND is often caused by an infection. It is usually diagnosed by lung x-rays and listening to the chest with a stethoscope. This method can diagnose pneumonia, but it does not provide information on the cause of the inflammation - information that might be helpful in guiding treatment. This study will measure proteins in the lungs of patients to see if certain proteins are associated with specific forms of pneumonia, and can thus serve as biomarkers for disease. Patients undergoing diagnostic bronchoscopy at the NIH Clinical Center may participate in this study. Patients will undergo bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage as scheduled for their medical care. For this procedure, the patient's mouth and throat are numbed with lidocaine; a sedative may be given for comfort. A thin flexible tube called a bronchoscope is advanced through the nose or mouth into the lung airways to examine the airways carefully. Saline (salt water) is then injected through the bronchoscope into the air passage, acting as a rinse. A sample of fluid is then withdrawn for microscopic examination. Researchers in the current study will use some of the fluid obtained from the lavage to examine for protein content. In addition to the bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage, participants will have about 2 tablespoons of blood drawn to compare blood test results with the results of the lung washings. Patients' medical records will be reviewed to obtain information on past medical history, current medical treatment, vital signs, and results of x-ray tests.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to analyze bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with lung infiltrates in order to discover new biomarkers and protein expression patterns that are associated with specific types of pulmonary disease. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a standard method to obtain lower airway samples to evaluate pulmonary infiltrates in order to diagnose infection, malignancy or non-infectious inflammation. After collecting the lavage, the clinical microbiology laboratory concentrates the formed elements (i.e. pathogens and cells) for stains and culture and discards the BAL supernatant. The supernatant however is a rich source of proteins and other molecules. We hypothesize that BAL fluid supernatant will be an important source of biomarkers that reflect host-pathogen interactions. The analysis of protein mass profiles and biomarker identification in BAL fluid supernatant may help develop new diagnostic methods and extend our understanding of mechanisms of lung inflammation due to infectious causes. POPULATION: The study population will include all patients undergoing bronchoscopy for clinical indications at the Clinical Center who provide informed consent for chart review and proteomic analysis of BAL supernatant, as described in this protocol. We hope to acquire BAL samples that reflect a spectrum of community-acquired and opportunistic pathogens associated with pulmonary disease. In addition analysis of a range of non-infectious pulmonary processes (e.g. acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome and engraftment syndrome) is important to develop measures of sensitivity and specificity. DESIGN: This is a prospective observational study. OUTCOME: The expected outcome is to develop a database of protein mass profiles of BAL fluid linked to specific microbiologic diagnoses. Our expectation is to acquire 1,000 specimens from the Clinical Center with a range of clinical diagnoses including bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal infections and sterile inflammation. When a sufficient number of samples in an individual category is collected (approximately 20-30), the samples will be analyzed with current proteomic techniques.</detailed_description>
