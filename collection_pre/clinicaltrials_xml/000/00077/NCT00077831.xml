	<detailed_description>In the first phase of this multi-site, 10-year longitudinal study, infants with one of four types of single-suture craniosynostosis were recruited: sagittal, metopic, right unilateral coronal, and left unilateral coronal. A case-matched "control" group of healthy, normal infants was also followed. This study, which is now in its second phase, is following this same cohort of children at the age of 7 years.</detailed_description>
