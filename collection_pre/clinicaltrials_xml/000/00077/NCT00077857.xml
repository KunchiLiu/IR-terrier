	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study compared the efficacy and safety of label dose of capecitabine (Xeloda®) to that of a lower dose of Xeloda® plus docetaxel (Taxotere®) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of chemotherapy with an anthracycline. Patients were randomized to receive either 1250 mg/m^2 or 825 mg/m^2 orally twice a day (po bid) on days 1-14 of each 3 week cycle, in combination with Taxotere® 75 mg/m2 intravenous (iv) on day 1 of each 3 week cycle. The anticipated time on study treatment was until disease progression and the target sample size was 440 individuals.</brief_summary>
