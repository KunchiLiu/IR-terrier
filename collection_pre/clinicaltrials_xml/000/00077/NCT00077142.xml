	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: TAC-101 may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of TAC-101 and to see how well it works in treating patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TAC-101 in Treating Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (Liver Cancer)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Phase I - Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TAC-101 in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. - Determine the safety of 2 consecutive courses of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the toxic and adverse effects profile of this drug in these patients. Phase II - Primary - Determine the objective antitumor response rate in patients treated with this drug at the MTD. - Secondary - Determine the overall survival time of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the duration of observed objective response, using WHO criteria and measurements of serum alpha-fetoprotein concentrations, in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the time to treatment failure in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the safety and tolerability of intermittent treatment with this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study. - Phase I: Patients receive oral TAC-101 once daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of TAC-101 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase II: Patients receive oral TAC-101 at the MTD (determined in phase I) once daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 35-60 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-18 patients for the phase I portion and 21-41 patients for the phase II portion will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
