	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as DJ-927 and capecitabine, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of DJ-927 and capecitabine in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DJ-927 and Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of DJ-927 and capecitabine in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. - Determine the dose-limiting and non-dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. Secondary - Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the possible pharmacokinetic interactions of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, nonrandomized, multicenter study. - Course 1: Patients receive oral DJ-927 once on day 1 and oral capecitabine once on days 0 and 1 and twice daily on days 2-14. - Course 2: Patients receive DJ-927 as in course 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 2-15. - Course 3 and all subsequent courses: Patients receive DJ-927 as in course 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. All courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of DJ-927 and capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A minimum of 6 patients receive treatment at the MTD. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
