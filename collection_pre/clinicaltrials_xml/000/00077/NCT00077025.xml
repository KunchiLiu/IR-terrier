	<brief_summary>This study is being carried out to see if treatment with ZD1839 (Gefitinib) combined with Arimidex (Anastrozole) has improved efficacy over Arimidex alone in preventing progression of metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Anastrozole-Placebo to the Combination Anastrozole-ZD1839 in Postmenopausal Patients With Estrogen Receptor and/or Progesterone Receptor Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Patients will be randomized in a double-blind manner in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 250 mg/day ZD1839 or matched placebo in combination with 1 mg/day anastrozole. The dose of ZD1839 has been selected based on clinical studies in other tumor types suggesting identical efficacy together with a better toxicity profile in patients treated at 250 mg compared to 500 mg/day. The 1 mg dose of anastrozole is the standard approved dose.</detailed_description>
