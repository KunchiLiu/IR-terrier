	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ABI-007, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ABI-007 and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ABI-007 in Treating Patients With Chemotherapy-Naïve Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of paclitaxel (albumin-stabilized Nanoparticle formulation) (ABI-007) in patients with chemotherapy-naïve stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. - Determine the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine duration of response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study. - Phase I: Patients receive paclitaxel (albumin-stabilized Nanoparticle formulation) (ABI-007) IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ABI-007 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase II: Patients receive ABI-007 as above at the MTD (determined in phase I). Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months for 1.5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 64 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
