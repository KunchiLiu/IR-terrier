	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth and may make them more sensitive to radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving tipifarnib together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib when given together with radiation therapy in treating patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tipifarnib and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxic effects of tipifarnib when administered with radiotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Secondary - Determine the 3-month clinical response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of tipifarnib. Patients receive oral tipifarnib once or twice daily on weeks 1-8. Patients also undergo concurrent radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, on weeks 2-8. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-15 months.</detailed_description>
