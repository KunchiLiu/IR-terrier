	<brief_summary>Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. 3-AP may help cytarabine kill more cancer cells by making them more sensitive to the drug. This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of 3-AP when given with high-dose cytarabine in treating patients with advanced hematologic malignancies</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3-AP and High-Dose Cytarabine in Treating Patients With Advanced Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 3-AP (Triapine) administered with high-dose cytarabine in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the clinical activity of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the effect of treatment with 3-AP (Triapine) on intracellular levels of cytarabine in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 3-AP (Triapine). Patients receive high-dose cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5 and 3-AP (Triapine) IV over 2 hours on days 2-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of 3-AP (Triapine) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for up to 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-48 patients (3-24 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 15-24 months.</detailed_description>
