	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride compared with paclitaxel as adjuvant therapy in treating breast cancer in women with 0-3 positive axillary lymph nodes. Giving additional cancer treatment after surgery may help to lower the risk that the cancer will come back (adjuvant therapy). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether the standard adjuvant therapy of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride is more effective than paclitaxel in treating women with breast cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Four Versus Six Cycles of Cyclophosphamide/Doxorubicin or Paclitaxel in Adjuvant Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the equivalence of paclitaxel given every two weeks with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride (CA) given every two weeks as adjuvant therapy for women with 0-3 positive axillary lymph nodes, for disease-free survival. II. To determine if longer therapy, 12 weeks, is superior to shorter therapy, 8 weeks, of either CA or paclitaxel for disease-free survival for women with primary breast cancer with 0-3 positive axillary lymph nodes. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the equivalence of paclitaxel given every two weeks with CA given every two weeks, and the potential superiority of longer vs. shorter therapy, in relation to overall survival, local control (regardless of metastatic status) and time to distant metastases (regardless of local recurrence status). II. To compare toxicities of short and long course CA and paclitaxel as adjuvant therapy for women with 0-3 positive axillary lymph node breast cancer. III. To determine the effect of long and short course CA and paclitaxel on the induction of menopause for pre-menopausal patients. IV. To assess the discrepancy of myelosuppression among the common multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) haplotypes in the CA treatment arm. V. To assess the effect of MDR1 haplotypes on disease-free survival (DFS) adjusted for treatment. VI. Exploratory analysis of the effect of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 5 (CYP3A5), cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 8 (CYP2C8), and cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily B, polypeptide 6 (CYP2B6) polymorphisms on DFS and toxicity. VII. To identify genetic markers associated with the risk of developing neutropenia in adriamycin/ cyclophosphamide-treated breast cancer patients. VIII. To identify genetic markers associated with the risk of developing peripheral neuropathy in paclitaxel-treated breast cancer patients. IX. To identify genetic markers associated with differences in the efficacy of each chemotherapy regimen. X. To examine genetic associations with other response and toxicity phenotypes that become apparent during future analysis of Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 40101 data. XI. To identify copy number variants associated with adriamycin/cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia and paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM III: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM IV: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Note: Randomization to Arms II and IV is no longer available, effective 12/15/2007. After completion of study treatment patients are followed up for 4-6 weeks, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for up to 13 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria: Patients must have histologically confirmed invasive carcinoma of the female breast, with 03 positive axillary lymph nodes Patients must have 03 positive axillary lymph nodes to be eligible for this study; patients with nodenegative breast cancer should have sufficiently "high risk" disease to warrant chemotherapy; as general guidelines, nodenegative patients with tumors of &gt;= 1 cm or estrogen or progesterone receptor negative tumors of any size may be eligible; ultimately though, the definition of "high risk" may be determined by the treating physician, and if the treating physician feels the patient warrants chemotherapy, the patient is eligible; for patients with 13 positive axillary nodes, the patient is eligible regardless of primary breast tumor characteristics, if in the opinion of the treating physician, chemotherapy is deemed potentially beneficial to the patient If the patient has had a negative sentinel node biopsy, then no further axillary dissection is required, and the patient is determined to be nodenegative; if an axillary dissection, without a sentinel node biopsy, is performed to determine nodal status, at least six axillary lymph nodes must be removed and analyzed and negative for the patient to be considered nodenegative; axillary nodes with single cells or tumor clusters =&lt; 0.2 mm by either hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&amp;E) or immunohistochemistry (IHC), will be considered nodenegative; lymph nodes positive for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with tumor cells/clusters =&lt; 0.2 mm will be considered nodenegative; any axillary lymph node with tumor clusters &gt; 0.2 mm will be considered positive If the patient has a sentinel node biopsy and one of the sentinel nodes is positive, as defined by tumor clusters &gt; 0.2 mm, an axillary dissection must be performed; a total of at least 6 axillary lymph nodes, including sentinel nodes plus the subsequent dissection, must be removed for the patient to be eligible; of all the lymph nodes removed from both the sentinel node procedure and the axillary dissection, 13 must be positive for the patient to be eligible as a nodepositive patient; if an axillary dissection is done without a sentinel node procedure, at least 6 lymph nodes must be removed and a 13 nodes must be positive for the patient to be considered nodepositive and eligible for this study Determination of involvement of axillary nodes with metastatic cancer will follow the revised tumornodemetastasis (TNM) staging system: axillary nodes with single cells with tumor clusters =&lt; 0.2 mm, by either H&amp;E or immunohistochemistry (IHC), will be considered negative axillary node; lymph nodes positive for PCR with tumor cells/clusters &lt; 0.2 mm will be considered negative axillary node; any axillary lymph node with clusters &gt; 0.2 mm will be considered to be positive Patients with estrogenreceptor and/or progesterone receptor negative, positive, or unknown tumors are eligible; estrogenreceptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) assays should be performed by immunohistochemical methods according to the local institution's standard protocol Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive, negative or unknown disease are eligible for this trial;
