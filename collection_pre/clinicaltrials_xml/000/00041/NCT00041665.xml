	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy and high dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is frequently used as treatment for patients with cancers of the bone marrow or lymph nodes such as Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia or multiple myeloma. A common side effect of the radiotherapy and high dose chemotherapy is mucositis (inflammation of the inside of the mouth and throat resulting in pain and difficulty swallowing). Mucositis is often very severe such that patients receive intravenous nutrition and pain medication in the hospital. In this study, an investigational recombinant human growth factor called Keratinocyte Growth Factor (rHuKGF) is being evaluated to determine its protective effect on the mucosal tissue and its ability to reduce the mouth and throat soreness.</brief_summary>
