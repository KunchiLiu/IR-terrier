	<brief_summary>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the cartilage degradation. PG-530742 inhibits some MMPs, potentially limiting cartilage degradation and disease progression. This study will test the efficacy and safety of PG-530742 in the treatment of mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis.</brief_summary>
