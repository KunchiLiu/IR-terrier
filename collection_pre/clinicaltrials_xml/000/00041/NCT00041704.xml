	<brief_summary>Anidulafungin is an antifungal agent of the echinocandin class which is highly active in vitro against fluconazole resistant Candida species. The efficacy of anidulafungin has demonstrated in various animal models of fluconazole-resistant mucosal disease; as well as, in Phase 2 Esophageal Candidiasis studies. This study is intended to offer patients with FRMC an alternate therapy with amphotericin B or with other agents whose efficacy and/or safety are inadequate in the treatment of this disease.</brief_summary>
