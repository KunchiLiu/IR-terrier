	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carboplatin, gemcitabine, and exisulind in treating patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the 18-month survival rate in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with carboplatin, gemcitabine, and exisulind. - Determine the feasibility and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall median survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Chemotherapy repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses. Patients also receive oral exisulind twice daily beginning on day 1 of course 1 and continuing until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.</detailed_description>
