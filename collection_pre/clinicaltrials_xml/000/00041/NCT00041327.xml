	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Antiviral therapy may kill viruses such as HTLV-1 that can cause cancer. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Combining chemotherapy with antiviral drugs and interferon alfa may be effective in treating adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by antiviral therapy and interferon alfa in treating patients who have adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma caused by HTLV-1.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Followed By Antiviral Therapy and Interferon Alfa in Treating Patients With HTLV-1-Related Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (EPOCH) followed by lamivudine, zidovudine, and interferon alfa, in terms of response rate, in patients with HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. - Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the effect of this regimen on markers of virus replication and expression and immune function in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive EPOCH chemotherapy comprising etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin IV continuously on days 1-5, cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on day 5, and oral prednisone on days 1-5. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning on day 7 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21-28 days for at least 2 courses beyond best response or for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or stable disease. Beginning 1 month after completion of EPOCH, patients receive oral lamivudine and zidovudine twice daily and interferon alfa SC daily continuously for 1 year. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.</detailed_description>
