	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel in treating patients who have persistent or recurrent cervical cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity of docetaxel in patients with persistent or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
