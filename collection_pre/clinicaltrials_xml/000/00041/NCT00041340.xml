	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Stage IV Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine response to Gleevec (Imatinib Mesylate) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and with c-Kit, Arg, Abl, or PDGF-R expression. II. To determine the side effects of Imatinib Mesylate in patients with colorectal cancer. III. To study the biologic effects of Imatinib Mesylate on the c-Kit and PDGF-R system and downstream signaling in metastatic colorectal cancer. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily. Treatment continues for 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or better continue therapy until disease progression or 1 year after complete response.</detailed_description>
