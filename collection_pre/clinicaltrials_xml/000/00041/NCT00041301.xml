	<brief_title>Assessing Quality of Life of Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the scale structure, psychometric validity, and reliability of quality of life measurements using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the prostate cancer-specific QLQ-PR25 questionnaires in patients with stage I-IV prostate cancer. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to stage of disease (local or locally advanced disease vs metastatic disease). Patients complete EORTC QLQ-C30 and prostate cancer-specific QLQ-PR25 questionnaires before therapy and at 3 months after the start of therapy. Patients in stratum II also complete questionnaires at 6 months after the start of therapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 375 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
