	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of exatecan mesylate in treating patients who have advanced soft tissue sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exatecan Mesylate in Treating Patients With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the anticancer activity of exatecan mesylate, in terms of objective response and duration of response, in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma. - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histological diagnosis (leiomyosarcoma vs other histologies). Patients receive exatecan mesylate IV over 30 minutes daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression. After disease progression, patients are followed every 12 weeks for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-50 patients (16-25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
