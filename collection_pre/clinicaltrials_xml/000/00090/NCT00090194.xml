	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if IGIV-C, 10% will be effective in converting a donor-recipient crossmatch status from positive to negative. The crossmatch test is used to determine if the donor tissue and recipient tissue are compatible. The study will also evaluate if IGIV-C, 10% will allow successful kidney transplantation in a patient who otherwise would not be able to receive a transplant. Three dose levels of IGIV-C, 10% will be evaluated to determine what dose level is most effective.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Transplant Options of Highly Sensitized Recipients Using IGIV-C, 10%</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation has emerged as the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Preliminary data suggest that IGIV therapy could have significant benefits in modifying allograft rejection episodes, stabilizing long-term allograft function, and reducing ischemia/reperfusion injury. Qualified patients will have an in-vitro assessment of the ability of IGIV-C, 10% to convert the donor-specific crossmatch (cytotoxic assay) from positive to negative. Those patients with successful in-vitro conversion of the donor-specific crossmatch assay will be randomized to receive IGIV-C, 10% intravenously at a dose of either 2 gm/kg, 1 gm/kg, or 0.5 gm/kg. IGIV-C, 10% will be administered 3 to 5 days prior to planned transplantation and, if transplantation is successful, 7 days post-transplant. If after receiving the IGIV-C infusion the donor-specific crossmatch reveals that cell death has fallen to 20% or less above background, the crossmatch will be considered negative. If after receiving one infusion the crossmatch remains positive, additional IGIV-C infusions may be administered at one-month intervals, up to 4 infusions. A repeat crossmatch must be obtained after each infusion. Patients will be followed for 12 months post-transplant. Concomitant therapy will include a standard immunosuppression regimen of mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and prednisone following induction therapy with thymoglobulin.</detailed_description>
