	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well imatinib mesylate works in treating patients with HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With HIV-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine clinical response in patients with HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma treated with imatinib mesylate. Secondary - Determine the inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptors, as determined by immunohistochemistry, in patients treated with this drug. - Determine cytokine profiles before and after treatment with this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug and antiretrovirals in these patients. - Determine mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily. Treatment continues for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
