	<detailed_description>This trial comprises three studies. In the first two studies, women will be randomly assigned to receive either real or sham acupuncture therapy. Study 1 will include women with various forms of cancer. White blood cell counts will be used to assess the effects of acupuncture on participants' immune responses. Study 2 will include women with unspecified pelvic pain and endometriosis; a self-report pain scale will be used to assess the effects of acupuncture on participants' symptoms. Study 3 will evaluate the validity and reliability of diagnoses made by Chinese medicine practitioners. In this study, a group of Chinese medicine practitioners will diagnose the same group of patients; consistency of the diagnoses will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
