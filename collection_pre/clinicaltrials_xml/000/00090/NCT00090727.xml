	<brief_title>Chemotherapy for Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is for people who have advanced cancer for which standard chemotherapy did not work or for which there are no reliably, effective treatments. AQ4N is an experimental chemotherapy that is thought to target tumor areas with low oxygen content and low blood supply; tumor areas that are usually the most resistant to standard chemotherapy and radiation treatment. AQ4N may be beneficial in cancer treatment by interfering with a protein that is required for cells to grow and divide, causing tumors to die or to delay their growth. All patients in this study will receive AQ4N. The dose will be increased for each new patient or group of patients until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.</detailed_description>
