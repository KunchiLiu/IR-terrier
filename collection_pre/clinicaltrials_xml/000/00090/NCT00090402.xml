	<brief_title>Fish Oil and Alpha Lipoic Acid in Treating Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious condition associated with increased inflammation, cholesterol, and oxidative stress (a condition involving an excess of free radicals and a decrease in antioxidant levels). Fish oil and alpha lipoic acid, which have few side effects, may help relieve these problems; therefore, these supplements may slow the progression of AD, particularly when given in combination. This study will evaluate the effect of fish oil and alpha lipoic acid on inflammation, lipid levels, and oxidative stress. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive fish oil alone, fish oil and alpha lipoic acid, or placebo for 1 year. AD rating scales as well as urine and blood tests will be used to assess participants. Participants will have monthly clinic visits during the study to monitor adverse events and to undergo various laboratory tests.</detailed_description>
