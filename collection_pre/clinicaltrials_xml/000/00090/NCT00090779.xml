	<brief_summary>Although some doctors favor starting anti-HIV treatment as soon as possible after patients learn they are infected, it is not known if treatment for recently infected patients results in long-term benefits or harm. The purpose of this study is to learn whether or not people should take anti-HIV drugs when they are first infected.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nine Month Course of Anti-HIV Medications for People Recently Infected With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combination antiretroviral therapy has resulted in significantly decreased morbidity and mortality, incidence of opportunistic infections, and hospitalizations in HIV infected people. However, because of long-term toxicities associated with long-term use of antiretrovirals and the persistence of virus in latent reservoirs, it is unclear when it is best to initiate therapy in recently infected individuals. This study compared the virologic outcomes of adults recently infected with HIV who received emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF), coformulated as Truvada, and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV), coformulated as Kaletra [immediate treatment (IT arm)], with those who received no treatment [deferred treatment (DT arm)]. The original study lasted 96 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups (IT arm vs. DT arm). For the first 36 weeks of the study, IT arm participants received FTC/TDF once daily and LPV/RTV twice daily. Some IT arm participants received a different ART regimen as determined by the participant and study staff, if appropriate. DT arm participants received no treatment for the duration of the study. At Week 37, participants from both arms were offered treatment continuation or initiation until Week 96 if they had a high viral load, low CD4 count, or experienced HIV-related symptoms (Step 2). Study visits occurred at screening, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 37, 38, 40, and every 4 weeks thereafter. Clinical assessment and blood collection occurred at all visits. Urine tests occurred at selected visits. Participants were asked to complete an adherence questionnaire at Weeks 12, 24, and 36. Per the recommendations the DSMB review in June 2009, this protocol was terminated as originally written with the exception of those participants in the IT arm in the middle of the first 36 weeks of treatment. Those participants were to continue on treatment until the end of the 36 weeks. At that point treatment decisions were made on best practice guidelines. In addition, the study duration was extended to include a 5 year follow up of participants who did not initiate long-term antiretroviral therapy (Step 3). The study was reviewed by an SMC on December 8, 2010. The SMC recommended the study close to long term follow-up because only very few participants enrolled in this portion of the study. All the results except for the CD4 analysis and time to treatment initiation and deaths were based on the database frozen on July 2, 2009. The results for the CD4 analysis and time to treatment initiation and deaths were based on the database frozen on January 30, 2012.</detailed_description>

Participants who took antiretrovirals for postexposure prophylaxis more than one year prior to study entry are not excluded. Certain medications within 21 days prior to study entry. Participants who agree to receive an alternative ART regimen approved by the investigator will not be excluded. Previously received an investigational antiHIV vaccine Current therapy with systemic corticosteroids. Patients who are taking a short course (less than 21 days) of corticosteroids are not excluded. Current therapy with systemic chemotherapeutic agents; nephrotoxic systemic agents; immunomodulatory treatments, including interleukin2; or investigational agents Known allergy or sensitivity to study drugs or their formulations Current alcohol or drug use that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the study Serious medical or psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the study Hepatitis B surface antigen positive within 21 days prior to study entry Known resistance to one or more components of the study drug regimen Inclusion Criteria for Step 2: subjects in DT arm who meet one of the following five criteria will be advised to enter step 2 and initiate ART: 1. CD4 cell counts below 350 cells/mm3 on 2 consecutive determinations at least 4 weeks apart at or after the step 1, week 12 study visit 2. HIV1 RNA above 750,000 copies/mL confirmed on 2 consecutive determinations at least 1 week apart at or after the step 1, week 4 study visit 3. HIV1 RNA above 200,000 copies/mL on 2 consecutive determinations at least 1 week apart at or after the step 1, week 12 study visit 4. Clinical progression to CDC category B or C disease 5. CD4 count below 200 cells/mm3 or CD4 percent less than 14% at any time on study subjects in IT arm who meet one of the following five criteria after discontinuing study medications will be advised to enter step 2 and reinitiate ART: 1. CD4 cell counts below 350 cells/mm3 on 2 consecutive determinations at least 4 weeks apart at or after the step 1, week 12 posttreatment discontinuation study visit 2.

Study participants on Step 1, DT arm who were not on ART either because they did not meet eligibility criteria for Step 2 or because they did not start ART even after meeting the Step 2 eligibility criteria. Previous A5217 participants who had either completed the study or ended prematurely their participation in the study, AND were not on ART either because they never met eligibility criteria for Step 2 or because they had not started ART even after meeting the Step 2 eligibility criteria.
