	<brief_title>Diet and Behavior in Young Children With Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism is a serious brain disorder that affects brain development and often causes social and educational problems. Prior studies suggested that a gluten- and casein-free diet may have a therapeutic effect on the behavior of children with autism. This study will examine the effects of such a diet on the behavior of children with autism who meet research diagnostic criteria, are monitored in adherence to the diet, and receive similar intense behavioral therapy. Children in this study will be following a gluten free and casein free diet for 18 weeks. All subjects will have 6 weeks of baseline followed by 12 weeks of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, challenge snacks with careful behavioral observation and evaluation. They also will be receiving uniform educational and behavioral services through their provider. Standard autism evaluation methods, weekly diet and sleep diaries and scheduled laboratory tests will be used to assess subjects. An end of study, follow-up assessment will be completed at 30 weeks after the start of the study.</detailed_description>
