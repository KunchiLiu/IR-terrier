	<brief_summary>Memory loss and difficulties with thinking associated with Alzheimer's disease may be due to chronic release of a brain chemical called glutamate. Glutamate helps transmit messages between nerve cells through interaction with a certain type of receptor (N-methyl-D-aspartate, NMDA) on the cell. Neramexane is a new drug that blocks the effects of excessive glutamate at the receptor (NMDA receptor antagonist).</brief_summary>
