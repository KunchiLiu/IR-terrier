	<brief_summary>This study assessed the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of intravenous (iv) or subcutaneous (sc) methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta in chronic kidney disease patients with renal anemia. Eligible patients were those who were receiving stable maintenance therapy with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta or erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) in Phase II or III clinical studies. They continued to receive methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta or comparator ESAs at the same weekly dose and by the same route of administration (sc or iv) as in the qualifying studies.</brief_summary>
