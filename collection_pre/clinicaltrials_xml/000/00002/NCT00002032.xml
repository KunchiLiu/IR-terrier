	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this trial are: To compare the safety of oral rifabutin versus placebo in the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteremia in AIDS patients with CD4 counts less than or equal to 200 cells/mm3. To investigate the incidence of MAC in these patients. A secondary objective is to compare clinical response, quality of life (Karnofsky), and survival between these two groups.</brief_summary>
