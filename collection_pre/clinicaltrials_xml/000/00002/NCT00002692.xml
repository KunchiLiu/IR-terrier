	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of intravenous infusion or intrahepatic infusion of fluorouracil and leucovorin in treating patients with colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Compared With Intrahepatic Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Colorectal Cancer Metastatic to the Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the survival and response rates of patients with colorectal liver metastases treated with intravenous vs. intrahepatic arterial infusion of fluorouracil/leucovorin. II. Assess the effect of these 2 treatments on symptoms and quality of life of these patients. OUTLINE: Randomized study. Patients randomized to Arm II should have a preoperative hepatic angiography; at laparotomy, an intrahepatic arterial catheter is fused into the gastroduodenal artery to establish an infusion of both lobes of the liver. Arm I: Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Drug Modulation. Fluorouracil, 5-FU, NSC-19893; with Leucovorin calcium, CF, NSC-3590. Intravenous infusion. Arm II: Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Drug Modulation. 5-FU; with CF. Intrahepatic arterial infusion. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 312 patients are expected to be randomized within 3-4 years.</detailed_description>
