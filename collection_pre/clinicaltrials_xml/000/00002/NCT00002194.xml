	<brief_summary>To evaluate the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between nevirapine and clarithromycin, and to determine the effects of nevirapine on cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) activity in vivo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Label Study in HIV+ Patients to Determine the Effects of Nevirapine (Viramune) on the Pharmacokinetics of Clarithromycin and Activity of Cytochrome 3A4.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is conducted in two separate groups. Patients in Group I receive clarithromycin orally for 32 days and nevirapine orally for 28 days. Patients in Group II receive erythromycin intravenously on days 0, 14, 28, and 43 and nevirapine orally for 28 days.</detailed_description>
