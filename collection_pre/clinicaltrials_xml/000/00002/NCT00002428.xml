	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a combination of microparticulate monovalent HIV-1 MN synthetic branched peptide candidate vaccine for oral administration and monovalent HIV-1 MN synthetic branched peptide vaccine in alum for intramuscular administration in intermediate or higher risk HIV-negative volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of UBI Microparticulate Monovalent (HIV-1 MN) Branched Peptide Vaccine in HIV-1 Seronegative Human Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volunteers receive one of two schedules of vaccines or placebo administered at days 0, 28, and 168. Specifically, group 1 receives oral microparticulate monovalent vaccine over 3 consecutive days on days 0, 1, and 2, and 28, 29, and 30, with the intramuscular monovalent vaccine given on day 168. Group 2 receives the intramuscular vaccine first, on day 0, followed by the oral form given on days 28, 29, and 30 and 168, 169, and 170. Volunteers are followed for 1 year.</detailed_description>
