	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving them in different ways may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy before and after surgery in treating patients with high-risk stomach cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Before and After Surgery in Treating Patients With Stomach Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of neoadjuvant cisplatin/fluorouracil (CDDP/5-FU) followed by surgery followed by adjuvant intraperitoneal floxuridine/leucovorin in patients with high-risk gastric cancer. II. Assess the quality of life and cost-benefit ratio associated with this treatment. III. Evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and overall staging accuracy of laparoscopy with or without laparoscopic ultrasound in predicting the resectability rate (with and without neoadjuvant CDDP/5-FU), response to chemotherapy, and accuracy when compared to pathologic findings. IV. Correlate the presence of mutated vs. wild-type p53 suppressor oncogenes in endoscopic biopsies and resected tumor specimens with clinical outcome (defined as downstaging, failure pattern, and disease-free and overall survival) in patients treated with and without neoadjuvant CDDP/5-FU. OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: CDDP Cisplatin, NSC-119875 CF Leucovorin calcium, NSC-3590 5-FU Fluorouracil, NSC-19893 FUDR Floxuridine, NSC-27640 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy followed by Surgery followed by Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Drug Modulation. CDDP/5-FU; followed by total or subtotal radical gastrectomy with D2 dissection; followed by FUDR; with CF. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be entered over 2-2.5 years.</detailed_description>
