	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of etoposide in treating patients who have refractory, recurrent, or metastatic ovarian or cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etoposide in Treating Patients With Advanced Ovarian or Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of prolonged oral etoposide (VP-16) in patients with advanced ovarian epithelial or cervical cancer. II. Evaluate the frequency and severity of observed adverse effects in this patient population treated with prolonged oral VP-16. OUTLINE: Patients receive etoposide by mouth once daily on days 1-21 every 4 weeks. Patients with responding disease continue treatment for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease continue treatment for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If 4-6 responses are observed in the first 25 patients, an additional 15 patients will be entered. The estimated duration of the study is 8 months.</detailed_description>
