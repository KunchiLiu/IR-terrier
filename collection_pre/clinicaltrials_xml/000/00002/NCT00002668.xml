	<brief_title>Pain Control in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Breast or Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the feasibility of implementing an outpatient education and behavioral skills training program for pain control in a multi-institution setting. - Evaluate whether patient education and behavioral skills training improve cancer pain control in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast or prostate cancer. - Amend the protocol, with the approval of the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, to a groupwide 3-arm study if analysis demonstrates feasibility and potential efficacy of the patient education and behavioral skills training program. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to diagnosis (breast vs prostate cancer), initial "pain worst" score (4-6 vs 7 or higher), and participating institution. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive standard pain management. - Arm II: Patients receive educational intervention (booklets, audiotapes, and videotapes) and behavioral skills training (including a schedule of practice relaxation sessions) in addition to standard pain management. Patients receive a follow-up phone call within 48-72 hours of intervention to review pain status. Patients on both arms undergo pain and psychological assessments on days 1 and 15. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 patients (48 per arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
