	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells, and may be an effective treatment for lymphoma. Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to kill cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation in treating patients with recurrent or residual low-grade lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Examine the potential role of high dose etoposide, cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation for patients at high risk for disease progression. II. Determine the value of monitoring the quality of remission by PCR assessment of BCl-2. III. Evaluate the efficacy of alpha interferon for patients with evidence of residual or recurrent lymphoma. IV. Evaluate the efficacy of bone marrow purging by PCR assessment of BCl-2. OUTLINE: Patients receive a brief 2-3 cycles of intensive chemotherapy to achieve minimum disease state. Etoposide is administered intravenously on day -8. Cyclophosphamide is infused intravenously over 2 hours daily on day -7 and -6. Patients receive mesna beginning 1 hour after initiation of the cyclophosphamide treatment. Total body irradiation is received on days -4, -3, -2 , and -1. On day 0 allogeneic or autologous bone marrow is infused intravenously. Patients with residual or recurrent lymphoma receive interferon alpha daily. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 35 allogeneic and 40 autologous patients are expected to be enrolled.</detailed_description>
