	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of short term chemotherapy with the Stanford V regimen (mechlorethamine, doxorubicin, vinblastine, prednisone, vincristine, bleomycin, and etoposide) followed by, as indicated, consolidative radiotherapy in patients with stage IIB, IIIA, IIIB, or IV Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Determine the initial response to 8 weeks of Stanford V chemotherapy in these patients. - Assess the complete and partial response rate to 12 weeks of Stanford V chemotherapy in these patients. - Determine the acute toxicity associated with this treatment. - Determine the disease free interval and survival following Stanford V chemotherapy with or without consolidative radiotherapy in these patients. OUTLINE: All patients are treated on Regimen A with the Stanford V Regimen; those with initial bulky, residual, or splenic disease who achieve a CR/PR proceed to Regimen B. - Regimen A: Patients receive mechlorethamine IV on weeks 1, 5, and 9; doxorubicin and vinblastine IV on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11; vincristine and bleomycin IV on weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12; etoposide IV over 30-45 minutes for 2 consecutive days on weeks 3, 7, and 11; and prednisone orally every other day on days 1-84. Treatment continues for 8-12 weeks, depending on response, in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Regimen B: Patients begin radiotherapy 2-4 weeks after completion of Regimen A. Patients receive radiotherapy to lungs, pleura, and other extralymphatic sites for approximately 5 weeks. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be entered if at least 16 of the first 22 patients respond. As of 03/96, it is expected that a total of 45 patients each with stage III/IV disease and 40 with unfavorable stage II disease will be accrued.</detailed_description>
