	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent salivary gland cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Salivary Gland Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the response rate in patients with metastatic or recurrent salivary gland cancer treated with paclitaxel (Taxol, TAX) by 3-hour infusion. II. Describe the toxicity of TAX in these patients. OUTLINE: Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers), Taxol, TAX, NSC-125973. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 32 patients/histology will be entered. If no response is observed in the first 14 patients in a particular histology, accrual to that group will close; if after 18 months annual accrual is less than 10 patients/histology, accrual to that group may close.</detailed_description>
