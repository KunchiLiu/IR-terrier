	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: Concomitant use of investigational compounds for prophylaxis or treatment of opportunistic infections or other treatments provided use of those compounds with ddCAZT is considered safe. Patients must have: Documented HIV infection OR documented AIDSdefining opportunistic infection or neoplasm. Previous AIDSdefining opportunistic infection, neoplasm, or condition OR CD4 lymphocyte count equal to or less than 300 cells/mm3 if symptomatic ORCD4 lymphocyte count equal to or less than 200 cells/mm3 if asymptomatic. Patients must not be currently enrolled in or must be unable to enter an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG), Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), or other controlled clinical program because of patient ineligibility, distance from trial site, or patient refusal. Patients currently enrolled in any controlled clinical trial of an antiHIV compound may enter this program only if they have met the end points required for termination of that trial. Patients may be coenrolled in clinical programs of investigational compounds being tested for prophylaxis or treatment of opportunistic infections or other treatments provided that program allows ddCAZT combination use, and concomitant administration of the other investigational drug and ddCAZT is considered safe by the investigator. Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded: Any clinical or laboratory toxicity or abnormality, particularly the presence or history of moderate to severe peripheral neuropathy, that would pose an undue risk to the patient upon initiation of ddCAZT treatment.
