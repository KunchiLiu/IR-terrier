	<brief_summary>Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interferon-gamma may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of the tumor. Combining more than one drug with interferon-gamma may kill more tumor cells. This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving fluorouracil together with phenylbutyrate, indomethacin, and interferon-gamma and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IV colorectal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I-II Study of Fluorouracil in Combination With Phenylbutyrate in Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine in a Phase I study the toxicity of flurouracil (FU) when given in escalating doses in combination with fixed doses of phenlylbutyrate (PB), indomethacin and recombinant human interferon-gamma (rhIFNg) to patients with advanced colorectal cancer. II. To determine in a Phase II study the efficacy of FU in combination with PB, indomethacin and rhIFNg in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fluorouracil (5-FU). Phase I: Patients receive 5-FU IV over 24 hours on day 1; phenylbutyrate IV over 120 hours and oral indomethacin daily on days 2-6; and interferon gamma subcutaneously on days 2, 4, and 6. Courses repeat weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 5-FU until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which less than 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Phase II :Patients receive 5-FU, phenylbutyrate, indomethacin, and interferon gamma as in phase I at the MTD. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this study and approximately 46 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study.</detailed_description>
