	<brief_summary>To compare the safety and tolerance of oral ganciclovir at a double dose 3 times/day or a single dose 6 times/day to IV ganciclovir given for 20 weeks of maintenance therapy. To compare the time to progression of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis between two regimens of oral ganciclovir and IV ganciclovir therapy given for 20 weeks of maintenance therapy. To describe the efficacy and safety of double dose versus single dose oral ganciclovir in patients who have a progression of retinitis while on the originally assigned maintenance treatment. To describe the safety, tolerance, and time to progression of retinitis during the 52 weeks of oral ganciclovir maintenance therapy in people with AIDS. To describe the safety and tolerance of oral ganciclovir maintenance therapy when given concurrently with antiretroviral treatment (e.g., zidovudine, ddI, or ddC). To describe survival of people with AIDS and CMV retinitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Study Comparing the Safety and Efficacy of Two Regimens of Oral Ganciclovir to Intravenous Ganciclovir Maintenance Therapy for Cytomegalovirus Retinitis in People With AIDS Who Have Received Prior Ganciclovir Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two hundred twenty-five patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis are eligible for enrollment in Groups A, B, and C of the study, provided that each subject has received and tolerated a therapeutic course of intravenous (IV) ganciclovir of at least 4 weeks duration resulting in stable retinitis. An additional 100 subjects who have received and tolerated a course of IV or oral ganciclovir under any clinical trial of oral ganciclovir sponsored by Syntex Research and have stable retinitis may enter into Group D of this study and receive oral ganciclovir.</detailed_description>
