	<brief_summary>To determine the safety, tolerance, and potential in vivo antiviral effects of five dosage levels and a dose to be determined of human anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) monoclonal antibody (SDZ MSL-109; formerly SDZ 89-109) when administered once every 2 weeks for a total of 12 doses to patients with either AIDS or eligible AIDS-related complex (ARC) and with culture proven evidence of CMV viremia and/or viruria. Sandoglobulin will be employed as a comparative control.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: Zidovudine (AZT). Acyclovir. Experimental maintenance or prophylactic therapy with an approved therapeutic agent for a nonviral opportunistic infection. Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole (TMP / SMX). Pyrimethamine / sulfadoxine. Inhaled pentamidine. Amphotericin B. Ketoconazole. Flucytosine (5FC). Antituberculosis therapy. Recombinant human erythropoietin. Recombinant granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor (GMCSF). Recombinant human interferon alfa 2 for AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma. Patients must have: AIDS or be HIV positive with CD4 lymphocyte counts below 200 cells/mm3 and be receiving prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) (with or without prophylaxis for another opportunistic infection), but have no prior medical history of an opportunistic infection. Expected survival of = or &gt; 6 months. Willingness and ability to give written informed consent. A copy of the signed and witnessed consent form must be maintained with the investigator's study files. Positive culture results documenting the presence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia and/or viruria. Seropositive for the presence of circulating antiCMV immunoglobulin. Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded: Significant pulmonary dysfunction. Uncontrolled or unstable diabetes. Significant cardiovascular disease including uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, angina pectoris, or a history of myocardial infarction within one year of entry into the study. Coagulation or hemorrhagic disorders. Any active severe opportunistic infection. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: Therapy with ganciclovir (DHPG) or phosphonoformate (PFA) or other experimental anticytomegalovirus therapy except as stipulated in this protocol. Any other experimental antiviral therapy. Biologicals including immunoglobulin therapy (except those patients randomized to receive Sandoglobulin as specified in this protocol). Patients with the following are excluded: Any significant organ system dysfunction as described in Exclusion coexisting conditions. Previous history of or evidence of idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, agammaglobulinemia, or hypogammaglobulinemia. Any other severe concomitant clinical condition. Documented, active cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease (tissue or organ invasion/dysfunction) at baseline. To this end, baseline indirect funduscopy (to detect and exclude patients with peripheral CMV retinitis) will be performed. Prior Medication: Excluded within 2 weeks of study entry: Therapy with ganciclovir (DHPG) or phosphonoformate (PFA) or other experimental anticytomegalovirus therapy except as stipulated in this protocol. Any other experimental antiviral therapy. Biologicals including immunoglobulin therapy (except those patients randomized to receive Sandoglobulin as specified in this protocol). Excluded: Prior treatment with monoclonal antibodies derived from any animal species. Prior Treatment: Excluded within 2 weeks of study entry: Major surgery.</criteria>
