	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill leukemia or lymphoma cells. Combining these two therapies may be an effective treatment for leukemia and lymphoma. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy plus interleukin-2 in treating patients who have leukemia or lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Plus Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Leukemia or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the safety and tolerability of a multidose regimen of humanized anti-Tac monoclonal antibody (HAT) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) in patients with leukemia and lymphoma. - Describe the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of HAT and IL-2 in a multidose schedule, including serum half-life of free HAT, area under the curve, and volume of distribution. - Evaluate the immunogenicity of HAT. - Identify immunologic parameters that correlate with efficacy. - Evaluate the preliminary efficacy of HAT in these patients. - Monitor patients receiving indium-111-labeled HAT for circulating infused antibody for pharmacokinetics, tumor imaging, and bioactivity (binding ability). OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (Hodgkin's lymphoma vs acute myelogenous leukemia vs chronic myelogenous leukemia). Patients receive humanized anti-TAC monoclonal antibody (HAT) IV over 30 minutes on day 1, then IV over 30 minutes every 7 days and interleukin-2 subcutaneously daily. Treatment continues for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or development of neutralizing antibodies. Patients are followed weekly for 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma and 14 each with AML and CML will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
