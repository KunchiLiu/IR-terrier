	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Surgery to remove axillary lymph nodes may be an effective treatment for women with breast cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of therapy with or without axillary lymph node dissection following quadrantectomy in treating older women with stage I breast cancer that is estrogen receptor positive.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery With or Without Lymph Node Removal in Treating Older Women With Stage I Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the efficacy of quadrantectomy with or without axillary lymph node dissection, followed by tamoxifen in terms of local and distant relapse rates and overall survival of patients with stage I, invasive breast cancer. - Determine the relationship between biological variables, such as hormone receptor status, cell proliferation, and DNA ploidy, and the clinical outcome of the disease in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo quadrantectomy with dissection of level I and II axillary lymph nodes. - Arm II: Patients undergo quadrantectomy without axillary lymph node dissection. Patients on both arms receive tamoxifen daily for 5 years. Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 642 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
