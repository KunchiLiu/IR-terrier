	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients with early-stage bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Early-Stage Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate toxicity and safety of intravesical paclitaxel in patients with superficial bladder cancer. II. Evaluate the efficacy of paclitaxel against transitional cell carcinoma in situ (CIS) and/or unresectable papillary superficial bladder cancer. III. Evaluate a dose-response effect and choose an appropriate dose for further clinical study. OUTLINE: Cohorts of patients receive intravesical paclitaxel in escalating doses, administered twice weekly for 6 weeks, then once every 2 weeks for another 6 weeks, for a maximum of 2 courses at a dose level. Patients must complete 8 of the first 15 instillations and a 3 month cystoscopic exam with biopsy and cytology to be deemed evaluable. Participants are followed by quarterly cytoscopy and cytology for an additional 21 month period. Biopsies are performed at 3 and/or 6 months, and thereafter if clinically applicable. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 19 evaluable patients will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
