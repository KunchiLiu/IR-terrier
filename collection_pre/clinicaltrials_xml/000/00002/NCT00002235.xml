	<brief_title>A Study on the Safety and Effectiveness of Twice-Daily Nelfinavir Plus Twice-Daily Indinavir Plus Efavirenz in HIV-Positive Patients Who Have Never Taken Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) or Protease Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive a treatment regimen consisting of nelfinavir, indinavir, and efavirenz for 48 weeks. During the study, patients are evaluated for changes from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and lymphocyte subsets and for development of adverse events and toxicities. After Week 48, patients with documented virologic response are eligible to continue receiving study treatments and to attend scheduled follow-up visits. Patients who experience virologic failure are discontinued from the study.</detailed_description>
