	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as G-CSF may increase the number of immune cells found in the bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover after chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Combining more than one drug and giving drugs in different ways may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with or without G-CSF in treating older patients with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With or Without G-CSF in Treating Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the role of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor given during and/or after remission induction with MICE (mitoxantrone/cytarabine/etoposide) in elderly patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). II. Compare the complete remission (CR) rate and survival of these patients when treated with nearly equivalent doses of oral vs. intravenous mini-ICE (idarubicin/cytarabine/etoposide) as consolidation therapy given on an outpatient basis. III. Evaluate the feasibility of a second intensive consolidation regimen consisting of BAVC (carmustine/amsacrine/etoposide/cytarabine) followed by autologous stem cell support in patients under age 71 who are in CR and have good performance status. OUTLINE: Randomized study. All patients are randomly assigned to Arms IA through ID for Induction. Patients who achieve CR and who have adequate organ function and performance status are then randomly assigned to Arm IIA or IIB for Consolidation. At selected centers, patients in CR after their first Consolidation course who are under age 71 and in very good clinical condition are treated on Regimen A (in lieu of a second Consolidation course). The following acronyms are used: AMSA Amsacrine, NSC-249992 ARA-C Cytarabine, NSC-63878 BAVC BCNU/AMSA/VP-16/ARA-C BCNU Carmustine, NSC-409962 DHAD Mitoxantrone, NSC-301739 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (Rhone-Poulenc Rorer) IDA Idarubicin, NSC-256439 MICE DHAD/ARA-C/VP-16 Mini-ICE IDA/ARA-C/VP-16 PBSC Peripheral Blood Stem Cells VP-16 Etoposide, NSC-141540 INDUCTION: Arm IA: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. MICE. Arm IB: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy plus Hematologic Toxicity Attenuation. MICE; plus G-CSF. G-CSF during chemotherapy. Arm IC: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy plus Hematologic Toxicity Attenuation. MICE; plus G-CSF. G-CSF after chemotherapy. Arm ID: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy plus Hematologic Toxicity Attenuation. MICE; plus G-CSF. G-CSF during and after chemotherapy. CONSOLIDATION: Arm IIA: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. Mini-ICE. Intravenous IDA/VP-16/ARA-C. Arm IIB: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. Mini-ICE. Oral IDA/VP-16 + subcutaneous ARA-C. Regimen A: Stem Cell Mobilization followed by 4-Drug Combination Myeloablative Chemotherapy with Stem Cell Rescue. G-CSF; followed by BAVC; with PBSC. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 500 patients will be randomized for Induction, of whom an anticipated 238 patients will be randomized for Consolidation. If at interim analyses survival is shorter on Regimen A, that regimen will be closed.</detailed_description>
