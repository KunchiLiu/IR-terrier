	<brief_summary>To investigate the safety of thymic humoral factor (THF gamma 2), its effect on HIV load based on at least a 75 percent decrease in HIV quantitative PCR RNA copies/ml, and its persistence when administered in combination with an antiretroviral nucleoside derivative (zidovudine; AZT). To assess the effects of THF gamma 2 on T-cells, quality of life, and progression of disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Thymic Humoral Factor (THF Gamma 2) in HIV-Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients receive 12 weeks of AZT before being randomized to self-administer one of two doses of THF gamma 2 or placebo for 15 consecutive days and then twice weekly for an additional 50 weeks.</detailed_description>
