	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and tolerance of topical cidofovir (HPMPC) therapy for refractory mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus disease in AIDS patients. To determine whether topical HPMPC therapy can induce re-epithelialization and healing of refractory mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus disease in AIDS patients. To evaluate the virologic effects of topical HPMPC therapy on herpes simplex virus shedding from refractory lesions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Topical 1-(S)-(3-Hydroxy-2-Phosphonylmethoxypropyl)Cytosine Dihydrate (Cidofovir; HPMPC) in the Treatment of Refractory Mucocutaneous Herpes Simplex Disease in Patients With AIDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to receive topical therapy with placebo (vehicle alone) or HPMPC at either 0.3 or 1.0 percent once daily for 5 days. Patients are assessed to day 15; those with no significant toxicity are eligible to receive open-label topical HPMPC for up to 6 months.</detailed_description>
