	<brief_summary>The objective of this double-blind placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the effect of Isoprinosine in a group of homogenous male volunteers who present with immunologic defects relative to: - Comparison of total helper and suppressor T-cell number between the groups. - Comparison of the phytohemagglutinins (PHA) and concanavalin A lymphoproliferative response and natural killer (NK) cell activity between the groups. - Determination of the clinical course of the volunteers after discontinuance of Isoprinosine.</brief_summary>
