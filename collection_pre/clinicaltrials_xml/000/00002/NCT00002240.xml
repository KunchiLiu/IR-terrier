	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new protease inhibitor known as BMS-232632. This drug will be given in combination with 2 other anti-HIV drugs (stavudine and didanosine). The effectiveness of BMS-232632 against HIV infection will be compared to that of nelfinavir, a protease inhibitor that is already commonly prescribed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of a New Protease Inhibitor, BMS-232632, in Combination With Other Anti-HIV Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to receive one of two drug regimens: BMS-232632, ddI, and d4T or NFV, ddI, and d4T. Three different doses of BMS-232632 are used in this study. Randomization is stratified for HIV RNA level (less than 30,000 copies/ml versus 30,000 or greater copies/ml). Patients remain on their drug regimen for 48 weeks.</detailed_description>
