	<brief_summary>This study will examine the effectiveness of clofazimine in the prophylaxis of Mycobacterium avium complex infection in HIV infected individuals who are at risk to develop this untreatable opportunistic disease. In the absence of truly effective antiretroviral therapy, a potential mode of treatment of patients with HIV infection is to prevent the development of the life-threatening opportunistic infections. Current studies demonstrate a possible efficacy of clofazimine in the prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), the most common AIDS-defining opportunistic infection. Future studies will examine the potential for prophylaxis against the other opportunistic infections. This proposal hopes to define the role of prophylactic clofazimine in preventing the currently untreatable Mycobacterium avium complex infection. AMENDED: To include prophylaxis for Asymptomatic and ARC.</brief_summary>
