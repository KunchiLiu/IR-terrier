	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the safety and toxicity of cellular adoptive immunotherapy using autologous CD8+ antigen-specific T-cell clones in patients with metastatic melanoma. - Estimate the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred CD8+ antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell clones in these patients. - Evaluate the antitumor effects of CD8+ antigen-specific T-cell clones in these patients. OUTLINE: Autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells are harvested and then CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones targeting melanosomal antigens are generated ex vivo. Patients receive cellular adoptive immunotherapy comprising autologous CD8+ CTL clones over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously every 12 hours on days 1-14 of courses 2-3. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for approximately 1 year after the last infusion. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
