	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of ecteinascidin 743 in treating adults with advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ecteinascidin 743 in Treating Adults With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ecteinascidin-743 (ET-743) when administered as a single intravenous infusion every 21 days in adults with solid tumors not amenable to standard therapy. II. Describe the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of ET-743, and study the predictability, duration, intensity, onset, reversibility, and dose-relationship of these toxic effects in these patients. III. Propose a safe dose for a phase II study based on the MTD determined on this study. IV. Assess the pharmacokinetics of ET-743 at different dose levels. V. Document any antitumor effects of ET-743 in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. All patients receive ET-743 IV over 3 hours every 21 days for 4 courses. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ET-743 until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. Patients are followed at 1 month, then every 3 months until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.</detailed_description>
