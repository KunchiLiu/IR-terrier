	<brief_summary>The objective of this Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with immunologic deficiency is to determine the effect of Isoprinosine in producing an immuno-restorative response within the study observation period (including the 2-month period following cessation of the 28 days of treatment), measured by one or more of the following immunological parameters: - Increase in natural killer (NK) cell activity. - Increase in total T-cells (OKT-11). - Increases in absolute number and percentage of T-helper cells (OKT-4).</brief_summary>
