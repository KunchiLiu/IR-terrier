	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: Zidovudine (AZT). If AZT is started during the study, patients must have received = or &gt; 15 days of aerosol pentamidine before beginning AZT. Prior Medication: Allowed: Zidovudine (AZT). If AZT began prior to study entry, patients must have received = or &gt; 15 days of AZT before beginning aerosol pentamidine. Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following are excluded: Requiring ongoing active therapy for an opportunistic infection (O.I.) at time of entry or those with either of the following AIDSdefining O.I.'s prior to entry: Toxoplasmosis. Cryptococcosis. Transfusion dependent (requiring blood transfusion more than once per month). The last transfusion cannot have been given within 7 days of study entry. Pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Uncontrolled asthma. Active therapy for tuberculosis. Patients with the following are excluded: Requiring ongoing active therapy for an opportunistic infection (O.I.) at time of entry or those with either of the following AIDSdefining O.I.'s prior to entry: Toxoplasmosis. Cryptococcosis. Transfusion dependent (requiring blood transfusion more than once per month). The last transfusion cannot have been given within 7 days of study entry. Pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Uncontrolled asthma. Prior Medication: Excluded within 30 days of study entry: Antiretroviral agents other than zidovudine (AZT). Immunomodulating agents. Corticosteroids. Active therapy for tuberculosis. Patients must: Have AIDS and recovered from their first episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Be at least 2 weeks and no more than 24 weeks status post therapy for acute PCP. Have positive antibody to HIV by a Governmentapproved ELISA test kit, or confirmed Western blot test. Adequate pulmonary function (vital capacity = or &gt; 80 percent of predicted; forced expiratory volume (FEV), 1 s = or &gt; 65 percent of total FEV; and corrected pulmonary diffusion capacity &gt; 60 percent of predicted). Free of acute medical problems. Active substance abuse.</criteria>
