	<detailed_description>Patients entering this study initiate antiretroviral therapy. For 24 weeks patients receive daily dosages of IDV, RTV, 3TC, and d4T. Patients are seen at Day 1 and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 for physical examinations, pregnancy testing, and blood sampling to monitor CD4 count and viral load. On Day 14, blood is drawn frequently for 24 hours for IDV and RTV pharmacokinetic sampling. The incidence of serious and drug-related adverse events and of adverse events leading to study discontinuation is tabulated.</detailed_description>
