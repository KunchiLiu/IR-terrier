	<brief_summary>To determine whether zidovudine (AZT) in conjunction with bone marrow transplantation prevents the reinfection of donor hematopoietic/lymphoid cells in patients with positive HTLV III antibody and large cell/diffuse histiocytic lymphoma. Patients who are candidates will be evaluated for HTLV III activity and drug levels.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with current lifethreatening infection at time of transplant that would preclude a transplant are excluded. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: Other antiretroviral agents. Patients with current lifethreatening infection at time of transplant that would preclude a transplant are excluded.

Also patient must fall into one of the following categories: Have an HIV seronegative identical twin to serve as a bone marrow donor.
