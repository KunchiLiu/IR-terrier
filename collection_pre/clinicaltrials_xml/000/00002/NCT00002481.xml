	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells. Bone marrow transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of radiation therapy and chemotherapy and kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose etoposide and cyclophosphamide plus total-body irradiation followed by bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy Plus Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and activity of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, total body irradiation, and autologous bone marrow transplantation in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine the feasibility of pretransplantation cytoreduction with a regimen of high-dose cytarabine, cisplatin, and dexamethasone in this patient population. III. Determine the feasibility of posttransplantation radiotherapy given to sites of residual disease (involved-field "boost" irradiation) in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease status (refractory vs relapsed). Autologous bone marrow is harvested before cytoreduction or involved field radiotherapy (IFRT). Patients with marrow involvement who achieve marrow complete response after cytoreduction undergo harvest of bone marrow before IFRT. Patients receive cytoreduction comprising high-dose cytarabine IV over 1 hour every 12 hours, cisplatin IV over 10 hours, and dexamethasone three times daily on days 1 and 2. At 3 weeks, a second course is administered if tumor reduction is at least 25% and in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients with involved sites 2 cm or greater in diameter at evaluation and previously unirradiated active disease sites, at least 90% of which can be treated with IFRT, undergo IFRT 5 days a week for 2 weeks beginning after cytoreduction and 3-5 weeks after harvest of bone marrow. Within 10 days after completion of IFRT, patients receive etoposide IV over 26 hours beginning on day -7, cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -6 to -4, and total body irradiation twice daily on days -3 and -2 and once on day -1. Bone marrow is reinfused on day 0. Eligible patients with residual disease at 3 months after transplantation undergo involved field "boost" irradiation to sites of residual disease. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven or unequivocal radiologic evidence of nonHodgkin's lymphoma that has relapsed or is refractory after firstline chemotherapy Unequivocal radiologic evidence of relapse defined as the presence of enlarged (at least 2 cm diameter) lymph nodes by CT scan or lymphangiogram Biopsy of accessible lymph nodes to confirm relapse encouraged Low, intermediate, or highgrade disease Normal bilateral bone marrow biopsy at time of bone marrow collection required (cellularity at least 20% and no histologic evidence of tumor) History of marrow involvement allowed if present marrow is histologically normal No disease progression in a previously irradiated site A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
