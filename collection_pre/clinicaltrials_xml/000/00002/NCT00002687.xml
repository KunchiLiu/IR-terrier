	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Mycosis Fungoides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of interleukin-2 in patients with stage IIB-IV mycosis fungoides. - Determine the response rate of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the immunologic response to this regimen in peripheral blood leukocytes and serum of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously on days 1-5 during weeks 1-3 and on days 1-3 and 5 during week 4. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 4 courses. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IL-2 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Six additional patients receive IL-2 at 1 dose level preceding the MTD. Patients are followed at least 3 times during year 1 and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
