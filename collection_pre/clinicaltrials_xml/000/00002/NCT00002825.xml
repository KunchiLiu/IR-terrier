	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel in treating children with recurrent solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel in Treating Children With Recurrent Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate to docetaxel in children with recurrent sarcomas, neuroblastomas, or brain tumors. II. Describe the toxic effects of docetaxel in these patients. OUTLINE: All patients receive docetaxel with G-CSF every 21 days for up to 12 courses. Patients are followed for survival.</detailed_description>
