	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill kidney cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of low-dose interleukin-2 in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the response rate and survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with low-dose intravenous interleukin-2. - Assess the toxicity associated with this treatment. OUTLINE: Patients receive low-dose intravenous interleukin-2 every 8 hours for a maximum of 15 doses in week 1 and again in week 3. Stable and responding patients receive a second course beginning approximately 2 months after initiation of the first course. Responding patients may continue therapy every 2 months provided toxicity is limited. Patients whose diseased kidney comprises the bulk of the tumor burden at entry undergo nephrectomy. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
