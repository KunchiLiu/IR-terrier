	<brief_title>SWOG-9342 Chemotherapy in Treating Women Enrolled in the SWOG-8897 Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the frequency of subclinical congestive heart failure by measuring resting MUGA at 5-8 and 10-11 years after randomization in women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil on protocol SWOG-8897. - Estimate the frequency of late cardiac effects (congestive heart failure, cardiac ischemic events, and clinical symptoms) in these patients treated with these regimens. - Monitor prospectively the incidence of annual cardiac events between the fifth and tenth year after randomization of these patients to these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. The treating physician completes patient cardiovascular and routine history and physical examination questionnaires at baseline and yearly. Patients undergo resting MUGA scans at 5-8 and 10-11 years after registration on protocol SWOG-8897. The first scan must be performed within 3 months prior to enrollment or within 1 month after registration on the current study, and the second scan must be done in the tenth year of follow-up and within 3 months prior to enrollment or 1 month from the anniversary of registration on the current study. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 420 patients will be accrued for this study. After initial accrual is completed, approximately 50 additional patients will be accrued at 10 years.</detailed_description>
