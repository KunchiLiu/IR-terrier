	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. Combining different types of biological therapies may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of T cells and interleukin-2 combined with peripheral stem cell transplantation or bone marrow transplantation in treating women who have stage IIIB or metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the toxicities of the combination of low dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) sargramostim (GM-CSF), and multiple doses of activated T cells (ATC) following peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in women with stage IIIB or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast. II. Evaluate the efficacy of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily for 5 days prior to peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection or for 2 days prior to bone marrow harvest. Following PBSC collection or bone marrow harvest, patients receive high dose chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide IV, carboplatin IV, and thiotepa IV over days -6 through -3. Patients undergo PBSC transplantation on day 0. Following PBSC transplantation, patients receive multiple doses of monoclonal antibody OKT3 activated T lymphocytes IV over 1 hour between days 1 and 65, continuous low dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV over days 1-65, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days 5-21. Patients are followed at day 100, as clinically indicated, and then annually. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.</detailed_description>
