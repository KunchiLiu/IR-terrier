	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining bone marrow transplantation with chemotherapy may allow doctors to give higher doses of chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving a bone marrow transplant together with chemotherapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, or multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Plus Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Hodgkin's Disease, or Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the toxicities, response rate, and duration of response associated with high-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide, carmustine or high-dose cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation followed by autologous, allogeneic, or syngeneic bone marrow transplant in patients with refractory or high-risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, or multiple myeloma. II. Evaluate any prognostic factors. OUTLINE: Patients with prior radiotherapy (greater than 2,000 cGy) receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours and etoposide IV over at least 30 minutes on days -7 through -4 followed by carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -3. Patients receive allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation on day 0. Patients with or without prior radiotherapy (less than 2,000 cGy) receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -8 through -5 followed by total body irradiation on days -4 through -1. Patients receive allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation on day 0. Prior to autologous bone marrow transplantation and following myeloablative chemotherapy, patients undergo mobilization consisting of cytarabine subcutaneously every 12 hours for 6 doses. Approximately 24 hours later, patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously. Peripheral blood stem cells are collected every 1-3 days beginning when blood counts recover and continuing until sufficient number of cells are reached. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven Hodgkin's disease (HD), nonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and multiple myeloma (MM) meeting the following requirements: Refractory to or at high risk following prior therapy Responded with at least a partial response to last cytoreductive regimen No bulky disease (individual tumor diameter larger than 5 cm) Eligible HD: CNS involvement at original presentation and currently in complete response (CR) Relapsed within 1 year following completion of frontline MOPP or ABVD Relapsed at any time following frontline MOPP/ABVD or other hybrid Eligible NHL: Any grade lymphoma with CNS involvement at original presentation and currently in CR Highgrade lymphomas (International Working Formulation HJ) with marrow involvement at original presentation and currently in CR, EXCEPT: Immunoblastic lymphoma and large cell (IWF G and H) with bone marrow involvement with small cleaved cell at original presentation High/intermediategrade lymphomas (IWF DJ) in relapse after adequate frontline therapy High/intermediategrade lymphomas (IWF DJ) that failed to achieve CR with adequate frontline therapy Lowgrade lymphomas (IWF AC) with B symptoms at original presentation and relapse after frontline therapy Lowgrade lymphomas (IWF AC) in relapse within 1 year following last chemotherapy Lowgrade lymphomas (IWF AC) with documented histologic conversion Eligible MM: Diagnosis based on either presence of both Group I diagnostic criteria OR One Group I criterion and all Group II criteria Group I diagnostic criteria: Plasma cells and/or myeloma cells greater than 10% in bone marrow Biopsyproven plasmacytoma in bone or soft tissue Group II diagnostic criteria: Monoclonal serum protein spike Urinary myeloma protein Osteolytic lesions on radiologic examination Generalized osteoporosis suffices if plasma cells in marrow exceed 30% Myeloma cells in at least 2 peripheral blood smears Stage II/III disease documented sometime during clinical course Stage III defined by presence of at least 1 of the following: Hemoglobin less than 8.5 g/dl Serum calcium greater than 12 mg/dl Advanced lytic bone lesions High Mcomponent production rates: IgG greater than 7 g/dl IgA greater than 5 g/dl Urinary light chain greater than 4 g/24 hours Stage II disease defined by absence of Stage III characteristics but presence of at least 1 of the following: Hb less than 10 g/dl More than 1 osteolytic lesion, none advanced IgG greater than 5 g/dl IgA greater than 3 g/dl Bone marrow donor available for lymphoma patients with marrow involvement Perfosfamidepurged autologous transplant allowed in patients with no matched sibling donor if: Marrow involvement is limited (less than 30% tumor cells on smears and in bilateral iliac crest biopsies) AND Age is under 60 Donor requirements: Excellent physical condition by history, lab studies, PE No physiologic, psychologic, or medical inability to tolerate the procedure No increased anesthetic risk No HIV infection Priority of multiple donors (in order given): ABO compatible Age over 18 Same sex as recipient A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
