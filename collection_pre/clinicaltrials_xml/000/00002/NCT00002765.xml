	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Immunotoxins can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of LMB-2 immunotoxin in treating patients who have leukemia or lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotoxin in Treating Patients With Leukemia or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of the recombinant immunotoxin LMB-2, an anti-Tac murine monoclonal antibody fragment conjugated to a truncated portion of Pseudomonas exotoxin, in patients with Tac-expressing leukemias and lymphomas. - Define the pharmacokinetics of LMB-2, including the terminal elimination serum half-life, area under the curve, and volume of distribution. - Evaluate, in a preliminary manner, the immunogenicity of LMB-2 in these patients. - Determine the effect of LMB-2 on various components of the circulating cellular immune system. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive LMB-2 immunotoxin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 15-21 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression, neutralizing antibodies, or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of LMB-2 immunotoxin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 patient experiences dose limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
