	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme or brain stem tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Followed by Bone Marrow or Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme or Brain Stem Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the overall survival, progression-free interval, and time to progression or recurrence in patients with nondisseminated glioblastoma multiforme or diffuse intrinsic brain stem tumors that are nonprogressive following surgery (if feasible) and involved-field irradiation and treated with intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or autologous bone marrow (ABM) rescue. II. Estimate the toxicity of myeloablative chemotherapy with thiotepa (TSPA) followed by carboplatin (CBDCA) in these patients. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic interactions of high-dose CBDCA, TSPA, and triethylenephosphoramide (a metabolite of TSPA) and any impact on subsequent toxicity. IV. Evaluate the effectiveness of autologous stem cells in restoring hematopoiesis following myeloablative therapy. OUTLINE: All patients undergo bone marrow or stem cell harvest (investigator option) no later than 12 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. The following acronyms are used: ABM Autologous Bone Marrow CBDCA Carboplatin, NSC-241240 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (Amgen), NSC-614629 PBSC Peripheral Blood Stem Cells TSPA Thiotepa, NSC-6396 2-Drug Myeloablative Chemotherapy followed by Hematopoietic Rescue. TSPA; CBDCA; followed by ABM or PBSC; G-CSF. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 60 patients will be entered over 3 years. If more than 5 patients on any arm experience treatment-related mortality, accrual will be discontinued.</detailed_description>
