No MAC positive blood cultures within 1 month prior to study entry. No symptoms suggestive of disseminated MAC infection (including unexplained diarrhea, fever, and night sweats) within 1 month of study entry. Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded: Positive PPD within 3 months prior to study entry (negative PPD defined as &lt; 5 mm induration).
