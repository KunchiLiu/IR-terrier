	<brief_summary>To determine the efficacy of Stealth liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX-SL) in the treatment of severe AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) by comparison with the established therapy ABV: Adriamycin (doxorubicin)/bleomycin/vincristine. To evaluate the safety and tolerance of DOX-SL compared to ABV in a population of AIDS patients with severe KS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of DOX-SL Versus Adriamycin Plus Bleomycin Plus Vincristine in the Treatment of Severe AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to receive either DOX-SL or the ABV combination. Infusions are given on day 1 and every 2 weeks for a total of six cycles. Kaposi's sarcoma lesions are evaluated prior to every cycle, at the end of the last treatment cycle, and 4 weeks following the end of the last treatment. Patients must agree to have one or more representative KS lesions biopsied.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: Prophylaxis for PCP, cryptococcal, and herpes infections, and antiretroviral therapy (e.g., AZT, ddC, ddI) provided these doses have been stable for at least 1 month. Therapy for tuberculosis, fungal, and herpes infections except with potentially myelotoxic chemotherapy. Foscarnet for new episodes of cytomegalovirus infection. Colonystimulating factors and erythropoietin. Patients must have: Biopsyproven, progressive, AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma, with any of the following: At least 25 mucocutaneous lesions. Ten or more new lesions in the prior month. Documented visceral disease with at least two accessible cutaneous lesions. Two accessible cutaneous lesions with edema. Documented antiHIV antibody. No active opportunistic infection with mycobacteria, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasma, Pneumocystis carinii, or other microorganisms (if under treatment with myelotoxic drugs). Life expectancy &gt; 4 months.

Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded: Clinically significant cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease. Peripheral neuropathy, signs of moderate to severe sensory loss, or moderate to marked motor loss. Inability to comply with the study. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: Other cytotoxic chemotherapy. Ganciclovir. Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded: Prior neoplasms treated with extensive chemotherapy that, in the investigator's opinion, has led to irreversibly compromised bone marrow function. History of idiosyncratic or allergic reaction to bleomycin or vincristine. Prior Medication: Excluded: Prior anthracycline therapy. Cytotoxic chemotherapy or interferon treatment within the past 4 weeks. Prior Treatment: Excluded: Radiation or electron beam therapy within the past 3 weeks.</criteria>
