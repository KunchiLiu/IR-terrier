	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose sequential chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy in treating patients with stage II or stage III breast cancer who have four or more positive axillary lymph nodes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant High-Dose, Sequential Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Resected Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of dose intensive, sequential adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide in patients with stage II/III resected breast cancer. II. Evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: All patients receive sequential chemotherapy regimens consisting of 3 courses each of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide on a schedule of one course every 14 days. Following completion of chemotherapy, patients who underwent breast conservation surgery receive radiotherapy. Mastectomy patients with 10 or more positive nodes or with T3-4 tumors are also eligible for delayed radiotherapy. Patients who are hormone receptor positive (or whose receptor status is unknown) are treated with oral tamoxifen for 5 years, beginning after completion of all other therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, then yearly. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At total of 90 patients will be entered.</detailed_description>
