	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have brain metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of 131-iodine-labeled monoclonal antibody fragment Me1-14 F(ab')2 administered intrathecally in patients with neoplasms metastatic to the leptomeninges. II. Identify objective therapeutic responses to this treatment. OUTLINE: Radioimmunotherapy. Iodine-131-Labeled Monoclonal Antibody Fragment Me1-14 F(ab')2, 131I-Me1-14 F(ab')2. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Three to 6 patients will be treated at each dose studied.</detailed_description>
