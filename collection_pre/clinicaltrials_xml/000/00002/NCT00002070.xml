	<brief_summary>To determine whether co-administration of sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF) improves tolerance to ganciclovir in patients previously intolerant because of neutropenia defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 500 cells/mm3. To assess if improved tolerance of ganciclovir is associated with a favorable outcome as defined by a delayed time to progression of retinitis; to confirm the safety and co-administration of ganciclovir and GM-CSF; to assess the changes in the expression of HIV p24 antigen in the serum and number of T4+ lymphocytes in the blood of patients receiving ganciclovir with or without GM-CSF.</brief_summary>
