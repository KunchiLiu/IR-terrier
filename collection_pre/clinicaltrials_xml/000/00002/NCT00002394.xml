	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of Giving Lamisil to HIV-Positive Subjects With Thrush Who Have Not Responded to Fluconazole Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, dose-escalating study with up to 2 sequential cohorts. The first 15 patients receive Lamisil for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, patients considered clinically cured (i.e., absence of removable, white plaques) are removed from treatment; patients not considered clinically cured receive an additional 2 weeks of treatment. At the end of 4 weeks, treatment is discontinued, regardless of clinical cure outcome. If less than 80% of patients are clinically cured after the 4 weeks of treatment, a second cohort of 15 patients receive Lamisil on the same treatment regimen as first cohort (i.e., initial 2-week treatment period, with an additional 2 weeks of treatment for those patients who are not considered clinically cured after 2 weeks of treatment).</detailed_description>
