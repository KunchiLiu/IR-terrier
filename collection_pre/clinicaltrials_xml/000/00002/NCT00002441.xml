	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if an HIV vaccine, AIDSVAX B/B, can protect adults who are at risk from becoming infected with HIV. Patients who become infected despite immunization will be studied to see if receiving the vaccine before becoming infected will help keep HIV levels (viral load) low.</brief_summary>
