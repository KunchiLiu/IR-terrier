	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy in treating children who have advanced soft tissue sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy, Surgery, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Children With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the response to vincristine/ifosfamide/doxorubicin (VID) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in children with newly diagnosed, inoperable or metastatic non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas. II. Estimate the 2-year and event-free survival rates in children treated with VID plus radiotherapy and/or surgery. III. Establish a bank of frozen tumor and peripheral blood tissue for use in further molecular studies. OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: DOX Doxorubicin, NSC-123127 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (Amgen), NSC-614629 IFF Ifosfamide, NSC-109724 Mesna Mercaptoethane sulfonate, NSC-113891 VCR Vincristine, NSC-67574 VID VCR/IFF/DOX Induction: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. VID. Local Control: Surgery and/or Radiotherapy plus 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. Excision of the primary tumor and pulmonary metastases; and/or irradiation of the primary tumor and pulmonary metastases using x-rays or Co60 beam energies of at least 4 MV (electrons or iridium-192 implant allowed for boost); plus VID. Continuation: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. VID. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be entered over 2.7 years if there are at least 7 responses in the first 20 patients.</detailed_description>
