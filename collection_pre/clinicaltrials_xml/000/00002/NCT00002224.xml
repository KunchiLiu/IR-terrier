	<brief_summary>Didanosine is an effective anti-HIV drug, but it can cause stomach upset. This study tests a new form of didanosine, ddI EC, a coated pill that passes through the stomach more easily and hopefully will prevent stomach upset. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of ddI EC versus the standard form of ddI. Both forms of ddI will be given with stavudine (d4T) plus nelfinavir (NLF).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Anti-HIV Regimens That Include One of Two Forms of Didanosine (ddI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 open-label treatment groups. Group 1 receives ddI EC plus d4T plus NLF for 48 weeks. Group 2 receives ddI plus d4T plus NLF for 48 weeks. Both forms of ddI are administered orally once daily. Antiviral activity is determined by the magnitude and the duration of reduction of plasma HIV RNA from baseline through Week 24.</detailed_description>
