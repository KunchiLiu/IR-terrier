	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II/III trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating children with relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Children With Relapsed Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the feasibility, at GATLA, of a study of the treatment of ALL in first hematologic relapse following treatment on a BFM protocol. II. Evaluate the efficacy of induction with vincristine/daunorubicin/asparaginase/prednisone in producing a second complete remission in these patients, and evaluate the toxicity of this regimen. III. Evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the Capizzi I regimen (vincristine/asparaginase/methotrexate) and Capizzi II regimen (cytarabine/asparaginase/daunorubicin) when given to maintain and prolong complete remission. IV. Offer the option of bone marrow transplantation to those patients who are in second remission and who have a histocompatible donor, and compare outcome of these patients with those on chemotherapy alone. OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study. Patients achieving remission on Induction proceed to Interim Maintenance, then to Continued Maintenance; those failing to achieve remission receive Salvage Re-induction, followed, if remission is achieved, by Interim Maintenance, then Continued Maintenance. Induction: 4-Drug Combination Chemotherapy with CNS Prophylaxis/Therapy. Vincristine, VCR, NSC-67574; Prednisone, PRED, NSC-10023; Asparaginase, ASP, NSC-109229; Daunorubicin, DNR, NSC-82151; with Intrathecal Cytarabine, IT ARA-C, NSC-63878; Intrathecal Dexamethasone, IT DM, NSC-34521. Interim Maintenance: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy with, as indicated, Radiotherapy. VCR; ASP; Methotrexate, MTX, NSC-740; with, as indicated, testicular irradiation (equipment not specified). Continued Maintenance: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy followed by 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy with CNS Prophylaxis and, as indicated, Radiotherapy. Capizzi II: ARA-C; ASP; DNR; followed by Capizzi I: VCR; ASP; MTX; with IT ARA-C; IT DM; and, as indicated, cranial irradiation (equipment not specified). Salvage Re-induction: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. ARA-C; ASP. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 72 evaluable patients will be entered. Accrual is expected to be completed in 3 years.</detailed_description>
