	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose combination chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have advanced or recurrent sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy and Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility of sequential high-dose chemotherapy with ifosfamide and doxorubicin followed by melphalan and cisplatin, each followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell support, in patients with high-risk or advanced sarcomas. II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine response rate and disease-free and overall survival in these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Beginning at least 4 weeks prior to the start of chemotherapy, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily until the completion of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvesting. Beginning 5 days after the start of G-CSF, PBSCs are collected over several days. Patients who do not mobilize sufficient cells undergo bone marrow harvest. Regimen A: Patients receive high-dose ifosfamide IV and doxorubicin IV continuously over 96 hours on days -8 to -4. 12.5% of PBSCs or bone marrow are reinfused on day -2 and 37.5% are reinfused on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF IV beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Regimen B: Beginning at least 4 weeks after day 1 of Regimen A, patients receive high-dose melphalan IV followed immediately by cisplatin IV on days -11 and -4. Patients receive G-CSF IV on days -10 to -6. 12.5% of PBSCs or bone marrow are reinfused on day -3 and the remaining 37.5% are reinfused on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF IV beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, and then as needed for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
