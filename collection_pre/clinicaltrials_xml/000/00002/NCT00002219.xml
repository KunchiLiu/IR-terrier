	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of Adding Adefovir Dipivoxil and Nelfinavir to the Anti-HIV Therapy of HIV-Infected Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the first phase of the study (Days 1-6), the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of ADF is assessed when administered simultaneously with the patient's reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) regimen. The second phase begins on Day 7 when nelfinavir is added to the therapy regimen for an additional 15 weeks. ADF pharmacokinetics are measured on Days 1, 2, and 7 (on a subset of 18 patients); peak and trough samples are collected on Day 28.</detailed_description>
