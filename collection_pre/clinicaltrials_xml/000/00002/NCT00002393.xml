	<brief_title>A Study of Indinavir Taken With or Without DMP 266</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 300 patients are randomized to 1 or 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors of their choice plus blinded therapy on Arm A or B as follows: Arm A: DMP 266 placebo plus indinavir. Arm B: DMP 266 plus indinavir. After 16 weeks, patients may switch the NRTI portion of their regimen if they meet a treatment failure criterion. After the completion of the 24-week period, patients have the option to continue on open-label DMP 266 and indinavir.</detailed_description>
