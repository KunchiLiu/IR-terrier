	<brief_summary>To evaluate the tolerance and immunologic and virologic effects of multidrug combinations of antiretrovirals in patients with HIV infection. Specifically, to evaluate zidovudine/zalcitabine ( AZT / ddC ) alone or in combination with either nevirapine or saquinavir ( Ro 31-8959 ). Administration of three-drug combinations for treatment of HIV infection is preferred over monotherapy or duotherapy. A system has been designed to rapidly evaluate current multidrug combinations of antiretrovirals and allow the addition of new agents as they become available.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety and Effectiveness of Retrovir Plus HIVID Combined With Either Nevirapine or Invirase in the Treatment of HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Administration of three-drug combinations for treatment of HIV infection is preferred over monotherapy or duotherapy. A system has been designed to rapidly evaluate current multidrug combinations of antiretrovirals and allow the addition of new agents as they become available. Patients are randomized to receive AZT/ddC either alone or in combination with nevirapine or Ro 31-8959 for a minimum of 48 weeks. Patients are followed at weeks 2 and 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter.</detailed_description>
