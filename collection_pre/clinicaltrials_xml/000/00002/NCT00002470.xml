	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of the cancer cells. Combining interferon alfa with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of fluorouracil plus interferon alfa in treating patients who have advanced metastatic carcinoid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorouracil Plus Interferon Alfa in Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Carcinoid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response rate and duration of remission in patients with advanced metastatic carcinoid tumors treated with fluorouracil and interferon alfa-2b. - Determine the symptomatic response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the survival characteristics of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously for 10 weeks and interferon alfa subcutaneously 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Treatment continues every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at weeks 1, 7, and 11 of each course. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
