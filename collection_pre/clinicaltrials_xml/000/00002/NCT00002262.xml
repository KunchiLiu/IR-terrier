	<brief_summary>To evaluate tolerance, toxicity, and preliminary evidence of antitumor efficacy of intralesionally administered tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for single intralesional injections. In addition, to assess the effects of TNF injections on Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) lesions as measured by P-32 magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</brief_summary>
