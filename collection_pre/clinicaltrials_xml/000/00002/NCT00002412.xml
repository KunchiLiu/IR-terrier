Any clinical or laboratory abnormality greater than Grade 3 toxicity, with the exception of laboratory values given. Concurrent Treatment: Excluded: Any experimental antiretroviral therapy or immunomodulators directed against HIV1, e.g., IL4, cyclosporine steroids at doses greater than 40 mg/day. Prior Medication: Excluded: Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy. Prior Treatment: Excluded: Radiation therapy within 30 days of entry except to a local lesion.
