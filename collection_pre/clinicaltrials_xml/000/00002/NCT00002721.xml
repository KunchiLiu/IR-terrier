	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of doxorubicin plus estramustine in treating patients with metastatic recurrent prostate cancer that does not respond to hormone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxorubicin Plus Estramustine in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of weekly intravenous doxorubicin (DOX) that can be given in combination with oral estramustine (EM) in patients with metastatic prostate cancer refractory to treatment with hormonal agents. II. Assess the frequency of expression of the multidrug resistance phenotype in biopsy specimens from these patients. III. Assess the response to DOX/EM in these patients. OUTLINE: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. Doxorubicin, DOX, NSC-123127; Estramustine, EM, NSC-89199. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Three to 18 patients will be entered.</detailed_description>
