	<brief_title>A Study to Compare the Effects of Two Anti-HIV Drug Combinations on the Immune Systems of HIV-Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to two study arms for at least 48 weeks of treatment. Arm A receives SQV SGC plus RTV plus two NRTIs of choice. Arm B receives EFV plus two NRTIs of choice. NRTIs approved for study use are stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), Combivir, and zalcitabine (ddC). Abacavir is excluded. The following immunology variables and HIV-1 viral characteristics will be evaluated during study visits: CD4 and CD8 cell counts; naive and memory T-cells; T-cell activation markers (HLA-DR and CD38); T-cells expressing T helper 1- (TH1-) and T helper 2- (TH2-) associated intracytoplasmic cytokines; anti-CD3 T-cell activation responses; T-cell receptor V Beta repertoire; cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity levels; lymph node histology (optional); HIV-1 qualitative microcultures and viral phenotyping for non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) and syncytium-inducing (SI) viral isolates. Laboratory determinations, adverse effects, neurological exams (including mental status evaluations), and lipodystrophy parameters (including fasting lipid profile and physical parameters) also are evaluated.</detailed_description>
