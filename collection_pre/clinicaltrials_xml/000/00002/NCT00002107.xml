	<brief_summary>To determine the MTD and dose-limiting toxicities of recombinant interleukin-2 (aldesleukin; Proleukin) administered subcutaneously in HIV-seropositive patients. To identify a tolerable subcutaneous regimen that will replicate the immunologic improvement demonstrated in the outpatient polyethylene glycolated IL-2 and high-dose continuous infusion IL-2 studies. To evaluate the incidence and level of anti-IL-2 antibody formation to subcutaneously administered Proleukin in this patient population.</brief_summary>
