	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Chemotherapy uses different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy and carmustine in treating patients who have supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Plus Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Supratentorial Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether the use of radiosurgery (stereotactic external-beam irradiation) prior to conventional radiotherapy with carmustine (BCNU) improves overall survival compared to conventional radiotherapy plus BCNU alone in patients with supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme. II. Determine and compare the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with these regimens. III. Compare the effects of these two regimens on neurologic function and quality of life. OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Tumor irradiation using megavoltage equipment (at least 4 MV photons); plus Carmustine, BCNU, NSC-409962. Arm II: Radiosurgery followed by Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Stereotactic tumor irradiation; followed by tumor irradiation as in Arm I; plus BCNU. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 200 patients will be entered over approximately 3 years.</detailed_description>
