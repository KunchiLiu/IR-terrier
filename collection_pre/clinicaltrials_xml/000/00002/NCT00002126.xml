	<brief_summary>To determine, in HIV-infected patients, the efficacy of filgrastim ( recombinant-methionyl human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor; G-CSF ) in preventing grade 4 neutropenia, i.e., absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 500 cells/mm3.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter Trial of Filgrastim (Recombinant-Methionyl Human Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor; G-CSF) for the Prevention of Grade 4 Neutropenia in Patients With HIV Infection.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to receive subcutaneous G-CSF at one of two different doses or no G-CSF (observation) for 24 weeks. Patients who experience ANC &lt; 500 cells/mm3 on two consecutive occasions at least 24 hours apart prior to completing the 24-week study period will be considered to have reached the primary study endpoint; those in the observation group who reach the primary endpoint prior to week 24 may begin receiving G-CSF for the remainder of the study period. After 24 weeks, patients may continue G-CSF on a compassionate basis at the investigator's discretion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: Antiretroviral agents (e.g., AZT, ganciclovir, ddI, ddC), trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (Bactrim), interferon, and amphotericin B ONLY IF patient is on the same dose for at least 14 days prior to study entry (patients may not start or stop these agents within 14 days prior to study entry). Patients must have: Documented HIV infection OR history of AIDS. CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/mm3. ANC (segmental neutrophils plus bands) &gt;= 750 and &lt; 1000 cells/mm3 within 7 days prior to study entry. Life expectancy of at least 6 months. NOTE: Stable Kaposi's sarcoma is permitted provided patient does not require myelosuppressive therapy (other than interferon) within 4 weeks prior to study entry. Prior Medication: Allowed: Prior antiretroviral agents (e.g., AZT, ganciclovir, ddI, ddC), trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (Bactrim), interferon, and amphotericin B. Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded: Malignancy other than Kaposi's sarcoma and localized basal or squamous cell carcinoma. Psychiatric, addictive, or other disorder that compromises ability to give informed consent. Known hypersensitivity to E. coliderived products. Prior Medication: Excluded: GCSF, other hematopoietic growth factors (except for erythropoietin), or investigational agents within 14 days prior to study entry. Substance abuse that would compromise compliance.</criteria>
