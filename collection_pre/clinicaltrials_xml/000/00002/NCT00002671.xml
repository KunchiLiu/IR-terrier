	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of aminocamptothecin in treating patients with recurrent or unresectable epithelial ovarian cancer that has been previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aminocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Unresectable Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced, recurrent, or inoperable ovarian epithelial cancer treated with aminocamptothecin as second-line therapy. II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Correlate the topoisomerase-I levels with response in patients with accessible tumors treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (measurable vs nonmeasurable). (The measurable disease stratum closed to accrual effective 08/1998.) Patients receive aminocamptothecin IV continuously on days 1-3. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) receive 4 additional courses past CR. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within approximately 15 months. (The measurable disease stratum closed to accrual effective 08/1998.)</detailed_description>
