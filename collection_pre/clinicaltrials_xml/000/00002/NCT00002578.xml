	<brief_title>Gallium Nitrate in Treating Patients With AIDS-Related Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients with AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with gallium nitrate after failure on first-line chemotherapy regimen. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this regimen in these patients, and determine if there is a correlation between those parameters and response. OUTLINE: Patients receive gallium nitrate IV continuously on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete remission (CR) receive 2 additional courses past CR. Patients who relapse after achieving CR may be retreated in the absence of disease progression. Treatment for relapse after a second CR is at the discretion of the principal investigator. Patients with leptomeningeal disease at study entry must receive intrathecal (IT) methotrexate with IV leucovorin calcium or IT cytarabine. Patients who develop leptomeningeal disease while on study may continue treatment with gallium nitrate but must also receive IT methotrexate and leucovorin calcium (with or without radiotherapy) or IT cytarabine. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven stage IIV AIDSrelated nonHodgkin's lymphoma Intermediate or highgrade disease HIV infection documented by ELISA and confirmed by Western blot Must have received at least 1 potentially curative chemotherapy regimen for lymphoma Must be past the hematologic nadir resulting from prior chemotherapy (generally 2 weeks from onset of prior therapy regardless of filgrastim (GCSF) use) Waiting period waived at the discretion of the principal investigator if patient wellbeing would be compromised At least 1 site of bidimensionally measurable or evaluable disease (e.g., bone marrow involvement only) History of leptomeningeal disease associated with systemic lymphoma allowed No primary CNS nonHodgkin's lymphoma A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
