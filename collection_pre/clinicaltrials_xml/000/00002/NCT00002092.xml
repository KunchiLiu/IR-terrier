	<brief_summary>To determine the change in CD4 count after 4 and 8 weeks in HIV-infected patients treated with cimetidine compared to placebo. To observe time-associated trends at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 in the change of CD4 counts for patients taking cimetidine for the full 16 weeks. To establish a safety record for cimetidine use in HIV-positive patients.</brief_summary>

NOTE: Patients who become pregnant after enrollment will be permitted to continue on study drug but must sign an additional informed consent indicating their awareness of the issues in taking a drug with limited safety data during pregnancy. Prior Medication: Allowed: Antiviral and immunomodulating drugs, provided patient has been on such therapy for at least 2 months prior to study entry. Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded: Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to cimetidine. Evidence of active opportunistic infection or malignancy requiring highdose systemic chemotherapy.
