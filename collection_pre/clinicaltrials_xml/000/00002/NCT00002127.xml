	<brief_title>A Phase II, Parallel Group, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Thalidomide in Reducing Weight Loss in Adults With HIV Wasting Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to receive either thalidomide at 1 of 2 doses or placebo for 8 weeks. Patients who respond may continue in double-blinded treatment for an additional 4 weeks; nonresponding patients may receive thalidomide for up to 4 weeks.
