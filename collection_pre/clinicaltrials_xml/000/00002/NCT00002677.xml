	<brief_title>Tributyrin in Treating Patients With Refractory Prostate Cancer or Other Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and optimum schedule of tributyrin in patients with prostate cancer or other solid tumors. II. Determine the toxic effects of tributyrin in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacodynamics of tributyrin, including modulation of tumor markers, evaluation of clinical remission (when possible), assessment of F-reticulocytes and/or F cells, and evaluation of hemoglobin F before and after treatment, in these patients. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of tributyrin, including maximum plasma concentration, terminal half-life, area under the concentration time curve, volume of distribution, and clearance of butyrate, in these patients. V. Determine the relationship between the pharmacokinetics and toxic or therapeutic pharmacodynamic effects of butyrate in these patients. VI. Calculate a tributyrin dose, using results from pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies, that achieves sustained butyrate concentrations capable of increasing therapeutic effects with reduced toxicity. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral tributyrin every 8 hours for 3 weeks. Treatment continues every 4 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve stable disease may receive additional courses at the discretion of the protocol chairperson. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tributyrin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.</detailed_description>
