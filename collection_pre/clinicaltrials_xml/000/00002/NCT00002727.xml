	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known which radiation therapy regimen is more effective in treating patients with stage II cancer of the vocal cord. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare two regimens of radiation therapy in treating patients who have stage II cancer of the vocal cord.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage II Cancer of the Vocal Cord</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the local response rate in patients with stage II invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the true vocal cord treated with hyperfractionation vs conventional fractionation radiotherapy. - Compare the acute and late toxic effects of these regimens in this patient population. - Compare the overall and disease-free survival patterns in this patient population treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to substage (T2a vs T2b). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo conventional radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks followed by boost radiotherapy 5 days a week for 2 weeks. - Arm II: Patients undergo hyperfractionation radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks followed by boost radiotherapy 5 days a week for 1.6 weeks. Patients with biopsy-proven persistent disease at least 6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy undergo salvage surgery with neck dissection (at the discretion of the surgeon). Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.2 years.</detailed_description>
