	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Estrogen replacement therapy may improve quality-of-life in postmenopausal women with endometrial cancer. It is not yet known whether estrogen replacement therapy will affect cancer recurrence. PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of estrogen replacement therapy in treating women who have stage I or stage II endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effect of estrogen replacement therapy on recurrence free and overall survival in women with a history of stage I or II endometrial adenocarcinoma. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are stratified according to stage of endometrial cancer (IA vs IB/IC vs II). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms: - Arm I: Patients receive oral conjugated estrogens (Premarin) daily for 3 years. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily for 3 years. Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years and then annually for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2,108 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
