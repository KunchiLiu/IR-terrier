	<brief_summary>PART I: To evaluate the safety, tolerance, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of three fixed doses of delavirdine mesylate (DLV) in combination with zidovudine (AZT) versus AZT alone in HIV-positive patients. PART II: To evaluate the safety, tolerance, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ZDV plus 3TC with or without DLV versus ZDV plus DLV in HIV-positive patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Double-Blind, Randomized, Dose Response Study of Three Doses of Delavirdine Mesylate (U-90152S) in Combination With Zidovudine (ZDV) Versus ZDV Alone in HIV-1 Infected Individuals With CD4 Counts of 200-500mm3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PART I: Patients are originally randomized to receive ZDV plus DLV (DLV at 1 of 3 doses) or ZDV plus placebo. AS PER AMENDMENT 3/7/96: PART II: Patients are rerandomized from PART I. Arm I: ZDV plus 3TC plus placebo. Arm II: ZDV plus 3TC plus DLV. Arm III: ZDV plus DLV (DLV at a higher dose than in the original protocol). Arm IV: ZDV plus DLV (no change from original; same treatment as Arm III). AS PER AMENDMENT 1/24/97: Approximately 450 more patients will be enrolled in one of these 3 revised arms on PART II. Half of these new patients will be anti-retroviral naive and half will be anti-retroviral experienced.</detailed_description>

Prior prophylactic or therapeutic HIV1 gp120 or 160 vaccines. Rifampin, rifabutin, astemizole, loratadine, or terfenadine within 21 days prior to initial study drug dose. Any unapproved investigational medication for any indication within 21 days prior to initial study drug dose.
