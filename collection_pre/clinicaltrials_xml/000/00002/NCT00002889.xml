	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imaging procedures such as MRI may improve the ability to determine the response of prostate tumors to therapy. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study MRI results in patients with prostate cancer that has been treated with radiation therapy plus androgen suppression therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Androgen Suppression in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Establish whether changes between baseline and 2-month post androgen suppression endorectal coil MRI results predict for biochemical control following radiotherapy with androgen suppression in patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. OUTLINE: Patients undergo a baseline endorectal coil MRI, followed by total androgen suppression (TAS) with either leuprolide IM or subcutaneous goserelin once a month plus oral flutamide 3 times a day for 2 months. Patients then receive a second endorectal coil MRI, followed by 2 months of external-beam radiotherapy plus TAS. Patients may receive an additional 2 months of TAS at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years, then yearly thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 180 patients (approximately 60 per year) will be accrued for this study over a 34 months.</detailed_description>
