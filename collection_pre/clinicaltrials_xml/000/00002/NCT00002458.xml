	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody in treating children with metastatic neuroblastoma in second remission.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Children With Metastatic Neuroblastoma in Second Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of ganglioside GD2-specific monoclonal antibody 3F8 as adjuvant therapy in patients with Stage IV neuroblastoma in second remission. OUTLINE: Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Antiganglioside GD2-specific Monoclonal Antibody 3F8, MOAB 3F8. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20 patients will be entered.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed, Stage IV neuroblastoma in second or subsequent complete remission, defined by the complete disappearance of all evidence of tumor on the following: Physical examination Secondlook surgery Bone scan Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy Chest xray CT MIBG Urinary catecholamines If marrow is infiltrated by tumor, complete elimination of tumor cells from the marrow compartment must be demonstrated by histology and immunofluorescence (based on simultaneous bone marrow aspiration and biopsy samples from at least 4 separate sites) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Under 18 Performance status: Not specified Life expectancy: Greater than 12 weeks Hematopoietic: Grade 4 cytopenias allowed Grade 3 marrow hypoplasia allowed Hepatic: Not specified Renal: No renal dysfunction worse than grade 3 Cardiovascular: No cardiac dysfunction worse than grade 2 Pulmonary: No pulmonary dysfunction worse than grade 2 Other: No neurologic dysfunction worse than grade 2 Hearing deficit allowed PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Prior murine antibody therapy allowed provided circulating HAMA titer is less than 1,000 U/mL serum by ELISA</criteria>
