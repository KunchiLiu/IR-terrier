	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of aminocamptothecin in treating patients with advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aminocamptothecin in Treating Patients With T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the antitumor activity of aminocamptothecin (9-AC) administered by 72-hour infusion in patients with advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. II. Assess the toxic effects of 9-AC administered on this schedule. OUTLINE: Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Aminocamptothecin, 9-AC, NSC-603071. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued; if no more than 1 response is seen in the first 15 patients, the study will close. Probable duration of study is 18 months.</detailed_description>
