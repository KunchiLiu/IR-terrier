	<brief_summary>To evaluate safety and immune response in HIV-infected patients treated with multiple injections of APL 400-003 vaccine. PER 2/27/96 AMENDMENT: To evaluate the safety of the vaccine when administered via the Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System. Facilitated DNA inoculation, a new type of DNA vaccine, involves direct injection of non-infectious HIV genes into a patient's muscle, along with agents that promote uptake of the genes into host cells. Host cells that have taken up these genes then produce viral proteins in a form that elicits immune responses in the form of antibodies, killer T-cells, and helper T-cells. The safety of this new vaccine approach needs to be assessed. PER 2/27/96 AMENDMENT: The Biojector 2000 provides an option for delivering the vaccine without a needle and employs a single-use syringe to avoid cross-contamination.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Facilitated DNA inoculation, a new type of DNA vaccine, involves direct injection of non-infectious HIV genes into a patient's muscle, along with agents that promote uptake of the genes into host cells. Host cells that have taken up these genes then produce viral proteins in a form that elicits immune responses in the form of antibodies, killer T-cells, and helper T-cells. The safety of this new vaccine approach needs to be assessed. PER 2/27/96 AMENDMENT: The Biojector 2000 provides an option for delivering the vaccine without a needle and employs a single-use syringe to avoid cross-contamination. Patients are given intramuscular injections of APL 400-003 at one of three doses (30, 100, or 300 mcg) on day 0 and again at weeks 10 and 20, and followed for 16 weeks after the final dose. An 8-week period prior to initial dosing is required for immortalizing the patient's PBMCs. PER 2/27/96 AMENDMENT: Five patients will be evaluated at the 300 mcg dose with the Biojector 2000.</detailed_description>
