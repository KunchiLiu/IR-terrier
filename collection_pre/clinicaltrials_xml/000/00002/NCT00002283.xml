	<brief_summary>Evaluate the effectiveness rate of dapsone plus trimethoprim as a therapy for the first episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in AIDS patients. Compare the rates and severity of adverse effects using dapsone versus trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole (TMP / PurposeX). Establish relative toxicities with regard to suitability for outpatient treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Exclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Excluded: Requirement for other medications found to be effective in the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) (i.e., DFMO, pyrimethamine, and sulfadiazine). Patients with the following are excluded: History of allergic reaction to dapsone. Requirement for other medications found to be effective in the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) (i.e., DFMO, pyrimethamine, and sulfadiazine). Patients subsequently found to be glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) positive will be withdrawn from the study and treated with another regimen. Prior Medication: Excluded: Requirement for other medications found to be effective in the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) (i.e., DFMO, pyrimethamine, and sulfadiazine). Patients who are glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) positive will be withdrawn from the study and treated with another regimen. Hospitalized patients with first episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) documented by GIEMSA or methenamine stain. Patients must: Be willing and able to give informed consent. Be expected to survive 1 week without therapy. Have less than 48 hours of treatment for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) for this episode.</criteria>
