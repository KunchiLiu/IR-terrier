	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells and may be an effective treatment for patients with anaplastic astrocytomas. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy in treating patients with anaplastic astrocytomas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the disease-free interval and survival in patients with supratentorial malignant brain gliomas randomized to radiotherapy alone vs. radiotherapy plus radiosensitization with mitolactol (DBD) followed by DBD and carmustine. OUTLINE: Randomized study. Group I: Radiotherapy. External-beam cranial irradiation with megavoltage equipment. Group II: Radiotherapy with Radiosensitization followed by Maintenance Chemotherapy. Radiotherapy as in Group I; with Mitolactol, DBD, NSC-104800; followed by DBD; Carmustine, BCNU, NSC-409962. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 212 patients will be entered over more than 3 years.</detailed_description>
