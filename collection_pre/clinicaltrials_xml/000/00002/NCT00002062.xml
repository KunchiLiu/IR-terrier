	<criteria>Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with known sensitivity to macrolide antibiotics are excluded. Consideration must be given to the fact that spiramycin is a macrolide antibiotic and, therefore, may have the potential to induce hepatotoxicity. Patients with a compromised immune system may have hepatic abnormalities or even hepatitis. If the benefittorisk ratio does not favor the use of spiramycin, the patients must be excluded from the study. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: Other investigational drugs.
