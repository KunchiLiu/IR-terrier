	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of melphalan in patients with persistent or recurrent neoplastic meningitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Melphalan in Patients With Neoplastic Meningitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intrathecal melphalan (L-PAM) in patients with neoplastic meningitis. II. Determine the CSF and serum pharmacokinetics of L-PAM administered via an Ommaya reservoir to these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive melphalan (L-PAM) intrathecally (IT) via lumbar puncture or Ommaya reservoir twice a week for 2 weeks. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of melphalan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 4 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 3 patients receive L-PAM via Ommaya reservoir at the MTD. Patients with objective or significant clinical response may receive additional L-PAM IT once a week for 2 consecutive weeks, every other week for 2 doses, and then monthly thereafter. Patients are followed every 12 weeks for 1 year or until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 3 children and 3 adults per dose level will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
