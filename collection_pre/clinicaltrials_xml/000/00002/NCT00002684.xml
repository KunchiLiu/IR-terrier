	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, ifosfamide, and paclitaxel, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy works in treating patients with metastatic urinary tract cancer that cannot be treated with surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Urinary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of cisplatin, ifosfamide, and paclitaxel in patients with unresectable or metastatic urothelial cancer (nontransitional cell histologies). OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously daily beginning on day 6 and continuing through day 17 or until blood counts recover. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of stable or progressive disease after completion of course 2 or complete response after completion of course 4. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
