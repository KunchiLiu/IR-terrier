	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give multiple doses of CPI-1189 to HIV-infected, otherwise healthy, males. The study will also look at how CPI-1189 affects the levels of HIV, T cells (cells in the body that help fight infection), and three anti-HIV drugs (zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir) in the blood. Advanced HIV infection can cause AIDS dementia (brain damage due to HIV leading to losses of memory and muscle control). CPI-1189 may be able to postpone AIDS dementia or slow it down.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of CPI-1189 in HIV-Infected Males on Combination Anti-HIV Drug Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Late-stage HIV infection can cause AIDS dementia (brain damage due to HIV leading to losses of memory and muscle control). CPI-1189 may be able to postpone AIDS dementia or slow it down. In this randomized, double-blind study, 48 HIV-infected, otherwise healthy, male volunteers receive either multiple-dose CPI-1189 or placebo by mouth for 15 consecutive days. Each dosing group begins 6 weeks following the start of the preceding group. Volunteers enter the study site the night before dosing on Days 1 and 15 and remain at the study site for 72 hours following dosing. Throughout the study, volunteers have physical exams and donate samples of blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and sperm.</detailed_description>
