	<brief_title>A Study of 1592U89 and Ethanol When Given Together to HIV-Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to one of the following three regimens: Regimen 1: 1592U89 alone. Regimen 2: pure grain alcohol diluted in orange juice. Regimen 3: 1592U89 plus pure grain alcohol diluted in orange juice. Treatment is administered weekly for 3 weeks.</detailed_description>
