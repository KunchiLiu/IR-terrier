	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy with no radiation therapy following chemotherapy in treating patients with stage III or stage IV Hodgkin's disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RT or No RT Following Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage III/IV Hodgkin's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare relapse-free survival and overall survival of patients with Stage III/IV Hodgkin's disease randomly assigned to adjuvant involved-field radiotherapy vs. no adjuvant therapy following remission induction with MOPP/ABV (nitrogen mustard/vincristine/procarbazine/prednisone/doxorubicin/bleomycin/vinblastine). II. Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of MOPP/ABV hybrid chemotherapy in advanced Hodgkin's disease. III. Evaluate the prognostic significance of an early response to MOPP/ABV in patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease. OUTLINE: Study randomized for adjuvant radiotherapy. All patients receive Induction chemotherapy on Regimen A, following which those in CR are randomized on Arms I and II. Regimen A: 7-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. MOPP/ABV Hybrid. Mechlorethamine, NM, NSC-762; Vincristine, VCR, NSC-67574; Procarbazine, PCB, NSC-77213; Prednisone, PRED, NSC-10023; Doxorubicin, DOX, NSC-123127; Bleomycin, BLEO, NSC-125066; Vinblastine, VBL, NSC-49842. Arm I: Radiotherapy. Involved-field irradiation using megavoltage equipment. Arm II: No further therapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 321 evaluable patients will be required; an annual accrual rate of 80 patients is anticipated.</detailed_description>
