	<brief_summary>To determine the appropriate duration of amphotericin B therapy for Candida esophagitis. To compare the effectiveness of two different amphotericin B doses in the treatment of biopsy-proven Candida esophagitis. To determine if low-dose amphotericin B is less toxic than standard dose therapy during a limited treatment period. To evaluate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of the two different dosing regimens.</brief_summary>
