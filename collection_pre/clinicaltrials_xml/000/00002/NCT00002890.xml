	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and toxicity of yttrium-90-labeled humanized monoclonal antibody M195 (90Y-MOAB HuM195) in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloid malignancies. II. Determine the pharmacology and dosimetry of 90Y-MOAB HuM195. III. Study the biological effects of 90Y-MOAB HuM195, including the ability to elicit human anti-human antibody responses and antileukemic responses. OUTLINE: This study seeks to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of yttrium-90-labeled humanized monoclonal antibody M195 (90Y-MOAB HuM195). All patients receive a single intravenous dose of 90Y-MOAB HuM195. Groups of 3 to 6 patients are treated at escalated doses of yttrium-90 until the MTD is determined. Patients with active leukemia who exhibit at least a 50% clearing of marrow blasts after the first dose may receive a second dose after 4-8 weeks provided remaining blasts are CD33-positive, there is no evidence of human anti-human antibody response, and any toxicity has resolved. All patients are followed monthly for 4 months after treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 24 patients will be treated. The study is expected to require 12-18 months to complete.</detailed_description>
