	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients with HIV-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has relapsed or has not responded to chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With HIV-Related Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response rate and duration of response to etoposide, mitoxantrone, and prednimustine in patients with relapsed HIV-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). II. Evaluate the response rate and duration of response to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide in patients with refractory HIV-associated NHL. III. Assess the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) receive oral etoposide and prednimustine on days 1-5 and intravenous mitoxantrone on day 1 every 3 weeks. Patients with refractory NHL receive cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide as a continuous infusion over 4 days every 4 weeks. All patients receive concomitant antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine or didanosine. G-CSF is given for hematologic support as indicated. All patients are evaluated for response after 2 courses of chemotherapy. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses. Patients with a stable or partial response receive 2 additional courses and are re-evaluated; those with a CR receive 2 more courses, while those with a stable or partial response are treated off study at the physician's discretion. Patients with progressive disease are removed from study. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 15-20 patients will be treated on each regimen.</detailed_description>
