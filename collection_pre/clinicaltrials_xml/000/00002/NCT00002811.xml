	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum are more likely to develop skin lesions in sun-affected areas. These skin lesions, such as actinic keratoses, can develop into skin cancer. T4N5 liposome lotion may reduce actinic keratoses or other sun-induced skin damage in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum. PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to compare treatment using T4N5 liposome lotion with treatment using placebo in reducing actinic keratoses and other sun-induced skin damage in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T4N5 Liposome Lotion Compared With Placebo Lotion for Preventing Actinic Keratoses in Patients With Xeroderma Pigmentosum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the safety and efficacy of T4N5 liposome lotion vs. a placebo lotion in reducing the incidence of actinic keratoses and protecting against other ultraviolet skin damage in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum. OUTLINE: Randomized, double-blind study. Groups of 6 patients are randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to Arms I and II, respectively. Arm I: Chemoprevention. Lotion composed of T4 endonuclease V protein encapsulated in liposomes and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline in a hydrogel base, T4N5 Liposome Lotion, T4N5. Arm II: Control. Liposomes suspended in phosphate-buffered saline in a hydrogel base, Placebo, PLCB. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 6-30 patients will be entered in this multicenter study.</detailed_description>
