	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy alone is more effective than chemotherapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation for ovarian epithelial cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of paclitaxel and carboplatin with that of carboplatin, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have persistent stage III or stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With or Without Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Persistent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare progression-free and overall survival of patients with drug-sensitive, low-volume ovarian cancer that is persistent following standard therapy treated with salvage therapy comprising standard-dose paclitaxel and carboplatin vs high-dose carboplatin, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide followed by bone marrow reconstitution. II. Compare the toxic effects of these two salvage regimens. III. Compare selected health-related aspects of quality of life in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by participating center and disease state at reassessment laparotomy. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and carboplatin IV continuously on days 1-5 every 3 weeks for a total of 6 courses. Arm II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and mitoxantrone IV over 15 minutes on days -8, -6, and -4, and carboplatin IV continuously on days -8 through -4, followed by rescue with autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 3 and 9 weeks after starting treatment, and every 3 months for an additional 5 assessments regardless of disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 275 patients will be accrued over approximately 60 months.</detailed_description>
