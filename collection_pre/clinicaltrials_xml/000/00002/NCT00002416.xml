	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two anti-HIV drugs, FTC and lamivudine (3TC), when given with either stavudine (d4T) or zidovudine (ZDV) and one other anti-HIV drug.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing FTC and Lamivudine in HIV-Infected Patients on a Stable Anti-HIV Drug Combination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to one of two arms in a 2:1 ratio (weighted to Arm 1). Arm 1: Replace lamivudine with FTC while continuing on current background regimen. Arm 2: Continue on current lamivudine-containing regimen. Patients are further stratified based upon screening plasma HIV-1 RNA and background therapy. Stratum 1: Less than 50 copies/ml; PI (protease inhibitor) in treatment regimen. Stratum 2: Less than 50 copies/ml; NNRTI (nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) in treatment regimen. Stratum 3: 50-400 copies/ml; PI in treatment regimen. Stratum 4: 50-400 copies/ml; NNRTI in treatment regimen. Clinic visits occur at regular intervals throughout the 48-week study period to determine viral load.</detailed_description>
