	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Giving the p53 gene for ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer may inhibit tumor growth. Giving the gene directly into the peritoneum may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of SCH-58500 in treating patients who have recurrent or persistent primary ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SCH-58500 in Treating Patients With Primary Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer (C95084)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety of SCH-58500 (recombinant adenoviral vector containing p53 tumor suppressor gene) when given as a single or multiple intraperitoneal instillation in combination with chemotherapy to patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis demonstrating p53 mutant ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal carcinoma. II. Assess the biological activity of SCH-58500 by confirming wild type p53 gene expression. III. Assess the stability of SCH-58500 infection and expression by collection and analysis of serial, posttreatment, ascites specimens in a subset of 5 patients. IV. Assess the pharmacokinetics of SCH-58500 by serum and peritoneal fluid measurements. V. Document any clinical evidence of antitumor activity in these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an abbreviated dose escalation, multicenter study of SCH-58500. Patients receive SCH-58500 by intraperitoneal instillation on days 1-5 (depending on dose level). Patients undergo ascites fluid and tumor sampling before and after intraperitoneal instillation. The ascitic fluid or tumor and normal tissue are then submitted for cytologic or histopathologic examination and biological activity analysis. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SCH-58500 until 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicity or until the highest planned dose is reached. Patients are followed at 2 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then yearly thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
