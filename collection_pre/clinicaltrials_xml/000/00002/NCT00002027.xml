	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and efficacy of diclazuril capsules compared with placebo capsules as treatment of cryptosporidial related diarrhea in AIDS patients. Treatment efficacy will be based on the drug's clinical results and on its anti-protozoan effects. Safety will be assessed by the occurrence of side effects as reported by patients at their visits and by frequent monitoring of hematology, biochemistries, and urinalysis.</brief_summary>
