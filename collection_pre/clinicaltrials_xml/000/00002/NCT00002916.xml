	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from human papillomavirus may make the body build an immune response to and kill cervical cancer cells. Combining vaccine therapy with surgery may be a more effective treatment for cervical cancer. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with surgery works in treating patients with early cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery and Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Early Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the systemic immunological response to the human papilloma virus vaccine (TA-HPV) expressing the proteins 16, 18, E6 and E7 examining the cytolytic T cell and the antibody responses in cervical cancer patients. - Investigate further the safety and toxic effects of TA-HPV in these patients. - Assess the proliferative capacity of T cells to the E6 and E7 proteins. - Observe any influence of vaccination with TA-HPV on the disease free interval or patterns of recurrence in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study. Patients receive 2 vaccinations of the human papilloma virus with proteins 16, 18, E6 and E7 at least 4 weeks apart, with the first vaccination at least 2 weeks before surgery and the second 8 weeks after the first one, unless unacceptable toxicity occurs. Patients who require radiotherapy following surgery receive their second vaccination 4-8 weeks after the first vaccination. Twenty-eight patients are entered initially; if at least 2 patients show an immunologic response, 16 additional patients are entered. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, then annually. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 44 patients will be entered over 1 year.</detailed_description>
