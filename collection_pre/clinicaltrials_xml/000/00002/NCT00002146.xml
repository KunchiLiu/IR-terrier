	<brief_summary>To determine whether acute ionized hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia immediately following foscarnet infusions can be lessened or eliminated by prior infusion of magnesium sulfate. To determine whether reductions in ionized magnesium, ionized calcium, and parathyroid hormone levels following foscarnet infusions are lessened by preinfusion of magnesium sulfate. To evaluate the safety of intravenous magnesium sulfate prior to foscarnet infusion by monitoring blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rhythm. To characterize the effect of magnesium sulfate on foscarnet blood levels and urinary excretion of calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and foscarnet.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous Magnesium Sulfate in Modulating Changes in Symptoms and Divalent Cation Levels Associated With Foscavir Therapy: A Phase IV Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Cross-Over, Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to one of four treatment groups. Intravenous foscarnet is administered for 4 days. Patients receive one of three doses of magnesium sulfate or placebo in normal saline according to one of four schedules. Sequence of doses will differ for each group.</detailed_description>
