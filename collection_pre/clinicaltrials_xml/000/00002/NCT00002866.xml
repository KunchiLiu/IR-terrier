	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as G-CSF may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person 's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel and epirubicin with and without G-CSF in treating women with metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel and Epirubicin With and Without G-CSF in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of docetaxel in combination with epirubicin and filgrastim (G-CSF) as first-line therapy in women with metastatic breast cancer (phase II closed as of 03/27/2000). II. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of docetaxel and epirubicin in these patients. III. Evaluate the toxicity of this regimen given at the recommended phase II dose. IV. Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of epirubicin and docetaxel. Patients receive epirubicin IV over 15 minutes followed by docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 4-13. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of epirubicin and docetaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose in which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients will be accrued to receive treatment at the recommended phase II dose (phase II closed as of 03/27/2000). Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-20 patients will be accrued within 4-5 months for the phase I portion of the study. A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued within 7-8 months for the phase II portion of the study (closed as of 03/27/2000).</detailed_description>
