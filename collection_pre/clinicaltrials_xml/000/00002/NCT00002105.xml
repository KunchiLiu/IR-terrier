	<brief_summary>To determine the efficacy of Stealth liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX-SL) in the treatment of moderate to severe AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) by comparison with the established therapy BV (bleomycin/vincristine). To evaluate the safety and tolerance of DOX-SL compared to BV in a population of AIDS patients with moderate to severe KS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized, Comparative Trial of DOX-SL (Stealth Liposomal Doxorubicin Hydrochloride) Versus Bleomycin and Vincristine in the Treatment of AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to receive either DOX-SL or the BV combination. Infusions are given on day 1 and every 3 weeks for a total of six cycles. Kaposi's sarcoma lesions are evaluated prior to every cycle, at the end of the last treatment cycle, and 4 weeks following the end of the last treatment. Patients who respond to therapy will be followed every 2 months for up to 1 year. Patients must agree to have one or more representative KS lesions biopsied.</detailed_description>
