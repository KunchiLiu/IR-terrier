	<brief_summary>To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity of sargramostim (recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF) given by continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) in patients with leukopenia in association with AIDS virus infection. In addition, single dose and steady state pharmacokinetics will also be determined.</brief_summary>
