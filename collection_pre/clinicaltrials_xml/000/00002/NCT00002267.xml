	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to assess the safety and the relative benefit of rifabutin monotherapy in preventing or delaying the incidence of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteremia in AIDS patients with CD4 counts less than or equal to 200, as compared to placebo, and to assess if survival is prolonged in patients who receive rifabutin prophylaxis.</brief_summary>
