	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy using paclitaxel and topotecan, plus G-CSF, in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma that is refractory or recurrent.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate in patients with refractory or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma treated with paclitaxel (TAX) and topotecan (TOPO) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. II. Determine survival in these patients. III. Describe the toxicity of TAX/TOPO/G-CSF. IV. Evaluate tumor p53 expression in relation to response to TAX/TOPO/G-CSF. OUTLINE: All patients receive paclitaxel, topotecan, and G-CSF every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses and until 2 courses beyond maximum response. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for relapse and survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be entered if there are 1-3 responses in the first 20 patients.</detailed_description>
