	<brief_summary>PRIMARY: To evaluate the clinical activity of foscarnet cream on the index lesion of mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in immunocompromised patients previously unresponsive to acyclovir treatment. SECONDARY: To evaluate the clinical activity and virologic activity of foscarnet cream on all treated lesions in this patient population. To evaluate the local tolerance and side effects of treatment with foscarnet cream in this patient population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Pilot Study of Foscarnet Cream in the Treatment of Mucocutaneous Herpes Simplex Virus Infections in Immunocompromised Patients Unresponsive to Acyclovir Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive topical applications of one percent foscarnet cream five times daily for up to 6 weeks; those who show no evidence of epithelialization of the index lesion after 3 or more weeks are removed from study and offered intravenous foscarnet. Patients who show a good response to topical foscarnet cream at the end of 6 weeks may continue receiving treatment at the discretion of the investigator.</detailed_description>
