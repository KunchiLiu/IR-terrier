	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of platinum-based chemotherapy with or without paclitaxel in treating patients with relapsed ovarian epithelial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platinum-based Chemotherapy With or Without Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Relapsed Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare survival of patients with relapsed ovarian epithelial or peritoneal cancer treated with paclitaxel and either carboplatin or cisplatin vs conventional platinum-based chemotherapy. - Compare the quality of life and health economics of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive platinum-based chemotherapy (that is familiar to the oncologist and used routinely by the center) comprising either cisplatin or carboplatin alone or cisplatin in combination with other drugs. - Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by either carboplatin or cisplatin. Treatment for both arms continues every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed. Patients are followed at 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 800 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
