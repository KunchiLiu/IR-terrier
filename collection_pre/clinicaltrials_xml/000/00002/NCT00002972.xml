	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients who have unresectable stage IIIB, stage IV or recurrent lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the therapeutic activity of paclitaxel in patients with bronchoalveolar carcinoma (BAC). - Assess the duration of response in patients presenting with an objective response. - Characterize the acute side effects of paclitaxel in patients with BAC. - Assess the role of some biological parameters in the natural history and the response to therapy of BAC; evaluate the expression of Ki67, p53, and K-ras mutation. OUTLINE: This is an open label, nonrandomized, multicenter study. Paclitaxel is administered every 3 weeks as a 3 hour continuous infusion in dextrose or normal saline. Patients are treated for a minimum of 2 cycles unless serious toxicity or complication occur. Disease is assessed every 6 weeks until documented progression; treatment side effects are assessed separately for each cycle of therapy. Treatment is given up to a maximum of 6 cycles of therapy or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal occurs. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 16 or 25 patients will be accrued.</detailed_description>
