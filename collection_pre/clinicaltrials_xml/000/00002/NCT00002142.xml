	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and tolerance of cidofovir (HPMPC) infusions in AIDS patients with relapsing cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. To determine the time to retinitis progression in this patient population. To evaluate the impact of cidofovir therapy on visual acuity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Label Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Cidofovir for the Treatment of Relapsing Cytomegalovirus Retinitis in Patients With AIDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to receive intravenous HPMPC either at one dose for both induction and maintenance or at a higher dose for induction than for maintenance. Induction consists of two consecutive weekly doses followed by maintenance every other week. All patients receive concomitant probenecid and saline hydration. Treatment continues until retinitis progression, as assessed by retinal photographs, or treatment-limiting toxicity occurs.</detailed_description>
