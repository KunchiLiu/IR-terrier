	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose radiation therapy and etoposide followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with acute leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy Followed by Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Acute Leukemia in Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of myeloablative total-body irradiation and etoposide followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation in prolonging the disease-free survival of patients with acute leukemia. II. Investigate the ability of growth factor-primed PBSC to provide hematopoietic reconstitution following myeloablative therapy. OUTLINE: Patients are treated on Regimen A, then Regimen B. Regimen A: Stem Cell Mobilization. Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (Amgen), G-CSF, NSC-614629. Regimen B: Radiotherapy and Myeloablative Chemotherapy with Hematopoietic Rescue. Total-Body Irradiation, TBI (high-energy electrons used for lung boost); and Etoposide, VP-16, NSC-141540; with Peripheral Blood Stem Cells, PBSC; G-CSF. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 45 patients will be studied over approximately 3 years.</detailed_description>
