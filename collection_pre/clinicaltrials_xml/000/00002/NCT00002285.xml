	<brief_summary>To determine the safety and efficacy of zidovudine (AZT) treatment combined with syngeneic or HLA identical allogeneic lymphocyte transfer in the presence of interleukin 2 (IL-2) as a treatment for AIDS. Patients with documented HIV viremia will be evaluated. Effects on virus replication, immune function, and clinical condition will be monitored with periodic virus cultures, estimates of lymphocyte type and numbers, cell surface markers, in vitro lymphocyte responses and frequent clinical evaluations.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following are excluded: Lymphoma. Active central nervous system (CNS) infection by bacteria, varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, or Cryptococcus neoformans. Any prior CNS infection due to Toxoplasma gondii. Any active lifethreatening infection including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) (if prior PCP then prePCP arterial PO2 must be above 80), disseminated cryptococcosis (if there was a prior cryptococcosis infection the patient must have had a negative blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture taken more than 6 weeks after the last antifungal therapy). Any prior mycobacterium aviumintracellulare isolation. Patients with the following conditions are excluded: Lymphoma. Active central nervous system (CNS) infection by bacteria, varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, or Cryptococcus neoformans. Any prior CNS infection due to Toxoplasma gondii. Any active lifethreatening infection including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) (if prior PCP then prePCP arterial PO2 must be above 80), disseminated cryptococcosis (if there was a prior cryptococcosis infection the patient must have had a negative blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture taken more than 6 weeks after the last antifungal therapy). Any prior mycobacterium aviumintracellulare isolation. Patients accepted for allogenic cell transfer must meet the CDC criteria for AIDS. Those patients who meet the criteria only because of Kaposi's sarcoma must also have a history of generalized lymphadenopathy (CDC category III), neurologic disease (CDC category IVB), or constitutional disease (CDC category IVA). Patients may be accepted for syngeneic cell transfer even if they have not met the CDC AIDS criteria, provided they have had constitutional disease (CDC category IVA) or a specified nonAIDS defining secondary infection (CDC category IVC2). Patients must have a positive blood culture for the AIDS virus before the beginning of therapy. Patients must be skin test negative for PPD. Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 6 months and a Karnofsky status of 60 or above. Patients must sign an informed consent agreement. From eligible patients precedence will be given to those with identical twin donors, then to Minnesota residents. The first patient must have an identical twin donor. Among eligible Minnesota patients without identical twin donors, the order of enrollment will be determined by overall good health, the presence of Kaposi's sarcoma (which permits monitoring of response by measuring lesions) and/or the presence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia (which permits monitoring of response by remission of CMV viremia).</criteria>
