	<brief_title>A Study of Saquinavir and Zalcitabine, Used Alone and Together, in the Treatment of Advanced HIV Infection in Patients Who Stopped Taking or Who Cannot Take Zidovudine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to one of three treatment regimens: ddC alone, Ro 31-8959 alone, and ddC plus Ro 31-8959. Treatment continues for at least 48 weeks.
