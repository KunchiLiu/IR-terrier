	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of taking lamivudine (3TC) plus zidovudine (ZDV) plus a protease inhibitor (PI) with taking the 3TC/ZDV combination tablet (Combivir) plus a PI. This study also examines how well patients follow the dosing schedules for these drugs. Doctors believe that taking Combivir plus a PI may be as effective as taking 3TC plus ZDV plus a PI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Two Anti-HIV Drug Combinations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is hypothesized that a fixed-dose 3TC/ZDV tablet given bid in combination with a protease inhibitor is clinically equivalent in its effect on plasma HIV-1 RNA level to a conventional regimen of 3TC, ZDV, and a protease inhibitor. Patients are stratified according to their current protease inhibitor therapy and randomized to receive open-label therapy of 1 Combivir tablet bid (Arm II) or an equivalent dose of 3TC and ZDV (Arm I), plus their current protease inhibitor for 16 weeks.</detailed_description>
