	<brief_summary>To identify doses of fozivudine tidoxil that are well tolerated and produce measurable antiviral activity. To identify the adverse event profile that defines the maximum tolerated dose. To characterize the single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of fozivudine and its metabolites. To correlate the adverse event profile and antiviral activity of fozivudine with pharmacokinetic parameters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety and Effectiveness of Fozivudine Tidoxil in HIV-1 Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this double-blind, dose-escalating study, patients receive fozivudine tidoxil at one of 5 dosage levels for 4 weeks and are randomized with respect to once- or twice-daily administration (cohorts 2 vs. 3 and 4 vs. 5). Within each cohort, 10 patients are randomized to the study drug and 2 to the placebo. At least 9 of the 12 patients enrolled in Cohort 1 must complete the entire 4-week course before Cohorts 2 and 3 are enrolled. At least 18 of these 24 patients must complete 2 weeks of the 4-week course before Cohorts 4 and 5 are enrolled.</detailed_description>
