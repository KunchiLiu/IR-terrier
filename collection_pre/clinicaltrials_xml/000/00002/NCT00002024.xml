	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: Topical acyclovir. Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following are excluded: Mild to moderate cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections that fail to satisfy the clinical severity criteria. Transplant where a trial reduction of immunosuppressive drug treatment is not feasible. Congenital or neonatal CMV infections where there is not documented congenital or acquired immunodeficiency. Neutropenia unless it is preexisting. Thrombocytopenia unless it is preexisting. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: Other myelosuppressive drugs such as cancer chemotherapy agents, interferon, foscarnet, or nucleoside analogs. Patients with the following are excluded: Mild to moderate cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections that fail to satisfy the clinical severity criteria. Transplant where a trial reduction of immunosuppressive drug treatment is not feasible. Congenital or neonatal CMV infections where there is not documented congenital or acquired immunodeficiency. Neutropenia unless it is preexisting. Thrombocytopenia unless it is preexisting. Patients must be immunocompromised with a serious cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. This would include pneumonia, gastrointestinal disease, hepatitis, or other organspecific disease or severe wasting syndrome. Patients with preexisting neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, and immediate lifethreatening disease can be included if the investigator believes that delay in starting ganciclovir therapy is not advisable. In such patients, the investigator must advise the patient of the risk of further marrow suppression and the increased risk of infection or bleeding; and the patient must sign an amended informed consent form.</criteria>
