	<brief_title>A Study to Compare the Effectiveness of Two Anti-HIV Drug Combinations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are stratified by screening plasma viral RNA results (50,000 copies/ml or below vs above 50,000 copies/ml) and randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Group 1 receives IDV 3 times daily plus d4T/3TC twice daily. Group 2 receives IDV/NFV/d4T/3TC twice daily. Patients remain on study medications for 24 weeks and are seen at the clinic once every 4 weeks after entering the study. At each clinic visit, blood samples are taken to evaluate CD4 cell count and plasma HIV RNA levels.</detailed_description>
