	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective than observation only after sugery in treating endometrial cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it works compared to observation only in treating patients with stage I or stage II endometrial cancer who have undergone hysterectomy and oophorectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy or Observation Only in Treating Patients With Endometrial Cancer Who Have Undergone Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the overall survival in patients with intermediate-risk endometrial cancer treated with pelvic radiotherapy vs observation after laparoscopically-assisted vaginal hysterectomy or total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. - Compare the time to locoregional recurrence (i.e., in the vaginal mucosa or elsewhere in the central pelvic area or lateral pelvic walls) in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the duration of ultimate pelvic control and event-free survival in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare sexual health issues in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center, tumor grade (1 vs 2 vs 3), surgical staging (yes vs no), and sexual health assessment (yes vs no). Patients undergo laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy or total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. After surgery, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo observation alone. - Arm II: Beginning within 12 weeks (preferably within 6-8 weeks) after surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Protocol-defined brachytherapy is allowed. Quality of life is assessed at baseline; at 16-18 weeks after surgery (arm I) or 5 and 9 weeks after initiating radiotherapy (arm II); and then at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
