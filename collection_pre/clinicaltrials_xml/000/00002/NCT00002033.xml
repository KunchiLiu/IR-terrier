	<brief_summary>To compare the effect of AS-101 to that of placebo on clinical efficacy and immunologic function in HIV positive patients with advanced disease. To compare the effect of AS-101 to that of placebo on occurrence of disease progression in HIV positive patients with advanced disease as defined by: (1) development of new diagnostically confirmed major opportunistic infection(s); or (2) development of AIDS-related dementia. To compare the effect of zidovudine (AZT) plus AS-101 versus AZT alone (placebo arm) on clinical efficacy and immunologic function in patients who require anti-viral therapy due to disease progression. Garlic capsules will be given to all study participants to mask the obvious garlic odor of AS-101.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: Standard therapy including acyclovir or ganciclovir for infections that develop during the study period. (Prophylactic acyclovir is not permitted.) Standard therapy for persistent infections may continue. Immunomodulators or specific therapy for malignancies (including Kaposi's sarcoma) allowed only with permission of WyethAyerst medical monitor. Zidovudine (AZT) may be added only if there is disease progression and after the patient has been in the study for a minimum of eight weeks. Garlic capsules will be given to all study participants to mask side effects of AS101. Required: Accepted standard prophylaxis for patients with prior Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Patients must have the following: Diagnosis of AIDS or AIDSrelated complex (ARC). Life expectancy &gt; 6 months. Provide written informed consent. Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded: Evidence of severe liver dysfunction (serum albumin &lt; 2.5 g/dl, prothrombin time &gt; 15 seconds or SGOT or SGPT &gt; 3 x upper limits of normal), gastrointestinal, renal, respiratory, endocrine, hematologic, cardiovascular system abnormalities or psychiatric disorders which would prevent compliance with the protocol. Evidence of AIDS related dementia. Presence of disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma defined as any visceral lesions or &gt; 20 cutaneous lesions; or Kaposi's sarcoma without at least one other AIDS defining characteristic. Presence of any lymphoma. Active opportunistic infection currently requiring treatment unless the infection has stabilized and continuing treatment is only required to prevent relapse (e.g., CNS toxoplasmosis or resolving tuberculosis). Concurrent Medication: Excluded: Prophylactic acyclovir. Immunomodulators or specific therapy for malignancies (including Kaposi's sarcoma) allowed only with permission of WyethAyerst medical monitor. Zidovudine (AZT) may be added only if there is disease progression and after the patient has been in the study for a minimum of eight weeks. Patients with the following are excluded: Evidence of severe organ dysfunction as defined in Exclusion complications or other specified disease conditions. Unlikely or unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol. Prior Medication: Excluded within 8 weeks of study entry: Any immune stimulation agents such as BCG vaccine, interferons, or other immune modulators within 8 weeks. Any immunosuppressive agent within 8 weeks. Excluded within 12 weeks of study entry: Zidovudine (AZT).</criteria>
