	<criteria>Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following are excluded: Prior history of a malignancy other than cutaneous basal cell or cervical carcinomas. Other significant, chronic underlying medical illness which would impair study completion. Liver dysfunction as demonstrated by lab results. Laboratory evidence of compromised bone marrow function. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: Any other experimental agents. Any probenecidcontaining product. Patients are excluded if they have a history of symptoms characteristic of CDC class I or IV including any of the following: Unintentional weight loss of greater than 10 lbs, or more than 10 percent of usual body weight within the last 16 weeks.

OR History of secondary infections associated with AIDS related complex (ARC) including: Recurrent oral candidiasis documented by morphology or by response to antifungal therapy within 3 years. Herpes zoster infection within 3 years. Oral hairy leukoplakia at any time. OR History of opportunistic disease fulfilling the CDC surveillance definition of AIDS. Signs and symptoms at baseline characteristic of acute HIV disease (CDC group I). Evidence of significant neurologic dysfunction as currently defined by CDC following standard neurologic screening and AIDS Dementia Assessment. Prior Medication: Excluded: Previous treatment for greater than 3 months duration with any antiretroviral compound such as zidovudine (AZT). Excluded within 4 weeks of study entry: Treatment with any potentially myelosuppressive drug, nephrotoxic agent, or other experimental therapy. Excluded within 3 months of study entry: Antiretroviral drugs or biologic response modifiers. Excluded within 4 months of study entry: Systemic corticosteroids. Patients must meet the following criteria: HIV infection demonstrated by ELISA and confirmed by Western blot. Signs and symptoms of HIV disease limited to those characteristic of CDC groups II (asymptomatic) and III (persistent generalized lymphadenopathy PGL). Ability to give informed consent. Willingness to be followed by the originating medical center for the entire 3year duration of the study. Active drug or alcohol abuse sufficient in the investigator's opinion to prevent compliance with the study regimen.</criteria>
