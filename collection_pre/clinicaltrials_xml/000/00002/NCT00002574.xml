	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of homoharringtonine and interferon alfa in treating patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Combining chemotherapy with interferon alfa may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of homoharringtonine administered simultaneously with interferon alpha in achieving complete cytogenetic response in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase. OUTLINE: Single-Agent Chemotherapy plus Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Homoharringtonine, HH, NSC-141633; plus Interferon alfa (Schering), IFN-A, NSC-377523.</detailed_description>
