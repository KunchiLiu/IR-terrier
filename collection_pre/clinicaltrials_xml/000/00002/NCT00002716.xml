	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective for metastatic colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of intrahepatic floxuridine, leucovorin, and dexamethasone with that of systemic fluorouracil and leucovorin in treating patients who have unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the efficacy, toxicity, and cost of hepatic artery infusion of floxuridine, leucovorin calcium (CF), and dexamethasone vs IV fluorouracil and IV CF after resection of primary disease in patients with hepatic metastases secondary to colorectal cancer. - Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. - Measure the level of thymidylate synthase present in liver metastases, and correlate these levels with objective response and survival in patients treated with these regimens. - Assess the p53 mutations, and correlate findings with objective response and survival in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center, percentage of liver involvement on CT scan or MRI (less than 30% vs 30% to under 70%), prior chemotherapy (none vs adjuvant chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin calcium (CF) or 5-FU, CF, and levamisole (LEV) completed at least 1 year before study vs adjuvant chemotherapy comprising 5-FU with or without LEV completed at least 6 months before study), and synchronous disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.</detailed_description>
