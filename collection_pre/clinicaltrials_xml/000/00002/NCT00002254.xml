	<brief_summary>To assess the tolerance and toxicity profile of deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine (FLT) after multiple oral dosing for 16 weeks. To characterize the steady-state pharmacokinetics of FLT after multiple oral doses. To assess the effect of FLT on immunologic and virologic markers of HIV infection (CD4+ lymphocyte count, p24 antigen, viremia) in patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC) after multiple oral dosing for 16 weeks.</brief_summary>

Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded: Symptomatic visceral Kaposi's sarcoma or progression of Kaposi's sarcoma within the month prior to study entry (progression is defined as more than a 25 percent increase in the product of bidirectional measurement of indicator lesions and/or more than a 25 percent increase in the number of new lesions). Concurrent neoplasms other than Kaposi's sarcoma or basal cell carcinoma of the skin. Patients who have had a malignancy in the past that has been in complete remission for 1 year without therapy may be enrolled.

Systemic maintenance therapy for AIDSdefining opportunistic infection. Recombinant erythropoietin. Long term therapy with either aspirin or probenecid. Concurrent Treatment: Excluded: Blood transfusion more than once per month. Patients with the following are excluded: Symptomatic visceral Kaposi's sarcoma or progression of Kaposi's sarcoma within the month prior to study entry. Unwilling to sign an informed consent or patients unwilling to be followed at the medical center where they were enrolled for the duration of the study and followup as required. History of intolerance to zidovudine (AZT) at any dose as demonstrated by an AZT related decrease in hemoglobin levels of at least 2 g/dl or AZT related depression of neutrophils of at least 200 cells/mm3 to &lt; 750 cells/mm3 which required discontinuation of AZT therapy. Diseases or conditions listed in Exclusion CoExisting Conditions. Prior Medication: Excluded: Antiretroviral agents within 14 days of study entry. Immunomodulating agents or corticosteroids within 30 days prior to study entry. Treatment for acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia within 2 weeks prior to study entry.
