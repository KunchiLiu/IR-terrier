	<brief_title>Group Therapy Compared With Educational Materials in Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of providing group support, and evaluate the effect of supportive-expressive group therapy vs. written educational material on the psychological health and quality of life of men with stage I/II prostate cancer. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by prior hormonal therapy. Patients continue standard oncologic treatment concurrently with supportive-expressive group therapy. Supportive-expressive group therapy consists of twelve 90-minute weekly meetings with 8-12 members and 2 cotherapists and is based on the following themes: building bonds, expressing emotions, detoxifying dying, taking time to prioritize and set realistic goals, fortifying families, and dealing with doctors. Each session commences with a brief stress reduction exercise and ends with a brief cognitive restructuring imagery exercise. The main portion of the meeting emphasizes providing an environment in which patients can share their concerns, feelings, and thoughts openly and honestly. The role of the cotherapist is to facilitate expression of patients' concerns, offer empathy, and continue to encourage patients to express their feelings and thoughts. Quality-of-life questionnaires are filled out at 3 and 6 months and then every 6 months for a total of 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 480 patients (including an estimated 53 minority patients) will be entered in this multicenter study.</detailed_description>
