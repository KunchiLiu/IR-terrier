	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel, cisplatin, and ifosfamide in treating patients who have ovarian or testicular germ cell tumors that are refractory to platinum-containing chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Germ Cell Tumors That Have Not Responded to Previous Cisplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity and optimal dose of paclitaxel when combined with cisplatin and ifosfamide in patients with germ cell tumors with favorable prognostic features and resistance to cisplatin. - Determine the efficacy of this regimen as salvage therapy in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of paclitaxel. Patients receive paclitaxel IV continuously on day 1 and cisplatin IV over 20 minutes and ifosfamide IV over 30 minutes on days 2-6. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously (SC) on days 7-18 or until blood counts recover. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients receive paclitaxel at the MTD. After completion of chemotherapy, some patients may undergo resection of residual masses. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-43 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
