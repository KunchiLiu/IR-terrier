	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give HIV-positive patients L2-7001 (a type of interleukin-2) plus anti-HIV therapy. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a substance naturally produced by the body's white blood cells that plays an important role in helping the body fight infection. IL-2 may be able to boost the immune systems of people with HIV infection.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study takes place in two phases. Phase A consists of an open-label dose-escalation of L2-7001 through four dose levels. Ascending dose cohorts of five patients are studied. The safety and tolerability of L2-7001 is assessed in preparation for the second phase of the study and to estimate an MTD. Phase B involves randomization of 190 patients to (a) one of three dose levels of L2-7001 plus ART, (b) one of two dosing levels of Proleukin plus ART, or (c) ART alone. L2-7001 and Proleukin are given SC every 12 hours for the first 5 days of an 8-week cycle for three cycles. Serum IL-2 levels, soluble IL-2 receptor levels, and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are evaluated in 8 patients randomized to each treatment cohort of Phase B. All patients completing this phase of the protocol are eligible to be screened for enrollment in a maintenance use protocol which will allow for access to L2-7001.</detailed_description>
