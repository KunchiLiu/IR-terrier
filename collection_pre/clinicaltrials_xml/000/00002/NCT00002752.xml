	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have primary or metastatic brain cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Primary or Metastatic Brain Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxic effects of intracranial iodine I 131 labeled anti-tenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6 in patients with primary or metastatic anaplastic gliomas. - Determine the objective therapeutic response of these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of iodine I 131 labeled anti-tenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6 (MOAB 81C6). Patients are stratified by prior external beam radiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients receive iodine I 131 labeled MOAB 81C6 intraventricularly followed by unlabeled MOAB 81C6 intraventricularly. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of iodine I 131 labeled MOAB 81C6 until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 2 years, every 2 months for 2 years, and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-6 patients per cohort will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
