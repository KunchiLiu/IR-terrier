	<brief_summary>To ascertain the effect of thalidomide on immune responses to vaccination with polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and tetanus toxoid in HIV-infected patients; particularly, on markers of immune activation and parameters of specific, anti-HIV cellular immunity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Thalidomide in HIV-Infected Patients Who Are Receiving HAART</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive oral thalidomide in a blinded, placebo-controlled study. [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/25/98: This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which thalidomide or placebo is administered for 21 days. After the first week of therapy, patients receive immunizations with keyhole limpet hemocyanin and polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine. Study therapy is stopped for 2 weeks after the immunizations. Following the immunizations, detailed evaluations of the immune responses to the vaccines are conducted over the next 8 weeks.]</detailed_description>

Peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or higher by Division of AIDS toxicity criteria. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: Other investigational HIVdrugs. Immunomodulatory or potentially immunomodulatory drugs, such as glucocorticoids, hematopoietins, interleukin2, interferon, or pentoxifylline. Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded: History of serious hypersensitivity to tetanus toxoid or any of the vaccine components. Prior Medication: Excluded: Previous immunization with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [or, AS PER AMENDMENT 11/25/98, keyhole limpet hemocyanin vaccine]. Tetanus toxoid booster within 5 years [deleted AS PER AMENDMENT 11/25/98]. Other investigational HIVdrugs within 6 weeks of enrollment. Immunomodulatory or potentially immunomodulatory drugs, such as glucocorticoids, hematopoietins, interleukin2, interferon, or pentoxifylline within 6 weeks of enrollment. Risk Behavior: Excluded: Active drug or alcohol abuse. Required: Effective combination antiretroviral therapy including two nucleoside analog agents (ZDV, 3TC, ddI, ddC, or d4T) and nelfinavir or indinavir, for at least one month prior to study entry. [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/25/98: On stable, effective, highlyactive antiretroviral therapy with combinations of any FDAapproved antiHIV drugs for at least 3 months prior to entry.]</criteria>
