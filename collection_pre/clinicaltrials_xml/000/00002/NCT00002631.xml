	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not known whether high-dose radiation therapy is more effective than standard dose radiation therapy in treating cancer of the esophagus. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus high- or standard-dose radiation therapy in treating patients with cancer of the esophagus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Cancer of the Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare, using a prospective controlled randomized study design, the survival and failure patterns associated with conventional-dose radiotherapy and fluorouracil/cisplatin (5-FU/CDDP) vs. high-dose radiotherapy and 5-FU/CDDP in patients with esophageal cancer. II. Compare the tolerance and quality of life of patients receiving these therapies. OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy plus 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy/Radiosensitization. Tumor irradiation using megavoltage photons of at least 6 MV (electrons may be used if required to boost supraclavicular fossa dose); plus Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875; Fluorouracil, 5-FU, NSC-19893. High-dose radiotherapy. Arm II: Radiotherapy plus 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy/Radiosensitization. Tumor irradiation as in Arm I; plus CDDP/5-FU. Conventional-dose radiotherapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 298 patients will be entered over 4 years.</detailed_description>
