	<brief_summary>To determine the time course of development of resistance to atevirdine mesylate ( U-87201E ) in patients with HIV isolates showing in vitro resistance to zidovudine ( AZT ). To determine the genotype changes in HIV reverse transcriptase associated with in vitro AZT resistance to U-87201E. To determine the genotype and phenotype effects of treatment with a nondideoxynucleoside agent on the alterations of the HIV-1 population associated with in vitro AZT resistance. To determine whether serial passage of patient pre-drug HIV isolates in the presence of U-87201E will generate the resistant mutants that may subsequently emerge in the patients.</brief_summary>

Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded: Clinically significant hypersensitivity to piperazine type drugs (Antepar, Stelazine). Severe uncontrollable diarrhea or vomiting or known malabsorption. Symptomatic hyperlipidemia. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: Other experimental drugs. AZT, ddI, ddC, foscarnet, immunomodulators or other agents with primary antiretroviral activity (exemptions by principal investigator permitted). Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded: History of clinically significant cardiovascular disease or nervous system or muscle disease, including seizures, peripheral neuropathy, dementia, or motor dysfunction. Prior Medication: Excluded: Experimental drugs within 4 weeks prior to study entry.</criteria>
