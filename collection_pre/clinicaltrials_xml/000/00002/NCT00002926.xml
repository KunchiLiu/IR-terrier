	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of peripheral stem cell transplantation with high-dose cytarabine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myelogenous leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Acute Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the value of autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation versus high dose cytarabine (Ara-C) performed after a common induction and consolidation course in patients with poor prognosis myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia secondary to MDS. - Compare the disease free survival and overall survival of patients who reached complete recovery according to the presence of an HLA-identical donor. - Monitor cytogenetic and clonal remission after intensive antileukemic therapy including stem cell transplantation. - Monitor residual disease and the hematopoietic clonal status of autologous peripheral blood stem cells mobilized after one consolidation course. - Assess recovery time of granulocyte and platelet counts following each treatment step. OUTLINE: Induction treatment with idarubicin on days 1,3,5; Ara-C from days 1 through 10; etoposide on days 1 through 5. On day 28 there will be assessment of responses. If there is at least partial response, the cycle will repeat the induction course for another 28 days. There is peripheral blood stem cell collection and cryopreservation following family HLA-typing. If there is no HLA match, then those who remained in remission after these consolidation courses will be randomized to either peripheral blood stem cell transplantation or HiDAC treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 80 patients will be entered per year.</detailed_description>
