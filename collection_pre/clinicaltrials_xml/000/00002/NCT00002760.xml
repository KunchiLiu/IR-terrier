	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antiandrogen withdrawal may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of ketoconazole and hydrocortisone for antiandrogen withdrawal in treating men with prostate cancer that is refractory to hormone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antiandrogen Withdrawal in Treating Patients With Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the response rate and duration of response to antiandrogen withdrawal alone vs. antiandrogen withdrawal plus ketoconazole/hydrocortisone in patients with advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer. II. Compare the response rate and duration of response to ketoconazole/hydrocortisone in patients treated with previous vs. simultaneous antiandrogen withdrawal. III. Evaluate the proportion of patients with circulating prostate cancer cells identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR). IV. Determine whether rt-PCR positively correlates with response. V. Compare the likelihood of response to these regimens in patients whose prior hormonal therapy consisted of initial combined androgen blockage vs. initial monotherapy followed later by an antiandrogen. VI. Correlate adrenal androgen synthesis suppression, as measured by levels of various adrenal androgens, with response. OUTLINE: Randomized study. Patients who develop progressive disease on Arm I cross to Arm II. Arm I: Antiandrogen Withdrawal. Antiandrogen stopped. Arm II: Antiandrogen Withdrawal plus Adrenal Androgen Blockade. Antiandrogen stopped; plus Ketoconazole, KCZ; Hydrocortisone, HC, NSC-10483. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 250 patients will be entered over 3 years to attain 238 eligible patients (including 25-40 minority patients).</detailed_description>
