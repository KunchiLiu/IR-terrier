	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with carboplatin and topotecan in treating patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia or recurrent acute leukemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of carboplatin plus topotecan given as a 5-day continuous infusion in patients with recurrent acute lymphocytic or myeloid leukemia or accelerated or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. - Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Gather preliminary information on the activity of this regimen in these patients. - Examine the pharmacokinetics of topotecan when administered concurrently with carboplatin. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan. Patients are stratified according to prior bone marrow transplant (BMT) (yes vs no). - Induction: Patients receive carboplatin and topotecan IV 3 times a day on days 1-5. Patients may also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) beginning on day 7 or 14. Retreatment is based on results of marrow exam on day 10-14. Patients with less than 5% blasts undergo a second marrow exam upon blood count recovery or on day 26-30, whichever is earlier. Patients with at least 5% blasts after day 21 receive one more course, in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and at the discretion of the investigator. Patients with no greater than 5% blasts begin G-CSF if blood counts are not recovered, then proceed to consolidation. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of up to 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients with prior BMT will not be entered at any level until 3-6 patients with no prior BMT tolerate that level. - Consolidation (begins around day 42 of last Induction course): Patients with ALL/AML in complete remission (CR) or CML in chronic phase receive 2 additional courses (same doses) 6-8 weeks apart. Patients experiencing a relapse after CR lasting at least 6 months may receive additional treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-20 patients without and 2-20 patients with prior bone marrow transfer will be accrued for this study over 2-2.5 years.</detailed_description>
