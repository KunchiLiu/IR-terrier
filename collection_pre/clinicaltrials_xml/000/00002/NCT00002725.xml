	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin-1 in treating patients with recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bryostatin-1 in Treating Patients With Recurrent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response to bryostatin 1 (BRYO) administered weekly for 3 weeks in patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Assess the toxic effects of this treatment. III. Establish the correlation between PKC isoenzyme activity and BRYO function in lymphoma cells and normal lymphocytes. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BRYO and its relationship to pharmacodynamics. OUTLINE: Single-Agent Chemotherapy/Differentiation Therapy. Bryostatin 1, BRYO, NSC-339555.</detailed_description>
