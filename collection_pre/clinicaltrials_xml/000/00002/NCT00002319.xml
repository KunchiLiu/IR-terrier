	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Stealth liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX-SL) in the long-term treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in patients who previously had good responses to DOX-SL in controlled studies of limited duration, or those with KS who discontinued treatment with another Kaposi's sarcoma therapy because of inadequate efficacy or unacceptable toxicity. To provide a defined protocol for Kaposi's sarcoma patients for whom DOX-SL therapy is indicated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of DOX-SL in the Treatment of AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive DOX-SL every 3 weeks for a maximum of 20 cycles (including any cycles from a previous DOX-SL study). KS lesions are evaluated prior to administration of each treatment, at the end of the final treatment cycle, and at 4 weeks following the end of the final treatment. Patients who respond will be followed every 2 months for up to 1 year. Study treatment may be interrupted for up to 4 months because of complete response, development of opportunistic infections, or adverse drug effects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Allowed: Prophylaxis for PCP, cryptococcal, and herpes infections, and antiretroviral therapy provided these doses have been stable for at least 1 month. Maintenance therapy for tuberculosis, fungal, and herpes infections. Therapy for new episodes of tuberculosis, fungal, and herpes infections except with potentially myelotoxic chemotherapy. Foscarnet or ganciclovir for CMV infection. Colony stimulating factors and erythropoietin. Patients must have: Moderate to severe AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma. Documented antiHIV antibody. No active opportunistic infection with mycobacteria, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasma, Pneumocystis carinii, or other microorganisms (if under treatment with myelotoxic drugs). NOTE: Eligible KS patients include those who have discontinued therapy in the control arm of a DOXSL KS study because of side effects or inadequate efficacy OR other KS patients for whom DOXSL is believed to be indicated. Patients must not be eligible for other Liposome Technology protocols comparing DOXSL with established therapies. Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded: Clinically significant cardiac disease. Confusion or disorientation. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: Other cytotoxic cancer chemotherapy. Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded: Prior neoplasms treated with extensive chemotherapy that, in the investigator's opinion, has led to an irreversibly compromised marrow function. History of idiosyncratic or allergic reaction to anthracyclines. History of major psychiatric illness. Prior Medication: Excluded within the past 4 weeks: Cytotoxic chemotherapy (other than in a qualifying Liposome Technology protocol). Interferon treatment. Prior Treatment: Excluded within the past 3 weeks: Radiation or electron beam therapy.</criteria>
