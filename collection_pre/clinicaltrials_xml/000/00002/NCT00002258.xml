	<brief_summary>To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose of SDZ ILE 964 administered by daily subcutaneous injections in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who have cytopenias (low blood cell counts). To obtain information about the biologic effects of SDZ ILE 964 administration in improving blood counts in HIV-infected patients. To obtain information about the effects of SDZ ILE-964 administration on both parameters of HIV replication and on residual immunologic function.</brief_summary>

Symptoms of CNS disease referable to HIV infection. Major surgery within 4 weeks of study entry. History of major pulmonary or cardiac disease. History of any prior malignancy other than Kaposi's sarcoma or noninvasive subcutaneous carcinoma. Documented allergic disorder such as asthma, history of anaphylaxis, atopy, serum sickness, or bronchospasm. Not allowed within 2 weeks prior to study entry: zidovudine (AZT). Not allowed within 4 weeks prior to study entry: systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy; investigational drugs other than ddI; medications known to be myelosuppressive as ganciclovir, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or dapsone.
