	<brief_summary>To assess the effects of two doses of synthetic peptide construction 3 ( SPC3 ) on HIV-1 plasma levels (as measured by RNA PCR Amplicor) and on lymphocyte subsets in patients with initial viral load above 10,000 copies/ml. To study the safety of SPC3 and the kinetics of HIV-1 plasma level changes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety and Effectiveness of SPC3 in HIV-1 Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first five patients receive SPC3 daily for 3 weeks. If that dose is tolerated, the dose is increased and given to the next 5 patients for 3 weeks. The remaining ten patients receive a dose of SPC3 based on response to the previous two dose levels. Patients are followed through day 28.</detailed_description>
