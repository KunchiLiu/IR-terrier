	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill melanoma cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response and survival rates of patients with metastatic melanoma following induction with high-dose and maintenance with low-dose interleukin-2. II. Assess the toxicity of this regimen. OUTLINE: All patients receive high-dose interleukin-2 over 24 hours, followed by low-dose interleukin-2 for 4 days in the absence of toxicity. Patients receive a second cycle beginning 9-13 days after completion of the first cycle, with response assessed approximately 2 months after initiating therapy. Patients with stable or responding disease receive a second course as above; those with a continued response may receive additional courses provided toxicity is limited. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20 patients will be entered.</detailed_description>
