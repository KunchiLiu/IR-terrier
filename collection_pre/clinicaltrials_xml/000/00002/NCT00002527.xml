	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. The use of aspirin may be an effective way to prevent the recurrence of polyps in colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of aspirin in treating patients who have stage I, stage II, or stage III colorectal cancer that has been surgically removed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aspirin in Treating Patients With Colorectal Cancer That Has Been Surgically Removed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether aspirin administered at a dose of 325 mg/day will decrease the number and size of new adenomas in patients with Dukes' A/B1/B2/C colorectal cancer who have undergone curative surgical resection. II. Assess whether this dose of aspirin will increase disease-free survival in these patients. OUTLINE: Randomized, double-blind study. Arm I: Chemoprevention. Enteric-coated Aspirin, ASA, NSC-27223. Arm II: Control. Placebo, PLCB.</detailed_description>
