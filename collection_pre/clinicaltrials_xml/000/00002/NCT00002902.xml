	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan plus ICI D1694 in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Plus ICI D1694 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of ICI D1694 (TDX) when given with irinotecan (CPT-11) every 3 weeks in patients with advanced solid malignancies. II. Describe the pharmacokinetics of TDX and CPT-11 when given in combination. III. Investigate the relationship between topoisomerase I expression in peripheral mononuclear cells and myelosuppression and/or gastrointestinal toxicity. IV. Investigate the effect of CPT-11 on thymidylate synthase expression in tumor. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalating study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ICI D1694 (TDX) given in combination with irinotecan. Irinotecan is given intravenously on day 1 and ICI D1694 intravenously on day 2. Treatment is repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity intervenes. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalated doses of TDX until the MTD is defined; an additional 10-12 patients will be entered at the MTD to confirm this as a recommended phase II dose. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 30-35 patients will be entered.</detailed_description>
