	<brief_title>A Phase II/III Study of Cysteamine (Mercaptoethylamine) and Zidovudine for the Treatment of HIV Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive high or low doses of cysteamine plus AZT or placebo plus AZT. The target dose of cysteamine is determined by titration of the dose over a 6-week period, after which the patient receives 24 additional weeks of treatment. An initial cohort of 36 patients will be enrolled in a 10-week pilot phase. Accrual will be temporarily suspended while data from the pilot phase is assessed.</detailed_description>
