	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with cancer of the esophagus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Cancer of the Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose and recommend a phase II dose for paclitaxel (TAX) when administered as a 96-hour intravenous infusion with a weekly fixed dose of intravenous cisplatin (CDDP) during concurrent radiotherapy for patients with localized esophageal cancer. II. Estimate the response rate of patients treated with 2 courses of TAX/CDDP induction chemotherapy and the complete response rate of patients treated with TAX/CDDP and concurrent radiotherapy. III. Describe the toxic effects of TAX/CDDP prior to and during radiotherapy. IV. Describe the pharmacokinetics of TAX as a continuous infusion (CI) over 96 hours. V. Evaluate, by flow cytometry, the ability of CI TAX to block esophageal cancer cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle. OUTLINE: After the MTD of TAX is reached on Part A, new patients are entered on Part B. The following acronyms are used: CDDP Cisplatin, NSC-119875 EBRT External-beam radiotherapy TAX Paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers), NSC-125973 PART A: Radiotherapy plus 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. EBRT using megavoltage equipment (&gt;/= 10 MV recommended; electron boost allowed for subclavicular fossae); plus TAX/CDDP. PART B: 2-Drug Combination Induction Chemotherapy followed by Radiotherapy plus 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. TAX/CDDP; followed by EBRT as in Part A; plus TAX/CDDP. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 3 patients/dose will be entered on Part A (up to 24 patients) and 3-6 patients on Part B.</detailed_description>
