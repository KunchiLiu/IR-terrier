	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. Combining different types of biological therapies, including interferon alfa, interleukin-2, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapies, including interferon alfa, interleukin-2, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, in treating patients with metastatic cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and failure-free survival in patients with metastatic cancer (preferably melanoma or renal cell) treated with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), interferon alfa (IFN-A), and interleukin-2 (IL-2). II. Describe the toxic effects and costs associated with this therapy to assess risk benefit and cost benefit. III. Assess the relative value of administering low- or high-dose TIL, as well as the value of administering IFN-A before TIL, IL-2 with TIL, or cimetidine with TIL. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center, tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) dose (low vs high), and medical condition suitable for interferon alfa (IFN-A)/interleukin-2 (IL-2) (yes vs no). Patients are assigned to one of two treatment regimens based on entry criteria. Regimen A (preferred): Patients meeting the preferred entry criteria receive IFN-A subcutaneously on days 1-4, TIL expanded in vitro with IL-2 IV on day 5, and IL-2 IV continuously over 72 hours following TIL infusion. Regimen B: All other patients receive TIL infusion once followed by oral cimetidine every 6 hours for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats in both regimens every 3-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression and according to TIL availability. Patients are followed every 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients with melanoma and 20-30 patients with renal cell carcinoma will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
