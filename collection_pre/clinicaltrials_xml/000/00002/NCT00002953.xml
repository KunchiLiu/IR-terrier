	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide with epirubicin and paclitaxel in treating women with metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide Compared With Epirubicin and Paclitaxel in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the activity and toxicity of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide with that of epirubicin and paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to receive either epirubicin and cyclophosphamide or epirubicin and paclitaxel. Each drug combination is given every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 704 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
