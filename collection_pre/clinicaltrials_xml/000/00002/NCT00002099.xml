	<brief_summary>To determine the tolerance and side effects of a combination of lentinan and didanosine (ddI) in comparison with ddI alone. To determine whether the combination of lentinan and ddI produces a significant immunorestorative effect within the study observation period (6-12 months) as measured by an increase in one or more of the following: neutrophil count and activity, T-cell subsets, and a decrease in p24 antigen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II/III Study of the Tolerance and Efficacy of Combined Use of Didanosine (2',3'-Dideoxyinosine; ddI) and Lentinan in HIV-Positive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are treated with daily oral ddI for 6 weeks, then are randomized to ddI in combination with intravenous lentinan or placebo (administered once weekly) for 26 weeks. Patients who are already stabilized on 400 mg/day ddI will proceed directly to randomization. Following completion of the combination therapy, patients may be offered 26 additional weeks of therapy on an optional basis.</detailed_description>
