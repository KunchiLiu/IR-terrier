	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Laparoscopic staging may help doctors plan more effective treatment for ovarian, primary fallopian tube, and primary abdominal cancers. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of laparoscopic staging in patients with ovarian, primary fallopian tube, or primary abdominal cancers who have not undergone complete staging.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Staging in Patients With Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Other Primary Abdominal Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility of laparoscopic staging of patients with incompletely staged ovarian, primary fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers. II. Assess the adverse effects associated with this technique. OUTLINE: Surgery. Laparoscopy with cytologic examination and lymph node sampling followed, if feasible, by surgical resection. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 50 patients will be accrued over approximately 2 years. If more than 4 evaluable patients cannot complete surgery, the study will be closed.</detailed_description>
