	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy with may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy with vinorelbine and paclitaxel plus radiation therapy in treating patients with advanced cancer arising in the pelvis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vinorelbine and Paclitaxel Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer Arising in the Pelvis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the toxic effects of vinorelbine given on a weekly schedule combined with standard whole pelvic radiation therapy. II. Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of vinorelbine given on a weekly schedule combined with standard whole pelvic radiation therapy. III. Access the toxic effects of paclitaxel given weekly in combination with the regimen determined to be the MTD of vinorelbine. IV. Determine the MTD of paclitaxel given weekly in combination with the regimen determined to be the MTD of vinorelbine. OUTLINE: Part I: Vinorelbine IV bolus is administered over 8-10 minutes on day 1 prior to radiation therapy. Whole pelvic radiation treatment is given on days 1-5 followed by 2 days of rest. The treatment volume encompasses all suspected pelvic disease with a minimum of 1 cm margin. Cycles repeat weekly. Dose of vinorelbine is escalated in cohorts of at least 3 patients until maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Part II: Paclitaxel is infused over 1 hour immediately following vinorelbine at the MTD, as determined in part I. Dose of paclitaxel is escalated in cohorts of at least 3 patients until the MTD is determined. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD for both parts I and II of the study. Patients are followed for late and chronic toxicities. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Projected accrual is 12 patients per year for approximately 3 years.</detailed_description>
