	<brief_summary>To determine response rate, median time to tumor progression, qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity in patients with advanced refractory AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) administered a 3-hour infusion of paclitaxel every 14 days. To evaluate the clinical benefit of paclitaxel in this patient population by evaluating self-reported responses to the Symptom Distress Scale and by documenting and evaluating any changes in their lymphedema, pain and disfiguring facial lesions.</brief_summary>
