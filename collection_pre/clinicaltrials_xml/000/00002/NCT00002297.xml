	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to determine the effects of isoprinosine in patients diagnosed as having unexplained generalized lymphadenopathy. Variables to be examined will include: Signs and symptoms: - Lymphadenopathy. - Fever. - Weight loss. - Occurrence of opportunistic infections. Cell-mediated immune system parameters: - T-helper cell (OKT4) numbers and proportions. - T-suppressor cell (OKT8) numbers and proportions. - Natural killer (NK) cell activity. - Lymphocyte blastogenic response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). - Lymphocyte blastogenic response to pokeweed mitogen (PWM). - Immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, IgD) profile. - Circulating immune complexes. Infections characteristically associated with AIDS, such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium, Mycobacterium avium- intracellulare, Legionella, and Isospora. Safety parameters: - Blood chemistry including serum uric acid (PurposeA-12). - Complete blood count (CBC). - Platelet count.</brief_summary>
