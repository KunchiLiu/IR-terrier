	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety, tolerance, and maximum tolerated dose of subcutaneous interleukin-2 (aldesleukin; IL-2) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). - Evaluate the hematologic effects of subcutaneous IL-2 in MDS. OUTLINE: IL-2 will be administered in cycles of twice daily subcutaneous injections 7 days a week for 4 consecutive weeks. After each cycle the patient will be evaluated for response. The patient could continue IL-2 therapy for up to 12 cycles. There are 4 dose levels of IL-2. At each dose level 3 patients will be accrued sequentially. Treatment with IL-2 should be continued until grade III toxicity or any side effects requiring hospitalization occurs. After the patient returns to baseline pretherapy values or grade I toxicity, the subject will resume IL-2 at 50% of the initial dose. If the patient again goes into grade III toxicity or is in need of hospitalization, IL-2 will be discontinued. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Between 12-24 patients will be accrued.</detailed_description>
