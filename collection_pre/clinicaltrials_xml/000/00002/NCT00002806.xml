	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine followed by radiation therapy in treating adults who have supratentorial glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Followed by Radiation Therapy in Treating Adults With Supratentorial Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the response rate of patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial low-grade glioma following neoadjuvant chemotherapy with PCV (procarbazine/lomustine/vincristine). II. Describe the toxicity of PCV. III. Determine the incidence of disease progression in these patients during PCV treatment. OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: CCNU Lomustine, NSC-79037 PCB Procarbazine, NSC-77213 PCV PCB/CCNU/VCR VCR Vincristine, NSC-67574 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy Followed by Radiotherapy. PCV; followed by external-beam cranial irradiation using at least 6 MV photons.</detailed_description>
