	<brief_summary>PRIMARY: To compare the effect of nevirapine versus placebo alone or in combination with zidovudine (AZT) on CD4 T-cell count and percentage after 3 and 6 months of treatment. To evaluate the safety and tolerance of nevirapine alone or in combination with AZT. SECONDARY: To compare the effects of the various treatment combinations on virologic and immunologic markers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety and Effectiveness of Nevirapine and Zidovudine, Given Separately and Together, in HIV-1 Infected Patients Who Have No Symptoms of the Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Part I, patients who have had prior AZT therapy receive either nevirapine or placebo in combination with AZT. In Part II, patients who are nucleoside naive receive either nevirapine or matching placebo. After 6 months, patients receive open-label nevirapine.</detailed_description>
