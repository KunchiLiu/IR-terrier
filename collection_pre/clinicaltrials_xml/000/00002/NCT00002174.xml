	<brief_summary>To determine if Thalidomide modulates the production of HIV-suppressor factors (MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, Rantes) and TH1 type cytokines (IL-12 and INF-gamma) in HIV-infected patients and alters viral load.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Further Evaluation of Thalidomide's Ability to Potentiate the Immune Response to HIV-Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be divided, 5 per group, into Groups I, II, III and IV. Groups I and II will include patients who have decided not to take anti-retro viral drugs. Groups III and IV will include patients receiving the same types of antiretroviral drugs. Patients in groups I and III will receive thalidomide while patients in group II and IV will receive placebo. The placebo capsules will be the same color as the thalidomide capsules and will contain glucose powder.
