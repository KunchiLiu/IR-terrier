	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Some cancers become resistant to chemotherapy drugs. Combining cyclosporine with chemotherapy may prevent resistance to the drugs and allow the cancer cells to be killed. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of adding cyclosporine to combination chemotherapy in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclosporine and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate whether the addition of cyclosporine (CYSP) to mitoxantrone (DHAD) and etoposide (VP-16) increases the response rate and duration of response in adults with refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). II. Correlate response to this treatment with the presence of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) multidrug resistance (MDR) and the degree of in vitro modulation of leukemic blasts, including CD34+ blasts. III. Correlate response with the presence of other resistance mechanisms, such as atypical MDR and non-P-gp phenotype. IV. Evaluate the toxicity of this treatment in AML patients. V. Study the effect of CYSP on DHAD and VP-16 pharmacokinetics and metabolism and, potentially, on intracellular drug accumulation. OUTLINE: Randomized study. The following acronyms are used: CYSP Cyclosporine, NSC-290193 DHAD Mitoxantrone, NSC-301739 VP-16 Etoposide, NSC-141540 Arm I: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. DHAD; VP-16. Arm II: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy with Drug Resistance Inhibition. DHAD; VP-16; with CYSP. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 25 patients/arm will be entered over approximately 3 years.</detailed_description>
