	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. It is not known whether giving high-dose or low-dose interferon alfa is more effective than no further therapy in treating patients with stage III melanoma. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of high- or low-dose interferon alfa with that of no further therapy following surgery in treating patients who have stage III melanoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the time to distant metastasis, death due to melanoma, and overall survival in patients with high-risk stage III melanoma treated with 10 MU of interferon alfa (IFN-A) for 4 weeks followed by 1 year of IFN-A at 10 MU three times per week vs. 2 years of IFN-A at 5 MU three times per week vs. observation alone. II. Assess the toxicity associated with IFN-A. III. Compare the quality of life, costs, and compliance associated with each treatment regimen. OUTLINE: Randomized study. Following definitive surgical resection, patients are randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to Arms A, B, and C, respectively. Arm A: Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Interferon alfa-2b (Schering), IFN-A, NSC-377523. Higher dose. Arm B: Biological Response Modifier Therapy. IFN-A. Lower dose. Arm C: Control. Observation. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 patients will be entered over approximately 4 years in this multicenter study.</detailed_description>
