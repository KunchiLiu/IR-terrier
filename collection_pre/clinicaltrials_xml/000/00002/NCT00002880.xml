	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of etoposide in treating patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etoposide in Treating Patients With Relapsed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response rate and response duration in patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma when treated with daily oral etoposide. II. Describe the toxic effects of daily oral etoposide in these patients. III. Monitor etoposide trough levels and determine whether etoposide concentrations correlate with age, response, and toxicity. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral etoposide daily for 21 days. Treatment is repeated every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in complete or partial remission receive 2 courses past best response (minimum 6 courses). Patients with stable disease after 3 courses may be removed from study. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 97 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.</detailed_description>
