	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of tretinoin in treating patients who have any stage mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tretinoin in Treating Patients With Mycosis Fungoides or Sezary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of tretinoin (TRA) in patients with mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome. II. Evaluate the spectrum of toxicity of TRA in this patient population. OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study. Single-agent Chemotherapy. Tretinoin, All-trans-Retinoic Acid, TRA, NSC-122758. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If 1 or more of the first 15 evaluable patients experience an objective response, then 20 additional patients will be entered. It is anticipated that the accrual rate will be 1-2 patients per month.</detailed_description>
