	<brief_title>A Study of AIDSVAX B/B and AIDSVAX B/E, Two Possible Vaccines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to 1 of the 2 following arms and administered 1 or 2 injections into the deltoid muscle at 0, 1, 6, and 12 months: Arm A: Patients receive 1 of 3 doses of AIDSVAX B/B vaccine (MN rgp120/HIV-1 plus GNE8 rgp120/HIV-1) in alum adjuvant. Arm B: Patients receive AIDSVAX B/E (MN rgp120/HIV-1 plus A244 rgp120/HIV-1) vaccine in alum adjuvant. Patients are evaluated at 1 hr, 3 days, and 14 days after each immunization and at 18 months after the first immunization. An interim analysis is performed after all patients receive the second dose (at 1 month).</detailed_description>
