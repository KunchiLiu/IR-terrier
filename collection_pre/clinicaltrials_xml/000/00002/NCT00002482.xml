	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody and cyclophosphamide in treating patients with metastatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Plus Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the clinical feasibility and toxicity of monoclonal antibody OKT3 given with low-dose cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced malignancies. II. Perform serial immune monitoring on patients treated with this regimen. III. Identify any clinical responses produced by this regimen. OUTLINE: Biological Response Modifier Therapy with Suppressor Cell Inhibition. Anti-CD3 Murine Monoclonal Antibody OKT3, MOAB OKT3; with Cyclophosphamide, CTX, NSC-26271. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 9 evaluable patients per diagnostic category will be required initially; if any response is seen during the dose-finding portion of the study, a total of 24 patients with that diagnosis will be entered.</detailed_description>
