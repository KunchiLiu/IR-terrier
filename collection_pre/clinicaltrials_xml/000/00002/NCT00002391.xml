	<brief_summary>To compare the safety, tolerance, durability of the viral load response and the antiviral activity of the 1592U89/zidovudine(ZDV)/lamivudine (3TC) regimen vs. ZDV/3TC regimen. To determine the clinical efficacy of the two regimens as measured survival, disease progression, weight growth velocity, and neuropsychological or neurological changes. To assess the development of viral resistance and relative pharmacokinetics associated with each regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety and Effectiveness of Zidovudine Plus Lamivudine, Used With and Without 1592U89, in HIV-1 Infected Children Who Have Taken Anti-HIV-1 Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to receive blinded treatment with ZDV/3TC alone or in combination with 1592U89, orally for 16 weeks. If after the 16-week period certain criteria are met, patients may have the option to switch to open-label treatment for the remainder of the study period.</detailed_description>

Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded: Serious bacterial infection that precludes absorption of study drug or observation of a study parameter. Documented hypersensitivity to a nucleoside analog. Coenrollment in certain opportunistic infection protocols is not exclusionary if approval is obtained. Malignancy. Lifethreatening infection or other chronic disease that may compromise patient safety.

Immunomodulators and cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. Systemic corticosteroids &gt; 14 days without approval. Investigational agents. Concurrent Treatment: Excluded: Radiation therapy. Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded: History of clinically relevant pancreatitis or hepatitis within the past 6 months. Participation in a vaccine trial. Prior Medication: Excluded: Protease inhibitor therapy within 2 weeks prior to randomization. Interleukins or interferons within 30 days prior to study drug administration. Investigational drugs within 14 days prior to randomization. HIV vaccine dose within past 30 days. Required: &gt; 12 weeks prior antiretroviral therapy and unchanged therapy 12 weeks prior to screening.</criteria>
