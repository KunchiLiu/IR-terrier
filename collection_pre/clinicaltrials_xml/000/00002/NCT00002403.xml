	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give zintevir (AR177) to asymptomatic (no symptoms) HIV-infected patients. Zintevir belongs to a new class of anti-HIV drugs, the integrase inhibitors. HIV uses the protein integrase to infect a cell. Integrase inhibitors block integrase and may stop replication of HIV.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Zintevir belongs to a new class of anti-HIV drugs, the integrase inhibitors. The HIV-1 virus uses the protein integrase to incorporate its genetic material into the infected host cell. Integrase inhibitors block integrase and may stop replication of the HIV-1 virus. In this open-label, Phase I/II study, 3 groups of HIV-positive patients (12 patients total) receive escalating doses of intravenous zintevir for 14 consecutive days.</detailed_description>
