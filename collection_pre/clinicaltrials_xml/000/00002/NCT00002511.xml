	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells and may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare radiation therapy with no further treatment in treating patients with stage III prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Compared With No Further Treatment Following Surgery in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare local recurrence rates, acute and late morbidity, overall survival, disease-free survival, and cancer-related survival of patients with pT3 pN0 adenocarcinoma of the prostate randomized following radical prostatectomy to postoperative conventional pelvic irradiation (60 Gy) vs no further treatment until relapse. - Better define the selective pathologic indications for radiotherapy in patients with pT3 pN0 disease. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. - Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks, followed by boost radiotherapy for 1-1.4 weeks. - Arm II: Patients are observed. Local relapse is treated with conventional pelvic radiotherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months during the first postoperative year, every 6 months until the fifth year, and annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1000 patients will be accrued for this study within 7.5 years.</detailed_description>
