	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells including natural killer cells to kill prostate cancer cells. Interferon gamma may interfere with the growth of the cancer cells. Combining interferon gamma with interleukin-2 may be a more effective treatment for prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy using interleukin-2 and interferon gamma in treating patients with advanced prostate cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety of immunization with HLA class I-matched allogeneic human prostate carcinoma cells genetically engineered to secrete interleukin-2 and interferon gamma in patients with prostate carcinoma. II. Evaluate the antitumor effects of this treatment as assessed by post-therapy declines in PSA. III. Evaluate the induction of cellular and humoral immunity in vivo with this treatment. OUTLINE: Tumor Cell Vaccine Therapy. Immunization with irradiated, MHC class I-matched allogeneic human prostate carcinoma cells, LNCaP cells, engineered to secrete approximately 58 ng/24 hr/million cells of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and approximately 0.72 U/24 hr/million cells of interferon gamma (IFN-G). PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 12 patients will be entered on the Phase I study; accrual will continue to a total of 25 patients treated at the MTD (Phase II). Accrual is expected to require 2 years.</detailed_description>
