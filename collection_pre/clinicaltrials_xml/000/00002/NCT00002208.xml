	<brief_summary>To demonstrate that the antiviral activity and safety/tolerability of a test regimen of indinavir is equivalent to that of a control regimen of indinavir when each is coadministered with zidovudine (ZDV) (or stavudine, d4T) and lamivudine (3TC) for 24 weeks to protease inhibitor- and 3TC-naive HIV-1-seropositive patients. To characterize the steady-state pharmacokinetic profiles of indinavir, ZDV (or d4T), and 3TC in the presence of each other, for both the control and test regimen groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter, Open-Label, Randomized, 24-Week Study to Compare the Safety and Activity of Indinavir Sulfate, 800 Mg q 8 h Versus 1,200 Mg q 12 h in Combination With Zidovudine and 3TC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms: Arm A: Indinavir plus ZDV plus 3TC. Arm B: Indinavir (test dose) plus ZDV plus 3TC. NOTE: d4T may be substituted for zidovudine for toxicity management. Patients are stratified based on prior use of nucleoside analogs (naive vs experienced to ZDV, dideoxyinosine [ddI], dideoxycytidine [ddC], and d4T) and screening viral RNA results (lower than 50,000 copies/mL vs more than 50,000 copies/mL).</detailed_description>
