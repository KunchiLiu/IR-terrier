	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy with paclitaxel in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S9714: Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess survival, progression-free survival and response rate of patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma receiving paclitaxel. II. Evaluate toxic effects of paclitaxel in 96 hour continuous infusion patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive 6 cycles of paclitaxel by IV continuous infusion over 96 hours. Before cycle 4, restaging is performed. If disease progression is witnessed, patients are removed from the study. If a stable, partial, or complete response is observed, patients receive the total of 6 cycles. Three weeks after the last cycle, final restaging is performed. Patients are followed every 3 months while on treatment and every 6 months thereafter, unless more frequent follow-up is clinically recommended. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 50 patients will be enrolled. The accrual rate is estimated at 25 per year.</detailed_description>
