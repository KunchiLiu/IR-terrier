	<brief_summary>The use of ganciclovir (DHPG) in combination with interferon beta to prevent relapse of cytomegalovirus retinitis in patients with AIDS. While early clinical trials have shown that 30 mg/kg/week of DHPG is usually sufficient to delay or prevent relapse, neutropenia is a common dose-limiting problem in about 50 percent of patients. Since in vitro data have suggested that there is synergism between DHPG and interferon beta against cytomegalovirus, a reduced dose of DHPG in combination with a low dose of interferon beta may prevent relapse without causing neutropenia. If remission can be maintained with low-dose DHPG and interferon beta, maintenance therapy with a moderate dose of interferon beta alone will be evaluated in a subsequent protocol.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients must fulfill the CDC criteria for the diagnosis of AIDS. In addition, patients must have a typical clinical picture of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, a positive CMV culture from any site, and no other possible explanation for the retinal findings (e.g., toxoplasmosis infection). Patients with AIDS in whom CMV retinitis is suspected will be examined by an ophthalmologist and, if, retinal lesions are seen, shall have a complete set of retinal photographs taken. CMV cultures of throat, buffy coat, urine, and if possible, semen will be obtained. Cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis serologic (IgG and IgM) tests will also be performed. Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients not meeting inclusion criteria are excluded. Patients not meeting inclusion criteria are excluded.</criteria>
