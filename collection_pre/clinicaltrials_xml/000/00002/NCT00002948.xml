	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of drugs and kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose topotecan and peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with refractory cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Topotecan and Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Refractory Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose, toxicities, and preliminary antitumor activity of escalating doses of topotecan, with filgrastim (G-CSF) and peripheral blood stem cell support, when administered to patients with refractory malignancies for which no effective therapy exists. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Prior to stem cell harvesting, patients receive 1-2 courses of mobilizing salvage chemotherapy. After stem cell harvest, high-dose topotecan is administered according to an escalating dosage scale. Topotecan is given over 30 minutes daily for three days. A minimum of 3 patients are entered at each dose level. The MTD is defined as the dose immediately below that at which 2 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are infused at least 24 hours after treatment with topotecan is complete. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously beginning on the day PBSC are infused and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified</detailed_description>
