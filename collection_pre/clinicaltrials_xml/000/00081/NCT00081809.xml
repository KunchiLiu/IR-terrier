	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: - To document the efficacy of treatment with autologous lymphoma-derived HSPPC-96 of selected patients with indolent lymphoma. The efficacy endpoints are: - the rate of complete and partial responses - the time to progression. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologous tumor-derived heat-shock protein peptide complex (HSPPC-96) administered intradermally once weekly for four consecutive weeks, followed by HSPPC-96 administered once every two weeks. - To evaluate the feasibility of autologous HSPPC-96 preparation from lymphoma specimens. - To assess approximately the composition of the tissue source of the autologous HSPPC-96 for each patient. - To study the effect of autologous lymphoma-derived HSPPC-96 vaccine therapy on the expression of Fas ligand and TRAIL death proteins in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with indolent lymphoma.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with previously treated or newly diagnosed follicular center cell grade I or grade II lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, MALT lymphoma, monocytoid Bcell lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, or marginal zone lymphoma with bidimensionally measurable disease; Part of the resected specimen must undergo routine pathologic examination to confirm the diagnosis of lymphoma. The remaining tissue must be used for the preparation of autologous HSPPC96; Autologous HSPPC96 vaccine must be successfully prepared and provided by the sponsor; A minimum of 2 grams of nonnecrotic, resectable malignant lymphoma for HSPPC96 preparation; Bidimensionally measurable disease in at least one location other than the resected lymphoid tissue; Life expectancy of at least 16 weeks; Zubrod performance status of less then or equal to 2; Adequate bone marrow function; Adequate hepatic function; Adequate renal function; Signed written informed consent; Patients of childbearing potential must practice contraception, which is adequate in the opinion of the Principal Investigator; Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to entry into the study and must not be lactating; Patients must be willing to be followed at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center during the course of treatment and followup; Electrocardiogram if none performed in the prior six months; Patients must have no chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or experimental anticancer therapy within six weeks prior to starting autologous HSPPC96 administration; Patients must have fully recovered from prior anticancer therapy; Tumor measurements and staging no more than 4 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of autologous HSPPC96. Patients with active or prior history of central nervous system lymphoma; Patients with serious intercurrent medical illnesses, requiring hospitalization; Patients with a history of primary or secondary immunodeficiency (other than related to the malignant lymphoma because treatment is dependent on functional immune system) or patients taking immunosuppressive drugs such as systemic corticosteroids; Women who are pregnant or lactating; Patients participating in another clinical trial; Patients receiving growth factors of any kind, including GCSF, GMCSF, or Epogen; Patients with bulky disease, defined as greater than 10 cm in diameter; Patients with positive HIV antibody; Patients with more than 4 previous treatment regimens will be excluded.</criteria>
