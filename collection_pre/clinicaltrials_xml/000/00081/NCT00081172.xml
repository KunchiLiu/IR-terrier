	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver radioactive tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiolabeled monoclonal antibody works in treating patients with progressive metastatic androgen-independent adenocarcinoma (cancer) of the prostate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody in Treating Patients With Progressive Metastatic Androgen-Independent Adenocarcinoma (Cancer) of the Prostate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate in patients with progressive metastatic androgen-independent adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with lutetium Lu 177 monoclonal antibody J591. - Determine the measurable disease response rate in patients treated with this drug. Secondary - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the duration of biochemical PSA and/or measurable disease response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the incidence of human anti-J591 antibody (HAHA) response in patients treated with this drug. - Correlate hematological toxicity of this drug with bone marrow involvement (bone scan index) in these patients. - Determine the survival rate in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the targeting of this drug to known tumor sites in these patients. - Determine the tumor-absorbed radiation dose in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study. Patients receive a single dose of lutetium Lu 177 monoclonal antibody J591 IV on day 1. Patients then undergo radionuclide scanning between days 6-8 to confirm tumor targeting by the study drug. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-32 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
