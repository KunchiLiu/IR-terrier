	<brief_summary>This study is a Phase I/II study. In Phase I of this study, the objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combination therapy with Aroplatin and gemcitabine (Gemzar®) in subjects with unresectable, locally advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer. In Phase II, the primary objective is to evaluate survival after therapy with Aroplatin and gemcitabine at the identified MTD in subjects with unresectable, locally advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the severity and quantity of adverse events and determine the proportion of non-progressors and the progression-free interval.</brief_summary>
