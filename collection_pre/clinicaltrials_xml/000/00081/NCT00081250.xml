	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: It is not yet known whether the supplement creatine is effective in increasing weight and improving appetite and quality of life in patients who have cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well creatine works in increasing weight and improving appetite and quality of life in patients with weight loss caused by cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Creatine in Treating Patients With Cancer-Associated Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare weight-gain effects of creatine vs placebo in patients with cancer-associated weight loss and/or anorexia. - Determine the effect of these regimens on quality of life in these patients. - Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. - Compare survival rates of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are stratified according to primary cancer type (lung vs gastrointestinal vs other), weight loss severity (&lt; 10 lbs vs ≥10 lbs), age (&lt; 50 years vs ≥ 50 years), planned concurrent chemotherapy (yes vs no), gender, and prognosis. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral creatine daily. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily. In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity as long as treatment is considered beneficial. Patients are followed every 6 months for up to 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
