	<criteria>Male or female subjects, ≥ 8 years of age and a weight of ≥ 35 kilograms Subjects with selected culturepositive infections caused by a multiple antibioticresistant pathogen presumed to be susceptible to tigecycline Subjects who have failed or are intolerant of other available appropriate antibiotic therapies or whose pathogens are resistant to other available antibiotics Subjects who are moribund with an expected survival of less than 2 weeks. Subjects who have been designated as "Do Not Resuscitate", unless it is anticipated within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that they can achieve benefit from potentially curative antibiotic therapy Known or suspected hypersensitivity to tigecycline, tetracyclines, or other compounds related to this class of antibacterial agents</criteria>
