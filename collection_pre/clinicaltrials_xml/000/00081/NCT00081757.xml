	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of thalidomide for the treatment of cancer. Patients with many types of cancers will be enrolled because the researchers will also study how the different cancers respond and what kind of side effects patients will experience.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Angiogenesis is a normal, physiological process in the growing embryo, wound healing and ovulation. Progressive recruitments of blood vessels to the tumor site are thought to result in a self perpetuating loop helping to drive the growth of tumors. This new vasculature also allows competent tumor cells to find access to the vascular system and facilitate distant spread of tumor cells. Neovascularization is apparently an absolute prerequisite for physical expansion of solid tumors to grow beyond the volume of about 1-2 mm in diameter. Several molecular and cellular mechanisms have been identified by which tumor parenchyma may exert its angiogenic effect on host endothelial cells. There is also evidence that endothelial cells themselves, like other stromal cells, may act reciprocally to alter the behavior of adjacent tumor cells in a paracrine or cell contact mediated fashion. There is now known to be a diverse family of angiogenic growth factors, foremost among them being basic FGF and VEGF. Several angiogenic peptide genes have been sequenced and cloned. The degree of vascularization has acquired importance as an independent prognostic indicator in various types of solid tumors. More recently, it has been noted that increased angiogenesis may also be an important feature in hematologic malignancies, e.g. leukemia.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria All patients must have a confirmed malignancy which can be classified as locally advanced or distant metastatic disease and must have either 1) failed on standard therapy or 2) have disease for which in the opinion of the investigator, no adequate standard +therapy exists. Patients must be 18 years of age or older. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and fertile women and men must use a medically acceptable means of birth control while on study and for 6 months thereafter. Patients must sign an informed consent to participate in this study. SWOG Performance status 03, unless related to cancer pain. Before starting treatment, women of childbearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test performed within 24 hours prior to beginning therapy. Pregnancy testing is not required for 1) women who have been postmenopausal for at least 2 years with no menses, 2) women who have had a hysterectomy. Patients must have adequate hematologic function as demonstrated by total white blood count &gt; or = 2000/mm3, adequate renal function as demonstrated by serum creatinine &lt; or = 3.0 mg/dl, and adequate hepatic function as demonstrated by bilirubin &lt; or =1.5 mg/dl and transaminases &lt; or =4 x ULN. Exclusion Criteria Patients must not be eligible for any UAMS participating clinical trial of higher priority.</criteria>
