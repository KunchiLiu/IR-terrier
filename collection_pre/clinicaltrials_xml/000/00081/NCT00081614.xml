	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the study is to assess the potential benefit of combining two targeted therapies (an anti-EGF inhibitor along with an anti-VEGF inhibitor). The goal will be to determine whether the addition of Erlotinib to Avastin will improve the benefit in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with regard to time to progression, response rate, duration of response, and survival compared with Avastin alone. Since Avastin has been shown to be active in renal cancer, the goal will be to assess whether this activity can be enhanced with Erlotinib.</brief_summary>
