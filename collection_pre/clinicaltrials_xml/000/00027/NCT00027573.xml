	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by donor peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have metastatic or unresectable kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Followed by Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall response rate and overall and disease-free survival of patients with unresectable or metastatic renal cell cancer treated with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed by allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. - Determine the toxicity and treatment-related mortality of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the percentage of donor chimerism in patients treated with this regimen.</detailed_description>
