	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have advanced colorectal cancer that has not responded to irinotecan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the recommended phase II dose of monoclonal antibody anti-anb3 integrin in patients with irinotecan-refractory advanced colorectal cancer. - Determine the safety and tolerance of this drug in these patients. - Determine any antitumor activity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the objective response rate, response duration, and time to progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody anti-anb3 integrin IV over 30 minutes once weekly on weeks 1-52 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease may continue therapy. Cohort of 4-6 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody anti-anb3 integrin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 4 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are treated at that dose in the phase II portion of the study. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4-24 patients will be accrued for phase I of this study and a total of 40 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study.</detailed_description>
