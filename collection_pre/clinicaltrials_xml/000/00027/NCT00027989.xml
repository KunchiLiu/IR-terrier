	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining liposomal doxorubicin with gemcitabine in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liposomal Doxorubicin and Gemcitabine in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response rate in women with metastatic breast cancer treated with doxorubicin HCl liposome and gemcitabine. - Determine the duration of response, time to disease progression, and duration of survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the quantitative toxicity of this regimen, in terms of incidence, type, and severity, in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive 2 courses beyond documentation of CR. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of each course, and then at the end of study. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
