	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Thalidomide may stop the growth of neuroendocrine tumors by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating patients who have metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thalidomide in Treating Patients With Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and efficacy of thalidomide in patients with metastatic low-grade neuroendocrine tumors. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily on weeks 1-8. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
