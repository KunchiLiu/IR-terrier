	<brief_title>Study of Triostat in Infants During Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized to receive study drug or placebo and randomization will occur stratified to each diagnostic category. All patients undergo preoperative echocardiograms to provide preoperative cardiac function data. The study drug or placebo will be provided in the operating room as an iv bolus just prior to cardiopulmonary bypass and as a bolus delivered on release of the aortic cross-clamp. This will be followed by iv for 12 hours. Operative data will be collected including CPB time, aortic cross-clamp time, length and degree of hypothermia. These data will be extracted from the anesthesia record.</detailed_description>
