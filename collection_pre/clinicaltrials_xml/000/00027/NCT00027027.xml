	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase I study is to test the safety of rhuMAb 2C4 to see what effects (good and bad) it has on patients with certain types of cancer, and also to find the highest dose of rhuMAb that can be given without causing severe side effects. All study participants will be assigned to specific group to evaluate different dosages of rhuMAb 2C4. The study is scheduled to run for up to one year depending on how patients respond to the study treatment.</brief_summary>
