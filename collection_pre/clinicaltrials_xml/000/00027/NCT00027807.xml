	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. Combining different types of biological therapies may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining different biological therapies in treating women who have stage IV breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biological Therapy in Treating Women With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of armed activated T cells given in combination with interleukin-2 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) in women with stage IV breast cancer. - Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the clinical response and overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of armed activated T cells. Patients undergo peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection. The PBMCs are treated ex vivo with monoclonal antibody OKT3 to form armed activated T cells (ATC). The armed ATC are expanded for 14 days in interleukin-2 (IL-2). Patients receive armed ATC IV over 30 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks. Patients also receive IL-2 subcutaneously (SC) once daily and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC twice weekly beginning 3 days before the first infusion of armed ATC and continuing until 7 days after the last infusion of armed ATC. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of armed ATC until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are treated at that dose. Patients are followed at 1, 2, and 5 months and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this study and a total of 18-33 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study within 4-6 years. PLEASE NOTE: THIS STUDY WAS INTENDED TO BE A PHASE I/II STUDY, BUT NEVER MOVED FORWARD TO PHASE II. (4-22-09)</detailed_description>
