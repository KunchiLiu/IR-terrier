	<brief_title>Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in patients with advanced or metastatic sarcoma treated with bortezomib. - Correlate levels of cyclins D1, E, p21 (WAF1), p27 (Kip1), mdm^2, p53, and Ki67 with response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease (stratum I: soft tissue sarcoma not specified in stratum II, osteogenic sarcoma arising from soft tissues, or gastrointestinal stromal tumor vs stratum II: Ewing's sarcoma of soft tissue or bone, rhabdomyosarcoma, or osteogenic sarcoma of bone). (Stratum I closed to accrual as of 10/17/03.) Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for stratum I within 5-11 months and 21-41 patients will be accrued for stratum II within 10.5-22 months. (Stratum I closed to accrual as of 10/17/03.)</detailed_description>
