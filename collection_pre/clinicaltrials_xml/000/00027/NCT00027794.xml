	<brief_title>Radical Prostatectomy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the success rate of radical prostatectomy in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the prostate. - Determine the serious toxic event rate of this surgery in these patients. - Determine the pN status of patients treated with this surgery. - Determine the percentage of patients found to have organ-confined tumors (pT2) after undergoing this surgery. - Determine the 2-year prostate-specific antigen-free survival rate of patients treated with this surgery. - Determine the surgical morbidity rates of patients treated with this surgery. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo limited pelvic lymphadenectomy and then radical retropubic prostatectomy. Patients who are found to have pN-positive disease receive further treatment according to the investigator's discretion. Patients with pN0 disease are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 4 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-74 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
