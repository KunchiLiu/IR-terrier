	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide in treating patients who have small cell lung cancer that has not responded to platinum-based chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chloroquinoxaline Sulfonamide in Treating Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide in patients with platinum-refractory small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide IV over 1 hour once a week for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
