	<brief_title>Ceramide Cream in Treating Women With Cutaneous Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in women with cutaneous breast cancer treated with topical ceramide cream. II. Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. IV. Assess the quality of life of these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Topical ceramide cream is applied to all cutaneous lesions twice daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at 1 and 3 months. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.</detailed_description>
