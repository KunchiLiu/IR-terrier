	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radioactive drugs such as holmium Ho 166 DOTMP can kill cancer cells without harming healthy cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of melphalan with or without holmium Ho 166 DOTMP followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Melphalan With or Without Holmium Ho 166 DOTMP Followed by Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of melphalan with or without holmium Ho 166 DOTMP followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. II. Compare the response rate and overall survival of these patients treated with these regimens. III. Compare the hematologic recovery rate and time to granulocyte engraftment of these patients treated with these regimens. IV. Compare the toxicity of these regimens in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to their beta 2 microglobulin (B2M) test at initial diagnosis (B2M no greater than 4 mg/L vs B2M greater than 4 mg/L vs unknown B2M). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Prior to stratification and randomization, patients receive a diagnostic dose of holmium Ho 166 DOTMP within days -31 to -10. Patients with adequate skeletal uptake of the diagnostic dose are randomized for therapy. Arm I: Patients receive holmium Ho 166 DOTMP IV over no more than 10 minutes within days -10 to -7 (at least 1 week and no more than 3 weeks after the diagnostic dose), melphalan IV over 20-30 minutes within days -3 to -1 (at least 24 hours prior to autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation), and autologous PBSC transplantation on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive melphalan and autologous PBSC transplantation as in arm I. Following transplantation, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) daily until blood counts recover. Patients are followed at 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 300 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 9 months.</detailed_description>
