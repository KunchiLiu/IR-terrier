	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and favorable immune response to an anti-streptococcal vaccine (a vaccine that treats a common bacterial infection) in healthy non-pregnant women. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) continues to be the single most frequent cause of life-threatening bacterial infection during the first 2 months of life. Further, GBS pregnancy-related morbidity afflicts more than 50,000 women annually in the US. Therefore, active immunization of women is an appealing strategy for the prevention of GBS disease in pregnant women and their infants during the first 3 months of infant life.</brief_summary>
