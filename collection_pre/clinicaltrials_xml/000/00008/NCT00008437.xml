	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as MRI, may allow the doctor to better detect the tumor. Highly focused ultrasound energy may be able to kill tumor cells by heating the breast tumor cells without affecting the surrounding tissue. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of MRI-guided ultrasound energy in treating women who have stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the incidence and severity of adverse events during and after MRI-guided focused ultrasound ablation in women with stage I-IIIA breast cancer. - Determine the ability to accurately and thoroughly coagulate a target volume of breast carcinoma, in terms of real-time target volume temperature profile, follow-up MRI, and histology, using this procedure. - Compare the appearance of gross and microscopic histopathologic tissue post coagulation with the pre- and post-coagulation magnetic resonance appearance of the targeted volume and measure any residual cancer cells in patients after this procedure. - Determine patient acceptance of this procedure, in terms of positioning, pain, safety, and follow-up cosmesis. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients undergo MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) ablation of the breast lesion using a series of pulses. Within 72 hours after MRgFUS procedure, patients undergo gadolinium-enhanced MRI to evaluate ablation borders. Within 7-10 days after MRgFUS procedure, patients undergo an ultrasound exam. Guide wires may be placed to assist in pre-surgical lesion localization. Within 10-21 days after MRgFUS procedure, patients undergo segmental resection or mastectomy. Patients are followed at 5-10 days post-surgery. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
