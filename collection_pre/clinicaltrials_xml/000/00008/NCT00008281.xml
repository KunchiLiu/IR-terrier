	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known which regimen of chemotherapy is more effective for metastatic colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: Phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of three chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Three Chemotherapy Regimens in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the overall survival of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium with vs without oxaliplatin vs oxaliplatin alone. II. Compare the response rate, time to tumor-related symptomatic worsening, time to disease progression, onset and duration of complete and partial responses, and duration of disease stabilization in patients treated with these regimens. III. Determine the safety profile of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Karnofsky performance status (50-60% vs 70-100%), number of metastatic organs (1 vs 2 or more), and LDH value (up to 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) vs greater than 1.5 times ULN). Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours followed by fluorouracil IV continuously over 22 hours on days 1 and 2. Arm II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Arm III: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV concurrently with leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours followed by fluorouracil IV continuously over 22 hours on day 1. Leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil are administered alone on day 2 on the same schedule as on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for 30 days, every 2 weeks for up to 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 786 patients (262 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
