	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Cryosurgery kills cancer cells by freezing them. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with cryosurgery and giving drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of intrahepatic and intravenous combination chemotherapy with or without cryosurgery in treating unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Unresectable Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin and fluorouracil when given with leucovorin calcium and hepatic intra-arterial floxuridine and dexamethasone with or without cryosurgery (group I cryosurgery closed to accrual as of 10/13/03) in patients with unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer. - Determine, preliminarily, the anti-tumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of oxaliplatin and fluorouracil. Patients are assigned to one of two treatment groups. (Group I closed to accrual as of 10/13/03.) - Group I (closed to accrual as of 10/13/03): Patients with no more than 8 hepatic metastases and no metastases greater than 5 cm in diameter undergo cryosurgery prior to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is delayed for at least 4 weeks after cryosurgery. - Group II: Patients with more than 8 hepatic metastases or at least one metastases greater than 5 cm in diameter do not undergo cryosurgery prior to chemotherapy. Beginning 2 weeks after pump placement surgery, all patients receive floxuridine and dexamethasone by hepatic intra-arterial infusion continuously on days 1-14; oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on days 15 and 29; and fluorouracil IV continuously over 48 hours on days 15-16 and 29-30. Courses repeat every 36 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin and fluorouracil until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 4-72 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
