	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating children with refractory or advanced solid tumors who are receiving anticonvulsants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan in Treating Children With Refractory or Advanced Solid Tumors Who Are Receiving Anticonvulsants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan in children with refractory or advanced solid tumors receiving anticonvulsants. - Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of irinotecan in this patient population. - Evaluate the pharmacokinetic behavior of this treatment regimen in these patients. - Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this treatment regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to type of concurrent anticonvulsant (enzyme activating anticonvulsants vs valproic acid vs other anticonvulsants). Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for up to 4 years and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
