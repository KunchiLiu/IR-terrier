	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Melphalan and colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of melphalan combined with filgrastim in stimulating peripheral stem cells in patients who have multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Melphalan and Filgrastim to Stimulate Peripheral Stem Cells in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and efficacy of melphalan when used with filgrastim (G-CSF) for stem cell mobilization in patients with multiple myeloma. - Analyze how this mobilization regimen affects parameters of stem cell (CD34+) mobilization and collection in these patients. - Determine how this mobilization regimen affects disease status and clonotypic (i.e., tumor cell) contamination in stem cell components in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization consisting of melphalan IV on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 2 and continuing until PBSC collection is complete. Patients are followed at 1 month. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
