	<brief_summary>The effects of talker variability will be investigated with four groups of listeners (young normal-hearing; old normal-hearing; young hearing-impaired; old hearing-impaired). Experimental conditions will include between-talker differences, speaking rate, lexical difficult and semantic/linguistic context. A preliminary experiment will evaluate the relative merit of adaptive vs fixed-level methods of stimulus presentation.</brief_summary>
