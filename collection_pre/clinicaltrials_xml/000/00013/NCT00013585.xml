	<brief_summary>A decrease in mental function often occurs in patients with HIV. Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are used to treat this but are not entirely effective. Some other therapy could play a role. The drug selegiline in its pill form is used to treat Parkinson's disease, a serious brain disorder. It is believed this drug might protect the brain and repair some damage. This study will use this drug in a "patch" form, which has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to see if it helps with decreased mental function in patients with HIV. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of selegiline transdermal system (STS) in the treatment of decreased mental function in patients with HIV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of the Selegiline "Patch" for Decreased Mental Function in HIV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment is a common adverse effect of HIV infection that can progress to dementia. ARVs are the only current therapy, but treatment response is frequently unsatisfactory, short lived, or the agents are poorly tolerated in doses adequate for central nervous system (CNS) penetration. An adjunctive therapy that interferes with the cascade of events triggered by the virus is likely to play an important role. Oral selegiline is an approved and marketed drug for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. Studies suggest that selegiline has a neuroprotective effect and that it may exert a "rescue effect" on dying and injured neurons. This study proposes to use transdermal selegiline, which may deliver a greater dose level than oral administration, in the treatment of HIV-associated cognitive impairment. This is a two-step study, with each step lasting 24 weeks. Step 1 is double-blind and Step 2 is open label. At entry, patients are randomly assigned to receive either the STS or placebo. One STS patch will be applied daily at the same time for 24 weeks. Patients are evaluated at the clinic at entry and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24. Cognitive status will be evaluated by performance on a series of neuropsychological assessments. Patients who complete Step 1 may participate in Step 2. Patients on placebo in Step 1 will receive active STS treatment in Step 2. The STS patch is applied once daily for an additional 24 weeks and patients are evaluated at the clinic at Weeks 28, 36, and 48.</detailed_description>
