	<brief_summary>This study will compare individuals with acute SCI to control patients in order to: 1. Determine if there are changes in colonic tone and sensation after SCI by comparing the fasting responses to the postprandial responses; 2. Determine if there are changes in colonic phasic motility after SCI by comparing the fasting responses to the postprandial responses; 3. Determine if colonic motor and sensory function after SCI change over time by repeating these studies six month later in SCI and control patients.</brief_summary>
