	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to evaluate the efficacy of a structured program of physical therapy in ameliorating the adverse consequences of Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI). The study will also investigate the interrelationship among measure of chronic venous diseases: lower limb muscle strength, mobility, and other symptoms of CVI important to the quality of life. Sixty patients will be randomized to a 6 months physical therapy program or to a control group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research is to evaluate the efficacy of a structured program of physical therapy in ameliorating the adverse consequences of Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI). A secondary purpose is to investigate the interrelationship among measure of chronic venous diseases: lower limb muscle strength, mobility, and other symptoms of CVI important to the quality of life. Sixty patients will be randomized to a 6 months physical therapy program or to a control group. All subjects will undergo a complete hemodynamic and psychiatric assessment. Key measures will be repeated twice to quantify trend and stability of the baseline measures. Skin biopsies will be obtained in selected patients who demonstrate a response to the physical therapy to evaluate the ultrastructural response therapy. Physical therapy will be conducted 1-3 times per week. Participants will be visited at home and a program will be tailored for each individual to maximize compliance. Validated, standardized questionnaires (FIM, SF-36, OARS, CHART) and functional ratings will be employed at commencement,3,6 and 12 months. Evaluations of hydrodynamics, muscle strength, and ankle motion will be conducted monthly during active physical therapy. Participants in active therapy will be offered to wait listed control group after 6 months.</detailed_description>
