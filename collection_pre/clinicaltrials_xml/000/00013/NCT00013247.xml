	<brief_title>Facilitating Shared Decisionmaking About Prostate Cancer Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Due to the disputed efficacy of prostate cancer (CaP) screening and treatment, most authorities recommend that providers inform and involve patients in CaP screening decisions. Objectives: This study evaluated two interventions designed to facilitate this process. Methods: 1152 male veterans age 50+ with no CaP and primary care appointments at four VA medical facilities in VISN 23 were randomly assigned to one of three groups: mailed pamphlet intervention, mailed video intervention, or usual care (control). Intervention materials were mailed two weeks prior to a target primary care appointment and patient telephone surveys were conducted one week (T1) and one year (T2) after the target appointment. Outcomes included: a 10- item validated knowledge index; responses to questions on CaP natural history, treatment efficacy, PSA accuracy, and expert disagreement about the PSA; whether screening was discussed with provider; scores on decision information seeking, participation and satisfaction scales; screening and treatment preferences; and PSA testing rates.
