	<brief_summary>The relationship between Useful Field of Vision (UFOV) and falls taken by the elderly will be investigated. UFOV is a test which measures visual attention. The test has been used in correlating the visual attention in the elderly with their driving safety record. The test is administered using a computer and consists of three parts: a) subject views figures which appear in the center of the computer screen and identified them as quickly as possible; b)the subject has to identify figures in the center of the screen while at the same time point to another symbol which will appear in one of eight places on the outer portion of the screen; c) the third section is similar to the second except while the subject is identifying and pointing there is a background noise.</brief_summary>
