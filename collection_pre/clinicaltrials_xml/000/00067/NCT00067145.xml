	<brief_summary>Many overweight patients are able to lose weight successfully, but then regain their weight. The purpose of this study is to develop and test the efficacy of 2 interventions to prevent weight regain in individuals who have recently lost weight. The two interventions being tested are a face-to-face group maintenance program and an Internet intervention. These interventions will be compared to a no-contact control group that receives quarterly newsletters. The primary outcome measure is weight regain from baseline to 18-months.</brief_summary>
