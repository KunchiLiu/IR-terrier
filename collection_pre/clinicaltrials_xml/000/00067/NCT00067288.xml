	<brief_summary>We have developed an 8-week Meaning-Centered Group Psychotherapy designed to help patients with advanced cancer sustain or enhance a sense of meaning, peace and purpose despite the limitations of their cancer illness. This project's overall aim is to explore the feasibility and efficacy of this new and unique psychotherapy intervention for advanced cancer patients in enhancing psychological and spiritual well-being and quality of life by comparing it with a standard supportive group psychotherapy.</brief_summary>
