The most severely affected limb will be designated the index limb. CRPS pain severity score in the index limb of 4 or greater on an 11point (010) NRS (Appendix I). Opioid analgesics, nonopioid analgesics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, anticonvulsants and antidepressant drugs may be continued provided that the subject was on stable doses for at least four weeks prior to the Treatment phase. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of starting study drug. In addition, sexually active WCBP must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal ligation; intrauterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized partner) while on study drug. WCBP must agree to have pregnancy tests every 4 weeks while on study drug. The average CRPS pain severity score in the index limb at the end of the PreTreatment Phase I (must be 4 or greater) and 2 each of the daily scores over the week must be within +/ one point of this average. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form. Prior treatment with CC5013 Prior development of an allergic reaction/hypersensitivity while taking thalidomide. Prior development of a moderate or sever rash or any desquamation while taking thalidomide. Pregnant or lactating females. Active litigation, compensation or disability issues related to CRPS. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.
