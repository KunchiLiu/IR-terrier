	<brief_summary>This non-randomized, open-label, outpatient clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of daily orally administered EKB-569 in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Patients must have been previously treated with a platinum- and docetaxel-based therapy either given concurrently or as separate regimens. The primary objective of the study is to assess the clinical activity of EKB-569 administered orally as a second-line or later stage treatment in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Secondary objectives include: - To further evaluate the safety of EKB-569 - To explore additional clinical activity parameters - To explore subject survival - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of EKB-569 - To assess subject reported outcomes EKB-569 will be administered orally as a single-agent. Eligible subjects will take EKB-569 daily as long as they do not have progressive disease and are tolerating treatment.</brief_summary>
