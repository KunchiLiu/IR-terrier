	<criteria>Adults with hypertension on hemodialysis Hypertensive, longterm (3 months or more) hemodialysis patients will be studied over a 6 hemodialysis baseline phase during which 44hour interdialytic ambulatory BP will be performed and baseline symptoms collected. Patients with wellcontrolled hypertension, on antihypertensive therapy will have blood pressure medications withdrawn until they become hypertensive as assessed by 44hour interdialytic ambulatory blood pressure recording. We will exclude patients who have had vascular event (stroke, myocardial infarction or limb ischemia requiring bypass) within previous six months, ambulatory BP &gt;170 mm Hg systolic or &gt;100 mm Hg diastolic, those who miss 2 or more hemodialysis treatments in the previous month, abuse streetdrugs, require home oxygen, have symptomatic congestive heart failure or are morbidly obese (body mass index &gt; 40 kg/m2).</criteria>
