	<brief_summary>Diabetic nephropathy is a frequent cause of end-stage renal disease. Reduction of dietary protein has been used to slow down renal disease progression, but patients are often unwilling to make these dietary changes. Other research suggests that changing the quality of dietary protein may be as effective as reducing the total amount of ingested protein. This study hopes to show that soy protein, a plant protein relatively high in essential amino acids and with high nutritional value, maye be beneficial to Type I diabetic patients with incipient renal disease.</brief_summary>
