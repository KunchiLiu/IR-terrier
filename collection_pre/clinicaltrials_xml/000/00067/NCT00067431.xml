	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Subject has diagnosis of partial seizures with/without secondary generalization, supported by: Observed ictal events consistent with partial seizures: With/ without secondary generalization; Documented by reliable observers 1 of following 2: EEG at some time in past demonstrating focal abnormalities consistent with partial seizures; OR, in absence of demonstrable EEG abnormality: MRI/CT scan evidence of a focal CNS lesion consistent with partial seizures On stable dose of 1 or 2 antiepileptic drug(s) (AED) other than valproate, for at least 1 month Not taking valproate or is currently receiving valproate resulting in a trough concentration of less than 40 mcg/mL History of at least 4 partial seizures/month in 2 months prior to screening Parent/caregiver is able to keep an accurate seizure diary EXCLUSION CRITERIA: History of any of following: LennoxGastaut syndrome; Primary generalized seizures; Infantile spasms; Mixed seizure disorders including atypical absence; Myoclonic or atonic seizures; Pseudoseizures or Epilepsia Partialis Continuans (EPC) Has had status epilepticus in the past 6 months Has significant history of any of following that would confound study results: Cardiac (including clinically important abnormality on ECG); Renal; Psychiatric (including psychosurgery); Oncologic; Endocrine; Metabolic; Pancreatic; Hepatic disease (including clinical/serological history of hepatitis); Urea cycle disorder Has: Expanding CNS neoplasm; Active CNS infection; Demyelinating disease; Degenerative neurological disease; Progressive encephalopathy; or any Progressive CNS disease Has platelet count less than or equal to 100,000/mcL Has blood chemistry ALT/AST value(s) greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal at screening Requires anticoagulant drug therapy Not expected to be able to maintain same dose of all prestudy AEDs, excluding valproate, throughout study Receiving systemic chemotherapy Has taken lamotrigine, felbamate, or pemoline, within past 3 months prior to screening Has been on ketogenic diet within 30 days prior to screening Considered by investigator to be nonresponder to valproate for treatment of epilepsy (e.g., Despite adequate trial with serum concentrations of 60 mcg/mL or greater, subject continues to have inadequate seizure control)</criteria>
