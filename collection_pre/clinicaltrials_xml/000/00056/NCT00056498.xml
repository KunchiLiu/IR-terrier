	<brief_title>Risperidone Treatment in Schizophrenia Patients Who Are Currently Taking Clozapine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clozapine is the only antipsychotic drug that has been approved for treatment resistant patients with schizophrenia. However, up to 50% of patients treated with clozapine fail to respond and continue to exhibit clinically significant residual positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairments. An emerging trend in treatment is the addition of a second antipsychotic drug. This study will determine if risperidone when given as adjunctive treatment is more effective than placebo in treating schizophrenic patients failing clozapine therapy. Participants are randomly assigned to add either adjunctive risperidone or placebo to their current clozapine treatment in a single, daily dose for 16 weeks. Positive and negative symptoms, cognitive impairments, side effects of the treatment, anxiety, depression, hostility symptoms, and quality of life are assessed. Neurological tests, self administered questionnaires, and interviews are used to assess patients.</detailed_description>
