	<brief_summary>Randomized subjects will receive CC-5013 plus high-dose dexamethasone or placebo appearing identical to CC-5013 plus high-dose dexamethasone in 4-week cycles. Each subject will participate in a treatment phase and a follow-up phase.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CC-5013 Plus Dexamethasone Versus Dexamethasone Alone in Previously Treated Subjects With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of the efficacy and safety of CC-5013 plus oral pulse high-dose dexamethasone and oral pulse high-dose dexamethasone therapy alone in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups: Subjects in the CC-5013/Dex treatment group took 25 mg of CC-5013 orally once daily on Days 1 to 21 and a matching placebo capsule once daily on Days 22 to 28 of each 28-day cycle; Subjects in the Placebo/Dex treatment group took 1 placebo capsule on Days 1 to 28 of each 28-day cycle. Subjects in both treatment groups took 40 mg of dexamethasone orally once daily on Days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of each 28-day cycle for the first 4 cycles of therapy. Beginning with Cycle 5, the dose of dexamethasone was reduced to 40 mg orally once daily on Days 1 to 4 for the remaining cycles.</detailed_description>
