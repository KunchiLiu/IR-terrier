	<detailed_description>RATIONALE: Topical resiniferatoxin (RTX) administrated to the bladder may be effective in decreasing the symptoms associated with interstitial cystitis through its action on pain sensing neurons. PURPOSE: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial to determine the safety and efficacy of RTX in patients with interstitial cystitis.</detailed_description>

Previous augmentation cystoplasty, cystectomy or cystolysis, neurectomy (i.e., hypogastric nerve plexus ablation) or implanted peripheral nerve stimulator which has affected bladder function History of ureteral reflux. Patients with a history of childhood urinary tract infections, recurrent urinary tract infections as an adult (defined as &gt;3 culture documented episodes within the previous 12 months), or pyelonephritis at any time must have a cystourethogram to rule out ureteral reflux. Evidence of renal impairment (creatinine &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal at Visit 1), hepatic impairment (AST or ALT &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal at Visit 1), clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory, or psychiatric diseases Any condition that in the judgment of the investigator would interfere with the patient’s ability to provide informed consent, comply with study instructions, place the patient at increased risk, or which might confound the interpretation of the study results Treatment with a drug or medical device that has not received regulatory approval within the previous 30 days Investigators, study staff and their immediate families. Immediate family is defined as current spouse, parent, natural or legally adopted child (including a stepchild living in the investigator’s household), grandparent, or grandchild.
