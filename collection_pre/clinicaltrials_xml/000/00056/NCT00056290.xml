	<brief_summary>This gene therapy study is being conducted to evaluate intramuscular gene transfer using VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) in patients with diabetic neuropathy in the legs. This condition causes a decrease in feeling and sensation due to diabetes. VEGF is DNA, or genetic material that is injected into the muscles of the leg. Once in the leg, it has been shown to cause new blood vessels to grow under a variety of conditions.</brief_summary>
