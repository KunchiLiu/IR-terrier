	<brief_summary>This phase II, 43 patient trial, will evaluate the efficacy of GTI-2040, an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the R2 component of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) mRNA, in combination with capecitabine, in the setting of advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Preclinical studies have shown synergy between GTI-2040 and capecitabine against renal cell carcinoma.</brief_summary>
