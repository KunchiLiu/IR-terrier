	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining chemotherapy with cetuximab may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together with cetuximab works in treating patients with unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the surgical resectability rate of patients with unresectable hepatic metastases secondary to metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and cetuximab. - Determine the response rate and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour (over 2 hours on day 1 of course 1 only) on days 1 and 8. Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, for a minimum of 12 courses or until deemed to have resectable disease. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and prior to each treatment course. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 67-73 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.</detailed_description>
