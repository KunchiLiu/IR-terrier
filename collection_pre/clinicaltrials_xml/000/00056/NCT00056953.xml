	<brief_title>Peer Mentors for Adolescents in HIV Affected Families</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will conduct an efficacy trial of peer mentoring for a high-risk, predominantly minority population of 9- to 15-year-old youths whose parents are HIV infected. The study will also determine mechanisms (mediating variables) through which peer mentoring improves outcomes for the mentees, for example, consistency and continuity of relationship, teaching/role modeling, emotional support/empathy, advocacy, and behavioral reinforcement. After the conclusion of the efficacy trial, the study will continue through naturalistic longitudinal research for an additional 2 years in order to examine the long-term outcomes of peer mentoring. Participants are randomized to either the peer mentoring program or a control condition (a recreation program). Surveys are conducted at entry into the study, at 6 months, 1 year, and then annually for 2 years. Youths will also participate in focus groups. The surveys and focus groups will assess the youths’ psychological functioning, academic adjustment, alcohol and drug use, HIV risk behaviors, delinquent/violent behaviors, peer relationships, prosocial activities, and coping/problem-solving skills. The study will also evaluate family outcomes, including parent/guardian functioning and improved permanency planning.</detailed_description>
