	<brief_title>Therapeutic HIV Vaccine and Interleukin-2 to Increase the Immune System's Response to HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has contributed to the increasing control of HIV infection and viral replication, ultimate control of HIV infection will require the development of effective HIV-specific immunity in HIV infected individuals. This trial will evaluate the use of the ALVAC vCP1452 vaccine in combination with IL-2 to increase HIV-specific immune responses in HIV infected patients. ALVAC vCP1452 vaccine is a recombinant canarypox HIV vaccine that is administered as a monthly intramuscular injection. The IL-2 is self administered as a daily subcutaneous injection at a low, non-toxic dose (2 million units). Participants in this study are randomized to receive either ALVAC and IL-2 or placebo for the first 3 months of the study. During this time, participants will continue on their current antiretroviral medications and have monthly study visits. Study visits will include a brief medical interview and physical exam, administration of the vaccine, and blood tests. At the end of 3 months, participants will discontinue both their study medications (IL-2 and ALVAC or placebo) and their antiretroviral medications. This Diagnostic Treatment Interruption (DTI) will continue for a minimum of 3 months. During the DTI, participants will have weekly study visits in which viral and lymphocyte dynamics are monitored.</detailed_description>
