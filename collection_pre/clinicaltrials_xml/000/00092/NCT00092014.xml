	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate and compare the effects of Alendronate and Risedronate to treat women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. The primary hypothesis for this study is that in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, treatment with oral alendronate 70 mg once weekly will produce a mean percent increase from baseline in hip trochanter bone mineral density (BMD) at 12 and 24 months which is greater than that observed with oral risedronate 35 mg once weekly.</brief_summary>
