	<detailed_description>The original base study (V501-015) (NCT00092534) was extended in protocol V501-015-10. Subjects in the placebo arm of the base study were given 3 doses of open-label GARDASIL™ (V501) at Extension (EXT) Day 1, EXT Month 2 and EXT Month 6 and were followed to EXT Month 7. Subjects who received only 1 dose of GARDASIL™ in the base study were given 3 doses of open-label GARDASIL™ (V501) at Extension (EXT) Day 1, EXT Month 2 and EXT Month 6 and were followed to EXT Month 7. Subjects who received 2 doses of GARDASIL™ in the base study were given only 1 dose of GARDASIL™ at EXT Day 1 and were followed for 15 days (day of vaccination plus 14 days). A second extension study, V501-015-20, will assess the effectiveness, immunogenicity and safety of GARDASIL™ during a period of 10-14 years following completion of the base study (V501-015) or the V501-015-10 extension. Subjects from Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden who participated in the base study were eligible to enroll. Effectiveness and safety will be assessed by registry-based follow-up. Immunogenicity will be assessed by serological testing at approximately Year 5 and Year 10 of the V501-015-20 extension, respectively.</detailed_description>
