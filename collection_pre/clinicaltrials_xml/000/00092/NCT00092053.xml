	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The primary hypothesis of this study is that in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, oral monthly ibandronate, at doses of 100 mg and 150 mg, does not achieve persistence in reduction of bone resorption throughout the monthly dosing interval, as demonstrated by a larger change in the serum carboxyterminal crosslinked telopeptide of Type I collagen (CTX-I) log-transformed fraction from baseline four weeks post dose compared to one week post dose, during the third month of treatment, in the participants taking ibandronate than in the participants taking placebo.</brief_summary>
