	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as gemcitabine, carboplatin, and paclitaxel use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating non-small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of different combination chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the overall survival of patients with stage IIIB or IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treated with gemcitabine and carboplatin vs gemcitabine and paclitaxel vs paclitaxel and carboplatin. - Compare the overall response rate and time to progression in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to weight loss within the past 6 months (less than 5% vs at least 5%), disease stage (IIIB vs IV), and brain metastases (present vs absent). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1. - Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. - Arm III: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1. In all arms, treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 6 weeks during study treatment, and then every 3 months until progressive disease is documented. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,134 patients (378 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
