	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining irinotecan with gemcitabine in treating patients who have refractory advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan and Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan when administered with gemcitabine in patients with refractory advanced solid tumors. - Determine the antitumor activity and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the optimal dose and time interval for this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study of irinotecan. Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 2 and 9. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 8 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
