	<brief_title>Erlotinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme treated with erlotinib. - Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral erlotinib daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 73 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
