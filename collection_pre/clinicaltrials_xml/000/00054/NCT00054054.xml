	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0216, Combination Chemotherapy and RT in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall survival of patients with stage III or IV squamous cell head and neck cancer treated with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil followed by accelerated fractionation/concomitant boost radiotherapy and cisplatin. - Determine the unconfirmed complete response rate in these patients after treatment with induction chemotherapy. - Determine the overall complete response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed) in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: - Induction Chemotherapy: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. - Chemoradiotherapy: Beginning within 3-4 weeks after administration of the second course of induction chemotherapy, patients receive accelerated fractionation radiotherapy once daily, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks with concomitant boost radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for the last 2.5 weeks of radiotherapy. Patients also receive concurrent cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 22. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
