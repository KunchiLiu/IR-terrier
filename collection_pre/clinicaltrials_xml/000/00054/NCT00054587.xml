	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known which regimen of chemotherapy plus radiation therapy with or without trastuzumab is more effective in treating breast cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare two different chemotherapy regimens plus radiation therapy with or without trastuzumab in treating women who have breast cancer that has spread to lymph nodes in the axilla (under the arm).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Trastuzumab in Treating Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the efficacy of adjuvant cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil vs adjuvant docetaxel and epirubicin, in terms of 5-year survival without relapse, in women with nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast with lymph node invasion. - Determine survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the tolerability of trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the efficacy and tolerability of trastuzumab in patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors. - Evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center. Patients are treated in 2 parts. - Part I: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive fluorouracil IV, or epirubicin IV, and cyclophosphamide IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses. Patients then undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks. - Arm II: Patients receive epirubicin IV over 10 minutes and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses. Patients then undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients with HER2/neu-positive tumors then proceed to part II. Patients with HER2/neu-negative tumors receive no further treatment. Patients with hormone (estrogen or progesterone) receptor-positive tumors also receive oral tamoxifen daily beginning after chemotherapy is completed and continuing for 5 years. - Part II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes every 3 weeks for 1 year. - Arm II: Patients are followed without treatment. Patients not receiving trastuzumab are followed at 4 months, 6 months, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 3 years. Patients receiving trastuzumab are followed at 4 months and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,600 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
