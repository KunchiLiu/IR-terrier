	<criteria>Patients meeting the following criteria will be eligible for participation in th is study: 1. Human Immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV1) infected males or females &gt;=18 years of age. 2. Screening genotypic resistance report indicating both of the following: at least one primary protease Inhibitor (PI) mutation at the following sites: 30N, 46I/L, 48V, 50V, 82A/F/L/T, 84V or 90M, and no more than two protease mutations on codons 33, 82, 84, or 90. 3. At least 3 consecutive months experience taking antiretrovirals (ARVs) from each of the classes of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors(NRTI(s)), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors(NNRTI(s)), and protease inhibitors (PIs) at some point in treatment history,with at least 2 protease inhibitor (PI)based regimens, one of which must be the current regimen, and current protease inhibitor (PI)based antiretroviral (ARV) medication regimen for at least 3 months prior to randomization. 4. Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV1) viral load &gt;=1,000 copies/mL at screening. Exclusion criteria: Patients with any of the following criteria are excluded from participation in t he study: 1. Antiretroviral (ARV) medication na√Øve. 2. Patients on recent drug holiday, defined as off antiretroviral (ARV) medications for at least 7 consecutive days within the last 3 months. 3. alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;=3.0x upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase(AST) &gt;=2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) (&gt;=Division of AIDS(DAIDS) Grade 1) at either screening visit.</criteria>
