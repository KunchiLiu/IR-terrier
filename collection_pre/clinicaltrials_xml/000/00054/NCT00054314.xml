	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BAY 59-8862 in treating patients who have non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BAY 59-8862 in Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall response rate, including partial and complete response, in patients with taxane-resistant non-small cell lung cancer treated with BAY 59-8862. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine duration of response and time to progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive BAY 59-8862 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease receive 2-4 additional courses beyond maximal response. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-84 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
