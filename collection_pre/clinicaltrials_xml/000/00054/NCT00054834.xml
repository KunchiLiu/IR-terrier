Prior/Concurrent Therapy: Chemotherapy: Patients must have failed standard therapy or are not eligible for any alternate therapies of higher therapeutic priority. Biologic Therapy: Patients who have received human or humanized monoclonal antibodies will be eligible provided prestudy evaluations demonstrate no significant reactivity with hLL2 IgG (i.e., HAHA).

Pulmonary: Patients with DFCO and FEV1 &gt;/= 60% by required Pulmonary Function Tests. Other: Patients agreeing to use a medically effective method of contraception while enrolled in the study.
