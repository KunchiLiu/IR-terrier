	<brief_summary>This study will investigate whether CX516 can improve attention, memory, language, or behavior in adults with Fragile X Syndrome and/or Autism. CX516 is an AMPAKINEÂ® compound. AMPAKINE compounds enhance synaptic strength. There is evidence to suggest that the synapses in the brain of an individual with fragile X syndrome are immature and abnormal. It is possible CX516 may partially correct this synaptic transmission defect and lead to improvement in cognitive and behavioral functioning. There is also reason to believe that these changes caused by CX516 could be helpful in managing cognitive and behavioral symptoms in patients with autistic disorder. Involvement for each participant will last 28 days. Participants will be given study medication, a physical exam, and a variety of cognitive assessment tests to study potential drug effectiveness at improving disease symptoms.</brief_summary>
