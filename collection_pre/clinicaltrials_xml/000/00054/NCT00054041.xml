	<brief_summary>Vaccines made from antigens may make the body build an immune response to kill abnormal cervical cells and may be effective in preventing cervical cancer.

	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Preventing Cervical Cancer in Patients With Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of SGN-00101, in terms of complete histologic regression, in patients with grade III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine change in lesion size in these patients after treatment with this drug. II. Compare histologic response before and after treatment with this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive SGN-00101 subcutaneously once on weeks 1, 4, and 8 in the absence of disease progression. Arm II: Patients receive standard care. At week 15, all patients undergo large loop excision of the transformation zone under colposcopy. Patients are followed at 19 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-84 patients (14-42 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 12-48 months.</detailed_description>
