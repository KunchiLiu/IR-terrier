	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known which regimen of radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy, with or without surgery, is more effective in treating early cancer of the cervix. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery followed by different regimens of radiation therapy and chemotherapy with that of chemotherapy and radiation therapy alone in treating patients who have stage I cancer of the cervix.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy With or Without Surgery in Treating Patients With Stage I Cancer of the Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare progression-free survival and survival of patients with stage IB2 carcinoma of the cervix after radical hysterectomy with tailored chemoradiotherapy vs primary chemoradiotherapy. - Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the health-related quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: (Surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy): Patients undergo exploratory laparotomy followed by radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Depending on the findings at surgery, the radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy are either completed or aborted. - Aborted hysterectomy: Patients with aborted hysterectomy are assigned to 1 of 3 groups, depending on the findings at surgery. - Group 1: Within 4 weeks of surgery, patients undergo pelvic radiotherapy 5 times weekly for 4-6 weeks and intracavitary irradiation during or after external radiotherapy. Patients also receive concurrent cisplatin IV over 1 hour once weekly for a total of 5-6 doses. - Group 2: Patients receive radiotherapy and cisplatin as in group 1 with additional extended field radiotherapy. - Group 3: Patients receive further treatment at the discretion of the investigator. - Completed hysterectomy: Patients completing the radical hysterectomy are assigned to 1 of 3 groups, depending on the findings at surgery. - Group A: Patients receive treatment as in group 1 above without intracavity irradiation. - Group B: Patients receive treatment as in group 2 above without intracavity irradiation. - Group C: Patients receive no further treatment. - Arm II (Primary chemoradiotherapy): Patients undergo pelvic radiotherapy 5 times weekly for 4-6 weeks and intracavity irradiation during or after external radiotherapy. Patients also receive concurrent cisplatin IV over 1 hour once weekly for a total of 6 doses. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, during week 5 of therapy, and then at 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 740 patients (370 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 7.5 years.</detailed_description>
