	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as ABX-EGF can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ABX-EGF in treating patients who have prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the clinical effect of monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF, determined by the PSA response, in patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer with rising PSA values without metastasis. - Determine the pharmacokinetics and safety profile (including immunogenicity) of this drug in these patients. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the time to disease progression and time to PSA progression in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF IV over 1 hour once weekly. Treatment continues every 8 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
