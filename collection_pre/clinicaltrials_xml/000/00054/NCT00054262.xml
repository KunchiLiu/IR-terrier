	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of T900607 in treating patients who have unresectable liver cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T900607 in Treating Patients With Unresectable Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the complete and partial response rates of patients with chemotherapy-na√Øve unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with T900607. - Determine the efficacy of this drug, in terms of duration of response and time to disease progression, in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive T900607 IV over 1 hour once weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
