	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of karenitecin in treating patients who have persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer that has not responded to platinum-based treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Karenitecin in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity of karenitecin in patients with persistent or recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer. II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive karenitecin IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
