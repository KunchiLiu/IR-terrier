	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of T900607 in treating patients who have gastroesophageal junction cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T900607 in Treating Patients With Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate (complete and partial) in patients with previously treated gastric or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma treated with T900607. (Gastric carcinoma closed to accrual as of 02/04.) - Determine the duration of response and time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive T900607 IV over 1 hour once weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
