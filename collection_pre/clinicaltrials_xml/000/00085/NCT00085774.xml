Inability to tolerate or unwillingness to comply with required washout periods for all applicable medications and xanthinecontaining foods and beverages prior to the screening visit Treatment in an emergency room for asthmatic symptoms or hospitalization for asthmatic symptoms within twelve months prior to the first screening visit Experienced an upper respiratory tract infection and/or sinusitis associated with exacerbation of asthmatic symptoms not requiring emergency room treatment and/or hospitalization and/or treatment with oral or injected corticosteroids that has not resolved within four weeks prior to the screening visit History and/or presence of any clinicallysignificant acute or chronic disease, including but not limited to bronchitis, emphysema, active tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, clinically significant cardiovascular disease (including cardiac arrhythmias and uncontrolled hypertension), clinically significant hepatic, renal, or endocrine dysfunction, stroke, uncontrolled diabetes, hyperthyroidism, convulsive disorders, and neoplastic disease other than basal cell carcinoma of the skin Known or suspected substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, marijuana, etc.) and/or presence of any other medical or psychological conditions that in the investigator's opinion should preclude study enrollment.
