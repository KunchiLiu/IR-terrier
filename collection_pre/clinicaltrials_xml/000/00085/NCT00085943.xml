	<brief_summary>This study will compare the ability of fosamprenavir 700 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice a day or lopinavir 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice a day both combined with a fixed dose combination tablet of abacavir 600 mg and lamivudine 300 mg once a day to suppress virus levels of HIV to less than 400 copies/mL of blood. In addition we will study the safety and tolerability of these compounds over the 48 week study period in patients naive to anti-HIV therapy.</brief_summary>
