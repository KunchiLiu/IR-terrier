	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well triapine works as first-line or second-line therapy in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma (cancer) of the pancreas. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as triapine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triapine as First-Line or Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cancer of the Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the 3- and 6-month survival rate of patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with 3-AP (Triapine^®) as first- or second-line therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this drug in these patients. II. Determine the time to treatment failure in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine overall survival and disease progression in patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine tumor response in patients treated with this drug. V. Determine laboratory studies that will increase our understanding of Triapine and its effects on cellular processes. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients receive triapene IV over 2 hours on days 1-4 and 15-18. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3-6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
