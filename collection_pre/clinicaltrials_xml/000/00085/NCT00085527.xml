	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: FR901228 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well FR901228 works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory advanced ovarian epithelial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FR901228 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Advanced Ovarian Epithelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate (complete and partial) in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced ovarian epithelial carcinoma treated with FR901228 (depsipeptide). - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Correlate clinical response with platinum sensitivity in patients treated with this drug. - Correlate clinical response with P-glycoprotein expression or p53 status in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to response to prior platinum administration (platinum resistant vs platinum sensitive). Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
