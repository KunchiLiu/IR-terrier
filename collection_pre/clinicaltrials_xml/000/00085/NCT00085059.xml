	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Boron neutron capture therapy using boronophenylalanine-fructose complex may kill tumor cells without harming normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well boron neutron capture therapy using boronophenylalanine-fructose complex works in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Boron Neutron Capture Therapy Using Boronophenylalanine-Fructose Complex in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the therapeutic activity and efficacy of boron neutron capture therapy using boronophenylalanine-fructose complex in patients with metastatic melanoma. - Determine the objective local response in patients treated with this regimen. Secondary - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the duration of local response and time to local progression in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the dose-response relationship at the per-lesion level in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive boronophenylalanine-fructose complex IV over 90 minutes followed by boron neutron capture therapy on days 1 and 2. Patients are followed at 1 and 6 weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter. In the event of disease progression, patients are followed every 3 months for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-24 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
