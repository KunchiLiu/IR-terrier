	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Inserting a gene that has been created in the laboratory into a person's white blood cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Combining gene-modified white blood cell infusions with interleukin-2 and vaccine therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well giving gene-modified white blood cells when given together with interleukin-2 and vaccine therapy works in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene-Modified White Blood Cells Followed By Interleukin-2 and Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine, preliminarily, any clinical tumor regression in lymphodepleted patients with metastatic melanoma treated with fowlpox gp100 antigen immunization and antitumor antigen T-cell receptor (TCR)-engineered tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or CD8+ autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes followed by interleukin-2. Secondary - Determine the in vivo survival of TCR gene-engineered cells in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to their ability to produce tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) (yes vs no). Patients receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -7 and -6 and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -5 to -1. - Stratum 1 (TIL): Patients receive TIL retrovirally transduced with gp100 antigen TCR gene IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0*. - Stratum 2 (CD8+peripheral blood lymphocytes [PBL]): Patients receive CD8+PBL retrovirally transduced with gp100 antigen TCR gene IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0*. NOTE: *Day 0 is 1-4 days after the last dose of fludarabine. Patients in both strata also receive fowlpox-gp100 vaccine (before TIL/PBL infusion) IV over 1-2 minutes on days 0 and 28 and high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours on days 0-4 and days 28-32. Patients also receive G-CSF SC once daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 6-8 weeks after the last dose of vaccine and high-dose IL-2, patients with stable or responding disease may receive 1 retreatment course. Responding patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 61 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
