	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of FR901228 and to see how well it works in treating patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas. FR901228 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FR901228 in Treating Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FR901228 (depsipeptide) in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas who are taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs). (Phase I) II. Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. (Phase I) III. Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients. (Phase I) IV. Determine the clinical efficacy of this drug, as measured by 6-month progression-free survival and objective tumor response, in these patients. (Phase II) V. Determine the safety profile of this drug when administered at the phase I MTD concurrently with or without EIAEDs in these patients. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study. Patients are stratified according to study phase (I vs II), concurrent use of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (yes vs no), histology (recurrent glioblastoma multiforme/gliosarcoma vs recurrent anaplastic glioma), pre-operative candidacy (yes vs no), and measurable/evaluable disease (yes vs no). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups (group A: no EIAEDs or group B: concurrent use of EIAEDs). Phase I (group B only): Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of FR901228 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of up to 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Phase II (groups A and B): Group A (phase II): Patients receive FR901228 as in phase I at dose level 1. Group B (phase II): Patients receive FR901228 as in phase I at the MTD.</detailed_description>
