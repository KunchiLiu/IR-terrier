	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well docetaxel works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma (cancer).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Endometrial Carcinoma (Cancer)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of docetaxel in patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-18 months.</detailed_description>
