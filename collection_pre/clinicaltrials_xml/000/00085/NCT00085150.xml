	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: LMB-2 immunotoxin can locate cancer cells and kill them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of LMB-2 immunotoxin in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia or lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LMB-2 Immunotoxin in Treating Young Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Leukemia or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of LMB-2 immunotoxin in pediatric patients with CD-25 positive relapsed or refractory leukemia or lymphoma. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug, including the terminal elimination serum half-life, area under the curve, volume of distribution, and relationship to disease burden, in these patients. Secondary - Evaluate the immonogenicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine changes in lymphocyte subsets, immunoglobulin levels, serum cytokines, and soluble cytokine receptor levels in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive LMB-2 immunotoxin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression, neutralizing antibodies (i.e., &gt; 75% of the activity of 1 µg/mL of LMB-2 immunotoxin), or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete remission (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia also receive cytarabine and hydrocortisone intrathecally once monthly concurrent with restaging lumbar punctures. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of LMB-2 immunotoxin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, a total of 12 patients are treated at that dose level. Patients are followed weekly for 1 month and then monthly thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-4 years.</detailed_description>
