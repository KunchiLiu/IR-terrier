	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with advanced solid tumors will receive investigational study drug ARRY-142886. This study has 2 parts. In the first part, patients will receive increasing doses of study drug in order to achieve the highest dose of study drug possible that will not cause unacceptable side effects. Approximately 25 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 1 (Completed). In the second part of the study, patients will receive the best dose of study drug, determined from the first part of the study, and will be followed to see what side effects the study drug causes and what effectiveness the study drug has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 35 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 2 (Completed).</brief_summary>
