	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with a monoclonal antibody may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether cetuximab is more effective when given at the same time as chemotherapy or following chemotherapy. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab at the same time as combination chemotherapy works compared to giving cetuximab after combination chemotherapy in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0342: Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, and Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare overall survival of patients with selected stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer treated with concurrent vs sequential paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab. Secondary - Compare response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial) in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. - Correlate epidermal growth factor receptor polymorphisms and downstream biomarkers with response to cetuximab in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I (concurrent cetuximab): Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour (over 2 hours on day 1 of course 1 only) on days 1, 8, and 15 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 4 courses (12 weeks) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on week 13, patients receive single-agent cetuximab IV over 1 hour once weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II (sequential cetuximab): Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 4 courses (12 weeks) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on week 13, patients receive single-agent cetuximab IV over 1 hour (over 2 hours on week 13 only) once weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (90 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 9 months.</detailed_description>
