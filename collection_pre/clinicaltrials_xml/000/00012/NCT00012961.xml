	<brief_title>Improving Health Services for Veterans With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Schizophrenia exacts a high toll on the lives of patients and their families and constitutes a major health care cost. VISN 5 has placed special emphasis on improving care for veterans with severe mental disorders, an effort recently recognized by the VA as a Program of Excellence in the Care of Seriously Mentally Ill Veterans. Objectives: This study is implementing a set of promising QOC methods for assessing QOC for schizophrenia in routine settings, using the evidence-based treatment recommendations developed under the AHCPR/NIMH-sponsored Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT). Methods: A random sample of 350 persons with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder is being drawn from the VISN 5 sites. Patients must have more than one outpatient contact during the preceding six months. Each subject will participate in two one-hour interviews, one at baseline and another six months later. An informant, psychiatrist, therapist, etc. will also be interviewed to help validate participant response. Status: Project work is ongoing.</detailed_description>
