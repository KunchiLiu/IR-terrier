	<brief_summary>Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining UCN-01 with cisplatin in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. UCN-01 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth and may help cisplatin kill more cancer cells by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cisplatin in combination with UCN-01 in patients with advanced malignancies. II. To assess the toxicity and observe the potential antitumor activity of UCN-01 plus cisplatin in advanced malignancies at each dose level studies. III. To determine the pharmacokinetics of UCN-01 and cisplatin on this treatment schedule. IV. To perform laboratory correlative studies to investigate intermediate molecular markers of the activity of UCN-01 and cisplatin at the cellular level. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cisplatin. Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and UCN-01 IV continuously over 36-72 hours on day 2. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cisplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 2-3 months for at least 1 year.</detailed_description>
