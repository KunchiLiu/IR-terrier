	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of irofulven in treating patients who have progressive or recurrent astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, or glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of irofulven alone or combined with anticonvulsants known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 in patients with progressive or recurrent high-grade anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, or glioblastoma multiforme. - Assess the pharmacokinetics of this drug on this schedule and determine the effects of P450-inducing anticonvulsants on the pharmacokinetics in these patients. - Determine the response rate of patients treated with this drug administered at the MTD. - Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent use of anticonvulsant drugs that induce cytochrome P450 (yes vs no drugs or modest-induction drugs). Patients receive irofulven IV over 30 minutes on days 1-4 or 1-5 (depending on dose-escalation level). Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients (per stratum) receive escalating doses of irofulven until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are accrued to receive treatment with irofulven at the recommended phase II dose. Patients are followed at 1 week and then every 2 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients (9 per stratum) will be accrued for the phase I portion of the study. Approximately 17-35 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of the study within 6-12 months.</detailed_description>
