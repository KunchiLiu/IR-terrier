	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Team Treatment of Depression in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Most depression treatment takes place in primary care, where the condition continues to be under-detected and under-treated. A collaborative care model derived from chronic illness management theory has been successful in improving care in other managed care settings. Objectives: This effectiveness study adapted collaborative care to the VA primary care setting ("collaborative care") and compared it with consult-liaison care ("CL care"). Methods: Patients within a VA primary care clinic were randomly assigned by firm to the two interventions. In collaborative care, existing staff resources were reorganized to form a multidisciplinary mental health specialist team. The team developed a treatment plan based on an initial assessment and suggested the plan to the primary care provider. Primary care providers' treatment efforts were then supported by brief Social Work telephone calls designed to support adherence and monitor symptomatology. Treatment results were systematically reviewed and suggestions for treatment modification were fed back to the primary providers. In CL care, the primary care providers were informed of the diagnosis and study clinicians facilitated referrals to Psychiatry residents in-clinic as requested. Mailed and in-clinic surveys and provider referral were used to recruit 168 collaborative care and 186 CL care patients who met criteria for major depression and/or dysthymia based on structured interview. Patients were excluded only if they required immediate inpatient care, had a pending mental health specialty clinic appointment, or had primary alcohol abuse. Outcome data on the SCL-20 depression symptomatology measure, Veterans SF-36, and Sheehan Disability Scale were collected at baseline, 3 and 9 months. VA utilization and costs of care were analyzed. Status: Complete. Final Report submitted June 30, 2001.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Several screening methods including mailed and inclinic surveys and provider referral were used to recruit 168 team and 188 CL study patients who met criteria for major depression and/or dysthymia based on structured interview. Patients were excluded only if they required immediate inpatient care, had a pending mental health specialty clinic appointment, had primary alcohol abuse, or were too impaired to participate in the screening interview. Outcome data on the SCL20 depression symptomatology measure, SF36V, and Sheehan functional impairment measure were collected at baseline, 3 and 9 months.</criteria>
