	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of annamycin liposomal in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the observed anti-tumor activity of annamycin liposomal in patients with anthracycline-resistant locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the clinical pharmacology of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the rationale for the dose and chosen schedule of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive annamycin liposomal IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-30 months.</detailed_description>
