	<brief_summary>A Web-based telemedicine system for monitoring the status of patients with pressure ulcers has been developed. It consists of three major data collection components: (1) digital photograph of ulcer; (2) quantitative measurements of wound status (i.e., ulcer area and volume, skin elasticity); and (3) other wound and patient data collected by a nurse. Data are collected via laptop computer and transmitted to a central database, where a computer program transforms the data into the necessary reporting format. The output is posted onto a World Wide Web page for access by the consulting physician. The system incorporates all data requirements for assessment recommended by AHCPR's Clinical Practice Guideline, Treatment of Pressure Ulcers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: A Web-based telemedicine system for monitoring the status of patients with pressure ulcers has been developed. It consists of three major data collection components: (1) digital photograph of ulcer; (2) quantitative measurements of wound status (i.e., ulcer area and volume, skin elasticity); and (3) other wound and patient data collected by a nurse. Data are collected via laptop computer and transmitted to a central database, where a computer program transforms the data into the necessary reporting format. The output is posted onto a World Wide Web page for access by the consulting physician. The system incorporates all data requirements for assessment recommended by AHCPR's Clinical Practice Guideline, Treatment of Pressure Ulcers. Objectives: The primary objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the clinical accuracy of a telemedicine system for assessing the status of pressure ulcers, both chronic and those which have been surgically repaired. The principal hypotheses were: (1) use of the telemedicine system results in the same diagnoses as does in-person patient assessment; and (2) patients are satisfied with the telemedicine system. Methods: Two VA medical centers and two specialties participated in the study: Ann Arbor (plastic surgery) and Augusta (plastic surgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation). They contributed inpatients and outpatients with a pressure ulcer of stage II, III, or IV over a one-year enrollment period. All study patients were assessed both in-person (the "gold standard") and with the telemedicine system. The in-person and telemedicine physicians provided yes/no responses to four diagnostic questions concerning wound healing and infection, based on AHCPR guidelines, and they were blinded to each otherï¿½s assessments. Patient satisfaction data were collected using a specially designed, self-administered questionnaire to measure perceptions regarding the burden of the telemedicine system, confidence in the evaluation, and absence of direct contact with a physician.
