	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have metastatic or recurrent cancer of the esophagus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0101 Gemcitabine and Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Cancer of the Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the 6-month survival rate of patients with metastatic or recurrent carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with gemcitabine and irinotecan. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-55 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
