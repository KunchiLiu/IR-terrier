	<brief_title>Telephone Administered Psychotherapy for the Treatment of Depression for Veterans in Rural Areas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More that 20% of patients in primary care have depressive disorders. While primary care is the principal venue for treatment for depression, fewer than 25% of depressed patients receive adequate treatment for their depression. These outcomes can be worse when there are barriers to treatment such as living in a rural area. Several studies have found that given a choice, about two-thirds of depressed primary care patients prefer psychotherapy or counseling over antidepressant medication. This is a controlled, randomized trial in which subjects meeting criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) from primary care settings in VISN 21 including CBOCs will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1) a 16-session manualized telephone administered cognitive behavioral therapy (T-CBT) delivered over 24 weeks or 2) a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition. Telephone-administered cognitive behavioral therapy (T-CBT) is an intervention aimed at improving coping skills and social functioning. It is divided into two phases: 1) an initial treatment phase consisting of 12 weekly sessions aimed at reducing symptoms of depression, and 2) a booster phase in which 4 sessions are provided at increasingly greater intervals to target maintenance of treatment gains. T-CBT, administered by doctoral level psychologists, will be compared to a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition that controls for the natural course of depression during the course of treatment.</detailed_description>
