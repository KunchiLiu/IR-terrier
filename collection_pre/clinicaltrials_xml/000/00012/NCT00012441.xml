	<brief_summary>Hemodialysis remains associated with a high mortality (approximately 22% per year) and many complications despite improvements over the last twenty years. Several nephrologists have suggested that increasing the frequency and amount of dialysis will result in improved outcomes. In fact, various forms of daily dialysis have been performed in over 300 patients in the last 30 years with improvements in blood pressure, quality-of-life, bone disease, and other complications of renal failure. Whether this form of treatment can be expanded to the 220,000 Americans on hemodialysis is unknown. The primary outcome of this study is to determine the effectiveness of nocturnal dialysis in hemodialysis patients in St. Louis. If the pilot study is effective, then participation in a larger, multicenter trial is expected. The endpoints measured are use of antihypertensive medications, improvement in secondary hyperparathyroidism and use of phosphorus binders, quality-of-life measured by SF-36 surveys, and improvement in physical function as measured by maximal oxygen uptake.</brief_summary>
