	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the highest dose of MLN2704 that can be given multiple times safely to patients with prostate cancer, and to identify any side effects associated with taking the drug. This study will also evaluate how MLN2704 is taken up, broken down and eliminated by the body.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologic or cytologic diagnosis (recent or remote) of prostate adenocarcinoma Radiographic evidence (recent or remote) of metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma 18 years of age or older Progressive prostate cancer as defined by the presence of one or more of the following despite castrate levels of testosterone (testosterone &lt;50 ng/dL): 1. Progressive tumor lesions (changes in the size of lymph nodes or parenchymal masses on physical examination or Xray and CT scan or MRI) 2. Progressive bone metastasis (presence of new lesion(s) on a bone scan) 3. Progressive PSA levels (as defined in Section 3.6.1) Subjects who have received an antiandrogen must have shown progression of disease following discontinuation of the antiandrogen Subjects must remain on luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) analog therapy for the duration of the trial unless surgically castrate Agree to use an effective barrier method of contraception.
