	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Cyclosporine may help the immune system slow the growth of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well cyclosporine works in treating patients with recurrent or refractory angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclosporine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Angioimmunoblastic T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate (complete and partial) in patients with recurrent or refractory angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma treated with cyclosporine. Secondary - Determine the disease-free, progression-free, and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral cyclosporine twice daily for up to 36 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression during weeks 1-6. Patients experiencing disease progression during weeks 7-36, receive an additional 36 weeks of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of angioimmunoblastic Tcell lymphoma (recurrent or refractory) based on histologic examination. At least one objective measurable or evaluable disease parameter. Have failed at least one type of treatment: chemotherapy, autotransplant, or steroid treatment. Patients may not receive concurrent chemotherapy. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02. Adequate renal function as indicated by creatinine &lt;= 1.5 the upper limit of normal (ULN). Adequate liver function as indicated by alkaline phosphatase, Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;= 2x the upper limit of normal. Total bilirubin &lt;= 2x the upper limit of normal. Age 18 or older. Prior cyclosporine or Tacrolimus (FK506). Prior allogeneic transplant. Evidence of active infection. Congestive heart failure, kidney failure, liver failure, or other severe comorbidities. Evidence of active neurological impairment. Previous history of hypersensitivity to cyclosporine and/or Cremorphor EL (polyoxyethylated oil). History of other malignancies (other than cured carcinomas in situ of the cervix or basal cell carcinoma of the skin). pregnant or breastfeeding women. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive.</criteria>
