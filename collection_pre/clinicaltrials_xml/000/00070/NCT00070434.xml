	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well different regimens of induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy work in treating patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of obtaining a pre-treatment determination of intratumoral molecular markers (TS, DPD, and ERCC-1) for use in selection of the appropriate regimen for induction cytotoxic combination chemotherapy in patients with cT3-4 rectal adenocarcinoma. - Determine the response probability (unconfirmed, complete and partial) in patients treated with targeted induction cytotoxic chemotherapy. - Determine the toxicity of targeted induction cytotoxic chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy in these patients. - Determine the response probability in these patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. - Induction chemotherapy: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups based on molecular analysis of the pretreatment tumor specimen. - Group I (lower likelihood of resistance to a fluorouracil-based regimen): Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours beginning on day 1. - Group II (higher likelihood of resistance to a fluorouracil-based regimen): Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1. - Group III (high likelihood of sensitivity to oxaliplatin and fluorouracil therapy): Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 90 minutes and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Treatment in all groups repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are evaluated for response approximately 2 weeks after the completion of induction chemotherapy. Patients with stable disease or better receive chemoradiotherapy. - Chemoradiotherapy: Beginning approximately 3 weeks after the completion of induction chemotherapy, patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily continuously for 5 weeks and concurrent radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks. After chemoradiotherapy, patients may undergo attempted surgical resection at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-65 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
