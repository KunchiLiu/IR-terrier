	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as edotecarin use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well edotecarin works in treating women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Edotecarin in Treating Women With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer That Has Not Responded to Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the antitumor activity of edotecarin in women with anthracycline- and taxane-refractory or chemoresistant locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Secondary - Determine the time to tumor response and duration of response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the clinical benefit of this drug in these patients. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive edotecarin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 31-65 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
