	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to use single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (f-MRI) of the brain to study the response of both normal participants and participants with Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee to acupuncture.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Brain Imaging - Acupuncture and Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent experimental studies in both animal and humans have begun to demonstrate some measurable physiologic effects that are associated with acupuncture, suggesting the possibility of a neurophysiologic explanation. In addition, brain research continues to uncover a complex set of endogenous neurologic control systems, such that it has become clear that the brain plays a major role in the modulation of pain perception and control. If acupuncture can be demonstrated to have a consistent effect on specific areas of the brain, it will become possible to explore the potential efficacy of acupuncture based on measurable neurophysiologic responses.</detailed_description>
