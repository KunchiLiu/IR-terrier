	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Denileukin diftitox may be able to make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well denileukin diftitox works in treating patients with metastatic melanoma or metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Denileukin Diftitox in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma or Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the clinical response in patients with metastatic melanoma or metastatic kidney cancer treated with denileukin diftitox. Secondary - Determine whether changes occur in levels of CD4-positive CD25-positive lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of these patients before and after treatment with this drug. - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease type (metastatic melanoma vs metastatic kidney cancer). Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV over 1 hour on days 1-5, 21-25, 42-46, and 63-67. Treatment repeats every 84 days (12 weeks) for up to a maximum total of 5 courses in the absence of disease progression, autoimmune ocular toxicity attributable to denileukin diftitox, or any other unacceptable toxicity. At any time during therapy, patients achieving a complete response receive 1 additional course of therapy after the complete response. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-96 patients (5-48 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 3-4 years.</detailed_description>
