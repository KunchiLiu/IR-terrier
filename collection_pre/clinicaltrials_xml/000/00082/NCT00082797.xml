	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Leucovorin may decrease side effects caused by high-dose methotrexate. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving high-dose methotrexate together with leucovorin works in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Methotrexate and Leucovorin in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme treated with high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin calcium. Secondary - Determine the acute toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the duration of survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive high-dose methotrexate IV over 4 hours on day 1 and oral or IV leucovorin calcium every 6 hours beginning on day 2 and continuing until blood methotrexate levels are acceptable. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive standard radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Patients with disease progression proceed to standard radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy upon stopping methotrexate therapy. Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 2 months for up to 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-36 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
