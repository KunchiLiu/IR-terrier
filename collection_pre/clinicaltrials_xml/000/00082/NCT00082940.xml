	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as denileukin diftitox, may interfere with the growth of cancer cells and slow the growth of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well denileukin diftitox works in treating patients with fludarabine-refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Denileukin Diftitox in Treating Patients With Fludarabine-Refractory B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the complete and partial response rate in patients with fludarabine-refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with denileukin diftitox. Secondary - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the response rate in patients (regardless of CD25 receptor density) treated with this drug. - Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response after 8 courses proceed to follow-up. Patients achieving a partial response or stable disease after 8 courses may continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then annually until relapse. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
