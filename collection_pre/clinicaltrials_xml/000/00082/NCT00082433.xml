	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if BMS-247550 added to the approved therapy of capecitabine (Xeloda) provides measurable clinical benefits over capecitabine alone in women with metastatic breast cancer. Patients should have previously received an anthracycline and a taxane. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.</brief_summary>

Patients may not have any history of brain and/or leptomeningeal metastases. Patients may not have Grade 2 or worse neuropathy at the time of study entry.
