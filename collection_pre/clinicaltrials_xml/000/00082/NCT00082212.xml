	<brief_title>A Study in Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian or Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the overall response rate of cetuximab alone in subjects with ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma who have persistent or recurrent disease following 1-2 previous regimens of chemotherapy. Potential relationship between response, dose, and the occurence of rash in the treatment of subjects who have stable disease after the initial 6 weeks of treatment, time to progression, and 1 yr survival.</detailed_description>
