Hemoglobinuria c.) Jaundice d.) Respiratory distress (respiratory rate &gt;= 30/min) e.) Persistent vomiting f.) Hematuria, as reported by the patient Presence of nonfalciparum species on microscopy Pregnant or breastfeeding women History of allergy to or hypersensitivity to azithromycin or any macrolide, mefloquine or related compounds (e.g. quinine and quinidine), or chloroquine Known or suspected folate deficiency Known history of blood dyscrasias (e.g., megaloblastic anemia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, hemolytic anemia) Known G6PD deficiency History of epilepsy or psoriasis History of treatment with any antimalarial drug (chloroquine, quinine, mefloquine, Malarone, SP, artemisinin compounds) or antibacterial with known antimalarial activity (macrolides, doxycycline, clindamycin) within 2 weeks prior to enrollment into the study Known or suspected cardiovascular, hepatic or renal abnormality that in the opinion of the Investigator would place the subject at increased risk to participate in the study.
