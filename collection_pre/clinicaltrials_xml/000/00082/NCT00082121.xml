	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of TP10, a Complement Inhibitor, in Adult Women Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During cardiac surgery, a substance called “complement” is released by the body. This complement causes inflammation, which can lead to side effects such as chest pain, heart attacks, or heart failure. The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug (TP10), which blocks complement release, can reduce such side events and be taken safely in women.</detailed_description>
