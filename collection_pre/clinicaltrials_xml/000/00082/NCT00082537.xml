	<brief_summary>This study is a double-blind, randomized study of MK0991 versus liposomal amphotericin B in the empirical treatment of pediatric patients (ages 2 through 17 years) who have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 500/microliter and who have fever despite broad antibiotic coverage. Such patients would be candidates for empirical therapy with an intravenous anti-fungal agent.</brief_summary>
