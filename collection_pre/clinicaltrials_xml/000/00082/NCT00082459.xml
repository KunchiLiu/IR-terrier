	<brief_title>Trial to Compare the Routes of Administration of an Investigational, Personalized, Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine Oncophage (HSPPC-96) in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this trial is to determine the safety of HSPPC-96 and which route of administration achieves a better response with the vaccine. HSPPC-96 is an immunotherapeutic agent made from an individual patient's tumor. The study is being conducted in Houston, Texas with patients enrolled into one of two treatment arms. The two treatment arms are either subcutaneous injection or intradermal injection, both with HSPPC-96. To be treated with HSPPC-96 patients must undergo surgery to remove the kidney tumor and a portion of this tissue will be sent to Antigenics' manufacturing facility for processing.</detailed_description>
