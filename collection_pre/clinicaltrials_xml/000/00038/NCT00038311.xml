	<brief_summary>Intensive chemotherapy is associated with significant thrombocytopenia, often requiring platelet transfusion to maintain platelet counts. This investigational drug has demonstrated the ability to increase platelet counts. This study will test the safety and efficacy of an investigational drug in the prevention of thrombocytopenia in patients with high-risk sarcoma receiving AI (Adriamycin/Ifosfamide) chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
