	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in the rate of healing of a tibia fracture treated with an intramedullary nail based on whether or not the bone was reamed prior to nail insertion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SPRINT - Randomized Trial of Tibial Fracture Fixation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with tibia fractures that are amenable to being treated with both a reamed and an unreamed nail will be randomized via telephone to one of the two groups. These patients then will be followed for a year with clinical, as well as subjective, outcome follow-up questionnaires. Time to healing, as well as repeat interventions and adverse events, will be tracked. The rationale for doing a large sample size multi-center trial is the hope that a clear answer to whether or not one of these two methods is significantly better than the other will become apparent and thus aid surgeons in making a more informed operative treatment choice.</detailed_description>
