	<brief_summary>This study is designed to test the hypothesis that African-Americans respond less well to combination pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy than Caucasian-Americans who have chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 and who were not previously treated with either interferon or ribavirin. Reasons for differences in response, regardless of race, will be studied.</brief_summary>
