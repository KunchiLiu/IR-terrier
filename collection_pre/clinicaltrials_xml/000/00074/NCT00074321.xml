	<brief_summary>Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug may kill more tumor cells. This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine in treating patients with unresectable solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan, Oxaliplatin, and Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Unresectable Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To define the maximally tolerated dose of the combination of CPT-11 (irinotecan hydrochloride), oxaliplatin, and capecitabine in three different populations, based on UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) genotype (6/6, 6/7, and 7/7). II. To identify any activity of this treatment combination in patients with metastatic cancer. III. To examine the differences in the toxicity profile, especially pertaining to hematologic and gastrointestinal (GI), and the maximally tolerated dose of the combination of CPT-11, oxaliplatin and capecitabine with respect to the UGT1A1 haplotypes. IV. Examine the effect of the UGT1A1 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of CPT-11 and its metabolites. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to UGT1A1 genotype (6/6 vs 6/7 [closed to accrual as of 8/24/06] vs 7/7). Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (QD) on days 2-15. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan hydrochloride, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 6-10 patients (for a total of 12 patients) receive treatment at that dose. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54-84 patients (12-22 for stratum I, 18-28 for stratum II [closed to accrual as of 8/24/06], and 24-34 for stratum III) will be accrued for this study within approximately 4.4 years.</detailed_description>
