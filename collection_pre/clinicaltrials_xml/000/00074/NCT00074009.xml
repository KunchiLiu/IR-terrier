	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who have unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Gastric Cancer or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of bortezomib in patients with unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Secondary - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine possible predictors of response to this drug, using pretreatment tumor immunohistochemistry, in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study. Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-33 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-12 months.</detailed_description>
