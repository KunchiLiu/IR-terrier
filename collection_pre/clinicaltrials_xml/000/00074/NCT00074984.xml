	<brief_summary>People with Fabry disease have an alteration in their genetic material (DNA) which causes a deficiency of the a-galactosidase A enzyme. Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta) is a drug that helps to breakdown and remove certain types of fatty substances called "glycolipids." These glycolipids are normally present within the body in most cells. In Fabry disease, glycolipids build up in various tissues such as the liver, kidney, skin, and blood vessels because a-galactosidase A is not present, or is present in small quantities. The build up of glycolipid ("globotriaosylceramide" or "GL-3") levels in these tissues in particular is thought to cause the clinical symptoms that are common to Fabry disease. This study will test the safety and efficacy of Fabrazyme in the treatment of patients with Fabry disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must provide written informed consent Patients must be at least 16 years old Patients must have a current diagnosis of Fabry disease and have a clinical presentation consistent of Fabry disease (decreased sweating, Fabry pain, angiokeratoma, etc.) Patients may not have received enzyme replacement therapy as a treatment for Fabry disease Patients must have a documented plasma agalactosidase A (aGAL) activity of &lt; 1.5 nmol/hr/mL or a documented leukocyte aGAL activity of &lt; 4 nmol/hr/mg Patients must have one or more of the following: a serum creatinine measurement of 1.2 to 3 mg/dL (106.1 to 265 umol/L) OR estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 80 mL/min only if the patient's serum creatinine measurement is &lt; 1.2 mg/dL Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to each dosing and all female patients must use a medically accepted form of contraception Patient has undergone or is currently scheduled for kidney transplantation or is currently on dialysis Patient has acute renal failure Patient has participated in a study employing an investigational drug within 30 days of study entry Patient has diabetes mellitus or presence of confounding renal disease Patient has a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke within 3 months of study entry documented by mildtomoderate neurological deficit Patient has critical coronary disease Patient has congestive heart failure Patient has severe residual neurological deficit that will confound the detection of new events as determined by an attending neurologist and/or Principal Investigator Patient is unwilling to comply with the requirements of the protocol or the patient has a medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or extenuating circumstances that would significantly decrease study compliance, including prescribed followup</criteria>
