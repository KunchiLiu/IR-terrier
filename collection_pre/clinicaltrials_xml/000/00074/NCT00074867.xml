	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether CP-547,632, an oral VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor is effective in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal serous cancer, or fallopian tube cancer for patients who have failed first line platinum-based therapy and have a persistent rising CA-125.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically proven epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal serous cancer, or fallopian tube cancerRecurrent or persistent elevated CA125. For the purpose of this study, elevated CA125 is defined as a value of â‰¥40 U/ml on two separate consecutive determinations made â‰¥1 week apart. CA125 values obtained within 4 weeks of abdominal surgery should not be taken into account. No definitive disease or clinical and findings of small volume disease (&amp;#163;1cm by spiral CT or &amp;#163;2cm by conventional CT or clinical exam). No prior exposure to mouse antibodies or prior VEGF or VEGF receptor targeted treatment or other antiangiogenicdirected, anticancer treatment including thalidomide. No prior consolidation therapy with cytotoxic agents for ovarian cancer. Continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted. No requirement for concomitant anticoagulant therapy. Administration of low dose anticoagulants for maintenance of central venous access is permitted.No chronic oral or intravenous steroid use.</criteria>
