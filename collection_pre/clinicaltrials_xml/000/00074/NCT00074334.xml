	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: The TP-38 toxin can locate tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells. Giving TP-38 toxin directly into the tumor may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of TP-38 toxin administered directly into the brain and to see how well it works in treating young patients with recurrent or progressive supratentorial high-grade glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TP-38 Toxin in Treating Young Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Supratentorial High-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Phase I - Determine the maximum safe volume rate and maximum tolerated infusion concentration of TGFa-PE38 toxin (TP-38) infused through 2 or 3 catheters in pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive supratentorial high-grade glioma. - Describe the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Phase II - Estimate the efficacy of this drug, in terms of post-infusion survival, in these patients. Secondary - Phase I and II - Determine the prevalence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and phosphorylation (activity) in patients treated with this drug. - Correlate EGFR expression with qualitative measures (e.g., histology, grade, and other tumor characteristics) and tumor response, survival, and progression-free survival in patients treated with this drug. - Phase II Only - Estimate the objective response rate in patients treated with this drug. - Estimate the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients in the phase I portion of the study are stratified according to the number of successfully placed catheters (3 catheters vs 2 catheters). Patients in the phase II portion of the study are stratified according to time of recurrence of high-grade glioma (first vs second or greater) and by surgery extent (surgical resection vs stereotactic biopsy) for those with first recurrence only. - Phase I: Patients undergo stereotactic biopsy or resection of the tumor followed by intratumoral (or tumor bed) catheter placement for treatment infusion. Within 12-48 hours after intratumoral (or tumor bed) catheter placement, patients receive TGFa-PE38 toxin (TP-38) intratumorally through 2 or 3 catheters over 33 to 124 hours. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients (in each stratum) receive escalating volumes until the maximum safe volume (MSV) is determined. Cohorts of 3-6 patients (in each stratum) receive escalating concentrations at the MSV until the maximum tolerated infusion concentration (MTIC) is determined. The MSV and MTIC are defined as the volume and concentration preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I at the MSV and MTIC. Phase I patients are followed post catheter placement, daily during TP-38 infusion, at 30 days, and then every 2 months for 1 year. Phase II patients will be followed for an additional year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-105 patients (6-60 for phase I and 45 for phase II) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
