	<brief_summary>The study will look at the safety profile (unwanted effects) of the long-lasting anticoagulant PEG-hirudin (SPP200) and compare these unwanted effects to those of unfractionated heparin, commonly used in haemodialysis to avoid clotting of the graft and of the haemodialysis machine.</brief_summary>
