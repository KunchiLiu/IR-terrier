	<brief_title>Adding Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Drug Treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Social anxiety disorder is a prevalent and disabling condition for which effective long-term treatments need to be identified. Paroxetine is effective in treating the acute symptoms of social anxiety, but longer-term management remains a challenge. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been effective in treating depression and panic disorder symptoms; it may also be effective in augmenting paroxetine response and reducing relapse after medication discontinuation. This study will examine the effects of paroxetine treatment alone and in combination with CBT. Participants in this study will receive paroxetine for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, participants will be randomly assigned to either add weekly sessions of CBT to their treatment or to continue taking paroxetine alone for another 16 weeks. After the 16-week treatment period, participants will have their treatments tapered and will be followed for an additional 24 weeks. Social anxiety symptoms, rates of remission, and quality of life will be assessed.</detailed_description>
