	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) alone compared to Copaxone plus albuterol in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). MS is thought to be an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Certain white blood cells of the immune system become abnormally active and mistakenly attack the myelin of nerve fibers. Myelin is a fatty sheath that surrounds nerve fibers and insulates the nerve like insulation around an electrical wire. Without proper myelin insulation, messages sent between the brain and other parts of the body may be confused or fail completely. Damage to myelin causes the symptoms of MS. The most common form of MS is known as relapsing-remitting (RR), where partial or total recovery occurs after attacks. Four therapies are currently approved for the treatment of MS. These therapies, however, are only moderately effective and can cause undesirable side effects. For this reason, there is a need to find new therapies that have minimal side effects and may stop the disease from getting worse.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis With Copaxone and Albuterol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MS is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by focal T cell and macrophage infiltrates that lead to demyelination and loss of neurologic function. Four therapies are currently approved for the treatment of MS. Three of these are approved for the treatment of patients with the relapsing-remitting (RR) form of MS, in which patients have clinical exacerbations followed by partial or complete recovery of function. These treatments are only modestly effective and are associated with significant toxicity, often causing patients to delay therapy for significant lengths of time. Thus, there is a need to find therapies with low toxicities that can be administered early during the disease course with the potential for arresting the disease. During the pre-treatment phase, patients undergo neurological exams, including the extended disability status scale (EDSS), Ambulation Index (AI), disease steps (DS) scale MS functional composite score, PASAT, 9 hole peg test, and the 25 foot walking time. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) and chest x-ray are performed. Serum chemistry is assessed as well as electrolyte and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. A brain MRI (with and without gadolinium), urinalysis, and urine pregnancy test (for women of reproductive potential) are performed. Blood is collected for mechanistic studies. In the treatment phase, patients are assigned randomly to 1 of 2 study arms: Arm 1: Copaxone plus placebo. Arm 2: Copaxone plus albuterol. At the treatment visits, blood is collected and neurological exams and a brain MRI are performed. A pregnancy test is administered to women of reproductive potential. Neurological exams are performed every 6 months. MRIs are performed at baseline, Year 1, and Year 2. At the end of the study, patients have a complete physical exam, a neurological exam, and a brain MRI.</detailed_description>
