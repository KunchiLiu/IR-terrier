	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining zoledronate with BMS-275291 in treating patients who have prostate cancer that has not responded to previous hormone therapy. Zoledronate may prevent bone loss and stop the growth of tumor cells in bone. BMS-275291 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. Combining zoledronate with BMS-275291 may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zoledronate and BMS-275291 in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the confirmed response rate of hormone refractory prostate cancer patients treated with Zometa with BMS-275291. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the toxicity profile associated with this treatment in this patient population. II. To evaluate the overall and progression-free survival associated with this treatment regimen. III. To explore changes markers for bone turnover, fPYR, fDPYR, and serum samples for cross-linked N-telopeptides from baseline. IV. To assess changes in bone tumor metabolism after treatment using PET scans. V. To assess changes in MMP-1, MMP-9, VEGF and bFGF from baseline after treatment. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy (yes vs no) and participating center. ARM I: Patients receive zoledronate IV over at least 15 minutes on day 1 and oral BMS-275291 daily on days 1-28. ARM II (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 10/10/2003): Patients receive zoledronate as in Arm I. In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
