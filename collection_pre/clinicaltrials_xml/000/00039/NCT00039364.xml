	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the therapeutic activity of imatinib mesylate (in terms of objective response and progression-free survival at 6 months) in patients with gliomas. - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to glioma (glioblastoma multiforme vs anaplastic oligodendroglioma or mixed oligoastrocytoma vs anaplastic astrocytoma or recurrent low-grade astrocytoma). Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 77 patients (29 patients with glioblastoma multiforme, 24 patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma or mixed oligoastrocytoma, and 24 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma or recurrent low-grade astrocytoma) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
