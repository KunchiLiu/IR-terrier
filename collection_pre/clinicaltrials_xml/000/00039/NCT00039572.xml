	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy such as boron neutron capture therapy may kill tumor cells without harming normal tissue. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of boron neutron capture therapy in treating patients who have glioblastoma multiforme or melanoma metastatic to the brain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Boron Neutron Capture Therapy in Treating Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme or Melanoma Metastatic to the Brain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the time course, uniformity, and severity of acute and chronic normal tissue reactions in patients with glioblastoma multiforme or intracranial melanoma treated with boronophenylalanine-fructose complex (BPA-f) followed by cranial neutron irradiation using a new fission converter beam facility. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of cranial neutron capture therapy in these patients. - Determine, through serial objective measurements, the clinical response in patients treated with this therapy. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of BPA-f in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cranial neutron capture therapy (NCT). Patients receive boronophenylalanine-fructose complex IV over 90 minutes followed by cranial NCT on days 1 and 2. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of NCT until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
