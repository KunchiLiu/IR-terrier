	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have advanced colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Provide oxaliplatin in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium using the FOLFOX4 regimen for front-line treatment in patients with no prior chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer who are not eligible for entry into ongoing clinical trials of higher priority. (The regimen in this Treatment Referral Center protocol is one that was found to be superior in a recent national intergroup study.) - Further determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. - Further determine the anti-tumor activity of this regimen, defined as the rate of time-to-treatment failure, time to progression, and survival, in these patients. - Capture data on subsequent salvage therapy administered to patients treated with this protocol. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 2, and fluorouracil IV over 22 hours on days 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with clinical evidence of benefit from this treatment, defined as stable disease, partial response, or complete response as well as no increase in size of any measurable or evaluable lesion and no new sites of disease, may be eligible for additional courses. Patients are followed until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 300 patients per month will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
