	<brief_title>Comparison of Screening Tests in Detecting Cervical Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the sensitivity and specificity of primary screening strategies for the detection of cervical intraepithelial or invasive neoplasia. - Compare the positive and negative predictive values of these strategies. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to the reason for the visit (general gynecological screening vs colposcopy referral). - Stratum 1 (general gynecological screening): Patients undergo Pap smear, visual inspection aided by acetic acid (VIA), a colposcopy, and finally a visual inspection aided by toluidine blue (VIT) followed by an acetic acid wash. A biopsy may be performed at this initial visit. Within 2-3 weeks, patients are notified of results. - Stratum 2 (colposcopy referral): Patients undergo Pap smear, VIA, colposcopy, VIT, and possible biopsy as in stratum 1. During the same visit, patients receive histologic evaluation and treatment with See-and-Treat loop electrosurgical excision procedure and/or endocervical curettage. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600-1,000 patients (300-500 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
