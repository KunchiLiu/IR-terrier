	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imaging procedures such as positron emission tomography (PET) may improve the ability to detect the extent of breast cancer. PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to study the effectiveness of PET to detect the extent of breast cancer in women who have primary or recurrent breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) as compared to conventional imaging in determining the extent of disease in women with primary or recurrent breast cancer. - Determine how often clinical management and operative intervention plans for patients are altered based on these FDG-PET scan findings. - Determine whether FDG-PET results in more accurate detection of disease in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 IV. Approximately 1 hour later, patients undergo positron emission tomography imaging. Some patients may undergo a repeat scan in 4-6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: (50 with primary disease and 50 with recurrent disease) will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.</detailed_description>
