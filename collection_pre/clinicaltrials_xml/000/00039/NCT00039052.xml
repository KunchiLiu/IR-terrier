	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-4 PE38KDEL cytotoxin may be able to deliver cancer-killing substances directly to solid tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of intravenous interleukin-4 PE38KDEL cytotoxin in treating patients who have recurrent or metastatic kidney cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or breast cancer that has not responded to previous treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Interleukin-4 PE38KDEL Cytotoxin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Kidney Cancer, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, or Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of interleukin-4 PE38KDEL cytotoxin in patients with recurrent or unresponsive, metastatic renal cell, non-small cell lung, or breast cancer that overexpresses interleukin-4 receptors. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug, including the duration and intensity of these toxic effects, in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetic behavior of this drug in these patients. - Determine the antibody response (if any) in patients treated with this drug. - Determine, in a preliminary manner, the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive interleukin-4 PE38KDEL cytotoxin (NBI-3001) IV over 10 minutes once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or detection of neutralizing antibodies. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of NBI-3001 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
