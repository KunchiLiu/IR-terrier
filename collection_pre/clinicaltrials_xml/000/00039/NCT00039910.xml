	<brief_summary>Intensive chemotherapy is associated with significant thrombocytopenia, often requiring platelet transfusion to maintain platelet counts. This investigational drug has been demonstrated to increase platelet counts. This study will test the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug in the prevention of thrombocytopenia in patients with recurrent or refractory intermediate-grade or high-grade non-Burkitt's, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), or Hodgkin's disease receiving DHAP (Dexamethasone, high-dose Cytarabine, and Cisplatin) chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
