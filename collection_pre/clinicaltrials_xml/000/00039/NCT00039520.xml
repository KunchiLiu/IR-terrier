	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining sulindac with docetaxel in treating women who have metastatic or recurrent breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sulindac and Docetaxel in Treating Women With Metastatic or Recurrent Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of women with metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the breast treated with sulindac and docetaxel. - Determine the time to progression of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sulindac twice daily. Patients also receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed within 3-4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-33 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
