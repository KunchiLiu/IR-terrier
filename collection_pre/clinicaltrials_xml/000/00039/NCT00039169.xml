	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BAY 59-8862 in treating patients who have advanced kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BAY 59-8862 in Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall tumor response rate, including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rate, in patients with advanced renal cell cancer treated with BAY 59-8862. - Determine the overall survival in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the duration of response (CR and PR) in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity profile of this drug in this patient population. - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in selected patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive BAY 59-8862 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months thereafter or for up to 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-140 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
