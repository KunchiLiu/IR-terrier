	<brief_summary>Multiple myeloma is a disease that resides primarily in the bone and has shown to be sensitive to radiation. Administration of a radiotherapy agent that targets the bone, such as Holmium-166-DOTMP, in conjunction with melphalan and an autologous stem cell transplant, may improve the patient's chance of responding to treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine the amount of Holmium-166-DOTMP that localizes in the bone and in normal organs, and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Holmium-166-DOTMP in the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Skeletal Targeted Radiotherapy Using Holmium-166-DOTMP in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to estimate the radiation absorbed dose to the bone marrow and kidneys based on whole-body gamma camera image data for comparison with that obtained using mathematical models based on whole body counting from a small gamma detection device called a thyroid probe; to obtain pharmacokinetic data following administration of 166Ho-DOTMP; and to evaluate safety and efficacy in patients who receive 25 Gy targeted therapy of 166Ho-DOTMP and 200 mg/m2 melphalan followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT).</detailed_description>
