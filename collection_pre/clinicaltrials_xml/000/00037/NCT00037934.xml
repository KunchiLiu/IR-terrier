	<brief_summary>We have established the feasibility and effectiveness of robot-aided rehabilitation in stroke patients using a robot for neurological rehabilitation designed and built by MIT. Results of a pilot study of 20 patients were promising and showed that robot therapy is safe, tolerated by patients and produces a significant, measurable benefit. We propose to test that the robotic upper extremity trainer is an acceptable cost effective adjunct to standard occupational therapy for patients with dysfunction of the shoulder and elbow due to hemiparetic stroke in a VA rehabilitation program.</brief_summary>
