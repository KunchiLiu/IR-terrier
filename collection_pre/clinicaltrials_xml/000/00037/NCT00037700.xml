	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of anakinra (IL-1 ra) and pegsunercept (PEG sTNF-RI) when they are used together in improving the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. The study will also evaluate the safety of the combination treatment and its effect on slowing down bone and joint destruction due to rheumatoid arthritis. The results will be compared to the effect when only 1 single medication (anakinra or pegsunercept) is used.</brief_summary>
