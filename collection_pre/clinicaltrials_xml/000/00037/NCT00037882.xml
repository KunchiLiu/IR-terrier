	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if PEG-Intron is better tolerated and more efficacious than standard interferons (Roferon, Intron) in patients with Philadelphia-positive Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia. These patients should have previously received standard interferon therapy and have been intolerant, resistant, or have relapsed disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PEG-Intron For Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Patients Unresponsive To Or Intolerant Of Roferon Or Intron</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It has been shown that patients who experience complete hematologic or at least a partial cytogenetic response to interferon will have improved survival times. In addition, evidence exists that even patients who do not demonstrate a cytogenetic response to interferon treatment can still benefit from treatment, in terms of survival, compared to patients not treated with interferon. This indicates that if a patient is better able to tolerate interferon, he or she may have improved survival even without cytogenetic response. Preliminary studies suggest that PEG-Intron is more convenient for patients (administered once weekly rather than daily), is better tolerated than interferon, and can produce hematologic remission in interferon-a resistant patients. Phase II studies are needed to ascertain the overall hematologic and cytogenetic response rates to PEG-Intron in such patients.</detailed_description>
