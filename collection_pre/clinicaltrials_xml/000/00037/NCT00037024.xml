	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Telephone counseling by a nutritionist and a personal trainer may improve physical function and quality of life in patients who have early-stage breast cancer or prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of a home-based, diet and exercise-based counseling program with that of a standard home-based counseling program in promoting health in patients who have early-stage breast cancer or prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Health Promotion in Patients With Early-Stage Breast or Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the efficacy of a diet and exercise-based home-based counseling program versus a standard home-based counseling program for improving physical function at 6 and 12 months for patients with early-stage breast or prostate cancer. - Compare the effects of these home-based programs on diet quality, physical activity, weight status, depression, and quality of life of these patients. - Compare the factors, such as gender, race, and social support, that interact with these home-based programs to predict program efficacy in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. - Arm I: Patients receive home-based telephone counseling by a personal nutritionist and a personal trainer. - Arm II: Patients receive home-based standard health telephone counseling in unrelated areas of cancer care (e.g., sun exposure, screening, and falls prevention). In both arms, counseling continues every 2 weeks for 6 months. Patients are followed at 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 420 patients (210 per arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
