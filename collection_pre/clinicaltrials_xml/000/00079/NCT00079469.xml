	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Contingency management is a behavioral treatment approach that provides immediate rewards for positive change in behavior such as quitting smoking. In this protocol, contingency management will be in the form of a cash reward. A smoking cessation (stop-smoking) program that combines contingency management with bupropion and counseling may be effective in helping cancer survivors stop smoking. PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of bupropion and counseling with or without contingency management in helping cancer survivors stop smoking.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bupropion and Counseling With or Without Contingency Management to Enhance Smoking Cessation in Treating Cancer Survivors Who Continue to Smoke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the feasibility of a multi-component smoking cessation intervention comprising bupropion and counseling with or without contingency management (cash reward) for cancer survivors who continue to smoke. - Compare 7-day point-prevalence abstinence rates in patients treated with these smoking cessation interventions. Secondary - Determine the characteristics of these patients that predict success at quitting smoking. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 smoking cessation intervention arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral bupropion twice daily on weeks 1-12 and brief practical counseling (i.e., problem-solving strategies, stimulus control, stress management, and social support) on weeks 1-6. - Arm II: Patients receive treatment as in arm I and contingency management (i.e., monetary reinforcement for not smoking) on weeks 1-6. In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 12 and 24 weeks after the completion of the smoking cessation interventions. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per intervention arm) will be accrued for this study within 8 months.</detailed_description>
