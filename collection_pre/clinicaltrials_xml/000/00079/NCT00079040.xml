	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well giving cisplatin and etoposide together with bevacizumab works in treating patients with previously untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them. Giving chemotherapy with a monoclonal antibody may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin, Etoposide, and Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the combination of PE plus concurrent and sequential bevacizumab with respect to six month progression free survival in patients with previously untreated SCLC. II. To evaluate the combination of PE plus concurrent and sequential bevacizumab with respect to survival and response rate. III. To evaluate toxicity in patients with extensive small cell lung cancer, treated with the combination of PE plus concurrent and sequential bevacizumab who have received no prior systemic chemotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if pre-treatment levels of plasma VEGF predict response to chemotherapy with Etoposide-Cisplatin plus concurrent + sequential bevacizumab. II. To determine if pre-treatment plasma VEGF is predictive of progression free survival and overall survival in advanced SCLC. III. To determine whether elevated plasma levels of endothelial cell-specific proteins (VCAM, E-selectin), reflective of chemotherapy or bevacizumab induced endothelial damage, are useful markers in assessing response to Etoposide/Cisplatin plus concurrent + sequential bevacizumab. IV. To determine whether pre- and post-treatment plasma levels of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is predictive of progression free survival and overall survival or predictive of response to therapy. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Chemotherapy: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Bevacizumab therapy: Beginning concurrently with chemotherapy, patients receive bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses (1 year) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks for up to 3 years from study entry.</detailed_description>
