	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as imiquimod cream, work in different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying how well imiquimod cream works in treating patients with basal cell skin cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imiquimod Cream in Treating Patients With Basal Cell Skin Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare levels of apoptosis in patients with basal cell skin cancer treated with vs without imiquimod 5% cream. Secondary - Compare levels of apoptosis in patients treated with this drug on two different administration schedules. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Patients undergo fine needle aspiration and punch biopsies of the target lesion. Patients are then randomized to 1 of 8 treatment arms and begin therapy within 30 days after biopsy. - Arm I: Patients apply topical imiquimod to the target lesion once every 12 hours on days 1 and 2 for a total of 4 doses. - Arm II: Patients apply topical placebo to the target lesion once every 12 hours on days 1 and 2 for a total of 4 doses. - Arm III: Patients apply topical imiquimod to the target lesion once every 24 hours on days 1-4 for a total of 4 doses. - Arm IV: Patients apply topical placebo to the target lesion once every 24 hours on days 1-4 for a total of 4 doses. - Arm V: Patients apply topical imiquimod to the target lesion once every 12 hours on days 1-4 for a total of 8 doses. - Arm VI: Patients apply topical placebo to the target lesion once every 12 hours on days 1-4 for a total of 8 doses. - Arm VII: Patients apply topical imiquimod to the target lesion once every 24 hours on days 1-8 for a total of 8 doses. - Arm VIII: Patients apply topical placebo to the target lesion every 24 hours on days 1-8 for a total of 8 doses. All patients undergo excision of the target tumor within 18-30 hours after the last topical treatment. Patients are followed at 7-14 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients (8 per treatment arm and 4 per placebo arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
