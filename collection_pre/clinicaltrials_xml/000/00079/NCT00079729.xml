	<brief_title>Directly Observed Therapy in HIV Infected Adolescent Focus Groups</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rate of HIV infection among adolescents is increasing at an alarming rate. Adherence to antiretroviral therapy has been a major challenge in achieving and maintaining adequate control of the disease in this population. DOT has been shown effective in individuals with tuberculosis (TB), but DOT in HIV infected populations has not been thoroughly examined. This study will collect information from HIV infected adolescents in order to establish a DOT program that will increase successful adherence to HIV treatment and will benefit the public by preventing development of viral resistance and reducing the risk of transmission. Adolescent participants in this study will be assigned to one of three 2-hour focus group sessions, each at a different site. The participants will complete a questionnaire and will give input about designing a DOT intervention model that will be accepted by adolescents. The model will then be used in a pilot study to determine the feasibility of implementing DOT programs in the community to help HIV infected adolescents.</detailed_description>
