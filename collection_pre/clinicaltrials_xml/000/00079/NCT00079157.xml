	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving a vaccine with Montanide ISA-51 and sargramostim may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy when given together with Montanide ISA-51 and sargramostim in treating patients with stage IV breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Plus Montanide ISA-51 and Sargramostim in Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety of telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with HLA-A2-expressing stage IV breast cancer. Secondary - Compare the generation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) peptide-specific vs cytomegalovirus peptide-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) immunity in patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate the dose level of this regimen with the generation of hTERT-specific CTL immunity and the development of hTERT-specific autoimmunity in these patients. - Determine the tumor response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of the telomerase: 540-548 peptide and CMV 495 peptide portions of the vaccine. Patients receive telomerase: 540-548 peptide and CMV 495 peptide (as an immunological control) vaccine emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) followed by sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 19, and 27 (for a total of 8 vaccinations). Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 5-8 patients receive escalating doses of telomerase: 540-548 peptide and CMV 495 peptide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 5 or 2 of 8 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 12 patients receive treatment at the MTD. Patients are followed within 30 days and then at 6 and 12 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-28 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
