	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors or leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose of 17-AAG administered as a 60 or 120-minute intravenous infusion on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, of a 21-day course, to children with refractory solid tumors or relapsed leukemia. II. To define and describe the toxicities of 17-AAG administered on this schedule. III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of 17-AAG in children with refractory cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of 17-AAG within the confines of a phase I study. II. To assess the biologic activity of 17-AAG. III. To examine the role of CYP3A5 polymorphisms in the pharmacologic and clinical phenotypes observed following administration of 17-AAG to children, within the confines of a phase 1 study. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients with solid tumors receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-AAG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, up to 6 additional patients with leukemia receive 17-AAG at the MTD as above. If these 6 patients tolerate this regimen, another 6 leukemia patients receive 17-AAG IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 30 days.</detailed_description>
