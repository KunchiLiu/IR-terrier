	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether CEP-701 given in sequence with induction chemotherapy increases the proportion of patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who achieve a second complete remission (CR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of CEP-701 (Lestaurtinib) in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomly assigned to chemotherapy alone received the second course of induction chemotherapy as soon as clinically indicated; patients randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy plus sequential lestaurtinib had lestaurtinib withheld for 3 days (72 hours) before the start of the second 5-day course of chemotherapy and resumed lestaurtinib treatment 2 days (48 hours) after the final administration of the second course of chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
