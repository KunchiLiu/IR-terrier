	<brief_title>Montessori-Based Activities for Elderly Persons With Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies have shown that Montessori-based activities, which focus on developing an individual's unique abilities, are effective in increasing engagement between nursing home residents with dementia and their caregivers. This study will determine whether the positive effects of Montessori-based programming can be replicated in adult day care, assisted living, and nursing homes. Results from this study will be used to create training materials to help staff in different settings implement the intervention within existing schedules, staffing, and programming routines. This study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase I, participants with mild dementia will be trained to become small group leaders for Montessori-based activities. In Phase II, newly-trained participants will use their skills to assist others. Assessments will be made throughout the study. Participants' engagement with the environment and caregiver burden and satisfaction will be assessed.</detailed_description>
