	<brief_summary>This randomized placebo-controlled trial will test whether supplementing with vitamins C and E can lower markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in healthy adults. We will examine whether one antioxidant vitamin is more effective than another, and whether gender or body fat influence the treatment effects. We will also determine whether gender, body fat, or menopausal status are associated with baseline concentrations of inflammation and oxidative stress markers.</brief_summary>
