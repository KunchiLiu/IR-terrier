	<brief_summary>In this study, patients will receive either pemetrexed plus irinotecan or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and irinotecan. The purposes of this study are to determine: - How pemetrexed plus irinotecan compares with 5-FU, leucovorin, and irinotecan in terms of efficacy. - The safety of pemetrexed plus irinotecan and any side effects that might be associated with it as compared with 5-FU, leucovorin, and irinotecan. - Whether pemetrexed can help patients with colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
