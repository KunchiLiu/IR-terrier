	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PEG-interferon alfa-2B may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Combining temozolomide with PEG-interferon alfa-2B may be an effective treatment for advanced solid tumors. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining temozolomide and PEG-interferon alfa-2B in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide Plus PEG-Interferon Alfa-2B in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and tolerability of temozolomide and PEG-interferon alfa-2b in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors or chemotherapy-naive advanced cancer. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of PEG-interferon alfa-2b at the MTD when administered with temozolomide in this patient population. - Determine the anti-tumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-7 and 15-21 and PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-9 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide and PEG-interferon alfa-2b until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
