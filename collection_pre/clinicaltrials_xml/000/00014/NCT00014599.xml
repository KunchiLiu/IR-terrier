	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients who have locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent cancer of the vulva.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced, Metastatic, or Recurrent Cancer of the Vulva</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the therapeutic activity of paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva. - Determine the objective response rate and duration of response in these patients treated with this drug. - Determine the acute side effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 9 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-29 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
