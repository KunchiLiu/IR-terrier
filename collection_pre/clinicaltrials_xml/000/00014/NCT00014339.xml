	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Enzyme products such as Wobe-Mugos E may help to reduce the side effects of multiple myeloma therapy. It is not yet known if chemotherapy is more effective with or without Wobe-Mugos E in treating multiple myeloma. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy with or without Wobe-Mugos E in treating patients who have stage II or stage III multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With or Without Wobe-Mugos E in Treating Patients With Stage II or Stage III Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the long-term survival of patients with chemotherapy-naive stage II or III multiple myeloma treated with standard melphalan and prednisone with or without adjuvant Wobe-Mugos E. II. Compare the effect of these two regimens on the reduction of the side effects from chemotherapy in these patients, using 2 quality of life questionnaires. III. Compare the effect of these two regimens on tumor response rate and new metastasis development in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral melphalan and oral prednisone on days 1-4. Patients also receive adjuvant enzyme therapy with oral Wobe-Mugos E 3 times daily beginning prior to or on day 1 of the first course of chemotherapy. Arm II: Patients receive melphalan and prednisone as in arm I. Patients also receive an oral placebo 3 times daily as in arm I. Treatment continues for a minimum of 12 months to up to 4 years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients continue on melphalan and prednisone on a 4-week course until achieving maximum response or plateau phase and then receive 2 additional courses of therapy. Quality of life is assessed at baseline; at 1, 3, and 6 months and every 6 months for up to 4 years during study; and then at end of study. Patients are followed for survival for 1 month after completing the study and all patients receive the enzyme product. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients (125 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.</detailed_description>
