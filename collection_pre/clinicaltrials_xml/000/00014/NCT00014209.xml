	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has not responded to previous treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Hodgkin's Disease or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma That Has Not Responded to Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's disease or aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this regimen in these two patient populations. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease (Hodgkin's disease vs non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). Patients receive oral dexamethasone on days 1-4, cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks, 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44-88 patients (22-44 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 4-10 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically confirmed Hodgkin's disease OR Histologically or cytologically confirmed aggressive nonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of Bcell origin (including immunoblastic, anaplastic large cell, mediastinal large Bcell, or Tcell rich Bcell NHL) No prior diagnosis of lowgrade NHL No histologic evidence of transformation from indolent to aggressive histology Bidimensionally measurable disease that is clinically or radiologically documented Bone lesions not considered bidimensionally measurable Lymph nodes at least 1.5 cm by 1.5 cm OR Other nonnodal lesions at least 1 cm by 1 cm Recurrent or refractory to 1 prior chemotherapy regimen (excluding gemcitabine and cisplatin) No known CNS involvement NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
