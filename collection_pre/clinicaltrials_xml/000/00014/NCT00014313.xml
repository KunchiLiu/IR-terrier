	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have metastatic Ewing's sarcoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Ewing's Sarcoma or Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the activity of cisplatin and etoposide in terms of response of patients with metastatic Ewing's sarcoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor. - Assess the bone marrow and kidney toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cisplatin IV over 3 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, and 43 and oral etoposide daily on days 1-15 and 29-43 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
