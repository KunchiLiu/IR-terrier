	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of busulfan and melphalan followed by donor bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who have advanced hematologic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Followed by Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Advanced Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antileukemic potential of busulfan and melphalan prior to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in patients with advanced or high-risk hematologic malignancy. - Determine the incidence of transplantation-related morbidity and mortality in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive cytoreductive chemotherapy comprising busulfan IV over 2 hours every 6 hours for a total of 16 doses on days -8 to -5 and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2. Patients undergo T-cell replete allogeneic bone marrow transplantation on day 0. For graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or every 12 hours beginning on day -1 and continuing for 50 days to 6 months followed by a taper. Once oral medications are tolerated, patients switch to oral tacrolimus every 12 hours. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11. Patients are followed weekly through day 100, every 6 weeks for 3 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 3-6 months for 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
