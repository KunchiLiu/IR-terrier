	<brief_title>Huang Lian (Chinese Herb) in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of Huang Lian (Chinese herb) in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the optimal pharmacologic, molecular, and biologic parameters of this treatment regimen in these patients. - Assess the preliminary therapeutic activity of this treatment regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral Huang Lian (Chinese herb) 4 times daily. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of Huang Lian until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-liming toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
