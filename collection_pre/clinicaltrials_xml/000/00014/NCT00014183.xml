	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as ZD 1839 may interfere with the growth of the tumor cells and slow the growth of kidney cancer. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ZD 1839 in treating patients who have recurrent or stage IV kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ZD 1839 in Treating Patients With Stage IV or Recurrent Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in patients with progressive stage IV or recurrent renal cell cancer treated with ZD 1839. - Determine the median time to objective progression in these patients receiving this drug. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in this patient population. - Determine if epidermal growth factor receptor expression in tumor tissue correlates with response and survival of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral ZD 1839 daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 8 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-23 months.</detailed_description>
