	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. Anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin may reduce the risk of blood clots. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus warfarin in treating patients who have prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Warfarin in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, efficacy, and durability of docetaxel and estramustine followed by doxorubicin and ketoconazole in patients with high-risk, androgen-independent prostate cancer. II. Determine whether anticoagulation with warfarin can reduce the frequency of thromboembolic complications associated with estramustine in these patients. OUTLINE: Regimen A: Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 3 weekly. Patients also receive oral warfarin daily. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Regimen B: After completion of regimen A, patients receive doxorubicin IV over 30 minutes weekly and oral ketoconazole twice daily. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed monthly until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
