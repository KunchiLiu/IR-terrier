	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of antibody therapy in treating patients who have refractory or relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of bispecific antibody 4G7xH22 in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. - Assess the clinical toxicity of this antibody in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of bispecific antibody (BsAb) 4G7xH22. Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on day 1 and BsAb 4G7xH22 IV over 2 hours on day 2. Treatment repeats weekly for a total of 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BsAb 4G7xH22 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks, monthly for 3 months, and then periodically for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
