	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to determine if Ro 31-7453 is more effective with or without food in treating patients who have metastatic solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ro 31-7453 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the impact of food on the bioavailability of Ro 31-7453 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, crossover study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral Ro 31-7453 under fasting conditions on day 1. After a 1-week washout period, patients receive oral Ro 31-7453 under fed conditions. Arm II: Patients receive fed treatment as in arm I on day 1. After a 1-week washout period, patients receive fasted treatment as in arm I. Both arms: At the start of week 3, patients may continue to receive oral Ro 31-7453 every 12 hours on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 7 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients (5 per arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
