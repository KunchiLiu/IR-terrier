	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Biological therapies such as interleukin-2 and interferon alfa stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells or may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Combining chemotherapy with biological therapies may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide followed by sargramostim, interleukin-2, and interferon alfa in treating patients who have stage IV melanoma that cannot be treated with surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Followed by Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma That Cannot be Treated With Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate, time to progression, and survival of patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma treated with temozolomide followed by sargramostim (GM-CSF), interleukin-2, and interferon alfa. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in this patient population. - Determine the changes in quality of life over time in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5, and sargramostim (GM-CSF), interleukin-2, and interferon alfa subcutaneously on days 6-17. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with at least stable or responsive disease after 8 courses of therapy may receive additional therapy at investigators discretion. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 8 weeks during study, and then at 1 month after study. Patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
