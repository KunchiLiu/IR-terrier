	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of topotecan in treating patients who have advanced ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topotecan in Treating Patients With Advanced Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and duration of prolonged topotecan as maintenance in patients with advanced ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with complete clinical response after platinum-based chemotherapy. - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral topotecan twice daily for 21 days. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients who tolerate course 1 may receive an escalated dose of topotecan for subsequent courses. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose tolerated by the majority of the patients. Patients are followed every 2 months for at least 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
