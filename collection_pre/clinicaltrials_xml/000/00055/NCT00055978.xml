	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy uses certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. Celecoxib may be effective in preventing the development or recurrence of lung cancer in former heavy smokers. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in preventing the development or recurrence of lung cancer in former heavy smokers who are at risk of developing cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib in Preventing Lung Cancer in Former Heavy Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of chemoprevention of lung cancer with celecoxib in former heavy smokers at risk for developing primary or second primary lung cancer. - Determine the safety and side effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the role of COX-2-specific inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) on antitumor immunity within the lung microenvironment of these patients. - Determine the effects of COX-2 inhibition on angiogenesis in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are stratified according to presence of preinvasive lesions (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 6 months. - Arm II: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 6 months. Treatment in both arms continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed every 6 months during treatment and then annually for up to 4 years. Patients are followed annually for up to 4 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (90 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Heavy former smokers without prior history of NSCLC Age &gt; 45 Smoked for minimum of 30 pack years Former smokers with prior curative resection of surgical stage I NSCLC will be recruited and must be: Age &gt; 18 Smoked &gt; 10 pack years Must have had pathological staging and the extent of disease documented. At least one nodal station each must have been biopsied and all biopsies must have been negative At least 6 months post curative resection of Stage I prior NSCLC, without evidence for recurrence or second primary lung cancer Normal blood chemistry and cell counts Negative pregnancy test Framingham 10yearrisk for coronary artery disease score &gt; 10% History of cardiovascular disease Evidence of diffuse coronary calcification on screening CT Concurrent use of NSAIDs. The use of cardiac (baby) Aspirin is permitted Hypersensitivity to celecoxib, sulfonamides, aspirin or other NSAIDs Liver dysfunction [abnormally elevated liver function tests [transaminases (ALT, AST) &gt; ULN, alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) &gt; 1.5 ULN]] or history of cirrhosis No peptic ulcer disease (PUD) diagnosis nor active symptoms in the last 2 years or, if PUD was diagnosed &lt; 2 years, there must be no active symptoms, and endoscopic confirmation of healing Renal dysfunction [abnormally elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) &gt; 1.5 ULN and creatinine &gt; ULN] End state respiratory disease Unstable angina or a history of significant coronary artery disease Other malignancies excluding nonmelanoma type skin cancer and in situ cervical cancer.
