	<brief_title>Silymarin (Milk Thistle Extract) in Treating Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Who Are Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effect of silymarin, in terms of liver function tests, in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving hepatotoxic chemotherapy. - Determine the effect of this drug on free and conjugated serum silibinin values in these patients. - Determine the serum antioxidant capacity by Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the oxidative damage, as determined by 8-oxodeoxyguanosine adducts, in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral silymarin daily for 28 days. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo as in arm I. Patients are followed at day 56. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
