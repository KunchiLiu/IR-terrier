	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of exatecan mesylate in treating children who have relapsed or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exatecan Mesylate in Treating Children With Relapsed or Refractory Rhabdomyosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response rate (complete and partial responses) in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma treated with exatecan mesylate. - Determine the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the median survival and survival at 6 and 12 months in patients treated with this drug. - Assess pain in patients treated with this drug. - Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study. Patients receive exatecan mesylate IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive 6 additional courses beyond CR. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
