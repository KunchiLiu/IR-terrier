	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy before radiation therapy, and combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy, may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of neoadjuvant gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and carboplatin followed by cisplatin and radiation therapy in treating patients who have locally advanced or recurrent carcinoma (cancer) of the urothelium.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0121, Neoadjuvant Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, and Gemcitabine Followed by Cisplatin and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Recurrent Carcinoma of the Urothelium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall survival of patients with locally advanced or recurrent carcinoma of the urothelium treated with neoadjuvant carboplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine followed by concurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy. - Determine the feasibility of administering this regimen to these patients. - Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed) of patients treated with the neoadjuvant regimen and those treated with the whole regimen. - Determine the proportion of patients who qualify for concurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy after receiving the neoadjuvant regimen. - Determine the potential value of suppressor gene expression analysis (p53 and retinoblastoma gene) and HER2 expression as indicators of prognosis and/or response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 15 minutes on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 4-8 weeks after the completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.</detailed_description>
