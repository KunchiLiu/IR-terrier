	<brief_title>Compassionate Use of Beclomethasone in Treating Patients With Graft-Versus-Host Disease of the Gastrointestinal Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Provide beclomethasone dipropionate to patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease refractory to standard therapy or with a contraindication to systemic steroids. - Minimize the serious side effects associated with systemic steroid use in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral beclomethasone dipropionate 4 times daily for 28 days in the absence of graft-versus-host disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may then receive a second course for 31 days if symptoms of graft-versus-host disease persist. Patients may receive up to 4 treatments (1 or 2 courses each) per year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
