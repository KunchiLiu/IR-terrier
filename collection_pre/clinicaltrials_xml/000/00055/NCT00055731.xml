	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs such as nilutamide, bicalutamide, flutamide, or cyproterone may stop the adrenal glands from producing androgens. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether hormone therapy is more effective with or without chemotherapy in treating prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of hormone therapy with or without docetaxel and estramustine in treating patients who have prostate cancer that is locally advanced or at high risk of relapse.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hormone Therapy With or Without Docetaxel And Estramustine in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer That is Locally Advanced or At High Risk of Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the 8-year survival rate, in terms of clinical and biological remission, of patients with locally advanced prostate cancer or with a high risk of relapse treated with neoadjuvant releasing factor agonist therapy and antiandrogen therapy with or without docetaxel and estramustine given before local radiotherapy or prostatectomy. - Compare the prostate-specific antigen level at 3 months in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare cancer progression by ultrasound in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare survival without clinical remission of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Gleason score (7 or under vs over 7), T stage (T1 or T2 vs T3 or T4), prostate-specific antigen level (20 ng/mL or less vs greater than 20 ng/mL), and lymph node involvement (N0 vs N1 or N2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral antiandrogen therapy comprising nilutamide twice daily or bicalutamide once daily or flutamide 3 times daily or cyproterone 4 times daily. Patients also receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2 and estramustine on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 4 courses. Patients also receive luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) therapy IV comprising buserelin subcutaneously (SC) every 2 months or triptorelin, leuprolide, or goserelin SC every 3 months. - Arm II: Patients receive antiandrogen and LHRH therapy as in arm I. Beginning approximately 21 days after chemotherapy is completed, patients with N0 disease undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6-7 weeks or radical prostatectomy. Patients with N1 or N2 disease undergo radiotherapy or no further local treatment. Hormonal therapy continues in both arms for 3 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 3 months, and at 1 year. Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients (125 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
