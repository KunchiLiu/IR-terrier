	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy uses certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. It is not yet known whether bexarotene is effective in preventing breast cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to study the effectiveness of bexarotene in preventing breast cancer in women who are at genetic risk of developing breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bexarotene in Preventing Breast Cancer in Women at Genetic Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether bexarotene can modify immunophenotypic markers related to breast cancer progression in women at high genetic risk for breast cancer. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to menopausal status (women with a uterus who have not had a menstrual period for more than 1 year vs any woman over 55 years old vs women 55 years and under without a uterus whose follicle-stimulating hormone is in the postmenopausal range). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral bexarotene once daily on days 1-28. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo as in arm I. In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or elevation of triglycerides to greater than 800 mg/dL. Patients undergo 2 breast biopsies in the same location on days 1 and 29. Patients are followed at 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 4 years.</detailed_description>
