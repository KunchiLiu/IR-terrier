	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Genetic studies may help in understanding the genetic processes involved in the development of some types of cancer. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the cancer-related genes in patients who have colon cancer or adenomatous polyps.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Study of Familial Factors in Patients With Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Identify human colon neoplasia susceptibility genes in patients with colon cancer or adenomatous polyps. - Correlate the inheritance of novel susceptibility alleles for adenomatous polyposis of the colon with colon neoplasia in these patients. - Correlate colon neoplasia susceptibility with the presence of COX-2, sPLA2, and DNMT genes in these patients. - Identify a novel gene that governs increased susceptibility to colon adenoma and cancer in the genome of these patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of colon cancer or polyps at age 70 or under Has a living full sibling with diagnosis of colon cancer or polyps at age 70 or under No history of familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome No hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, according to Amsterdam criteria No known I1370K adenomatous polyposis of the colon susceptibility variant Enrolled on 1 of the following clinical trials: CLB9581 CLB89803 CLB80001 NOTE: Patients do not need to be receiving protocol therapy. Patients who are outside the treatment protocol's followup range are eligible. Patients who discontinued therapy for any reason, including toxic effects, are eligible. PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age 70 and under at diagnosis Other No significant psychiatric illness that would preclude giving informed consent No inflammatory bowel disease (in patient or sibling)</criteria>
