	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is to see if bevacizumab works in treating patients who have unresectable nonmetastatic liver cancer that has not spread to the main portal vein. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Unresectable Nonmetastatic Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of bevacizumab, in terms of progression-free survival and disease stability and response, in patients with unresectable nonmetastatic hepatocellular cancer (HCC) without main portal vein invasion. II. Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. III. Assess tumor vascular perfusion kinetics, by dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MRI, in patients before and after treatment with this regimen. IV. Determine the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-inhibition by this drug on circulating levels of VEGF and related cytokines that also contribute to HCC pathogenesis (including bFGF, TGF-alpha, and IGF-II) and on potential alterations of these levels on prognostic variables in these patients. V. Determine the effect of VEGF-inhibition by this drug on hepatic function and hepatitis viral activity in cirrhosis in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study. Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment continues every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-46 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
