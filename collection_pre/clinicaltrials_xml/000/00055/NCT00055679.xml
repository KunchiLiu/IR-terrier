	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating early breast cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of different regimens of combination chemotherapy in treating women who have stage I breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Women With Stage I Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the efficacy of 4 vs 6 courses of adjuvant fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, in terms of 5-year survival, in women with stage I breast cancer. - Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. - Determine the correlation of length of survival with biological factors in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine biological factors significant for prognosis and prediction of survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive fluorouracil IV, epirubicin IV, and cyclophosphamide IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive the same regimen as in arm I for up to 4 courses. After completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients who are estrogen or progesterone receptor positive also receive oral tamoxifen daily for 5 years, beginning after completion of chemotherapy. Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,512 patients (756 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
