	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have progressive or recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with monoclonal antibody Hu1D10. - Determine the duration of response and progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu1D10 IV over 2 hours. Treatment repeats weekly for a total of 4 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at weeks 5 and 8 and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 12 months.</detailed_description>
