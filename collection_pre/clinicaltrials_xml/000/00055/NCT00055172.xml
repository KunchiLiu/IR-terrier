	<brief_summary>This study will examine the role of hereditary factors in different forms of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Patients with immunodeficiencies may be eligible for this study. Candidates include: - Patients with diminished numbers of T cells or NK cells or both, or - Patients with normal T cell and NK cell numbers but diminished T cell, B cell, or NK cell function. Relatives of patients will also be studied. Participants will have blood samples collected for genetic analysis in studies related to SCID at the National Institutes of Health and other institutions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal of this project is to identify the genetic basis of new forms of inherited immunodeficiency. The particular focus relates to cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 that share the common cytokine receptor (Gamma) chain, (Gamma c), and to molecules that are important for signaling or gene regulation in response to these cytokines, although other causes of inherited immunodeficiency are also encompassed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Index cases to be included are those with diminished numbers of T cells and/or NK cells and/or B cells or other immune cells or those who have normal numbers of T cell, B cells, NK cells and other immune cells but diminished function of one or more immune cells. Relatives of affected individuals may also be studied Patients (index cases): 6 months of age and older Siblings: 6 months of age and older Nonsibling relatives (biological parent, aunt, uncle or grandparent): 18 years or older EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients to be excluded are those with a known diagnosis. Other patients may be excluded based on the particular immunological phenotype or the inability of the laboratory to handle additional cases at a given time.</criteria>
