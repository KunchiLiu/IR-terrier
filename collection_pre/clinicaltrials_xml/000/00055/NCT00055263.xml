	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to: - Test the safety of DN-101 in patients with advanced malignancies - Understand how fast the body absorbs, processes, and eliminates DN-101 - Determine the highest dose of DN-101 that is well tolerated by cancer patients - Learn how fast the body absorbs, processes, and eliminates DN-101 compared to the approved product</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A New Formulation of Calcitriol (DN-101) in Patients With Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Calcitriol, at low doses, is approved by the FDA for use in patients with chronic renal failure. However, much higher doses of calcitriol are needed for any possible anti-cancer effect. DN-101 is a new capsule that contains 30 times the amount of calcitriol found in the currently available calcitriol capsule. In order to take an amount of calcitriol equivalent to 1 capsule of DN-101, cancer patients would need to swallow 30 pills of the approved, low dose formulation. DN-101 is a pill containing calcitriol, a chemical related to vitamin D that is immediately active in your body. The natural vitamin D found in dairy products or in typical vitamin pills, must be chemically changed by your liver and kidney into calcitriol before it is active. High doses of calcitriol had anti-cancer effects when tested in animals. DN-101 may have anticancer effects in your kind of cancer.</detailed_description>
