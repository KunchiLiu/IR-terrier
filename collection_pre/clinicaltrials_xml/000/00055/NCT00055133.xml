	<brief_summary>Paxceed™ is being developed by Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The main objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of treatment with Paxceed™ in patients with RA. In RA, there is an increase in cell growth and changes in cell function. The active substance in Paxceed™, paclitaxel, has undergone clinical studies as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent and has demonstrated its usefulness as an agent that stops growth of cells and blocks certain types of cell function associated with RA. Because of these effects, it is thought that Paxceed™ might alter the destructive course of RA.</brief_summary>
