	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs such as goserelin or leuprolide may stop the adrenal glands from producing androgens. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving chemotherapy together with hormone therapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy, Hormone Therapy, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility and safety of paclitaxel, estramustine, carboplatin, and androgen ablation followed by radiotherapy in patients with poor-prognosis locally advanced prostate cancer. - Determine the progression-free survival and time to prostate specific antigen failure in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly; oral estramustine three times a day, five days a week; and carboplatin IV over 1 hour once monthly. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 4 courses. Patients also receive gonadotropin-releasing hormonal therapy comprising either goserelin subcutaneously or leuprolide intramuscularly once monthly. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses. After the completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo radiotherapy once daily on weeks 17-24. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 4 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.</detailed_description>
