	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study effectiveness of combining cisplatin, gemcitabine, and trastuzumab in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin and Gemcitabine Plus Trastuzumab in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin, gemcitabine, and trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients with untreated p185-HER2 overexpressing stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the pharmacokinetic interactions among these drugs in these patients. III. Assess the pharmacodynamics of these drugs in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Regimen A: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes followed by cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 90 minutes on day 2. Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 8 and trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes on day 15. Patients proceed to regimen B on day 22 of regimen A. Regimen B: Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes, gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes, and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 8 and trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Maintenance: After completion of 6 courses, patients with stable disease or partial response receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes weekly until tumor progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-48 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
