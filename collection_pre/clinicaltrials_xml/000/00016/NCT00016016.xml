	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining flavopiridol and cytarabine with mitoxantrone in treating patients who have acute leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flavopiridol, Cytarabine, and Mitoxantrone in Treating Patients With Acute Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the toxicities of escalating doses of flavopiridol administered in a timed sequence with ara-C and mitoxantrone in adults with refractory or relapsed acute leukemias or high-risk myelodysplasias (MDS). II. To determine if flavopiridol administered in a timed sequence with ara-C and Mitoxantrone will induce clinical responses in adults with refractory or relapsed acute leukemias or MDS. III. To determine if flavopiridol is directly cytotoxic to leukemic blasts in vivo. IV. To determine if flavopiridol can recruit and synchronize residual leukemic blasts to proliferate in vivo. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of flavopiridol. (Phase I closed to accrual effective10/24/2003). Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 and cytarabine IV continuously on days 6-9 followed by mitoxantrone IV over 30-150 minutes on day 9. Patients achieving a partial or complete response after the first course of therapy may receive an additional course of therapy beginning 35 Â± 7 days after blood count recovery. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. (Phase I closed to accrual effective 10/24/2003). Once the MTD is reached, additional patients are accrued to receive flavopiridol at the recommended phase II dose.</detailed_description>
