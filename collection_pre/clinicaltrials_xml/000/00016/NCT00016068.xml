	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antivirals such as valganciclovir act against viruses and may be effective in preventing cytomegalovirus. It is not yet known if valganciclovir is effective in preventing cytomegalovirus. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying valganciclovir to see how well it works in preventing cytomegalovirus in patients who have undergone donor stem cell transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Valganciclovir to Prevent Cytomegalovirus Infection in Patients Following Donor Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease and non-CMV invasive infection-free survival in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation treated with valganciclovir vs placebo. - Compare the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with these drugs. - Compare the incidence of other severe invasive bacterial and fungal infections and overall survival in patients treated with these drugs. Secondary - Compare the incidence of CMV infection or disease at baseline and at days 270 and 640 after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients treated with these drugs. - Compare the incidence of herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus infections at baseline and day 270 in patients treated with these drugs. - Determine the safety of valganciclovir in these patients. - Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these drugs. - Compare CMV-specific immune reconstitution in patients treated with these drugs. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, prior neutropenia (yes vs no), and presence of refractory graft-versus-host disease requiring secondary therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral valganciclovir daily. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily. Treatment begins around day 80-120 post-transplantation and continues until day 270 post-transplantation in the absence of active infection or unacceptable toxicity. Patients developing active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection receive induction doses of ganciclovir IV or open-label oral valganciclovir for 1 week followed by open-label oral valganciclovir maintenance dosing until CMV can no longer be detected. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and days 180 and 270 post-transplantation. Patients are followed at days 400, 520, and 640 post-transplantation. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 184 patients (92 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
