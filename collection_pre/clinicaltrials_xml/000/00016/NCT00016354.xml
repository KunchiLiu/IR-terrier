	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of benzoylphenylurea in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benzoylphenylurea in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of benzoylphenylurea in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Evaluate the acute and chronic toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. - Evaluate the pharmacokinetics and metabolites of this regimen and any potential correlation with pharmacodynamic effects in these patients. - Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral benzoylphenylurea (BPU) once weekly. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BPU until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 12 additional patients are accrued and treated with BPU as above to confirm the MTD. Patients are followed for 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
