	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-247550 in treating patients who have prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-247550 in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the prostate-specific antigen response to BMS-247550 in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. - Determine the overall survival and progression-free survival rate in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the objective response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial responses) in those patients with measurable disease treated with this drug. - Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-9 months.</detailed_description>
