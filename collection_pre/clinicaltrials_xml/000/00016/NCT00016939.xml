	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of flavopiridol in treating patients who have unresectable or metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flavopiridol in Treating Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial responses in patients with unresectable or metastatic renal cell cancer treated with flavopiridol. - Determine the 6-month time to treatment failure rate and overall survival rate of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in this patient population. - Determine, in a preliminary manner, the association of tumor response with pretreatment tumor proliferative and apoptotic rates in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
