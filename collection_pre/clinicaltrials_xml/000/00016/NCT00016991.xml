	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as ZD 1839 may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of glioblastoma multiforme. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ZD 1839 in treating patients who have glioblastoma multiforme in first relapse.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ZD 1839 in Treating Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme in First Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the activity of ZD 1839 in patients with glioblastoma multiforme in first relapse. - Determine the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Assess the relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor status in these patients and activity of this drug. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral ZD 1839 once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for at least 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 53 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
