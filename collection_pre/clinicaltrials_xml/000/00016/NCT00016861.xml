	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating children who have refractory or progressive solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan in Treating Children With Refractory or Progressive Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of irinotecan in children with refractory or progressive solid tumors. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug and its metabolites (SN-38, SN-38G, and APC) administered with and without concurrent anticonvulsants in this patient population. - Determine the benefit this drug offers this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are accrued into stratum 1 initially and into stratum 2 if stratum 1 closes due to dose-limiting toxicity of myelosuppression or diarrhea. Patients on anticonvulsants will be accrued into stratum 3 and must meet the eligibility criteria for the stratum that is open (stratum 1 or stratum 2). (Stratum 1 closed as of 2002-09-15). Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with and without anticonvulsants is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
