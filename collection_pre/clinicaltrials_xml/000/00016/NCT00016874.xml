	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining 3-AP, cisplatin, and paclitaxel in treating patients who have advanced or metastatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3-AP Plus Cisplatin and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and tolerability of 3-AP, cisplatin, and paclitaxel in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the tumor response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive 3-AP IV continuously over 96 hours on days 1-4 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 1 additional course of therapy after documented CR. Patients with partial response or stable disease may receive therapy for up to 6 months. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of 3-AP, paclitaxel, and cisplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
