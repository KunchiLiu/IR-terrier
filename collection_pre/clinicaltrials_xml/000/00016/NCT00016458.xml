	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity of cyclophosphamide and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin in patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis. II. Determine the efficacy of this regimen in terms of controlling disease in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Pilot Study of Cyclophosphamide and Rabbit Anti-Thymocyte Globulin as Salvage Therapy in Patients With Diffuse Systemic Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on day 1 and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 6-8 hours on days 2-5. Patients are followed on days 60-85 and then every 3 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
