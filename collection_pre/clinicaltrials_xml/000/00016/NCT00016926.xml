	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of capecitabine in treating patients who have advanced, persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Advanced, Persistent, or Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the activity of capecitabine in patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-62 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-20 months.</detailed_description>
