	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of two different regimens of Ro 31-7453 in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ro 31-7453 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the objective disease rate of patients with recurrent or refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with two dose schedules of Ro 31-7453. - Compare the safety and tolerability of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the response duration in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the time to progression and time to treatment failure in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of Ro 31-7453 and its major metabolites in these patients. - Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral Ro 31-7453 twice daily on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive oral Ro 31-7453 twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 28 days and then every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 160 patients (49 per treatment arm plus 61 additional patients in the arm determined to be most effective) will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
