	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Screening tests may help doctors detect cancer cells early and plan more effective treatment for cancer. New diagnostic procedures such as computed tomographic colonography may provide a less invasive method of identifying patients who have colon cancer. PURPOSE: Diagnostic and screening trial to compare the effectiveness of barium enema, computed tomographic colonography, and colonoscopy in detecting of colon cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Barium Enema, Computed Tomographic Colonography, and Colonoscopy in Detecting Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the accuracy of air contrast barium enema, computed tomographic colonography (virtual colonoscopy), and colonoscopy for the detection of colonic lesions in patients with factors related to colon cancer. - Compare the patient experience during each of these imaging tests. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. A repeat fecal occult blood test is performed. Patients then undergo an air contrast barium enema (ACBE). At 7-10 days after ACBE, patients undergo a computed tomographic colonography (virtual colonoscopy) followed by a colonoscopy on the same day. A repeat ACBE may be performed if there is a discrepancy between the initial ACBE and colonoscopy. If the repeat ACBE continues to show an abnormality, patients undergo a second colonoscopy. Within 24 hours of completion of each test, patients fill out a questionnaire about their experience. At 5-7 days after completion of all tests, patients complete a final questionnaire comparing all 3 tests. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,133 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.</detailed_description>
