	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs such as thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating women who have epithelial ovarian cancer that has not responded to previous therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thalidomide in Treating Patients With Refractory or Resistant Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the time to progression of disease in patients with platinum-refractory or resistant ovarian epithelial carcinoma treated with thalidomide. - Evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-15 months.</detailed_description>
