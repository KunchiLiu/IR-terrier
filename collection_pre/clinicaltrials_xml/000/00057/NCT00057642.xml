	<brief_title>Improving Retention of Hispanics Receiving Antidepressant Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite major advances in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, Hispanics continue to underutilize mental health services relative to their own mental health needs. Cultural factors are important causes of underutilization. To date, however, attempts to boost utilization by improving the cultural congruence of psychiatric services have not focused on retaining Hispanics in antidepressant therapy. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a time-limited psychotherapy that has successfully improved treatment retention among patients with dually diagnosed substance abuse and psychiatric disorders. During Phase I of this study, MI is adapted for use as an adjunctive therapy with antidepressant treatment and culturally adapted to Hispanic participants. In Phase II, participants receive sertraline for 12 weeks and participate in four sessions of MI therapy as a supplementary intervention designed to encourage treatment retention. Participants who are intolerant to sertraline or have an inadequate response by Week 6 are switched to venlafaxine ER while continuing to receive MI and to complete study assessments. A follow-up interview is conducted 6 months after the termination of treatment.</detailed_description>
