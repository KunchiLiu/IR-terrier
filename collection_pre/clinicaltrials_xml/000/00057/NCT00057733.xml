	<brief_title>Stress Management Training in Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine whether a modified version of a self-administered stress management training intervention, previously found to be of benefit in chemotherapy patients, is effective in improving quality of life and decreasing psychological distress (anxiety and depression) in patients with cancer who are undergoing radiotherapy. Secondary - Compare the efficacy of this intervention on improving quality of life and decreasing psychological distress (anxiety and depression) in male vs female patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive self-administered stress management training (SSMT) in 3 stress management techniques (progressive muscle relaxation training and guided imagery, abdominal breathing, and coping skills) adapted specifically for use during radiotherapy. Patients initially receive a 5-minute standardized presentation regarding the nature and purpose of SSMT. Patients then receive information and instruction regarding the three stress management techniques comprising a videotape, audiotape, and brochure. Patients also receive their institution's usual psychosocial care. - Arm II: Patients receive their institution's usual psychosocial care only. Quality of life, anxiety, and depression are assessed at baseline and then at 1, 2, and 3 weeks. Intervention helpfulness is assessed at 3 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 327 patients (approximately 163 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
