	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine is more effective with or without radiation therapy in treating pancreatic cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine with or without radiation therapy in treating patients who have locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine With or Without Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the overall survival and progression-free of patients with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine with or without radiotherapy. - Compare the objective response rate in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the quality of life (QOL) of patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the effect of gemcitabine and radiotherapy on the QOL of patients with improved objective response rate and progression-free and overall survival. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to performance status (0 vs. 1) and weight loss within the past 6 months (less than 10% vs. 10% or more). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I (Gemcitabine alone): - Induction: Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes once weekly for 6 weeks followed by 1 week of rest. - Consolidation: After the 1 week of rest, patients receive gemcitabine IV once weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Arm II (Gemcitabine with radiotherapy): - Induction: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes once weekly for 6 weeks beginning on day 1. Patients also undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks beginning on day 1. - Consolidation: Approximately 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes once weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, week 6, week 15 (for arm II), week 16 (for arm I), and 9 months. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year. Patients who receive treatment beyond 3 years are followed for survival. ACCRUAL: 74 patients were accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
