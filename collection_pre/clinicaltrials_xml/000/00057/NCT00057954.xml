	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Photopheresis allows patient white blood cells to be treated with ultraviolet (UV) light and drugs outside the body to inactivate T cells. Pentostatin may suppress the immune system and reduce the chance of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following bone marrow transplantation. Combining photopheresis with pentostatin and total-body irradiation may be effective in killing cancer cells before bone marrow transplantation. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving photophoresis together with pentostatin and total-body irradiation as a reduced-intensity regimen before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation works in treating patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's or Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the rate of stable engraftment of donor cells in patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's or Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with a reduced toxicity conditioning regimen followed by allogeneic (sibling or unrelated) bone marrow transplantation. - Determine the extent and duration of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the 100-day overall survival and long-term progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Evaluate the feasibility of collection of molecular chimerism studies at baseline, days 30, 100, 6 months and one and two years and at relapse. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. - Conditioning regimen: Patients undergo extracorporeal photopheresis using methoxsalen and UV light on 2 consecutive days between days -7 to -4. Patients receive pentostatin intravenously (IV) continuously on days -3 to -2 and undergo total body irradiation on day -1. - Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation: Patients undergo infusion of allogeneic bone marrow or stem cells on day 0. - Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive oral or IV cyclosporine beginning on day -1 and continuing until 6 months after transplantation, oral mycofenolate mofetil beginning on day 100 and continuing for 1 year, and methotrexate IV on days 1 and 3. Patients are followed at day 100, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.8 years.</detailed_description>
