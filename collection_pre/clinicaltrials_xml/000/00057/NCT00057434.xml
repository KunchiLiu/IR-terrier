	<brief_title>Vitamin A Therapy for Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By the year 2000, 13.8 % of individuals with HIV will be co-infected with tuberculosis (TB). Despite effective TB chemotherapy, mortality rates remain extremely high, and no simple, inexpensive intervention is available. Prior to the discovery of antibiotic treatment, cod-liver oil, a potent source of Vitamin A, was the standard treatment for TB. Vitamin A is essential for normal immune function, and Vitamin A supplementation is used in many countries to reduce mortality in children. Vitamin A deficiency in HIV infected people has been associated with increased mortality in the United States, Haiti, Malawi, and Uganda. This study will determine whether daily Vitamin A supplementation, given concurrently with TB chemotherapy, will reduce mortality in adults with HIV and TB. All study participants will receive standard TB chemotherapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, pyrazinamide) for the first 2 months, followed by isoniazid and ethambutol for the following 6 months. Participants will be randomized to receive either a daily vitamin and mineral supplement or placebo. Participants will be followed for 24 months after study enrollment.</detailed_description>
