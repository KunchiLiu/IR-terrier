	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as alemtuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well alemtuzumab works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory advanced mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alemtuzumab in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Advanced Mycosis Fungoides or Sézary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with relapsed or recurrent advanced mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome treated with alemtuzumab. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive alemtuzumab IV over 2 hours three times per week. Treatment continues for up to 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
