	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating patients with refractory stage IV cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Refractory Stage IV Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and feasibility of administering 1 or 2 courses of vaccination with carcinoembryonic antigen peptide 1-6D (CAP 1-6D)- and CMV pp65 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells in patients with refractory stage IV CEA-expressing malignancies. - Determine the ability of this regimen to induce CAP 1-6D- and CMV pp65-specific T cells in these patients. - Determine the antitumor effect of this regimen, in terms of progression-free survival, of these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study. Patients undergo leukapheresis and collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from which dendritic cells (DC) are generated and pulsed with carcinoembryonic antigen peptide 1-6D (CAP 1-6D) and CMV pp65 peptide. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 vaccination cohorts. - Cohort I: Patients receive vaccination with CAP 1-6D-pulsed DC and CMV pp65 peptide-pulsed DC subcutaneously and intradermally every 3 weeks for a total of 4 vaccinations. - Cohort II: Patients receive vaccinations as in cohort I every 3 weeks for a total of 8 vaccinations. For both cohorts, a safe dose of the vaccine is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients (6 per cohort) will be accrued for this study within 24 months.</detailed_description>
