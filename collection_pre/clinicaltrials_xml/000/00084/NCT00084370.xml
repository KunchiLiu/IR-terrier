	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. The use of celecoxib before prophylactic oophorectomy may be an effective way to prevent the development of ovarian epithelial cancer. PURPOSE: A controlled pilot trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in preventing cancer in patients at high-risk for ovarian epithelial cancer who are undergoing prophylactic oophorectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib in Preventing Cancer in Patients at High Risk for Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Who Are Undergoing Prophylactic Oophorectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare histologic and molecular alterations in tissue biomarkers of patients at high risk for ovarian cancer treated with celecoxib followed by prophylactic oophorectomy vs prophylactic oophorectomy only. Secondary - Compare alterations in gene expression pattern in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. - Group I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 3 months and then undergo prophylactic oophorectomy. - Group II: Patients undergo immediate prophylactic oophorectomy.</detailed_description>
