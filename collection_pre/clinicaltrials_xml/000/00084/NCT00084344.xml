	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: High estrogen levels may be associated with dense breast tissue and an increased risk of developing breast cancer. 4-hydroxytamoxifen gel (a substance made when tamoxifen breaks down in the body) may be effective in reducing breast density by reducing estrogen levels with fewer side effects than tamoxifen. This may improve quality of life and the ability to detect breast cancer with screening mammography. PURPOSE: Randomized screening study to determine the effect of 4-hydroxytamoxifen gel on breast density, salivary sex steroids (hormones), and quality of life in premenopausal women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of 4-Hydroxytamoxifen Gel on Breast Density, Salivary Sex Steroids, and Quality of Life in Premenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the effect of 4-hydroxytamoxifen gel on breast density, as measured by digital mammography, in premenopausal women. - Determine the effect of this gel on breast density in these participants, as defined by the BIRADS lexicon. Secondary - Determine the effect of this gel on salivary sex steroid levels in these participants. - Determine the effect of this gel on quality of life of these participants. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Participants apply 4-hydroxytamoxifen gel in 4 metered doses daily to each breast beginning on the first day after cessation of the first menstrual period after digital mammography is performed. - Arm II: Participants apply placebo gel as in arm I. In both arms, treatment continues for 1 year. In both arms, participants collect daily saliva samples for 4 menstrual cycles during the study. Three of the saliva collections occur during the cycles encompassing the time periods when imaging studies are performed (months 0, 6, and 12). The fourth collection takes place during the first month that gel is applied to the breast. Participants also undergo digital mammography at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year. Participants who develop clinical breast problems considered suspicious for cancer discontinue study treatment until a histological diagnosis is established. Those found to have breast cancer are removed from the study and those with benign disease continue the study. If an excisional biopsy is performed, density measurements are made on the opposite breast. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 participants (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
