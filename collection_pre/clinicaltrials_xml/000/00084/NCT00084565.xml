	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, topotecan, and estramustine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving more than one chemotherapy drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel, topotecan, and estramustine together works in treating patients with metastatic hormone therapy-refractory prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel, Topotecan, and Estramustine in Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated with paclitaxel, topotecan, and estramustine. - Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. Secondary - Determine the frequency and number of circulating tumor cells in patients before and after treatment with this regimen and at disease progression. - Determine the microtubule morphology, β-tubulin isotype pattern, apoptotic markers, and metaphase chromosome alignment in circulating tumor cells in patients before and after treatment with this regimen and at disease progression. OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15; topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 2, 9, and 16; and oral estramustine twice daily on days 1 and 2 of course 1 and on days 0-2, 7-9, and 14-16 of all subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-38 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
