	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from gene-modified pancreatic cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving vaccine therapy together with chemotherapy and radiation therapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy works in treating patients with resected stage I or stage II adenocarcinoma (cancer) of the pancreas.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine overall and disease-free survival of patients with resected stage I or II adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in combination with GVAX pancreatic cancer vaccine. Secondary - Correlate specific in vivo parameters of immune response (post-vaccination delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to autologous tumor, mesothelin-specific T-cell response, and the degree of local eosinophil, macrophage, and T-cell infiltration at the vaccine site) with clinical responses in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxic effects associated with intradermal injections of this vaccine in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. - Post surgery vaccination: Within 8-10 weeks after pancreaticoduodenectomy, patients receive GVAX pancreatic cancer vaccine intradermally (ID) on day 0. - Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy: Within 16-28 days after the first vaccination, patients receive fluorouracil (5-FU) IV continuously for 3 weeks. Approximately 1-2 weeks after completion of 5-FU, patients receive chemoradiotherapy comprising radiotherapy daily and 5-FU IV continuously for 26-28 weeks. Approximately 3-5 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive 5-FU IV continuously for 4 weeks. 5-FU repeats every 6 weeks for 2 courses. - Post chemoradiotherapy vaccination: Within 4-8 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive GVAX pancreatic cancer vaccine ID on days 0, 28, 56, and 196. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
