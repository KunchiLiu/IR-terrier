	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Celecoxib may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor and may increase the effectiveness of paclitaxel by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving celecoxib together with paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel together with celecoxib works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel and Celecoxib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Epithelial or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of paclitaxel and celecoxib in patients with recurrent or persistent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral celecoxib twice daily on days 2-6, 9-13, and 16-27. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-22 months.</detailed_description>
