	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as fluorouracil work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving cetuximab with fluorouracil and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Cetuximab, Fluorouracil, and Pelvic Irradiation in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Locally Recurrent Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety profile of neoadjuvant cetuximab, fluorouracil, and pelvic irradiation in patients with locally advanced or locally recurrent rectal cancer. Secondary - Determine the activity of this regimen, in terms of pathological complete response rate, in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, pilot study. Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, and 64 and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-42. Patients undergo whole-pelvic radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-40. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 1-3 weeks after completion of study treatment, patients undergo surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy off-study. Patients are followed for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
