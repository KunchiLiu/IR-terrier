	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. Iloprost may be effective in preventing lung cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well iloprost works in preventing lung cancer in patients who are at high risk for this disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iloprost in Preventing Lung Cancer in Patients at High Risk for This Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the reversal of premalignant histological changes in the bronchial epithelium of patients at high risk for lung cancer (defined by &gt; 20 pack years of smoking and sputum atypia) treated with iloprost vs placebo. - Determine whether this drug modulates Ki-67 proliferation index in these patients. - Determine whether this drug affects prostaglandin metabolism in these patients. - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Determine whether this drug modulates a panel of biomarkers, including MCM-2(Minichromosome maintenance protein: forms DNA helicase), EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor: cell surface receptor for the epidermal growth factor family of proteins. Mutations in EGFR expression or activity can result in cancer.) , HER2/neu (Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2 is a member of the EGFR family), RARβ (Retinoic Acic Receptor Beta is a nuclear transcription regulator and a member of the thyroid-steroid hormone receptor superfamily), p53, FHIT (Fragile histidine triad protein is an enzyme involved in purine metabolism and had been demonstrated to be a tumor suppressor), apoptotic index, and microvessel density, in these patients. - Determine the genes whose expression is altered by this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to smoking status (current vs former) and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral iloprost twice daily. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms, treatment continues for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 152 patients (76 [38 current smokers and 38 former smokers] per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
