	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (radiation directed at the tumor more precisely than in standard radiation therapy) with incorporated boost (an increase in the amount of radiation given during treatment) may cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving radiation therapy together with chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so it can be removed. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of neoadjuvant intensity-modulated radiation therapy with incorporated boost when given together with capecitabine in treating patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy With Incorporated Boost and Capecitabine Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of neoadjuvant boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy when combined with capecitabine before surgery in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Secondary - Determine the pathologic tumor response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Patients undergo neoadjuvant IMRT with incorporated boost once daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Beginning on the first day of radiotherapy, patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily 7 days a week for 5 weeks. Patients undergo surgical resection 4-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy. Cohorts of 3-6 patients undergo escalating doses of boost IMRT until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at week 5 of chemoradiotherapy, before surgery, and then at 1, 3, and 12 months after surgery. Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 12 months after surgery. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-15 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
