	<brief_title>Healing Touch and Relaxation Therapies in Cervical Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The side effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment are often severe and can have devastating effects on the mental and physical well-being of cancer patients. This study will determine whether healing touch and relaxation therapy are effective in minimizing the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment in cervical cancer patients. Participants in this study will receive weekly chemotherapy and daily radiation treatments for 6 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either standard care (SC), SC plus relaxation therapy, or SC plus healing touch therapy. The relaxation therapy consists of progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery. The healing touch therapy involves an energy-based modality in which health care practitioners stimulate the energy fields surrounding the patient. A physician-completed assessment and measures of immune function will be used to assess the well-being and overall quality of life of participants.</detailed_description>
