	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients with progressive small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Progressive Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the targeting, tissue distribution, and pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 in patients with progressive small cell lung cancer. Secondary - Determine the immunogenicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine tumor response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 (MOAB Hu3S193) IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1-4. Patients also receive indium In III MOAB Hu3S193 IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1 and 4 and then undergo gamma camera imaging. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 and 4 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6-12 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
