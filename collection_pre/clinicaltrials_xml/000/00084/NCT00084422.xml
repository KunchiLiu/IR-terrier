	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: CEP-701 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of CEP-701 in treating young patients with recurrent or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>N2001-03: CEP-701 in Treating Young Patients With Recurrent or Refractory High-Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CEP-701 in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma. - Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetic behavior of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Determine the degree of TrkB tyrosine kinase inhibition activity present in the serum of patients treated with this drug. - Correlate the degree of TrkB tyrosine kinase inhibition activity in these patients with dose level, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity data of this drug. - Determine the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive oral CEP-701 twice daily* on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *On day 1 of course 1 only, patients receive oral CEP-701 once instead of twice. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CEP-701 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, the dose level is expanded up to 9 patients. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
