	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Immunotoxins can locate tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells. Immunotoxin therapy may be effective in treating advanced solid tumors. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of immunotoxin therapy in treating patients with recurrent unresectable advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotoxin Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin in patients with advanced mesothelin-expressing malignancies. Secondary - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the response in patients treated with this drug. - Correlate the induction of antibody against this drug with its pharmacokinetics in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study. Patients receive a test dose of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin IV over 1-2 minutes on day 1 followed by SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-15 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
