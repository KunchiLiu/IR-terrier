	<brief_summary>Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of low-dose radiation therapy to the abdomen combined with docetaxel in treating patients who have recurrent or persistent advanced ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy to the Abdomen Plus Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Advanced Ovarian, Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel in combination with low-dose abdominal radiotherapy in patients with recurrent or persistent advanced ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of docetaxel. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes once daily on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 35. Within 3 hours after beginning docetaxel, patients also receive low-dose abdominal radiotherapy twice daily (at least 4 hours apart) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 24, 29, 30, 35, and 36. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
