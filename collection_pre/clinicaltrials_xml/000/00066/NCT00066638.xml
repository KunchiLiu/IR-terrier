	<brief_title>FR901228 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of depsipeptide in patients with refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma (MM). OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a stable plateau (stable paraprotein levels or urine protein excretion over 3 consecutive determinations at least 4 weeks apart) may receive maintenance therapy comprising FR901228 IV on days 1 and 15, with courses repeating every 28 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-12.5 months.</detailed_description>
