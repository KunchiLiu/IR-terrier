	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who have diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that is refractory to previous chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma That Is Refractory To Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall response rate in patients with chemotherapy-refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with bortezomib. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. - Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the possible mechanism of resistance to this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 20 days and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
