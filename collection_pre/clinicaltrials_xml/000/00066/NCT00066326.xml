	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining imatinib mesylate with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin when given together with imatinib mesylate in treating patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate and 17-N-Allylamino-17-Demethoxygeldanamycin in Treating Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) when administered with imatinib mesylate in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter, dose-escalation study of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate on days 1-21 and 17-AAG IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4, 8, and 12. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-AAG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional cohort of 6-10 patients receives treatment at the recommended phase II dose. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21-42 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.</detailed_description>
