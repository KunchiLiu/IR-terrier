	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety of NY-ESO-1b peptide vaccine and Montanide ISA-51 in patients with ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer expressing NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1. - Determine the immunologic profile (NY-ESO-1 antibody, CD8+ cells, and delayed-type hypersensitivity) induced by this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive NY-ESO-1b peptide vaccine emulsified with Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously once every 3 weeks on weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 weeks and then every 6-12 weeks for 2 years or until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
