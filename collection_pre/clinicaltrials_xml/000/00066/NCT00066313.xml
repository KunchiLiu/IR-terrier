	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: ZD6474 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. ZD6474 may also stop the growth of small cell lung cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well ZD6474 works compared to placebo in treating patients with small cell lung cancer that has responded to previous chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ZD6474 in Treating Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the progression-free survival of patients with previously treated small cell lung cancer (SCLC) treated with ZD6474 vs placebo. - Compare the response rate of patients treated with these regimens (only patients who had measurable disease outside a prior radiation field at study entry). - Compare the toxicity and tolerability of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the pharmacokinetics of these regimens in these patients. - Correlate outcome and response with vascular endothelial growth factor expression and microvessel density in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. - Provide a comprehensive tumor, plasma, and urine bank linked to a clinical database for further study of molecular markers in SCLC. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, timing of prior radiotherapy (early [before day 1, course 4 of chemotherapy] vs late vs no prior radiotherapy), stage of disease at diagnosis (limited vs extensive), and response at study entry (complete vs partial). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral ZD6474 daily. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily. In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 4 weeks while on therapy, and then every 8 weeks until disease progression. Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
