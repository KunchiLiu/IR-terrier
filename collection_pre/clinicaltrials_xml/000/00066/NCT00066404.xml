	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Using BG00001 to insert the gene for interferon-beta into a person's pleural cavity may improve the body's ability to fight cancer. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of intrapleural BG00001 in treating patients who have malignant pleural mesothelioma or malignant pleural effusions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrapleural BG00001 in Treating Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma or Malignant Pleural Effusions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and toxicity of intrapleural BG00001 in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma or malignant pleural effusions. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients. - Determine the success of gene transfer/interferon beta gene expression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine systemic and intrapleural cytokine responses and cellular and humoral immune response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine, preliminarily, tumor response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive BG00001 via an intrapleural catheter on day 1. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BG00001 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed weekly for 1 month, biweekly for 1 month, monthly for 4 months, and then every 6 months for 15 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
