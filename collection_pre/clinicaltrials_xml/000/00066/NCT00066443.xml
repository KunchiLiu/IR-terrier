	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as epirubicin and docetaxel use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as pegfilgrastim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining epirubicin and docetaxel with pegfilgrastim in treating women who have locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epirubicin, Docetaxel, and Pegfilgrastim in Treating Women With Locally Advanced or Inflammatory Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of docetaxel and epirubicin when given with pegfilgrastim in women with locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer. (Phase I, group 1 closed to accrual as of 9/13/04 and Phase II, group 1 closed to accrual as of 5/10/06) - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the clinical and pathological response rate and duration of response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine drug sensitivity and resistance in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine prognostic and predictive markers in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter, dose-escalation study of docetaxel and epirubicin. - Phase I: Group 1 (21-day regimen) (closed to accrual as of 09/13/04): Patients receive epirubicin IV over 15 minutes and docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with objective response after 6 courses may receive additional therapy at the discretion of the physician. Group 2 (14-day regimen): Patients receive epirubicin IV over 15 minutes and docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously on day 2. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with objective response after 8 courses may receive additional therapy at the discretion of the physician. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of epirubicin and docetaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase II: Group 1 (21-day regimen) (closed to accrual as of 5/10/06): Patients receive treatment as in phase I with epirubicin and docetaxel at the recommended Phase II dose. Group 2 (14-day regimen): Patients receive treatment as in phase I with epirubicin and docetaxel at the recommended Phase II dose. Patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 90 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
