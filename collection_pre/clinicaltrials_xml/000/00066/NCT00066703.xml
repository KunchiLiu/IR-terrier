	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using triptorelin, exemestane, and tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen. It is not yet known whether giving triptorelin together with exemestane is more effective than triptorelin and tamoxifen in treating hormone-responsive breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying triptorelin and exemestane to see how well they work compared to triptorelin and tamoxifen in treating premenopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triptorelin With Either Exemestane or Tamoxifen in Treating Premenopausal Women With Hormone-Responsive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the disease-free survival, breast cancer-free interval, distant recurrence-free interval and overall survival of premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer when treated with triptorelin and exemestane vs triptorelin and tamoxifen. - Compare the quality of life, including late side effects of early menopause, of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, international, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to planned use of concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no), and number of positive lymph nodes (0 vs 1 or more). Treatment duration is 5 years. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 6 months for 2 years, and annually for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed breast cancer Completely resected disease No clinically detectable residual locoregional axillary disease Prior surgery for primary breast cancer of 1 of the following types: Total mastectomy with or without adjuvant radiotherapy Breastconserving procedure (e.g., lumpectomy, quadrantectomy, or partial mastectomy with margins negative* for invasive disease and ductal carcinoma in situ) with planned radiotherapy NOTE: *If all other margins are clear a positive posterior (deep) margin is permitted, provided the excision was performed down to the pectoral fascia and all tumor has been removed OR a positive anterior (superficial; abutting skin) margin is allowed provided all tumor was removed Tumor confined to the breast and axillary nodes Tumor detected in internal mammary chain nodes by sentinel node procedure and is not enlarged is allowed Axillary lymph node dissection or a negative axillary sentinel node biopsy required Patients with negative or microscopically positive axillary sentinel nodes are eligible Positive sentinel nodes must have either axillary dissection or radiation of axillary nodes No distant metastases No locally advanced inoperable breast cancer, including any of the following: Inflammatory breast cancer Supraclavicular node involvement Enlarged internal mammary nodes (unless pathologically negative) Bilateral synchronous invasive breast cancer allowed if disease meets all other eligibility criteria No prior ipsilateral or contralateral invasive breast cancer Hormone receptor status: Estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive At least 10% of the tumor cells positive by immunohistochemistry If &gt; 1 breast tumor, each tumor must be hormone receptor positive PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age Premenopausal Sex Female Menopausal status Premenopausal Estradiol in the premenopausal range after prior surgery OR meets the following criteria: Menstruating regularly for the past 6 months Has not used any form of hormonal treatment (including hormonal contraception) within the past 6 months Performance status Not specified Life expectancy Not specified Hematopoietic Not specified Hepatic No systemic hepatic disease that would preclude prolonged followup Renal No systemic renal disease that would preclude prolonged followup Cardiovascular No systemic cardiovascular disease that would preclude prolonged followup No prior thrombosis (e.g., deep vein thrombosis) and/or embolism unless patient is medically suitable Pulmonary No systemic pulmonary disease that would preclude prolonged followup Other Not pregnant or nursing Fertile patients must use effective nonhormonal contraception No history of noncompliance to medical regimens No other nonmalignant systemic disease that would preclude prolonged followup No other malignancy within the past 5 years except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, nonbreast carcinoma in situ, contralateral or ipsilateral carcinoma in situ of the breast, or other nonrecurrent invasive nonbreast malignancy, including any of the following: Stage I papillary thyroid cancer Stage IA carcinoma of the cervix Stage IA or B endometrioid endometrial cancer Borderline or stage I ovarian cancer No psychiatric, addictive, or other disorder that would preclude study compliance PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy Prior or concurrent neoadjuvant or adjuvant trastuzumab allowed Chemotherapy No prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy Endocrine therapy No prior tamoxifen, other selective estrogenreceptor modulators (SERMs) (e.g., raloxifene), or hormone replacement therapy for more than 1 year before breast cancer diagnosis No prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant endocrine therapy since diagnosis of breast cancer No concurrent oral or transdermal hormonal therapy No other concurrent estrogen, progesterone, or androgens No other concurrent aromatase inhibitors No concurrent oral or other hormonal contraceptives (i.e., implants or depot injections) Radiotherapy See Disease Characteristics No prior ovarian radiotherapy Surgery See Disease Characteristics No prior bilateral oophorectomy Other No concurrent bisphosphonates, except in the following cases: Bone density is at least 1.5 standard deviations below the young adult normal mean Participation in a randomized clinical study testing bisphosphonates in the adjuvant breast cancer setting No other concurrent investigational agents</criteria>
