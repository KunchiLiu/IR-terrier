	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of specialized high-dose radiation therapy in treating patients who have stage I non-small cell lung cancer and lung dysfunction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer And Lung Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated course of accelerated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer with pulmonary dysfunction. - Determine the short-term and long-term toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine local tumor control, failure-free survival, and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the effect of radiotherapy dose volume relationships and pre-treatment pulmonary function studies on the incidence of pulmonary toxicity in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive accelerated 3-dimensional (3-D) conformal radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 3.5-6 weeks. Cohorts of 8 patients receive escalating fractions of accelerated 3-D conformal radiotherapy until the maximum tolerated course is determined. The maximum tolerated course is defined as the course at which no more than 2 patients develop at least grade 3 dose-limiting toxicity and no more than 1 patient develops at least grade 4 dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
