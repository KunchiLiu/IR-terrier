	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 in Treating Children Who Have Undergone Bone Marrow Transplantation for Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of interleukin-2 after autologous bone marrow transplantation in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia. II. Determine toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously on days 1-7, 9-14, and 16-22. On days 8 and 15, patients receive IL-2 IV over 2 hours. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 6-9 patients receive escalating doses of IL-2 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 or 2 of 9 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-27 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
