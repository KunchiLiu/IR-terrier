	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel combined with fluorouracil-uracil and leucovorin in treating patients who have solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Combined With Fluorouracil-Uracil and Leucovorin in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of weekly paclitaxel when combined with fluorouracil-uracil and leucovorin calcium in patients with solid tumors. II. Determine the side effects and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of paclitaxel. Patients receive paclitaxel IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive oral fluorouracil-uracil and leucovorin calcium twice daily on days 2-6, 9-13, and 16-20. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 months and then for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
