	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with cyclosporine and paclitaxel may be an effective treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy combined with paclitaxel and cyclosporine in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy, Paclitaxel, and Cyclosporine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody Lym-1 in combination with paclitaxel and cyclosporine in patients with recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody Lym-1 (Y90 MOAB Lym-1). Patients receive oral cyclosporine every 12 hours on days -2 to 14. Patients receive unlabeled MOAB Lym-1 IV followed by a tracer dose of indium In 111 MOAB Lym-1 IV on day 0. On day 7, patients receive unlabeled MOAB Lym-1 IV followed by Y90 MOAB Lym-1 IV. Patients in cohorts 2-4 also receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 9. Courses repeat every 8 weeks for a total of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB Lym-1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 21 months, and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 36 months.</detailed_description>
