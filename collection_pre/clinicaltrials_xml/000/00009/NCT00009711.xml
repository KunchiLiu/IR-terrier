	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Assessing the long-term effects of bone marrow transplant on lung function in patients may improve the ability to plan treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies lung function in pediatric patients who have undergone bone marrow transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Lung Function in Children Who Have Undergone Bone Marrow Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the delayed effects of bone marrow transplantation preparative regimens on pulmonary function in children surviving at least 5 years after transplantation for hematologic malignancy. - Determine the relationship between pulmonary function and growth rates in these patients. - Determine the effect of growth hormone treatment on pulmonary function in these patients. - Determine the relationship between pulmonary function and age at time of transplantation in these patients. - Determine the incidence and severity of restrictive pulmonary disease, and whether these factors vary with increasing time after transplantation in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo respiratory history, signs and symptoms assessment, pulmonary function tests (PFT) including spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, and height measurement. Patients are assessed at 5-10 years, 10-15 years, and over 15 years after bone marrow transplantation. Patients with abnormal PFTs are assessed at more frequent intervals as clinically indicated. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 280 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
