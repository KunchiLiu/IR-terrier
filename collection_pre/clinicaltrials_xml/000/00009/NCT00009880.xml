	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus radiation therapy with and without fluorouracil in treating patients who have cancer of the esophagus or stomach.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy With or Without Fluorouracil in Treating Patients With Cancer of the Esophagus or Stomach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the survival and failure patterns in patients with previously untreated carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with cisplatin, paclitaxel, and concurrent radiotherapy with or without fluorouracil. - Compare the tolerance of these regimens by these patients. - Compare the overall quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to percentage of weight loss (less than 10% vs 10% or more), disease histology (adenocarcinoma vs squamous cell carcinoma), and lesion size (no more than 5 cm vs more than 5 cm). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil IV continuously over 24 hours and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-5, paclitaxel IV continuously over 24 hours on day 1, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily on days 6-15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 2 courses. Patients with stable or responsive disease after the first course of induction therapy receive a second course of therapy. Patients with local disease progression after the first course proceed to chemoradiotherapy. Beginning on day 29 of the last course of induction chemotherapy, patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, and 29-33, and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. - Arm II: Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising cisplatin IV and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 2 courses as in arm I. Beginning on day 29 of the last course of induction chemotherapy, patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients also receive cisplatin IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36, and paclitaxel IV continuously over 96 hours on days 1-4, 8-11, 15-18, 22-25, 29-32, and 36-39. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, within 1 week after radiotherapy, at 6 weeks after study completion, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 5 years. Patients are followed within 8 weeks, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for two years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 84 patients (42 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 21 months.</detailed_description>
