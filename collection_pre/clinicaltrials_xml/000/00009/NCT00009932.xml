	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining fenretinide, paclitaxel, and cisplatin in treating patients who have solid tumors that have not responded to previous therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose, clinical toxicity, and recommended phase II dose of fenretinide when combined with paclitaxel and cisplatin in patients with refractory solid tumors. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the therapeutic response to this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of fenretinide. Patients receive oral fenretinide twice daily on days 1-7 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 2. On day 8 of course 1, patients also receive fenretinide once in the morning. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response receive 2 additional courses. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fenretinide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
