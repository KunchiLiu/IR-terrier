	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of SU5416 in treating patients who have metastatic kidney cancer that has not responded to previous therapy with interleukin-2. SU5416 may stop the growth of kidney cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SU5416 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer That Has Not Responded to Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the clinical activity of SU5416 in patients with progressive metastatic renal cancer failing prior biologic therapy or fluorouracil-containing regimens. II. Determine the changes in tumor perfusion in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the time to progression and survival in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice weekly. Treatment continues every 6 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response (CR) receive an additional 6 months of therapy after achieving CR. Patients are followed every 3 months.</detailed_description>
