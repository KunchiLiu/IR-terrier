	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with cyclosporine and paclitaxel may be an effective treatment for metastatic breast cancer. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy, cyclosporine, and paclitaxel in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy, Cyclosporine, and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody m170 in combination with cyclosporine and paclitaxel in patients with recurrent or refractory metastatic breast cancer. - Determine the preliminary efficacy of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody m170 (Y90 MOAB m170). Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily for 4 days prior to apheresis which continues daily for a maximum of 5 days. A minimum of 6 million CD34+ cells/kg must be harvested. Patients receive oral cyclosporine every 12 hours on days -3 to 25. Patients receive unlabeled monoclonal antibody (MOAB) m170 IV followed by a tracer dose of indium In 111 MOAB m170 IV on day 0. On day 7, patients receive unlabeled MOAB m170 IV followed by Y90 MOAB m170 IV. Patients in cohorts 2-4 also receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 9. If needed, patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 21 and receive G-CSF SC daily until blood counts recover. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB m170 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 36 months.</detailed_description>
