	<brief_title>Maintaining Abstinence in Chronic Cigarette Smokers - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The work adapts interventions that have been successful in the general populations, and tailors them to chronic smokers, who may have numerous previous smoking treatment failures. If successful it will: (1) make available a treatment intervention that produces hight long term abstinence rates; (2) provide information on variables that predicts success and failure in this population of smokers; (3) examine the cost-effectiveness of more intensive, longer term treatments.</detailed_description>
