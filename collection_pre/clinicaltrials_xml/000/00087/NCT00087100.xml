	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as pemetrexed disodium work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well pemetrexed disodium works in treating patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Disodium in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of pemetrexed disodium in patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma that failed higher priority treatment protocols. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 7 days before and continuing until 3 weeks after the last dose of pemetrexed disodium, patients also receive oral folic acid daily and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B_12) intramuscularly every 9 weeks. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-3.4 years.</detailed_description>
