	<criteria>Male and female subjects with signs or symptoms consistent with infection, and if available, laboratory findings consistent with staphylococcal infection (e.g., Gram stain and culture results). Signs and symptoms consistent with infection Infection suspected to be due to Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Subjects who were treated with a previous antibiotic (systemic or topical) with MRSA activity (other than linezolid or vancomycin) for more than 24 hours and treatment extended into the 72 hour period prior to the first dose of study drug, unless documented to be a treatment failure (72 hours of treatment and not responding). Subjects with uncomplicated skin or superficial skin structure infection such as superficial/simple cellulitis, impetiginous lesion, furuncle, or simple abscess that only need surgical drainage for cure. Subjects excluded with necrotizing fasciitis, gas gangrene, osteomyelitis</criteria>
