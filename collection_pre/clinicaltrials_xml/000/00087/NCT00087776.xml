	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to compare the survival of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma treated with Taxoprexin Injection to those treated with Dacarbazine. In addition, the response rate to each drug, response duration, time to progression and time to treatment failure will be measured. Toxicity will be evaluated and compared between the two groups.</brief_summary>
