	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized Phase 3 study comparing pemetrexed and cisplatin combination to gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NCSLC). Gemcitabine plus cisplatin is currently the standard of care for NSCLC. It is thought that pemetrexed plus cisplatin may be as effective and may have fewer side effects than the standard of care.</brief_summary>

Treatment with any drug within the last 30 days that has not received regulatory approval. Serious cardiac condition. Serious medical disorder in addition to NSCLC that would make it difficult for the patient to complete the study. Inability or unwillingness to take folic acid or Vitamin B12 supplementation. Presence of fluid retention that cannot be controlled by drainage.</criteria>
