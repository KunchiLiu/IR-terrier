	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well CCI-779 works in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CCI-779, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CCI-779 in Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma or Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the antitumor activity of CCI-779 in this patient population. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the following in patients with soft tissue sarcomas and following treatment with CCI-779: duration of response, time to progression, survival. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe and correlate the following with patient characteristics and outcome in this patient population and following treatment with CCI-779: relative levels of 4EBP1 to eIF4E, phospho 4EBP1, total and phospho ribosomal S6 on pretreatment tumor tissue, expression levels of EGFR, activated EGFR, Her2, c-Myc, phospho Akt, total Akt, phospho-mTOR and total mTOR on pretreatment tumor tissue, drug induced inhibition of p70S6 kinase activity, and phosphorylation of S6 in PBMC, relative levels of serum sirolimus in post-treatment samples. OUTLINE: Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
