	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bryostatin 1, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Bryostatin 1 may help rituximab kill more cancer cells by making them more sensitive to the drug. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bryostatin 1 together with rituximab works in treating patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has not responded to previous treatment with rituximab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bryostatin 1 and Rituximab in Treating Patients With B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the feasibility and safety of bryostatin 1 and rituximab in patients with rituximab-refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). - Determine the antitumor response in patients treated with this regimen. Secondary - Determine the effects of this regimen on the functional and molecular status of effector cells (i.e., NK cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells) in these patients. - Determine the expression of CD20 and complement-inhibitory molecules on tumor cells before and after treatment with this regimen in these patients. - Determine the effects of this regimen on the global gene expression pattern in CLL cells of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV continuously over 24 hours on days -6, 2, and 9 of course 1 and on days 2 and 9 of courses 2-6. Patients also receive rituximab IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of courses 1 and 4. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-48 patients (9-24 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 9-24 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia) will be accrued for this study within 12-30 months.</detailed_description>
