	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin when given together with paclitaxel in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin with paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) when administered with paclitaxel in patients with metastatic or unresectable solid malignancy. II. Determine the dose-limiting and non-dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine tumor response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). Patients receive 17-AAG IV over 1 hour on days 1*, 4, 8, 11, 15 and 18 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *17-AAG is not administered on day 1 of course 1. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-AAG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 6-12 patients are treated at the recommended phase II dose.</detailed_description>
