	<brief_summary>This 4 arm study is designed for patients with CHC who have not responded to peginterferon alfa-2b (12KD)/ribavirin combination therapy. In these patients, the effects of lengthening the duration of treatment, as well as including an initial 12-week period of high-dose PEGASYS (360 micrograms sc), are compared with the standard combination therapy of PEGASYS (180 micrograms sc) and ribavirin (1000-1200mg po). The anticipated time on study treatment is 1-2 years and the target sample size is 500+ individuals.</brief_summary>
