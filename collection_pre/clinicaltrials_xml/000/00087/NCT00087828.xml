	<brief_title>Identification of the Cranberry Juice Compounds That Prevent Urinary Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant health issue, with one fourth of all women experiencing symptoms during their lifetimes. Cranberry juice has been shown to reduce the incidence of UTIs by preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder. However, the compounds that direct this activity have not been identified. This study will identify and examine UTI-reducing compounds in cranberry juice. Participants in this study will drink a specified amount of water following an overnight fast. Their urine will be collected 1 to 3 hours after the water is consumed. Several days later, the women will be provided with cranberry juice to replace the water in the regimen. Urine samples will be analyzed for compounds that have antibacterial or antiadhesion activity against the bacteria that cause UTIs.</detailed_description>
