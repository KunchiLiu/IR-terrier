	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gimatecan, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gimatecan in treating patients with recurrent or progressive primary malignant glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gimatecan in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Primary Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gimatecan in patients with recurrent or progressive primary malignant glioma treated with or without concurrent enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs. - Determine whether this drug has sufficient activity to warrant further development in these patients. (phase II) Secondary - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetic behaviors of this drug in these patients. - Correlate the principal toxic effects with the pertinent pharmacokinetic parameters of this drug in these patients. - Determine the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to the concurrent use of enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs (yes vs no). - Phase I: Patients receive oral gimatecan once daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gimatecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase II: Patients receive gimatecan as in phase I at the MTD. Patients are followed for at least 1 month and then every 2 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-83 patients (30-42 for phase I [15-21 per stratum] and 21-41 for phase II) will be accrued for this study within 24 months.</detailed_description>
