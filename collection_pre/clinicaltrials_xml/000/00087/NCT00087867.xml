	<brief_title>Study of Oral SCIO-469 in Relapsed, Refractory Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of SCIO-469 as monotherapy in relapsed, refractory patients with multiple myeloma (MM), based on response rates. Patients took SCIO-469 two capsules (60 mg) by mouth three times a day with water, preferably with a meal, for 72 days except on Days 1 and 30 of monotherapy and Days 1 and 11 of combination therapy. On these days, the second dose of SCIO-469 was administered after collection of the 12-hour PK sample, and the third dose was not administered.</detailed_description>
