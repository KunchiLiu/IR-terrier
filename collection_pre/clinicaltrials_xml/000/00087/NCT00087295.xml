	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as FR901228 (depsipeptide), work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well FR901228 works in treating patients with advanced cancer of the urothelium that has progressed or recurred after receiving one chemotherapy regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0400, FR901228 in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer of the Urothelium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response (confirmed complete and partial) in patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium that has progressed after prior chemotherapy when treated with FR901228 (depsipeptide) . - Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine, preliminarily, the effects of this drug on reversing tumor promoter gene methylation in these patients. - Correlate, preliminarily, tumor DNA in plasma with response or outcome in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response receive 2 additional courses of treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
