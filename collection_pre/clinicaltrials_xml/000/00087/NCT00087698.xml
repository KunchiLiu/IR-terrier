	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine how successful the chemotherapy regimen of Pemetrexed plus cisplatin before surgery is at killing all the tumor so that none is left at the time of surgery. Following surgery, all eligible patients will receive radiation to the chest. How patients respond, whether the cancer returns and if so, where, will also be monitored.</brief_summary>
