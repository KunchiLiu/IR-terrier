	<brief_summary>ICA-17043 is being developed for the chronic treatment of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) in both adults and children. ICA-17043 is a potent and specific inhibitor of a channel in human red blood cells (RBCs) that blocks RBC dehydration. ICA-17043 is expected to inhibit RBC dehydration and thus should prevent or delay the sickling process. By reducing sickled cells, an improvement in anemia, a reduction in painful crises, and ultimately, less end-organ disease is anticipated.</brief_summary>
