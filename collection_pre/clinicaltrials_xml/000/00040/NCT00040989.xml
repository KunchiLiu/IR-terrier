	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: BAY 56-3722 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BAY 56-3722 in treating patients who have recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BAY 56-3722 in Treating Patients With Recurrent, Unresectable, or Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the tumor response rate of patients with recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with BAY 56-3722. - Determine the duration of response, time to progression, and survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive BAY 56-3722 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-140 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
