	<criteria>Patients will be included in the study if all of the following criteria are met: Willing and able to give informed consent Age 30 years or older at time of diagnosis of Parkinson's disease Have idiopathic Parkinson's disease with at least 2 cardinal signs of disease: resting tremor, bradykinesia, or rigidity Modified Hoehn and Yahr stage less than or equal to 2.5 Must have had screening procedures for cancer appropriate for the patient's age and gender, within the last 12 months; or be willing to obtain such screening before randomization Women: are not breastfeeding Women: nonchildbearing potential (ie, postmenopausal or surgically sterile) or must use a medically accepted contraceptive regimen for at least 60 days before the baseline visit, and agree to continue such use throughout the duration of the study and for 30 days after the final dose of study drug. Women must be given a pregnancy test unless they are at least 2 years postmenopausal or surgically sterile. Patients will be excluded from participating in this study if 1 or more of the following criteria are met: Have atypical Parkinsonism due to drugs, metabolic disorders, encephalitis, or other neurodegenerative diseases Have confirmed diagnosis of Parkinson's disease for more than 5 years Have a tremor score of 3 or more in any body part Have any other known medical or psychiatric condition that may compromise participation in the study Have a history of prior malignancy (excluding basal or squamous cell cancer of the skin) within the previous 5 years Have an unresolved abnormal cancer screening test result before randomization Have greater than trace amounts of glycosuria at screening, except for known diabetic patients Have estimated creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min Have liver function tests (LFT) greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) Have any other clinically significant ECG or laboratory finding Have any history of malignant melanoma Have history of seizures (except febrile) or posttraumatic epilepsy Have MiniMental State Exam (MMSE) score ≤ 26 Have taken another investigational drug within 60 days before the baseline visit Have received prior treatment with CEP1347 Have received treatment with agents with potentially confounding antiParkinson's disease effects, with specified substrates for CYP3A4/5, or with inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 Received treatment within 6 months before the baseline visit with agents that may induce Parkinson's disease Are expected, within the next 3 months, to reach a level of disability sufficient to require dopaminergic therapy Have BECK depression score ≥ 15 Have known or suspected sensitivity to the investigational study drugs, including BCIT</criteria>
