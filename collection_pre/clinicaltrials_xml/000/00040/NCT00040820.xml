	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer that has been previously treated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Provide oxaliplatin for patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer who have exhausted all approved therapies for colorectal cancer. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, Treatment Access Program study. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for at least 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately one patient per site per month will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
