	<brief_summary>Glutamate is fundamentally involved in learning and memory. Memory loss associated with mild cognitive impairment may be due to loss of glutamate receptors in the aging brain. There is evidence CX516 enhances brain activity by specifically targeting remaining glutamate receptors in the affected portions of the brain. This study will test the safety and efficacy of CX516 in the symptomatic treatment of participants with mild cognitive impairment.</brief_summary>
