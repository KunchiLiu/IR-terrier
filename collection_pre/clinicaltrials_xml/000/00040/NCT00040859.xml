	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining oxaliplatin with capecitabine in treating patients who have advanced esophageal cancer or stomach cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Advanced Esophageal Cancer or Stomach Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the objective tumor response rate of patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, or gastric cardia treated with oxaliplatin and capecitabine. Secondary - Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after CR. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 weeks (prior to each course of chemotherapy). Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
