	<brief_title>Walking Therapy In Hemiparetic Stroke Patients Using Robotic-Assisted Treadmill Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects enrolled into the study will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups. The first group will receive one hour of conventional gait training, consisting of lower extremity strengthening exercises, stretching, and full weight bearing walking as tolerated, with appropriate physical assistance from a therapist. The second group will receive walking therapy using a Lokomat, which is a special treadmill that works in conjunction with 2 light-weight robotic arms that assists the subject to move their legs while they try to walk on the treadmill. Some of the subjectâ€™s body-weight will be supported using a harness. During Lokomat training sessions, subjects will receive feedback of their walking performance on a computer monitor to help them walk. Both groups will be trained for 8-10 weeks, 3 times per week, for 1 hour training sessions (24 total sessions). Resources for transportation to the National Rehabilitation Hospital will be provided to all study participants.</detailed_description>
