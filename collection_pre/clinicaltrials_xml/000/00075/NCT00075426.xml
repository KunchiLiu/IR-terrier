	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as arsenic trioxide, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well arsenic trioxide works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety and activity of arsenic trioxide in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Determine the response, in terms of objective tumor response and response duration, in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the patterns of failure and survival in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5 of week 1 and on days 1 and 5 of weeks 2-8 (course 1 only). Beginning with course 2 and for all subsequent courses, patients receive arsenic trioxide on days 1 and 5 of weeks 1-8. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 1 additional course of therapy beyond CR. Patients achieving CR due to local consolidative therapy (surgery or radiotherapy) receive 2 additional courses of therapy beyond CR. Patients are followed for 1 month, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-18 months.</detailed_description>
