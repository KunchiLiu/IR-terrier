	<brief_summary>This phase II clinical trial studies the side effects and how well imatinib mesylate works in treating patients with uterine cancer that has failed to respond to initial chemotherapy or has re-grown after therapy. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Uterine Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the activity of Gleevec^trademark (TM) (imatinib mesylate) as measured by progression-free survival at six months. II. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse effects of Gleevec^TM in this cohort of patients as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE v3.0). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the distribution of progression-free survival and overall survival. II. To estimate the objective response rate (partial and complete response as defined under the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria). III. To determine the effects of prognostic factors such as initial performance status and histological grade. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the levels of expression of v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (c-KIT), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 2 (AKT2), and phosphorylated (p)-AKT2 in archived, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary tumors collected prior to the initiation of first-line chemotherapy OUTLINE: Patients receive imatinib mesylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically confirmed uterine carcinosarcoma that is persistent or recurrent with documented disease progression after appropriate local therapy; acceptable histologic type is defined as carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed Mullerian tumor), homologous or heterologous type All patients must have measurable disease; measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded); each lesion must be &gt;= 20 mm when measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain xray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or &gt;= 10 mm when measured by spiral CT Patients must have at least one "target lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions Patients must not be eligible for a higher priority Gynecological Oncology Group (GOG) protocol, if one exists; in general, this would refer to any active GOG phase III protocol for the same patient population Patients who have received one prior regimen must have a GOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2; patients who have received two prior regimens must have a GOG performance status of 0 or 1 Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one week prior to registration; continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration Patients must have had one prior chemotherapeutic regimen for management of carcinosarcoma; initial treatment may include highdose therapy, consolidation, or extended therapy administered after surgical or nonsurgical assessment Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, one additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease according to the following definition: Cytotoxic regimens include any agent that targets the genetic and/or mitotic apparatus of dividing cells, resulting in doselimiting toxicity to the bone marrow and/or gastrointestinal mucosa Note: Patients on this noncytotoxic study are allowed to receive one additional cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease, as defined above; however, due to the novel nature of biologic compounds, patients are encouraged to enroll on secondline noncytotoxic studies prior to receiving additional cytotoxic therapy Patients must have NOT received any noncytotoxic chemotherapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mcl, equivalent to CTCAE v3.0 grade 1 Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcl Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal (ULN), CTCAE v3.0 grade 1 Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN (CTCAE v3.0 grade 1) Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN (CTCAE v3.0 grade 1) Alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN (CTCAE v3.0 grade 1) Neuropathy (sensory and motor) less than or equal to CTCAE v3.0 grade 1 Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and authorization permitting release of personal health information Patients who have met the preentry requirements Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to the study entry and be practicing an effective form of contraception, and cannot be lactating; since interactions with the metabolism of oral contraceptives cannot be excluded, a barrier method of contraception must be used Patients must have tissue blocks from initial diagnosis available for submission to the GOG Tissue Bank Patients who had previous treatment with Gleevec^TM Patients with other invasive malignancies, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer, who had (or have) any evidence of other cancer present within the last 5 years or whose previous cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy Patients with signs or symptoms of bowel dysfunction or obstruction Patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin Patients with deep venous or arterial thrombosis (including pulmonary embolism) within six weeks of study entry Patients receiving therapeutic corticosteroids Patients with active or uncontrolled infection History of seizures or those patients receiving phenytoin, phenobarbital, or carbamazepine Patients with other severe concurrent disease, which the investigator feels may make the patients inappropriate for study entry Presence of clinically apparent central nervous system metastases, or other carcinomatous meningitis History of myocardial infarction within previous six months or congestive heart failure requiring therapy</criteria>
