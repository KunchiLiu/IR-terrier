	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known which docetaxel regimen is more effective for non-small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of two regimens of docetaxel in treating patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for unresectable stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Two Regimens of Docetaxel in Treating Patients Who Have Not Received Chemotherapy For Unresectable Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the effects of two different schedules of docetaxel on the incidence of grade 3 and 4 toxic effects in older or poor performance chemotherapy-na√Øve patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer. Secondary - Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the response rate in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the incidence of serious adverse events in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 2 courses during study treatment, and then at study completion. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2-3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 210-230 patients (105-115 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
