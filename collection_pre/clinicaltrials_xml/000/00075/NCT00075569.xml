	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development of cancer or to treat early cancer. SGN-00101 may be effective in preventing the development of cervical cancer in patients who have cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well SGN-00101 immunotherapy works in preventing cervical cancer in patients with grade III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SGN-00101 Immunotherapy in Treating Patients With Grade III Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the rate of regression at 4-7 months in patients with grade III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN III) treated with SGN-00101 immunotherapy. - Compare the rate of regression at 4-7 months with expected outcome in patients immunized with this vaccine. - Determine the toxic effects and recovery from possible toxic effects of this vaccine in these patients. Secondary - Determine induction of cell-mediated immune responses against human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 peptides before and after treatment in patients immunized with this vaccine - Correlate regression of disease with enhanced immunologic responses in patients immunized with this vaccine. - Correlate seropositivity of HPV-16 virus-like particles (VLP16) with vaccine-induced regression of CIN III in patients immunized with this vaccine. - Determine the efficacy of this vaccine in patients whose CIN III is associated with HPV-16 infection vs other HPV types. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. All patients receive SGN-00101 subcutaneously once monthly on months 1-3 (for a total of 3 vaccinations) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Group 1: Four months after the first vaccination, patients undergo therapeutic and diagnostic loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) or core biopsy. - Group 2: Six months after the first vaccination, patients undergo therapeutic and diagnostic LEEP or core biopsy. Patients in group 1 are followed at 12 months and patients in group 2 are followed at 14 months after the first vaccination. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients (36 for group 1 and 30 for group 2) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
