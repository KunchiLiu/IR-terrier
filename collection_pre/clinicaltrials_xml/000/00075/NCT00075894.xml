	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as alanosine, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of alanosine in treating patients with high-grade progressive or recurrent malignant gliomas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alanosine in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent Malignant Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of alanosine (SDX-102) with or without enzyme-inducible antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) in patients with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deficient high-grade progressive or recurrent malignant gliomas. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug administered concurrently with EIAEDs in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent anticonvulsant drug use (drugs that induce hepatic metabolic enzymes vs drugs that cause modest or no induction of hepatic metabolic enzymes OR no anticonvulsant drug). Patients receive alanosine (SDX-102) IV continuously for 5 days. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SDX-102 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 week and then every 2 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
