	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Valproic acid may help stop the growth of Kaposi's sarcoma cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying valproic acid in treating patients with HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Valproic Acid in Treating Patients With Kaposi's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety of valproic acid in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma. - Determine the effects of this drug on human herpes virus 8 (KSHV) gene expression using polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry in these patients. Secondary - Determine the effects of this drug on HIV, KSHV, and Epstein-Barr virus viral loads in the plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of these patients. - Determine clinical response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot, multicenter study. Patients receive oral valproic acid twice daily on days 1-28 followed by a drug taper over 2 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
