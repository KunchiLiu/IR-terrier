	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, open label, randomized study. Patients will be randomized to one of the following arms with an allocation ratio of 3:1, respectively: Arm A: CP-675,206 + neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NHT) OR Arm B: neoadjuvant hormone therapy. After randomization, patients will receive study treatment for three cycles (one cycle is defined as 28 days). After completion of three cycles, patients will undergo a prostatectomy and pathology assessments will be completed at a central laboratory, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) in Washington, DC.</brief_summary>
