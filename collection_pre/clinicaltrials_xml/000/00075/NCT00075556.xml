	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well neoadjuvant radiation therapy and capecitabine work in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for stage III or stage IV colorectal adenocarcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Radiation Therapy and Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Colorectal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with stage III or IV colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy and capecitabine. Secondary - Determine the tolerance profile of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the rate of preservation of functional integrity of the anal sphincter in patients treated with this regimen. - Compare the conversion rate from the effects of mutilating surgery vs surgery with sphincter preservation in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily and undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 days a week on weeks 1-5. Patients undergo surgery on week 6. Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study within 10 months.</detailed_description>
