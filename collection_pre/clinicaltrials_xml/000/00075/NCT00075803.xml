	<brief_summary>The study is designed as a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, prospective, comparative study of fluconazole versus voriconazole for the prevention of fungal infections in allogeneic transplant recipients. Recipients will be stratified by center and donor type (sibling vs. unrelated) and will be randomized to either the fluconazole or voriconazole arm in a 1:1 ratio.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Fluconazole vs Voriconazole to Treat Fungal Infections for Blood and Marrow Transplants (BMT CTN 0101)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Allogeneic blood and marrow transplant patients are highly susceptible to invasive fungal infection prior to engraftment, due to neutropenia and mucosal injury. After engraftment, an impairment of cell mediated immunity from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the use of aggressive immunosuppressive therapies, such as corticosteroids, leave patients vulnerable to invasive fungal infections. Recipients of alternate donor transplants are especially susceptible due to slow reconstitution of cell mediated immunity. Fluconazole prophylaxis in prospective randomized trials of both autologous and allogeneic transplant recipients has been demonstrated to reduce invasive fungal infections due to yeasts prior to engraftment. A prolonged course of fluconazole given during the first 75 days (to cover the early post-engraftment period of risk) is highly effective in the prevention of early and later yeast infections. This has translated into a survival benefit. A recent analysis of long-term outcomes of these individuals demonstrated a continuing benefit beyond the course of prophylaxis with a further benefit in survival. In another study of various factors associated with survival after matched unrelated donor transplants, fluconazole prophylaxis was an independent predictor for overall survival in a multivariate analysis. Fluconazole prophylaxis has been found to be effective and safe with few substantive drug interactions and has been widely adopted by transplant clinicians. DESIGN NARRATIVE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, prospective, comparative study of fluconazole versus voriconazole for the prevention of fungal infections in allogeneic hematopoietic transplant recipients and cord blood recipients in children under the age of 12. Prior to the start of the pre-transplant conditioning regimen, participants will give written informed consent and be screened for eligibility. Participants who meet all entry criteria will be assigned randomly to voriconazole or fluconazole within 72 hours of Day 0. Participants will begin the study drug on Day 0 (after completion of the conditioning regimen). Day 0 is defined as the day infusion of the stem cell product is completed. The study drug will be continued until Day 100 following transplant or until one or more criteria for early withdrawal are met. Continuation of the study drug beyond Day 100 is permitted for participants who meet specific criteria. The development of any fungal infection during prophylaxis will be classified according to the definitions listed in the protocol.</detailed_description>

Patients are eligible if colonized or have had superficial infection. Patients with a history of candidemia greater than 8 weeks prior to conditioning must have a negative blood culture within 14 days of conditioning (within 7 days is recommended), no clinical signs of candidemia, and may not still require antifungal therapy Presumptive, proven, or probable aspergillus or other mold infection or deep mycoses (including hepatosplenic candidiasis) within 4 months prior to conditioning regimen initiation Uncontrolled viral or bacterial infection at the time of study registration Pregnant or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing age must avoid becoming pregnant while receiving antifungal agents Karnofsky performance status less than 70% or Lansky status less than 50% for patients under 16 years old unless approved by the medical monitor or protocol chair History of allergy or intolerance to azoles (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole) Requiring therapy with rifampin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, cisapride (Propulsid®), terfenadine (Seldane®), astemizole (Hismanal®), ergot alkaloids, longacting barbiturates, or who have received more than 3 days treatment with rifampin or carbamazepine within 7 days prior to conditioning regimen initiation.
