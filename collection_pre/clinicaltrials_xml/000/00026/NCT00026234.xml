	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of hepatic arterial infusion plus chemotherapy in treating patients who have colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving the drugs in different combinations and different ways may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hepatic Arterial Infusion Plus Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Colorectal Cancer Metastatic to the Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and toxicity of hepatic arterial infusion with floxuridine and dexamethasone followed by systemic therapy with oxaliplatin and capecitabine in patients with surgically resected liver metastases from primary colorectal carcinoma. II. Determine the 2-year survival rate of patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the 2-year recurrence rate and time to recurrence in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive floxuridine and dexamethasone intra-arterially continuously on days 1-14, oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 22, and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 22-35. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of the fourth course, patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2.5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-75 patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months-3.25 years.</detailed_description>
