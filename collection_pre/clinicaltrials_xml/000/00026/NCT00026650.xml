	<brief_summary>Background: -This protocol acknowledges that it is in the interest of the NIH and ROB, as well as our patients, to continue to follow those who have been treated with radiotherapy at ROB and are not otherwise eligible for current active research protocols. it also provides a mechanism for the correlation and interpretation of disparatc data for research into the long term side effects and outcomes for a variety of disease entities and treatments, such as combined modality treatment, MoAb, PDT, radiation modifiers, intraoperative radiotherapy, etc. Objectives: -The objective of this protocol is to provide follow-up care for patients previously treated with radiotherapy in the Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) in order to assess the late effects of treatment and the natural history of disease. Eligibility: -Patients who received radiation therapy at the NCI IRB who are long-term survivors and are not currently entered on an active research protocol. Design: -This is a natural history protocol that will provide follow-up care for Radiation Oncology Branch patients and will allow for appropriate long-term follow up care and evaluation, including NIH consultation services as required. It will be made clear to patients in the consent form, that data collected in their follow-up may be used anonymously for publications concerning the natural history of disease processes and long term effects of treatment.</brief_summary>
