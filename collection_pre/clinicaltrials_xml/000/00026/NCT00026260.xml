	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapy with drugs such as SU5416 may stop the growth of cervical cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of SU5416 in treating patients who have persistent or recurrent cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SU5416 in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor cytostatic activity of SU5416, in terms of 6-month progression-free survival and time to progression, in patients with persistent or recurrent cervical squamous cell carcinoma. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Correlate surrogate endpoint molecular and imaging markers with clinical outcome in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 4. Treatment repeats weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-23 months.</detailed_description>
