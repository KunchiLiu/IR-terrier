	<brief_summary>Blood levels of the hormones estradiol and progesterone are of interest in evaluating ovarian function. However, because these hormone levels vary from day to day, blood samples must be taken very often or elaborately timed to specific phases of the menstrual cycle. A method has now been developed for measuring estradiol and progesterone levels in saliva. This study will test the accuracy of this method and examine whether salivary levels of these hormones change after treatment with raloxifene. Hormone levels will be measured during 3 menstrual cycles in women currently enrolled in the clinical study, "A Phase II Trial of Two Doses of Raloxifene in Women at Risk of Developing Invasive Breast Cancer." Participants will provide a saliva sample every morning for about a month during three collection periods-1 month before beginning raloxifene treatment, and 3 and 12 months after treatment starts. Patients will be given kits for collecting the samples and mailing them to the laboratory at the end of each collection period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Raloxifene on Hormone Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deviations from normal levels of serum E(2) and P are of interest in evaluating ovarian function. However, the day-to-day variations in these levels necessitates serial blood sampling or elaborate efforts to time blood draws within specific phases of the menstrual cycle. A noninvasive method for assessment of the levels of sex steroids on a daily basis using saliva has been developed. This study will assess the levels of estradiol and progesterone during 3 menstrual cycles (pre-drug and after 3 and 12 months of raloxifene therapy) in pre-menopausal women participating in a pilot chemoprevention trial of raloxifene.</detailed_description>
