	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel and ifosfamide in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel and Ifosfamide in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of docetaxel and ifosfamide as first-line chemotherapy in women with metastatic breast cancer. - Determine the response rate and duration of response of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the time to treatment failure and survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour (beginning 1 hour after docetaxel infusion) on days 1-3. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every month during study, and then every 3 months after completion of study. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-42 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
