	<brief_title>Hormone Replacement Therapy for Hot Flashes and/or Vaginal Symptoms in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Tamoxifen for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of hormone replacement therapy in managing hot flashes and menopausal vaginal symptoms in postmenopausal women with a history of node-negative invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast who are receiving adjuvant tamoxifen. - Determine the effect of this regimen on blood coagulation and lipid profiles in these patients. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior hysterectomy (yes vs no), symptom complex (vasomotor vs vaginal vs both), duration of hot flashes (less than 1 year or no hot flashes vs 1 year or more), and average daily number of hot flashes (less than 10 or none vs 10 or more). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients who have not undergone prior hysterectomy receive oral medroxyprogesterone once daily for 6 months. If, after 1 month, symptoms do not resolve, patients receive oral conjugated estrogens once daily in addition to medroxyprogesterone for 5 months. Patients who have undergone prior hysterectomy receive oral conjugated estrogens once daily for 6 months. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 6 months. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and months 1, 2, 3, and 6. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
