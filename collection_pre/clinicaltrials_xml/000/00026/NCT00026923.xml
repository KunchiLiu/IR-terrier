	<brief_summary>This study evaluates a system of remote supervision of laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery is performed through small holes in the abdomen called ports. A camera is passed through one port for visualization. Laparoscopic surgery requires an assistant to hold the camera and help the operating surgeon view the surgical field. The assistant camera holder may be a surgeon or a robotic arm. The robotic arm is usually controlled by the operating surgeon. In this study, a robotic arm holding the camera will be used, and will be controlled by a surgeon outside the operating room.</brief_summary>
