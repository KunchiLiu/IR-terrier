	<brief_title>Shark Cartilage in Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal or Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether the addition of powdered shark cartilage (BeneFinâ„¢) to standard therapy improves overall survival in patients with advanced colorectal or breast cancer. - Determine whether this therapy has any impact on toxicity in these patients. - Determine whether this therapy improves the quality of life in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease type (breast vs colorectal female vs colorectal male), age (49 and under vs 50-69 vs 70 and over), ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), baseline quality of life (UNISCALE rating less than 50% vs 50-75% vs more than 75%), and concurrent chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.</detailed_description>
