	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation in Treating Patients With Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the side effects of radiofrequency ablation in patients with bone metastases. - Determine the effect of this regimen on pain in these patients. - Determine the effect of this regimen on mood in these patients. - Determine the effects of narcotic usage in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the relationship between laboratory and imaging features of this treatment and the effects of the treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation directly to the metastatic lesion over approximately 12 minutes. Pain and mood are assessed at baseline, daily for 14 days after treatment, and at 1 and 3 months after treatment. Patients are followed at 1 week and then at 1 and 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 75 patients will be accrued for this study within 12.5 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant disease with a bone lesion that appears to be metastatic disease by clinical and/or imaging techniques Persistent intractable pain from a solitary site of bone metastases (greater than 5 on pain scale of 010) Bone metastasis must be amenable to radiofrequency ablation using a percutaneous CTguided approach Bone metastasis must be no greater than 8 cm No tumor mass in contact with hollow viscera No primary musculoskeletal malignancies, lymphoma, or leukemia No spinal metastases that do not have an intact cortex between the mass and the spinal canal and exiting nerve roots No tumor involving weightbearing long bone of lower extremity or impending fracture PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 21 and over Performance status: Not specified Life expectancy: Not specified Hematopoietic: Platelet count at least 70,000/mm^3 No uncontrolled coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis that cannot be corrected with fresh frozen plasma and platelets Hepatic: Not specified Renal: Not specified Cardiovascular: No pacemaker PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: At least 14 days since prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease No concurrent systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease during and for 14 days after study therapy Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: At least 30 days since prior radioisotopes for metastatic disease No concurrent systemic radioisotopes for metastatic disease Surgery: No surgical stabilization of tumor site with metallic hardware Other: Prior aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, antiplatelet medications, or warfarin must be discontinued for an appropriate period of time prior to study based on the drug's halflife and known antiplatelet activity (e.g., 7 days for aspirin and 24 hours for ibuprofen) At least 24 hours since prior low molecular weight heparin</criteria>
