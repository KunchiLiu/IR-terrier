	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together with low-dose radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage I or stage IIA Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Low-Dose Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage I or Stage IIA Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the freedom from progression in patients with stage I or IIA Hodgkin's lymphoma with a favorable prognosis treated with Stanford V-C chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vinblastine, prednisone, vincristine, bleomycin, and etoposide with low-dose radiotherapy. - Minimize the early and late effects of treatment in these patients by avoiding staging laparotomy and its consequences, limiting cumulative doses of chemotherapy, and reducing the dose of radiotherapy to moderately bulky sites of disease. - Assess early and late treatment-related toxicity, freedom from second disease progression, and overall survival at 5 and 10 years in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive Stanford V-C chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes weekly on weeks 1 and 5; doxorubicin IV and vinblastine IV over 5 minutes once weekly on weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7; oral prednisone every other day on weeks 1-8; vincristine IV and bleomycin IV over 5 minutes once weekly on weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8; and etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 2 of weeks 3 and 7. Beginning 2-3 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo low-dose radiotherapy 5 days a week for approximately 3 weeks. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.</detailed_description>
