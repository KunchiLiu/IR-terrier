	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the ability of exisulind to inhibit growth and development of duodenal adenomas in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. - Determine the effect on apoptosis in polyp vs mucosal tissue in these patients when treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral exisulind 4 times daily. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo 4 times daily. Treatment continues for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
