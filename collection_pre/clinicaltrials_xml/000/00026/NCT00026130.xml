	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients who have locally advanced pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall survival of patients with locally advanced non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with gemcitabine, fluorouracil, and radiotherapy. - Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the overall clinical response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-5 weekly for 6 weeks. Patients concurrently undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Three weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly on weeks 1-3. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.</detailed_description>
