	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who have untreated or relapsed Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of bortezomib, in terms of response rate, in patients with previously untreated or relapsed Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the time to progression, stable disease duration, and response duration in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks. Patients with complete or partial response or stable disease are followed every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5-2 years.</detailed_description>
