	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining imatinib mesylate with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining imatinib mesylate with irinotecan and cisplatin in treating patients who have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate and Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate when administered with irinotecan and cisplatin in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. - Determine the effect of imatinib mesylate on irinotecan metabolism by the cytochrome p450 system in these patients. - Determine the response rate, time to progression, and survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of imatinib mesylate. Patients receive irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily beginning on day 22 of course 1 and continuing until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
