	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: VEGF Trap may stop the growth of solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by stopping blood flow to the cancer. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of VEGF Trap in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VEGF Trap in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the long-term safety and tolerability of VEGF Trap in patients with incurable relapsed or refractory solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with stable or responding disease after receiving treatment on protocol MSKCC-01131. - Determine the biological effect of this therapy on suppressing tumor growth or progression in these patients. - Determine the steady state concentration of VEGF Trap over time in these patients. - Determine whether patients develop antibodies to this therapy during extended exposure. OUTLINE: This is an extension study for patients who showed evidence of stable disease or complete or partial remission after completing treatment on protocol MSKCC-01131. Patients continue to receive VEGF Trap subcutaneously once weekly for up to an additional 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive treatment at the same dose level as on protocol MSKCC-01131. Patients are followed at approximately 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
