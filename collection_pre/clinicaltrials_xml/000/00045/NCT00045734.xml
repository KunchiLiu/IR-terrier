	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in treating patients who have recurrent meningioma. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Recurrent Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of imatinib mesylate, in terms of 6-month progression-free survival, of patients with recurrent meningioma. II. Determine the response rate and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. III. Evaluate the safety profile of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. V. Determine the surrogate endpoints of angiogenic activity of this drug in these patients. VI. Correlate molecular abnormalities in the tumor with response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (yes vs no), histology (benign vs atypical or malignant), neurofibromatosis positivity (yes vs no), and preoperative candidacy (yes vs no). Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 8-12 months.</detailed_description>
