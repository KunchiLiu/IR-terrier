	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining UCN-01 with fludarabine in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphocytic lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma treated with UCN-01 and fludarabine. - Assess the molecular changes in CLL cells in peripheral blood in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of UCN-01. Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day 1 and fludarabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of UCN-01 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 18-46 additional patients receive UCN-01 and fludarabine as above at the recommended phase II dose. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this study within 6 months. A total of 18-46 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study within 9-23 months.</detailed_description>
