	<brief_title>Erlotinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma or Recurrent or Progressive Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib in patients with recurrent malignant glioma or recurrent or progressive meningioma. II. Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the 6-month progression-free survival, 12-month survival, and objective tumor response of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to study phase (I vs II), concurrent enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (yes vs no), histology (recurrent GBM vs recurrent anaplastic glioma vs recurrent meningioma vs stable GBM), preoperative candidacy (yes vs no), and concurrent steroids (yes vs no). Phase I: Patients concurrently receiving EIAEDs receive oral erlotinib once daily. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Phase II: Once the MTD is determined, additional patients concurrently receiving EIAEDs are treated with erlotinib as above at the phase II dose. Patients not concurrently receiving EIAEDs are treated with erlotinib as above at a predetermined dose. Patients are followed for survival.</detailed_description>
