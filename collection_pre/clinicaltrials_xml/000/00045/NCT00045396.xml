	<brief_summary>Tipifarnib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of tipifarnib in treating patients who have acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome in first complete remission</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Of The Farnesyltransferase Inhibitor ZANESTRA (R115777, NSC #702818, IND #58,359) In Complete Remission Following Induction And/Or Consolidation Chemotherapy In Adults With Poor-Risk Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) And High-Risk Myelodysplasia (MDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the duration of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) when ZARNESTRA is administered after intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy to adults with poor risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplasia (MDS) in first complete remission (CR). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the tolerability and toxicities of ZARNESTRA when administered in a chronic dosing schedule over a 48 week period to adults in first CR following intensive cytotoxic chemotherapies. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-15 months.</detailed_description>
