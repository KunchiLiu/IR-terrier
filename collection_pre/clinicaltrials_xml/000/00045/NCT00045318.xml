	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of exatecan mesylate in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors and kidney dysfunction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exatecan Mesylate in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and Kidney Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of exatecan mesylate in patients with advanced solid tumors and varying degrees of renal dysfunction. - Determine the dose-limiting and non-dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the effects of renal dysfunction on the plasma pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients. - Establish a model for dosing this drug in patients with impaired renal function. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to severity of renal dysfunction (normal vs mild vs moderate vs severe). Patients receive exatecan mesylate IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each renal dysfunction stratum receive escalating doses of exatecan mesylate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients in the normal renal function stratum do not undergo dose escalation. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients (6 normal, 9 mild, 12 moderate, and 18 severe renal dysfunction) will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.</detailed_description>
