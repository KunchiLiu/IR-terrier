	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying erlotinib hydrochloride to see how well it works in treating patients with advanced esophageal cancer or stomach cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of cancer by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Advanced Esophageal Cancer or Stomach Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride). II. Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the degree of dysphagia relief in patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this drug in these patients. V. Correlate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression with response to treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
