	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well ixabepilone works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixabepilone in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine any antitumor activity of ixabepilone, in terms of objective response rate, in patients with incurable, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior taxane therapy (yes vs no). Patients (with or without prior taxane exposure) receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. An additional cohort of 37 patients who have received prior taxane therapy are then accrued to receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 at a higher starting dose. For all patients, courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who receive more than 6 courses with satisfactory response may be treated every 4-5 weeks. Patients removed for unacceptable toxicty are followed periodically. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 105 patients (at least 74 with and 21 without prior taxane exposure) will be accrued for this study within 26 months.</detailed_description>
