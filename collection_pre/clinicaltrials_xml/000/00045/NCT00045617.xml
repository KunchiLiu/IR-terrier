	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy with vaccine therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy with vaccine therapy in treating patients who have limited-stage small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0122: Combination Chemotherapy, Radiation Therapy, and Vaccine Therapy in Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of cisplatin, etoposide, and thoracic radiotherapy followed by cisplatin, etoposide, monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine (TriAb), and monoclonal antibody GD2 anti-idiotype vaccine (TriGem), in terms of overall and progression-free survival of patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer. - Determine the immune response to each of the 2 anti-idiotype vaccines when used in this regimen in these patients. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial) in patients with measurable disease treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. - Induction therapy: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 29-33. Thoracic radiotherapy is administered 5 days a week, beginning on day 1 of chemotherapy, for 5 weeks. Patients then undergo radiotherapy boost for 1.5 weeks. Patients with stable disease or at least partial response proceed to consolidation therapy. - Consolidation therapy (begins within 3-5 weeks of the last dose of induction chemotherapy or radiotherapy): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 of weeks 11 and 14. Patients also receive monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine (TriAb) and monoclonal antibody GD2 anti-idiotype vaccine (TriGem) intradermally on day 1 of weeks 11, 13, 15, and 17 (4 injections) and then monthly subcutaneously for 2 years. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response after consolidation chemotherapy undergo cranial radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
