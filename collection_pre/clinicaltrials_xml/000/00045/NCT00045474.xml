	<brief_title>Brachytherapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of brachytherapy using an intracavitary applicator and liquid iodine I 125 in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. - Determine the acute and chronic toxicity of this therapy in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Within 3-21 days after surgical resection, patients receive brachytherapy using an intracavity balloon application (GliaSite) with iodine I 125 solution for a total of 5-7 days. Cohorts of 5-10 patients receive escalating doses of brachytherapy until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 10 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 2 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
