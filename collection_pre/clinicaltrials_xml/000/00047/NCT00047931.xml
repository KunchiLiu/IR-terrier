	<brief_summary>This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine against HIV and examine whether it induces an immune response to HIV. A vaccine is a substance given to try to create resistance or immunity to a disease or infection. The vaccine in this study is made from DNA (genetic material) of four HIV proteins called 'gag', 'pol', 'Nef', and 'Env'. Injected into a human, the viral DNA instructs the body to make small amounts of some HIV proteins. This study will see if the body then creates an immune response to these proteins. Study participants cannot catch HIV or AIDS from the DNA vaccine or any proteins made from it. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination and blood and urine tests. Women will also have a pregnancy test. Women enrolled in the study must either be infertile (e.g., due to menopause or hysterectomy) or must agree either to abstain from heterosexual sex or to practice birth control for at least 21 days before beginning the study and throughout its duration. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the experimental vaccine or a placebo (a salt solution that does not contain any active substance) and will be divided into three groups, based on their entry into the study. Of the first seven people enrolled (Group 1), five will receive a 2-mg dose of vaccine and two will receive placebo. If the vaccine is safe at this dose, then in Group 2, five people will receive a 4-mg dose of vaccine and two will receive placebo. If this dose is safe, then in Group 3, thirty people will receive an 8-mg dose of vaccine and six will receive placebo. All participants will receive three injections in an upper arm muscle-one injection a month for three months-with a needle-less device called a Biojector 2000Â® (Registered Trademark). At the time of each injection, participants will be observed for at least 1 hour after immunization. At home, they will record their temperature and any symptoms they may experience, including any effects at the injection site, for at least 7 days, or as long as the symptoms remain. If symptoms occur, participants will report them immediately to the clinic staff and, if necessary, come to the clinic for an examination. Participants will have about 10 clinic visits during the study. Most visits will last about 2 hours; those on vaccination days will last about 4 hours. ...</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HIV-1 Vaccine Test in Uninfected Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, dose-escalation study to examine tolerability, dose, and immune response of an HIV DNA plasmid vaccine. The hypothesis is that this vaccine will be safe for human administration and elicit immune responses to HIV. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in humans of VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP and secondary objectives are to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine and social impact of participating in an HIV-1 vaccine trial.</detailed_description>
