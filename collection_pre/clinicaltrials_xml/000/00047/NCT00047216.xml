	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of tipifarnib in treating patients who have recurrent bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tipifarnib in Treating Patients With Recurrent Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the 1-year recurrence-free survival rate of patients with stage 0 or I recurrent transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder treated with tipifarnib. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
