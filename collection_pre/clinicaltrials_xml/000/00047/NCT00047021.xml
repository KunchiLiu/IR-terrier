	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining cytarabine and mitoxantrone in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory leukemia or lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Leukemia or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine non-hematologic toxic effects of high-dose cytarabine and high-dose mitoxantrone in patients with recurrent or refractory leukemia or lymphoma. - Determine the in vitro T/NK lymphocyte proliferative responses to patient's leukemia/lymphoma cells before and after treatment with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive high-dose cytarabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and high-dose mitoxantrone IV over 15-30 minutes on day 5. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 14 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients who achieve at least stable disease or a response may receive a second course beginning at least 14 days after the first course is completed. Patients are followed for 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 2-3 years.</detailed_description>
