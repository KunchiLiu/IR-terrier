	<brief_title>Brief Integrative Therapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BIT integrates interpersonal, problem solving, affect regulation, and psychoeducational components. In this study, BIT is used to encourage women to focus on current issues and problems. The BIT therapist will help patients identify the impact of PTSD on their functioning, help them identify effective coping strategies for dealing with trauma-related distress, and encourage them to establish and maintain a certain degree of independence from the therapist. Patients receive 15 weekly sessions of BIT. Assessments occur pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at a 3-month follow-up, and include self-report measures, clinician administered PTSD scale questions, interviews, and evaluations of lifetime stressors.</detailed_description>
