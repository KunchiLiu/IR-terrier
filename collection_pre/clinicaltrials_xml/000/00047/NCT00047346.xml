	<brief_title>Erlotinib in Treating Patients With Unresectable Liver Cancer and Liver Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of OSI-774 in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with moderate liver dysfunction. II. Establish the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of OSI-774 in HCC patients with moderate liver dysfunction. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess possible anti-tumor effects of OSI-774 in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in terms of partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) as assessed by tumor shrinkage by RECIST criteria. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.</detailed_description>
