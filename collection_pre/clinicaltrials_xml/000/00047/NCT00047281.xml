	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Thalidomide and celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining thalidomide and celecoxib with etoposide and cyclophosphamide may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining thalidomide and celecoxib with etoposide and cyclophosphamide in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory malignant glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thalidomide, Celecoxib, and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of thalidomide, celecoxib, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide, in terms of 6-month progression-free survival, in patients with relapsed or refractory malignant glioma. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the radiographic response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-42, oral etoposide once daily on days 1-21, and oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 22-42. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients (32 with glioblastoma multiforme and 16 with anaplastic glioma) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
