	<brief_title>Exercise Training Program to Improve Clinical Outcomes in Individuals With Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: CHF affects approximately five million Americans and is the number one cause of hospital admission in individuals over the age of 65. Although exercise training improves several clinical measures in individuals with CHF (e.g., peak VO2, heart rate variability, and plasma norepinephrine levels), it is not known whether exercise training reduces mortality in individuals with CHF. DESIGN NARRATIVE: This multicenter randomized study will determine if exercise training reduces mortality and hospitalization rates in individuals with moderate to severe CHF. The secondary objective is to evaluate whether an exercise program designed for individuals with CHF improves quality of life and functioning, is economically advantageous, and prevents medical complications. Three thousand individuals with moderate to severe CHF will be randomly assigned to either standard medical therapy and education, or standard medical therapy and education plus a supervised exercise training program. The exercise training will include 36 supervised clinic-based training sessions followed by home-based exercise and periodic supervised sessions for reinforcement. Participants assigned to the supervised exercise training program will use either a treadmill or stationary bicycle, which will be provided for them. Recruitment Status: As of November 9, 2006, HF-ACTION has enrolled 2180 subjects and will conclude enrollment at the end of February, 2007, with an anticipated enrollment of approximately 2300 subjects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>LVEF less than or equal to 35% New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III, or IV CHF diagnosis in the 3 months prior to study entry, with a minimum of 6 weeks of treatment Must be on optimal heart failure therapy according to American Heart Association (AHA), American College of Cardiology (ACC), and Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) heart failure guidelines, including treatment with angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and betablocker therapy, or have documentation justifying why optimal therapy is not being used, including intolerance, contraindication, participant preference, or physician's judgment Must be on stable doses of medications (e.g., betablocker, ACEI, and additional medications as listed in the study guidelines) for 6 weeks prior to study entry Must be in stable medical condition and able to begin an exercise program, as determined by study physician Comorbid disease, behavioral limitations, or other limitations that would interfere with exercise training, or would prevent completion of 1 year of exercise training Pregnant or planning to become pregnant in the year following study entry Major heart event or heart procedure within the 6 weeks prior to study entry Heart procedure or hospitalization for any reason planned in the future Expecting to receive a heart transplant in the 6 months following study entry CHF caused by significant uncorrected primary valvular disease (except mitral regurgitation secondary to left ventricular dysfunction); if valve replacement has been performed, may not participate for 12 months following the procedure CHF caused by congenital heart disease or obstructive cardiomyopathy Performance of exercise training at regular intervals (more than once per week) at a moderate to vigorous intensity at any time in the 6 weeks prior to study entry Exercise testing results that would prevent safe exercise training, as defined by the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR) guidelines, including abnormal blood pressure response, early ischemic changes, and unexpected lifethreatening arrhythmia Use of fixedrate pacemakers, pacemakers with inability to attain target heart rates, or automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) devices with heart rate limits set below the target heart rate for exercise training Use of an intracardiac device such as an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or a cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker in the 6 months prior to study entry (must demonstrate stability for 6 weeks postprocedure) Primary physician considers placement of an intracardiac device such as an ICD or a cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker probable within 6 months of study entry; will be excluded until such device has been placed and 6 weeks of stabilization have passed Participation in another clinical trial that may interfere with study participation, followup, or data collection, or that may affect cardiovascular morbidity or mortality</criteria>
