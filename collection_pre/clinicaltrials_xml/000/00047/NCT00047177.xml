	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating children who have recurrent or refractory medulloblastoma, supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal or atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin in Treating Children With Recurrent or Refractory Medulloblastoma, Supratentorial Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor, or Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Estimate the objective response rate to oxaliplatin in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory medulloblastoma at first progression. - Estimate the objective response rate to oxaliplatin in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory medulloblastoma at second or later relapse. - Estimate the objective response rate to oxaliplatin in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor, or atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor. - Describe the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor type (medulloblastoma [measurable disease at first relapse vs positive cerebrospinal fluid or linear leptomeningeal disease vs measurable disease at second or later progression] vs supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor vs atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor). Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses (1 year) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5-2.8 years.</detailed_description>
