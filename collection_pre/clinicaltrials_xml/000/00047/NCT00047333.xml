	<brief_title>Erlotinib in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Cannot be Surgically Removed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess progression-free survival (PFS) measured at 16 weeks following initiation of once daily continuous oral therapy with OSI-774 in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess objective response rate, rate and duration of stable disease, time to progression, median and overall survival in this patient population, and any changes in tumor perfusion based on functional CT imaging. II. To correlate response with patient characteristics including: age, disease stage (TNM, Okuda [6]), viral hepatitis status, pathologic grade of cirrhosis, Childs-Pugh status, Performance Status, serum values of: alpha feto-protein, bilirubin, transaminases, albumin; EGFR expression score by IHC; and development of skin rash during therapy. III. To determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of OSI-774 in this patient population. IV. To determine the safety and tolerability of OSI-774 in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to epidermal growth factor receptor expression (low, 0-1+ vs high, 2-3+). Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months.</detailed_description>
