	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: UCN-01 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining UCN-01 with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining UCN-01 with irinotecan in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>UCN-01 and Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of UCN-01 and irinotecan in patients with advanced solid tumors, primarily lung, ovarian, and gastrointestinal tumors. - Determine the acute and chronic toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. - Determine, preliminarily, the anti-tumor effect of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day 1 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of UCN-01 and irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the recommended phase II dose. Patients are followed at 1 month. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-15 months.</detailed_description>
