	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of the drug Bevacizumab that can be given in combination with chemoradiation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The effect that this combination treatment has on the tumor will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Combined RHUMAB VEGF and Capecitabine-based Chemoradiation for Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study administers 50.4 Gy of radiation for unresectable pancreatic cancer with concurrent capecitabine and an experimental drug, Bevacizumab. The drug is an antiangiogenic agent (kills tumor blood vessels) and has been shown in preclinical models to enhance the antitumor effect of radiation and chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
