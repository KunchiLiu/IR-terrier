	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Thalidomide and celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and may increase the effectiveness of temozolomide by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining temozolomide, thalidomide, and celecoxib following radiation therapy in treating patients who have newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide, Thalidomide, and Celecoxib Following Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of adjuvant temozolomide, thalidomide, and celecoxib after radiotherapy, in terms of time to tumor progression and overall survival, in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5 and oral thalidomide once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
