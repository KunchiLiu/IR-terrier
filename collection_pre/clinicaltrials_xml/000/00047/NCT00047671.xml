	<brief_title>Ethnic Variations in Antidepressant Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depressed patients vary substantially in their responses to antidepressants. Genetic factors may account for a large part of these differences in response. This study will include both African Americans and Caucasians to examine the role of genetic factors in treatment response. Participants receive citalopram (Celexa) for 8 weeks and a placebo for 1 week. Visits occur once a week for 11 weeks. A variety of interviews, scales, tests, and questionnaires are used to assess participants.</detailed_description>
