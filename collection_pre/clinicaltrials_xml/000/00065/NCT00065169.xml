	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib can delay the onset of Alzheimer Disease (AD) in people with Age Associated Memory Impairment (AAMI). This study will also evaluate genetic risk and brain structure as potential predictors of mental decline.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Delaying Alzheimer Disease Symptoms With Anti-Inflammatory Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AD is one of the most common mental disorders of late life. Preliminary studies indicate that anti-inflammatory drugs may attenuate or prevent AD symptoms, but efficacy trials are needed. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either celecoxib or placebo for 18 months. Participants will undergo positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Routine laboratory blood tests, cognitive tests, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed. Participants will also be screened for Parkinson disease. Follow-up testing will be conducted at specific intervals following the study.</detailed_description>
