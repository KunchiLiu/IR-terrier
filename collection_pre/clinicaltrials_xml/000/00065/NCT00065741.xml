	<brief_summary>A series of clinical studies will be conducted in normal, healthy adult volunteers to evaluate the potential for alterations in the pharmacokinetics of anti HIV drugs when botanicals/nutriceuticals are given concurrently via the oral route. Both the drugs and botanicals are known to rely upon or to modulate, respectively, metabolism via glucuronidation.</brief_summary>
