	<brief_title>Efficacy of Acupuncture for Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 4-arm multi-site randomized controlled trial to clarify the extent to which various types of acupuncture needling can diminish the effect of chronic low back pain on patient functioning and symptoms. Reviews have noted the poor quality of research in this area and urged that scientifically rigorous studies be conducted. Recent higher quality trials suggest acupuncture is a promising treatment for back pain. This study directly addresses methodological shortcomings that have plagued previous studies. A total of 640 subjects (160 per arm) with low back pain lasting at least 3 months will be recruited from group model HMOs in Seattle, WA and Oakland, CA. They will be randomized to one of three different methods of stimulation of acupuncture or to continue usual medical care. Ten treatments will be provided over 7 weeks. The primary outcomes, dysfunction and bothersomeness of low back pain, will be measured at baseline, and after 8, 26, and 52 weeks by telephone interviewers masked to treatment. Analysis of covariance within an intention-to-treat context will be used to analyze the data. Because chronic back pain is a major public health problem and the top reason patients seek acupuncture treatment, a clear, unambiguous assessment is critical for making informed decisions about whether acupuncture should be included as part of conventional care for back pain or covered by insurance. Results of this study will provide the clearest evidence to date about the value of acupuncture needling as a treatment for chronic low back pain.</detailed_description>
