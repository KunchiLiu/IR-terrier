	<criteria>Inclusion: Histologically or Cytologically proven SCLC, CD 56+ small cell carcinoma of unknown origin, or CD56+ nonpulmonary small cell carcinoma Relapsed disease; defined as patients with an initial response (partial or complete) to firstline therapy, then relapse more than 3 months after completion of last chemotherapy. Patients must have received no more than 3 prior chemotherapy regimen. Patients must have measurable disease defined as: Lesions that can be measured in at least one dimension according to RECIST Predicted survival of 3 months or more Zubrod performance status 02 Patients must not have received chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 4 weeks of study entry, nor have planned surgery. Absolute neutrophils greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/l, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9g/dl and platelets greater than or equal to 100 x 10^9/l. Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal AST/ALT less than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal without liver metastases; less than or equal to 5 times the upper limit of normal with liver metastases and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. Patients must have normal thyroid function (patients receiving thyroxin replacement therapy who are biochemically euthyroid may be enrolled). Women of childbearing potential must provide a negative pregnancy test at screening and use adequate contraception in the opinion of the investigator, for the duration of study. Patients must be capable of understanding the nature of the trial and must give written witnessed informed consent prior to any screening procedure. Exclusion: Significant residual neurological or cardiac toxicity (grade 3 or 4) following previous chemotherapy Patients who are concurrently receiving other antineoplastic treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy including steroid therapy). Myocardial infarction within 6 months of study entry, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, uncontrolled arrythmia, severe aortic stenosis, a history of multiple sclerosis, or other demyelinating disease, EatonLambert Syndrome, history of hemorrhagic stroke, any CNS injury with residual neurologic deficit, ischaemic stroke within the last 6 months, current known herpes zoster (shingles), or cytomegalovirus infection, or a history of recurrent infections with these viruses, chronic alcoholism, serious concomitant infection, or any other concomitant illness considered significant enough to interfere with the study outcome. Other investigational agents must not be taken during the study or within 4 weeks of study entry. Previous monoclonal antibody therapy Patients must not have known central nervous system metastases Previous malignancy with &lt; 5 year disease free interval from the last therapeutic intervention, except for adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.
