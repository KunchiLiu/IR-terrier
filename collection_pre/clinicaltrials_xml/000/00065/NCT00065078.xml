	<brief_title>Providing Birth Control Through Home Health Visits</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unintended pregnancy is associated with significant public health problems, including inadequate prenatal care, low birth weight infants, infant mortality, and maternal morbidity and mortality. Children born as a result of unplanned pregnancies are at greater risk for poor outcomes such as poor mental health and developmental disabilities. This research project will determine whether providing contraception in the home can reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy in low income and minority women. The project will also determine whether delaying a pelvic exam encourages or discourages the utilization of clinic-based preventive services to screen for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and cervical cancer. Participants will be randomized to either an experimental group or a comparison group. Each participant will receive family planning counseling during a home visit by a community health nurse. Participants in the experimental group will be offered a three-month supply of oral contraceptives or a depo-provera shot; both forms of contraceptives will be delivered during home visits. Each participant will complete a survey during the initial visit and during a 1-year follow-up. The study will last approximately three years.</detailed_description>
