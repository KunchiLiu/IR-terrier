	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Written informed consent At least 18 years old Confirmed advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) Received one prior chemotherapy for metastatic NSCLC excluding TAXOTERE or HYCAMTIN. In addition, subjects are allowed to have previously received a noncytotoxic therapy, such as an endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) or angiogenesis inhibitor. Presence of either measurable or nonmeasurable disease by radiologic study or physical examination. Full recovery and at least 21 days from prior treatment for NSCLC; 42 days from treatment with mitomycin or nitrosureas and 30 days from prior noncytotoxic therapy. At least 3 weeks since last major surgery (a lesser period is acceptable if deemed in the best interest of the patient). At least 7 days since prior radiotherapy. A probable life expectance of at least 3 months. Adequate bone marrow reserve, CBC/Platelet, kidney and liver function. Exclusion criteria: Concomitant malignancies or other malignancies within the last five years. Symptoms of brain metastases requiring treatment with steroids. Active infection. Severe medical problems other than the diagnosis of NSCLC that would limit the ability of the subject to follow study guidelines or expose the subject to extreme risk. Ongoing or planned chemotherapy (other than treatment during this study), immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or investigational therapy for the treatment of NSCLC. Use of investigational drug within 30 days or 5 halflives prior to the first dose of study medication. Women who are pregnant or lactating. Subjects of childbearing potential refusing to practice adequate contraception. Prior treatment with or history of allergic reaction to either HYCAMTIN or TAXOTERE. Subjects who cannot receive steroid premedication.</criteria>
