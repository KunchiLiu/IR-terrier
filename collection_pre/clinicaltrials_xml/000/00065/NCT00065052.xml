	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if limiting television (TV) and computer time will result in a stabilization or smaller increase in body mass index (BMI), lower energy intake, and increased physical activity in 4-7 year old obese (&gt;85th BMI percentile) children over two years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modifying the Home Television Watching Environment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a positive correlation between obesity and television watching in adults and children. And, television watching, controlling for current obesity, is a predictor of future obesity. Almost half of all children watch 3 or more hours of television each day. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children watch no more than 1-2 hours each day. Families will be randomized to one of two conditions. Half the families will be taught to use the TV Allowance to reduce their child's TV and computer use by one-half over a six month period and the other half will use the device to monitor TV watching (control group). This study uses TV Allowance units to monitor home television watching, video game playing, and computer use. The TV Allowance can also be used to limit the amount of TV and computer use by programming it to allow a specific number of hours for each family member. Heights, weights, food intake, and physical activity will be measured at baseline and every six months. The purpose of this study is to determine if limiting television and computer time will result in a stabilization or smaller increase in BMI, lower energy intake, and increased physical activity in 4-7 year old obese (&gt;85th BMI percentile) children over two years.</detailed_description>
