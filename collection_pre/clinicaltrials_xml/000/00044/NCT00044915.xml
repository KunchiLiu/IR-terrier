	<criteria>Acute ischemic stroke of hemispheric localization (exclude brainstem and cerebellum), of suspected thromboembolic origin. Males or females aged 18 years or over. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) total score 8 to 23 with a motor deficit &gt;/= 2 (for either one arm or leg) and level of consciousness &lt; 2 and at least one of the following: Visual field deficit, neglect, or aphasia. If a patient receives tPA, NIHSS must be performed prior to receiving the study drug but after infusion of tPA is initiated. Signed informed consent from patient or legally authorized representative CT scan evidence of: Clearly defined areas of hypodensity indicating infarction of &gt;1/3 of the MCA territory or evidence of significant mass effect with shift of midline or major areas of sulcal effacement associated with loss of cortical definition (greywhite distinction). Minor early CT changes are common in MCA strokes and patients with early or subtle changes are eligible. A primary intracerebral haemorrhage or any finding not consistent with an acute ischemic stroke as the cause of presenting symptoms. Clinical evidence of acute stroke due to lacunar infarct (pure motor hemiplegia; pure sensory deficit, ataxia/clumsy hand syndromes) Neurological (other than the presenting stroke) or psychiatric conditions that may affect the patient's functional status and/or that may interfere with the patient's assessment Clinically relevant preexisting neurological deficit (Historical Rankin score &gt;/= 2 regardless of cause) Generalized seizures having developed since the onset of stroke symptoms Systolic blood pressure &gt; 210 or &lt; 110 mmHg (confirmed by up to three readings prior to randomization) Diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 or &lt; 60 mmHg (confirmed by up to three readings prior to randomization) Myocardial infarction within 3 months, unstable angina within 35 days prior to starting infusion, unstable supraventricular and/or ventricular arrhythmia, severe conduction defect (AV block grades 2 and 3), complete left or right Bundle Branch Block, bradycardia (heart rate [HR] less than 50 bpm), uncompensated heart failure History of myocarditis, cardiomyopathy or aortic stenosis Patients known to have prolonged QTc intervals (inherited and sporadic syndromes of QTc prolongation or QTc interval &gt; 450 msec males and 470 msec females on baseline ECG) or using Class IA or Class III antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, amiodarone, sotalol) Any patients that require initiation of new digoxin therapy are excluded. Patients already on digoxin therapy (for at least 1 month stable dose) at time of enrollment will be allowed in the study. Electrolyte imbalance at baseline. Should the results not be available before starting the study drug infusion, the patients will be allowed in the study providing that the corrective therapy of any abnormal electrolyte results is implemented immediately upon availability of the laboratory report. Any conditions predisposing to electrolyte imbalances (e.g., chronic vomiting, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa) will also be excluded at baseline. Participation in a research protocol for investigation of a pharmaceutical agent or innovative invasive procedure (including intraarterial tPA) within the past 30 days Previously in the BRAINStudy or treated with repinotan Life expectancy of less than 6 months due to comorbid conditions Any other known clinically significant medical disorder (e.g., cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, endocrine, major uncompensated metabolic disturbances, respiratory, immunological, hematological or bleeding disorder, cancer, AIDS)</criteria>
