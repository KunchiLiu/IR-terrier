	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of ethylene diamine tetra-acetic (EDTA) chelation therapy in individuals with coronary artery disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EDTA chelation therapy involves repeated administrations of a synthetic amino acid to reduce atherosclerotic plaque and other mineral deposits throughout the cardiovascular system. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 40 infusions of either the standard chelation solution or placebo. The primary endpoint of this trial will be a composite of all cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalization for angina. The results of TACT will provide either a significant positive result or an informative null result upon which rational clinical decision-making and health policy can be based.</detailed_description>
