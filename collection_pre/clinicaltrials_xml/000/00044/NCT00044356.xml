	<brief_title>Phase II Trial of Allovectin-7速 for Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment - If you take part in this trial you will be treated for about 10 weeks. You will receive an injection of Allovectin-7速 by needle, directly into one or more selected tumors once a week for the first six weeks. The injections may be given in a doctor's office. During a four-week observation period, your disease will be measured to see if the treatment is working. This will be done by general physical exams and scans (such as X-ray scans). Patients who show no sign of disease progression may be offered an option to repeat this treatment course.</detailed_description>
