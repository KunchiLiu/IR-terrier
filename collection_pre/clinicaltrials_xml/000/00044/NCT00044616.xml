	<brief_title>Relapse Prevention for Bipolar Type-II Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar II (BP II) disorder is characterized by a high recurrence of major depressive episodes (MDE), and it is associated with substantial illness and deaths. Unfortunately, relatively little attention has been given to treatment of BP II. Concern that patients may switch from depressed to manic states during treatment of MDE has impeded the development of effective treatments for BP II MDE. BP II MDE patients are treated initially with fluoxetine for 10 weeks. Patients who recover from MDE are then randomized to receive a relapse-prevention treatment of fluoxetine, lithium, a combination of fluoxetine and lithium, or placebo for 1 year. Patients undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations, including physical examinations, bloodwork, thyroid function tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), urinalysis, and HAM-D, YMR, CGI-S, CGI-I, and adverse events scales.
