	<brief_title>Switching Medication to Treat Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over the past several years, new, "atypical" antipsychotic medications have become available to treat schizophrenia with little information to guide prescribing for relatively stable outpatients. Participants will be randomly assigned to either continue taking their current medications for schizophrenia, or to switch to a new medication. Participants assigned to switch to a new medication will begin receiving either olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), quetiapine (Seroquel), or aripiprazole (Abilify), depending on what they are currently taking. Participants currently taking a single oral medication will switch to olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, quetiapine, or aripiprazole. Participants currently taking a single conventional injectable will begin taking long-acting injectable risperidone (Risperdal Consta). Participants currently taking two antipsychotic medications will begin taking only one of the medications they are currently using. Participants will stay on their assigned treatment for 6 months, after which time the participant's prescribing psychiatrist will advise the participant on which medication should be used. Study participants are interviewed at study start and at follow-up visits for 1 year.</detailed_description>
