	<brief_summary>Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor that has been marketed in the US for the treatment of hypertension since 1991. It has been shown to be effective in reducing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults when used once daily. ACE inhibitors are frequently used to treat hypertension in children, however ramipril has not been extensively tested in children, and information regarding the efficacy and safety would therefore be of benefit to children. This study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ramipril in the treatment of hypertension in children ages 6 through 16 years.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In adults, common side effects include persistent dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, and headache. Rare cases of angioedema have been reported. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, ACE inhibitors can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. When pregnancy is detected, ramipril should be discontinued as soon as possible. Ramipril is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to the product or have a history of angioedema related to previous treatment with an ACE inhibitor.</detailed_description>

Currently receiving more than one antihypertensive medication including: ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics. Receiving lithium, potassium supplements, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or major tranquilizers (Note: Stimulant medications for behavioral disorders, corticosteroids, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents for chronic pain management are permitted during the trial provided the subject's dosage is anticipated to remain unchanged throughout the duration of the study.)
