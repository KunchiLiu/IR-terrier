	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as SB-715992, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well SB-715992 works in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent malignant melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SB-715992 in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of SB-715992, in terms of response rate, in patients with previously untreated metastatic or recurrent malignant melanoma. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the early progression rate and response duration in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Correlate pharmacokinetics with safety and efficacy endpoints of this drug in these patients. - Correlate β-tubulin and kinesin spindle protein expression in tumor tissue with clinical outcomes in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study. Patients receive SB-715992 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients are followed at 4 weeks after completion of protocol therapy. Patients with ongoing complete response, partial response, or stable disease are followed every 3 months thereafter until relapse. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-14 months.</detailed_description>
