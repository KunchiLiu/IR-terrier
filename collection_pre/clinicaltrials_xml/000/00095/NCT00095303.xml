	<detailed_description>Adolescent drug abuse continues to be one of the most pressing public health issues in the United Statesâ€”our nation's teenagers continue to use illicit drugs at a worrisome rate. Broad reviews of the treatment outcome literature indicate that family interventions in general, and Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) in particular, are effective with drug using youth. This study is designed to compare BSFT to treatment as usual (TAU). The researchers believe that BSFT will be much more effective than TAU in reducing adolescent drug use. They will also examine which of these treatment approaches does a better job of engaging adolescents and family members in treatment, decreasing problem behaviors, decreasing sexually risky behaviors, increasing pro-social activities (e.g., school, work), and improving the functioning of the family. With the addition of the extended follow up, we have the opportunity to examine the sustainability of study outcomes into early adulthood, filling a gap in the treatment research literature about the long-term effects of adolescent substance abuse treatment. The follow up study examined the long term effectiveness of BSFT compared to TAU in the rates of substance use, number of arrests and externalizing behaviors, in youth who received study treatments at the time when they were adolescents.</detailed_description>
