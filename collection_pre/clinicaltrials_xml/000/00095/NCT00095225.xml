	<brief_summary>This Phase II, multicenter, randomized trial is designed to make preliminary evaluations of the efficacy of combining bevacizumab with chemotherapy (docetaxel or pemetrexed) or Tarceva relative to chemotherapy (docetaxel or pemetrexed) alone in patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC.</brief_summary>
