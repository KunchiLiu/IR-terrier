	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures such as microsatellite analysis of sediment in the urine may improve the ability to detect bladder cancer without invasive procedures. PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to study the effectiveness of microsatellite analysis of sediment in the urine in detecting bladder cancer in healthy participants, participants who have genitourinary conditions requiring cystoscopy, and patients who have bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microsatellite Analysis of Urinary Sediment in Detecting Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the sensitivity and specificity of microsatellite analysis (MSA) of urine sediment with cystoscopy and urine cytology for detecting bladder cancer in participants undergoing cystoscopy. Secondary - Determine the temporal performance characteristics of MSA in urine sediment from these participants. - Determine which of the 15 individual markers or combination of markers that make up the MSA test are most predictive of the presence of bladder cancer in these participants. OUTLINE: This is a single-blind, multicenter, cohort study. Urine and blood specimens are collected from all participants at baseline. Urine specimens are examined using microsatellite analysis, urine cytology, and urinalysis. Patients in groups 2 and 3 also undergo cystoscopy at baseline. Patients in group 3 undergo cystoscopy, upper tract imaging (e.g., abdominal CT scan), microsatellite analysis, urine cytology, and urinalysis every 3 months for 2 years in the absence of progressive disease. Microsatellite analysis, which identifies loss of heterozygosity using polymerase chain reaction technique, is conducted for 15 markers: D4S243, D21S1245, FGA, D17S695, D16S476, D9S171, IFN-A, D20S48, D13S802, D17S654, D16S310, THO1, D9S162, D9S747, and MBP. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 participants (100 each for groups 1 and 2 and 300 for group 3) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
