	<brief_title>Lumbar Interbody Fusion Using the Telamon® Peek™ Versus the Telamon® Hydrosorb™ Fusion Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lumbar spinal fusion is commonly performed as a "last resort" in patients with chronic low back pain caused by degenerative changes and instability of the spine. The surgical treatment involves the removal of an intervertebral disc, and subsequently the union of the two adjacent intervertebral bodies, such that a bony connection is formed within time after surgery. Lumbar spinal fusion is being performed with increasing frequency. Many interbody fusion methods have been described. In recent years, several types of fusion cages have been developed. These cages are made of various materials: titanium, stainless steel, carbon fiber or polyethylethylketone (Peek). Fusion cages have been quickly integrated into orthopedic practice. To date, no studies have been conducted that compare the efficacy of nonresorbable and bioresorbable fusion cage devices. In this study the surgical and clinical outcomes are compared of patients with degenerative lumbar spine disorders who undergo lumbar fusion with a nonresorbable versus a bioresorbable fusion cage. Patients with lumbar spinal disorders will be recruited from several European centers and randomly allocated to one of the two intervention groups. In both treatment groups lumbar spinal fusion is performed using a standardized technique. Patients will be evaluated during two years post-operatively. During this follow up period, the clinical outcome and fusion parameters will be assessed.</detailed_description>
