	<brief_summary>Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. This phase II trial is studying how well ixabepilone works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixabepilone in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial adenocarcinoma treated with ixabepilone. II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed endometrial adenocarcinoma Recurrent or persistent disease Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required Not amenable to management with any of the following: Surgery Radiotherapy Higher priority or standard chemotherapy Measurable disease At least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion ≥ 20 mm by conventional techniques (e.g., palpation, plain xray, CT scan, or MRI) OR ≥ 10 mm by spiral CT scan At least 1 target lesion Tumors within a previously irradiated field are designated as nontarget lesions Disease in an irradiated field as the only site of measurable disease is acceptable as a target lesion only if there has been clear progression of the lesion at least 90 days after completion of radiotherapy Received 1, and only 1, prior chemotherapy regimen (e.g., highdose therapy, consolidation, or extended therapy administered after surgery or nonsurgical assessment) for management of endometrial adenocarcinoma Ineligible for a higher priority Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocol (e.g., any active GOG phase III study for the same patient population) Performance status GOG 02 Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm^3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm^3 Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) AST (aspartate aminotransferase) ≤ 2.5 times ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN Sensory or motor neuropathy ≤ grade 1 Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception No active infection requiring antibiotics No other invasive malignancies within the past 5 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer At least 3 weeks since prior biologic or immunologic agents directed at the malignant tumor One prior noncytotoxic* (biologic or cytostatic) regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease allowed See Disease Characteristics Prior paclitaxel or docetaxel allowed Recovered from prior chemotherapy No more than 1 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen (either single or combination drug therapy) No prior ixabepilone At least 1 week since prior hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor Continuation of hormone replacement therapy allowed See Disease Characteristics Recovered from prior radiotherapy Recovered from prior surgery At least 3 weeks since other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor No prior cancer treatment that contraindicates study therapy</criteria>
