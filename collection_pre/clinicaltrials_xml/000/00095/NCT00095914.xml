	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and ABI-007, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining paclitaxel with ABI-007 may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel with ABI-007 in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel and ABI-007 in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine whether a change in the formulation alters the pharmacokinetic profile of paclitaxel in the plasma of patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors treated with ABI-007 and paclitaxel. Secondary - Correlate pharmacokinetic data of this regimen with decrease in the neutrophil count at nadir in these patients. - Determine the intra- and interindividual pharmacokinetic variability of ABI-007 in these patients. - Determine protein binding of paclitaxel via measurement of α-1-acid glycoprotein and serum albumin levels in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, pilot study. - Courses 1 and 2: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and ABI-007 IV over 30 minutes on day 22. - Arm II: Patients receive ABI-007 IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 22. - Courses 3 and beyond: All patients receive ABI-007 IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
