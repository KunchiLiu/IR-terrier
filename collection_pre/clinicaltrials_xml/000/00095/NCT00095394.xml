	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical research is to learn if severe hypertension can be better controlled by initially treating with a combination of drugs (Irbesartan/HCTZ), in patients who are unlikely to achieve blood pressure (B/P) control with only one drug. In addition, the study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drugs.</brief_summary>
