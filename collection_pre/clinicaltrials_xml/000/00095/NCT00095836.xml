	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gefitinib in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer that did not respond to iodine therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Thyroid Cancer That Did Not Respond to Iodine Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the all-measurable-disease response rate in patients with iodine-refractory locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer treated with gefitinib. Secondary - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically confirmed thyroid cancer Metastatic or locally advanced disease Not amenable to OR unresponsive or refractory to local therapy and/or radioactive iodine, depending on cell type Medullary and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas are considered unresponsive on the basis of histology alone Welldifferentiated papillary or follicular thyroid carcinomas are considered refractory if there is no evidence of uptake on radioactive iodine scanning OR the tumor progresses despite treatment with radioactive iodine Measurable disease PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age 18 and over Performance status ECOG 02 Life expectancy Not specified Hematopoietic Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm^3 Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm^3 Hepatic AST or ALT ≤ 3 times normal Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times normal No unstable or uncompensated hepatic disease Renal Creatinine ≤ Common Toxicity Criteria grade 2 No unstable or uncompensated renal disease Cardiovascular No unstable or uncompensated cardiac disease Pulmonary No clinically active interstitial lung disease Chronic, stable, asymptomatic radiographic changes allowed No unstable or uncompensated respiratory disease Other No known severe hypersensitivity to gefitinib or any of its excipients No other severe or uncontrolled systemic disease No other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that would preclude study participation Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy Not specified Chemotherapy No concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy Not specified Radiotherapy See Disease Characteristics No concurrent localregional radiotherapy to a primary disease site No concurrent radiotherapy to a bony or CNS metastasis Surgery Completely healed after prior oncologic or other major surgery Other Recovered from all prior anticancer therapy More than 30 days since prior nonapproved or investigational drugs No concurrent use of any of the following agents: Phenytoin Carbamazepine Barbiturates Rifampin Phenobarbital Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) Systemic retinoids Cyclosporine Verapamil Diltiazem Nicardipine Nifedipine Nitrendipine Erythromycin Theophylline Ketoconazole Itraconazole Antihistamines (e.g., terfenadine or astemizole) No concurrent grapefruit or grapefruit juice No other concurrent systemic anticancer treatment</criteria>
