	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of picibanil sclerotherapy in children with macrocystic lymphangioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Picibanil (OK432) Sclerotherapy in Children With Macrocystic Lymphatic Malformations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior treatment (no prior treatment vs prior surgical treatment) and geographic area. Patients who meet all study criteria are put in the "Immediate Treatment Group." Patients receive an intralesional injection of picibanil (OK432) with the aid of ultrasonography or transillumination for localization of cysts. Treatment repeats every 6-8 weeks for a total of up to 4 injections. After completion of treatment, patients are followed at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Completion date provided represents the completion date of the grant per OOPD records</detailed_description>
