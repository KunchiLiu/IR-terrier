	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: LMB-9 immunotoxin can locate tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells. This may be an effective treatment for advanced pancreatic, esophageal, stomach, colon or rectal cancer. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of LMB-9 immunotoxin in treating patients who have advanced pancreatic, esophageal, stomach, colon, or rectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LMB-9 Immunotoxin in Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic, Esophageal, Stomach, Colon, or Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity of LMB-9 immunotoxin in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the colon, rectum, pancreas, esophagus, or stomach with overexpression of the Lewis-Y antigen. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients. - Determine the clinical response of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive LMB-9 immunotoxin IV continuously on days 1-5. Patients with stable or responding disease after completion of the first course receive additional courses every 4-5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of LMB-9 immunotoxin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 weeks and then every 2 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.</detailed_description>
