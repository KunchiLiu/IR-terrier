	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Gemcitabine may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy after surgery may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine with radiation therapy in treating patients who have undergone surgery to remove cancer of the pancreas.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the time to disease progression, local control, and survival of patients with previously resected pancreatic cancer treated with adjuvant gemcitabine and radiotherapy. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, 29, and 32 and undergo radiotherapy on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-38 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning at least 4 weeks after chemoradiotherapy, patients without disease progression and with less than 10% weight loss during study receive additional gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 2 courses. Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 6 months and then every 3 months for up to 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.2 or 3.4 years.</detailed_description>
