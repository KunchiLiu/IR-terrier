	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and 1-year event-free survival in patients with severe autoimmune hematologic disease treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of High-Dose Cyclophosphamide in Patients With Severe Autoimmune Hematologic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide IV on days 1-4 and filgrastim (G-CSF) starting on day 10 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
