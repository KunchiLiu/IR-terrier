	<brief_title>Cost-Effectiveness of and Long-Term Outcomes Following Acupuncture Treatment for Osteoarthritis of the Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis (OA) makes up a large proportion of the disability and economic costs in the U.S. The knee is the most common site of OA and is a common cause of disability and the leading indication of total knee replacement in the elderly. There are presently no curative therapies for OA. Recently, increased attention has focused on the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies, such as acupuncture, especially for patients who have failed to respond to more standard therapy. Little is known of the long-term health services utilization and outcomes of patients with knee OA. This study will evaluate the cost effectiveness and overall outcomes of acupuncture for OA treatment. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either acupuncture or placebo. Surveys and questionnaires will be used to assess participants. Data will be collected on the short- and long-term utilization of health services as well as on pain and physical function.</detailed_description>
