	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known which regimen of radiation therapy is more effective for prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of different regimens of radiation therapy in treating patients who have localized prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Radiation Therapy Regimens in Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the 5-year survival rate, in terms of clinical and biological remission, in patients with localized prostate cancer treated with two different radiotherapy regimens using different doses and number of fractions. II. Compare the nadir of PSA and the delay in obtaining the nadir in patients treated with these two regimens. III. Compare acute and long-term toxicity of these two regimens in these patients. IV. Compare overall survival and quality of life in patients treated with these two regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive radiotherapy to the seminal vesicles at 46 Gy in 23 fractions and to the prostate at 70 Gy in 35 fractions, with 5 fractions per week. Arm II: Patients receive radiotherapy to the seminal vesicles as in arm I and to the prostate at 80 Gy in 40 fractions, with 5 fractions per week. Treatment continues in both arms in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed annually. Patients are followed every 4 months for a minimum of 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 306 patients (153 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.</detailed_description>
