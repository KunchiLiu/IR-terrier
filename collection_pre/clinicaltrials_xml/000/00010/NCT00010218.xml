	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of karenitecin in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-small cell lung cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Karenitecin in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients with relapsed or refractory non-small cell lung cancer treated with karenitecin as salvage chemotherapy. - Determine the effect of prior response to chemotherapy on response to this drug in these patients. - Determine survival and failure-free survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to response to prior chemotherapy (relapsed vs refractory). Patients receive karenitecin IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease after 6 courses may receive 2 additional courses beyond best response. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 45 patients (25 for stratum I and 20 for stratum II) will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
