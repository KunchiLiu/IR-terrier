	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and may be an effective treatment for recurrent glioma and meningioma. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in treating patients who have progressive, recurrent, or unresectable malignant glioma or meningioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma or Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate in patients with recurrent malignant glioma or meningioma. - Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug, with or without concurrent enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs), in these patients. (Stratum of patients currently taking EIAEDs closed to accrual as of 05/15/2003 for phase I and phase II) - Determine angiogenic activity in vivo using functional neuro-imaging studies and in vitro with assays of serum angiogenic peptides. - Determine the efficacy of this drug, in terms of 6-month progression-free survival and objective tumor response, in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug use (yes [stratum closed to accrual as of 05/15/2003 for phase I and phase II] vs no). - Phase I (patients with glioma or meningioma) Patients in cohorts 1 and 2 receive oral imatinib mesylate (STI571) once daily on days 1-28. Patients in cohorts 3-5 receive oral STI571 twice daily on days 1 and 3-28 of the first course and on days 1-28 of subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of STI571 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase II (patients with glioma) (glioblastoma multiforme patients excluded as of 05/15/2003) Patients receive oral STI571 at the MTD determined in phase I, 1-2 times daily for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study within 6 months and a total of 39 patients will be accrued for phase II of the study within 6-8 months. (Glioblastoma multiforme patients excluded from phase II as of 05/13/2003).</detailed_description>
