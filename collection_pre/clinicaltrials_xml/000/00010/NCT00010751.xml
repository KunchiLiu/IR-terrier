	<brief_title>Effects of Reiki on Painful Neuropathy and Cardiovascular Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of coronary heart disease(CHD) in type II diabetes is currently at least 20% in subjects 65 years and older. Numerous data suggest that hyperglycemia may be an independent risk factor for macrovascular complications. Diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN) affects 5-50% of patients with diabetes and is exacerbated by poor glycemic control. DPN is characterized by acute functional abnormalities in nerve fibers followed by chronic nerve fiber loss and blunted nerve fiber regeneration. Symptoms include tingling and burning sensations in the calves, ankles and feet. Pharmacological treatment of diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) and DPN include tricyclic antidepressants, which are cardiotoxic and have a low efficacy rate. The ADA recommends the utilization of diet and exercise as the primary means of glycemic control, and therefore of DPN. Because of the increased levels of extremity pain, patients with DPN are less likely to include exercise as a part of their health regimen. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) commonly complicates diabetes and has been invoked as a cause of sudden death in diabetic patients. The excess cardiac mortality in diabetics appears to be augmented by the presence of DAN in patients with advanced deficits in sympathetic cardiovascular enervation which may augment cardiac arrhythmogenesis. An bio-energy modality known as Reiki is an energy manipulation technique similar to Therapeutic Touch, a hands-on modality familiar in nursing for the relief of chronic pain, as well as accelerate healing in full thickness dermal wounds. The study approach is to apply Reiki to patients with DPN +/- DAN in a semi-double blind, randomized, crossover study to ascertain if glycemic control and cardiac autonomic function are improved in these patients. Outcome measures will include HBA1c values, the McGill-Melzack Pain Questionnaire, and a quality of life questionnaire. Participants will also be tested as to their ability to tolerate exercise by a 6 minute walk test. This study will help elucidate whether an bio-energy technique can reduce pain levels, improve glycemic control by increasing exercise tolerance and improve cardiac autonomic function, both major contributors to CHD mortality.</detailed_description>
