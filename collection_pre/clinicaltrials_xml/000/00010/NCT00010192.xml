	<brief_summary>Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Combining rituximab with interleukin-2 may kill more cancer cells. Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab plus interleukin-2 in treating patients who have hematologic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Plus Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of rituximab followed by low-dose and intermediate-dose pulse interleukin-2 (IL-2) in patients with CD20-positive B-cell lymphoid malignancy. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intermediate-dose pulse IL-2 in this patient population. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of intermediate-dose pulse aldesleukin. Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients then receive low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) on days 29-39, 43-53, 57-67, and 71-81, and intermediate-dose aldesleukin SC on days 40-42, 54-56, 68-70, and 82-84. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of intermediate-dose pulse aldesleukin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
