	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer that has not responded to gemcitabine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide in Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Has Not Responded to Gemcitabine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response rate to arsenic trioxide in patients with pancreatic cancer who have progressed after first-line treatment with a gemcitabine-containing regimen when treated with arsenic trioxide. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the duration of response, median and overall survival, and time to progression in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-12 months.</detailed_description>
