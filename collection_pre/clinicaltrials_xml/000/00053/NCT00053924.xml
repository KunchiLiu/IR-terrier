	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perifosine in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perifosine in Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of perifosine, in terms of 6-month survival, in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. - Determine median survival time and the 1-year survival rate of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the objective response rate (partial and complete), response duration, and time to progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral perifosine daily for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months.</detailed_description>
