	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining irinotecan with cytarabine in treating patients who have refractory or recurrent acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan and Cytarabine in Treating Patients With Refractory or Recurrent Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the activity of irinotecan and cytarabine in patients with refractory or recurrent acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast transformation. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan in this regimen in these patients. - Correlate the clinical activity of this drug with cellular endpoints associated with DNA synthesis inhibition, DNA repair, induction of apoptosis, and drug resistance in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of irinotecan. Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes and cytarabine IV over 60 minutes on days 1-6. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 9 patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and 9 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast transformation are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.</detailed_description>
