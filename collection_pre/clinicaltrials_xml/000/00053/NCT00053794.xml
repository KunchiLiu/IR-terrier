	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perifosine in treating patients who have metastatic or locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perifosine in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Locally Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of perifosine, in terms of response rate and duration of response, in patients with untreated metastatic or locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the early progression rate in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, non-blinded, multicenter study. Patients receive a loading dose of oral perifosine twice on day 1 and then once daily on days 2-21 for the first course. For all subsequent courses, patients receive a loading dose of oral perifosine once on day 1 and then once daily on days 2-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for 1 month. Patients with stable or responsive disease are followed every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
