	<brief_title>Vaginal Changes and Sexual Function in Patients With Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Obtain estimates of changes in vaginal length, perceived vaginal elasticity, perceived vaginal lubrication, and sexual activity, response, and satisfaction among patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer. - Compare these differences between the patients in the two treatment groups in GOG-0201. - Determine the relationships between vaginal dilation activities and vaginal length changes in these patients. - Determine the association between smoking and vaginal length and between smoking and vaginal dryness in these patients after therapy for cervical cancer. - Assess the extent of subject interest in and preferred methods of sexual counseling related to problems resulting from treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: Vaginal length is measured using Vaginal Sound, a modified plastic vaginal dilator. The data about vaginal elasticity and lubrication and sexual activity, response, and satisfaction are obtained from patient self-report, as well as vaginal dilation activities. Measurement and assessments are taken before treatment and then at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 150 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
