	<brief_title>Research Study in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Epithelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Utilize array comparative genomic hybridization and Taqman analyses, a quantitative genomic polymerase chain reaction, to validate the observation that a gain in chromosome 8q is predictive of shorter progression-free survival in patients with primary grade 2 or grade 3 advanced serous papillary ovarian cancer. II. Utilize these analyses to determine whether a gain in chromosome 8q is predictive of worse overall survival in these patients. III. Utilize these analyses to determine whether other previously identified chromosomal changes (3q gain, 7q gain, 16q loss, and 17pter-q21 loss) predict outcome in these patients and the association between these changes and clinical characteristics. IV. Utilize these analyses to identify up to 5 additional chromosomal changes and their association that may predict outcome (progression-free and overall survival) in these patients. OUTLINE: Genomic DNA is isolated from optimal cutting temperature (OCT)-embedded tissue and analyzed using comparative genomic hybridization. The chromosomal changes identified by this method are compared to those identified using the Taqman method, a quantitative genomic polymerase chain reaction analysis. Chromosome 8q is of specific interest. Other chromosomal changes may be detected in chromosomes 3q, 7q, 16q, and/or 17pter-q21.</detailed_description>
