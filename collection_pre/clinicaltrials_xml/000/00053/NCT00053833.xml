	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating patients who have refractory ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0025 Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Refractory Ovarian Epithelial, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial response rates of patients with platinum- and taxane-refractory ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer treated with irinotecan. - Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
