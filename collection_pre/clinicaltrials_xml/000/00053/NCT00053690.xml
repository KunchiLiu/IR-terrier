	<brief_title>Treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in Patients With Other Mental Illnesses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the progress in treating PTSD in the general population and the elevated prevalence of PTSD in people with severe mental illness (SMI), there are no empirically validated treatments designed for patients with comorbid PTSD. The cognitive behavioral treatment provided in this study may improve knowledge of PTSD, decrease distorted beliefs, reduce PTSD symptoms, and improve quality of life. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either a cognitive behavioral treatment plus standard care for SMI or standard care alone. The cognitive behavioral treatment incorporates several common features, including psychoeducation, relaxation training, and cognitive restructuring. Standard care for SMI includes medication, case management, and psychosocial treatment. PTSD, psychiatric symptoms, health, quality of life, and substance abuse outcomes are measured. Participants' knowledge of PTSD and beliefs about the world are also measured. Participants are assessed at baseline, post-treatment (16 weeks), and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups.
