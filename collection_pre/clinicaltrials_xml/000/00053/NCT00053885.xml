	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: PTK787/ZK 222584 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of PTK787/ZK 222584 in treating patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PTK787/ZK 222584 in Treating Patients With Unresectable Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of PTK787/ZK 222584, in terms of 3-month progression-free survival, in patients with malignant mesothelioma. - Determine the response rate in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the overall and failure-free survival of patients treated with this drug. - Correlate pretreatment circulating serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor, and VEGF mRNA isoforms with response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral PTK787/ZK 222584 daily. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
