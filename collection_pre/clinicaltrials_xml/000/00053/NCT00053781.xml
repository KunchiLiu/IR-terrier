	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perifosine in treating patients who have metastatic or recurrent malignant melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perifosine in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of perifosine, in terms of response rate, in previously untreated patients with metastatic or recurrent malignant melanoma. - Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral perifosine daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) receive 2 additional courses after documentation of CR or stable PR (i.e., no further tumor shrinkage). Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
