	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating patients who have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer that has responded to previous chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thalidomide in Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effect of thalidomide on time to disease progression and survival in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer who achieve a complete or partial response to induction chemotherapy. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive oral thalidomide daily beginning 3-4 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy. Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 18 months.</detailed_description>
