	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine in treating patients who have advanced colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with gemcitabine. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
