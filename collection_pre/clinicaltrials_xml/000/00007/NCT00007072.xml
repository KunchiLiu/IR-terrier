	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and efficacy of azacitidine and phenylbutyrate in treatment of patients with thalassemia major.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Azacitidine and Phenylbutyrate in Patients With Thalassemia Major</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive azacitidine IV continuously on days 1-4 and oral phenylbutyrate three times a day on days 14-42. Bone marrow needle aspiration is performed on days 6, 14, and 42 to assess disease response to treatment. If no response on day 42, a second course of azacitidine and phenylbutyrate begins 7 days later. Patients are followed weekly for 3 months and then monthly thereafter.</detailed_description>
