	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together with filgrastim and radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage II or stage IIIA breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of administering adjuvant paclitaxel, dose-intensive cyclophosphamide, and filgrastim (G-CSF), followed by doxorubicin and then radiotherapy in patients with stage II or IIIA breast cancer involving &gt; 4 lymph nodes. - Determine the incidence of febrile neutropenia in these patients during the first course of therapy. - Compare the incidence of febrile neutropenia and duration of neutropenia in patients treated with this regimen with that seen in patients treated on protocol CWRU-4194. - Determine the disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Evaluate the quality of life of these patients. - Correlate HER-2/neu overexpression with disease-free and overall survival in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV continuously and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days 1-3. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 5 and continuing until day 14 or until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses. Patients then receive doxorubicin IV on day 1 and G-CSF SC on days 2-11 every 21 days for 4 courses. Patients with hormone receptor positive disease also receive oral tamoxifen daily for 5 years beginning at the completion of chemotherapy. Beginning 3-6 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy, patients receive radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6-7 weeks. Quality of life is assessed days 1 and 4 of the first course of chemotherapy, day 1 of the second course, the last day of the final course, and at 6 months after the completion of treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
