	<detailed_description>The multi-disciplinary behavioral, group-based intervention focuses on dietary and exercise changes, with group meetings over an 18-month period. Participants are assessed at 6-month intervals (for a total of 18 months) to examine the impact of the interventions on body weight and blood sugar control (primary outcomes), as well as on blood pressure, cholesterol, quality of life and attitudes (secondary outcomes). All enrolled participants receive group-based weight loss intervention. Half the women enrolled also receive several individual sessions of motivational interviewing and the other half of enrolled women receive the same number of individual sessions of health education, which focus on issues relevant to women (e.g., mammography, sleep hygiene, menopause, etc).</detailed_description>
