	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Assessment of patients undergoing radiation therapy may help to determine the effects of the treatment and may help improve cancer treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the memory skills in patients receiving radiation therapy for brain metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Memory Skills in Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy for Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility of performing a test battery consisting of five neurocognitive measures and a quality of life instrument following radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases. OUTLINE: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Quality of life and neurocognitive function is assessed before study, at completion of radiotherapy, and at 1 month after completion of radiotherapy. Patients are followed at 1 month. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 months.</detailed_description>
