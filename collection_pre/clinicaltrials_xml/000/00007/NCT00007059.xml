	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effects of bile externalization and antibiotic gut sterilization on the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil in patients who have undergone orthotopic liver transplantation. II. Correlate serum concentrations of mycophenolic acid with inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase activity in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Pharmacokinetics of Mycophenolate Mofetil in Patients Who Have Undergone Orthotopic Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients begin a mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)-containing regimen within the first 5 days after transplantation. Patients have blood drawn on postoperative days 7, 21, 42, 70, 98, 126, and 154. Urine is collected on postoperative days 7, 21, and 42. Patients with T-tube bile externalization also have bile collected on postoperative day 7.</detailed_description>
