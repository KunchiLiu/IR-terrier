	<brief_summary>Background: NSC630176 is a depsipeptide fermentation product from Chromobacterium violaceum with potent cytotoxic activity against human tumor cell lines and in vivo efficacy against both human tumor xenografts and murine tumors (1-3). NSC 630176, herein referred to as depsipeptide, shows a lack of cross resistance with several commonly used cytotoxic agents such as vincristine, 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C and cyclophosphamide (2). However, it has been defined as a P-glycoprotein (Pgp) substrate by COMPARE analysis of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) drug screen cytotoxicity profile (4). Depsipeptide is a member of a novel class of antineoplastic agents, the histone deacetylase inhibitors. In the phase I trial conducted at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), responses were observed at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with cutaneous and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Objectives: In patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the primary end points to be examined are overall response rate, complete response rate and duration of response. In patients with relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphoma, the endpoints to be examined are overall response rate and complete response rate. To evaluate the tolerability of depsipeptide with extended cycles of therapy. Eligibility: Patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome) or other peripheral T-cell lymphomas are eligible. Design: Depsipeptide will be administered at 14 mg/m^2, over 4 hours on days 1, 8 and 15. This trial will accrue in six cohorts; Arm 1, patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who have had less than or equal to two prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens; Arm 2, patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma who have had less than or equal to two prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens; Arm 3, patients with cutaneous and peripheral T-cell lymphoma who have had more than two prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens; Arm 4, patients with other mature T-cell lymphomas; Arm 5, a replicate arm of arm 1; Arm 6, patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma who have had more than two prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens; Arm 7, patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma who have received vorinostat. Dose may be adjusted based on toxicities.</brief_summary>

Open and accruing Cohort 3 Cutaneous Tcell Lymphomas or Peripheral Tcell LymphomaMore than 2. Closed to accrual Cohort 4 Other Mature T cell LymphomasAny number. Open and accruing Cohort 5 Cutaneous Tcell Lymphoma (mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome)2 or fewerCohort 5 is a replicate cohort, identical to #1 Cohort 6 Peripheral Tcell Lymphoma (PTCL), unspecified, or Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (T and null cell) Primary Cutaneous TypeMore than 2. Patients with PTCL in cohort 3 migrated to this cohort Cohort 7 Cutaneous Tcell Lymphoma (mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome) Prior vorinostat requiredAny number Patients with cutaneous Tcell lymphoma [CTCL (mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome) stage IB to IVB are eligible. Patients with stage IB and IIA should be refractory to, intolerant to, or have reached a sixmonth or longer response plateau on at least two prior therapies from the following list: psoralen plus ultraviolet A irradiation (PUVA), ultraviolet B (UVB), electron beam therapy (EBT), photophoresis, interferon, systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, topical nitrogen mustard, or topical carmustine (BCNU). One qualifying prior treatment must have been topical nitrogen mustard, topical carmustine or a phototherapy (UVB, PUVA or EBT). Topical steroids, systemic retinoids or biologicals do not qualify. Patients with stage IB or IIA who are not candidates for topical nitrogen mustard, topical carmustine or phototherapy (UVB, PUVA or EBT) are eligible for enrollment. Patients may not have received more than two systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. Steroids, retinoids, and biologic agents, will not be considered as systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy is considered equivalent to a systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen and must be counted toward the two prior systemic cytotoxic regimens. Patients with stage IIBIVB who have had no more than 2 prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens are eligible. There is no restriction regarding number of prior topical therapies, skin irradiation, or noncytotoxic systemic therapies (i.e. PUVA, retinoids or biologic, with the exception of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy) in this patient group. After 24 patients were enrolled in this arm, the arm was closed, and a replicate arm constituted of this same patient population was opened (Cohort 5).

Patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma (Mycosis fungoides or Sezary Syndrome) or peripheral T cell lymphoma as defined above who have received more than 2 prior systemic therapies and who have experienced disease progression will be included in a third and independent arm. This arm of the protocol was closed to accrual for CTCL with Amendment H. Patients with mature T cell lymphomas not included above will be enrolled in a fourth arm. These include but are not exclusively limited to: Enteropathytype T cell lymphoma; Hepatosplenic Tcell lymphoma; Subcutaneous panniculitislike T cell lymphoma; Angioimmunoblastic Tcell lymphoma; Anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Patients must have experienced disease progression after receiving prior standard treatment. There will be no limit on the number of prior regimens. Primitive T cell neoplasms and T cell leukemias will not be enrolled. Patients with peripheral Tcell lymphoma, unspecified, or anaplastic large cell lymphoma, T and null cell, primary cutaneous type, as defined by the REAL/WHO classification (1618), who have experienced disease progression after receiving prior standard treatment and who have had more than 2 prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens are eligible for enrollment to a sixth arm of the trial. Patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma (Mycosis fungoides or Sezary Syndrome) or peripheral T cell lymphoma as defined in #1 who have received any number of prior systemic therapies and who have previously been treated with vorinostat will be included in a third and independent arm.
