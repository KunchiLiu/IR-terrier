	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Vaccines made from cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill colorectal tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy and/or vaccine therapy in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy and/or Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and tolerability of monoclonal antibody 105AD7 anti-idiotypic vaccine and ONYCR1, ONYCR2, and ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccines in patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. - Determine any immunological response to these treatment regimens in these patients. - Determine the 6-month and 1-year survival of these patients after receiving these treatment regimens. - Determine the tumor response to these treatment regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are assigned to one of three treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive monoclonal antibody 105AD7 anti-idiotype vaccine (MOAB 105AD7) plus BCG intradermally (ID) weekly for weeks 1 and 2; MOAB 105AD7 ID plus alum adjuvant intramuscularly (IM) weekly for weeks 4 and 6; and then MOAB 105AD7 ID alone monthly for up to 12 months. - Arm II: Patients receive ONYCR1, ONYCR2, and ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccines plus BCG ID weekly for weeks 1 and 2; these vaccines ID weekly for weeks 4 and 6, and then monthly for up to 12 months. - Arm III: Patients receive MOAB 105AD7, ONYCR1, ONYCR2, and ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccines, and BCG ID weekly for weeks 1 and 2; MOAB 105AD7 and ONYCR1, ONYCR2, and ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccines ID plus alum adjuvant IM weekly for weeks 4 and 6; and then MOAB 105AD7 and ONYCR1, ONYCR2, and ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccines monthly for up to 12 months. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients (15 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
