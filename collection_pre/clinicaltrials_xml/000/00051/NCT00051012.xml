	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to provide an opportunity for patients who exhibit progressive disease while receiving placebo on the companion 93-04-11 study to receive ONTAK. It is also designed to determine the effectiveness of ONTAK in Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) patients whose tumors do not express CD25.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must have been previously enrolled in Protocol 930411 and randomized to the placebo arm; or the patient met all eligibility criteria for protocol 930411 other than the expression of CD25 on CTCL tumor cells. CTCL disease Stage Ia III. History of less than or equal to 3 previous therapies. Repeated use of the same agent is considered to be 1 therapy unless it is part of a different combination regimen. Only 1 prior combination cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen is permitted. Topical or systemic steroids are not considered a therapy. Patient must have evaluable or measurable disease. Lymph node involvement no greater than LN2. No CTCL involvement of bone marrow. No significant pulmonary or cardiac disease. No active CNS, kidney, or liver disease. No systemic infections. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. â€¢ The 930414 study is no longer open to subjects previously enrolled in 930410 or 920401.</criteria>
