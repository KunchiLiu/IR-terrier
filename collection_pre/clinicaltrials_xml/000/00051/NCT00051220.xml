	<brief_title>Treatment for Specific Phobias in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children with specific phobias may experience academic, social, and personal distress, as well as interference in day-to-day activities. One-Session Treatment has been found a rapid and effective treatment for adults with phobic disorders. However, its utility in the treatment of childhood phobia has not been examined. Participants are randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: a one-session treatment group, an education/support group, and a waitlist control group. The one-session treatment group is directly exposed to a phobia object or situation during a 3-hour treatment session. In the education/support group, children are given information about fear and phobias and are taught how to deal with them through workbook activities. Children who participate in the one-session treatment group or the education/support group are assessed 1 week post-treatment and again after 6 months. Participants with improved symptoms have a 1-year follow-up. Participants with phobias that persist at 6 months are encouraged to participate in alternative treatment. Waitlist control participants are assessed pre-treatment and 1 month post-treatment. Those who continue to have phobias at the 1-month assessment are randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 active treatments.</detailed_description>
