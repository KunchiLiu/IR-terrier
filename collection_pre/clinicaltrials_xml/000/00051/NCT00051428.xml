	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of Reiki in the treatment of fibromyalgia (FM), a condition characterized by widespread muscle pain and stiffness, often accompanied by sleep disturbance, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, and psychological distress. Reiki is a form of energy medicine in which practitioners reportedly access universal life energy to heal patients, either by direct contact at specific hand positions or from a distance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Reiki in the Treatment of Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia is one of the most common rheumatologic diagnoses. Treatment is generally unsatisfactory and most randomized, controlled treatment trials have been unable to demonstrate a sustained effective intervention. A vast body of anecdotal literature as well as two randomized controlled trials suggest that Reiki may be an effective treatment for FM, appearing to relieve pain and improve psychological well being. Reiki appears to have no adverse effects and can eventually be self-administered, making it a low-risk, low-cost, potentially patient-empowering intervention. This study will investigate the efficacy of Reiki in the treatment of FM. One hundred Reiki-naive FM patients will be recruited from a chronic fatigue referral clinic and will participate in an 8-week trial. Patients will be randomized into one of two Reiki groups (direct-contact and distant Reiki) or one of two control groups (sham and placebo). Patients will receive either Reiki or placebo 16 times during the course of the study. Patients will be assessed at study entry, at Weeks 4 and 8, and 12 weeks post-treatment.</detailed_description>
