	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis is a condition in which the amount of bone is reduced, the bones are weak, and there is an increased risk for fractures. Glucocorticoids (such as prednisone) are prescribed to treat a large number of conditions such as arthritis and asthma. When taken for several months or longer, glucocorticoids can cause bone loss and lead to a form of osteoporosis called "glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis." This study compared the effects of teriparatide, the study drug, with alendronate, an approved drug for treating glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.</brief_summary>
