	<brief_title>Group Therapy for Postpartum Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ten to twenty percent of new mothers experience major depression in the postpartum period or postpartum depression (PPD). This condition poses a risk for disturbances in the mother-infant relationship as well as for developmental delays and subsequent psychopathology in their children. Thus, and investigation of the efficacy of a relational approach that focuses on improving the mother's sense of competence in the parenting role, and reducing depressive symptoms and social isolation through group therapy is warranted. Patients are randomly assigned to either relational group treatment or to standard individual treatment. Assessments of maternal and infant functioning, mother-infant and father-infant relations, parenting stress, and marital conflict and conducted pre- and post-treatment, at 12 months post-treatment, and when infants are 12 and 24 months of age.</detailed_description>
