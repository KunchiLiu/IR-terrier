	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal dose of Campath for patients with relapsing or refractory (failed standard therapy) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The study will also evaluate the safety of the drug and whether it is effective in treating these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study of CAMPATH in Patients With Relapsing or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is being conducted in 2 parts with the primary objective of part 1 being to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CAMPATH (alemtuzumab, MABCAMPATH, CAMPATH) administered intravenously (IV) once a week as treatment for relapsing or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The primary objective of part 2 is to determine the overall response rate (complete response, CR/unconfirmed , plus partial response) of weekly IV CAMPATH in the treatment of relapsing or refractory NHL. This is a Phase I/II study, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of weekly IV CAMPATH as therapy for patients with relapsing or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have: Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of relapsing or refractory nonHodgkin's lymphoma that has failed conventional therapy.

Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. World Health Organization (WHO) performance status (PS) of 0, 1, or 2. Adequate marrow and organ function (details are listed in the protocol). Female patients with childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to enrollment. Male and female patients must agree to use an effective contraceptive method while on study treatment, if appropriate, and for a minimum of 6 months following study therapy. Signed, written informed consent. Patients must not have: Prior autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplant within 6 months of study entry. A history of prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant or organ transplant. Previously untreated nonHodgkin's lymphoma. Previously treated with CAMPATH. Patients with bulky disease, ie any single mass &gt; 7.5cm. Prior radiotherapy to the only site of measurable disease. Medical condition requiring chronic use of oral, highdose corticosteroids. Autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Use of investigational agents within previous 30 days or any anticancer therapy within the previous 3 weeks. Patients must have recovered from all acute toxicities of any prior therapy. Past history of anaphylaxis following exposure to humanized monoclonal antibodies. Active, uncontrolled infection, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. Active secondary malignancy. Active central nervous system (CNS) involvement with NHL. Pregnant or lactating women. Male or female patients who do not agree to use effective contraceptive method(s) during the study. Any significant concurrent disease or illness that would, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise patient safety or compliance, or interfere with the interpretation of study results.</criteria>
