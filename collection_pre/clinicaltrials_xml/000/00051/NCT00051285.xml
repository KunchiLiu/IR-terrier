	<brief_title>ESSENTIAL-"The Studies of Oral Enoximone Therapy in Advanced Heart Failure"</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial of oral enoximone in approximately 700 subjects with advanced chronic heart failure of either ischemic or nonischemic etiology receiving optimal conventional heart failure therapy. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either enoximone or placebo at the Randomization Visit. The initial dose of study drug will be 25 mg t.i.d.(3xday) and will be administered immediately after randomization. Subjects who tolerate this initial dose will be continued on 25 mg t.i.d. for at least two weeks. After two weeks, eligible subjects will be titrated to 50 mg t.i.d. for the duration of the study.</detailed_description>

A target serum digoxin level of &lt;=1.0 ng/ml (&lt;=1.3 nmol/l) is recommended</criteria>
