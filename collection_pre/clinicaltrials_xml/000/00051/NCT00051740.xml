	<detailed_description>Many schizophrenia patients have serious difficulties that affect their quality of life. Cognitive Adaptation Training (CAT) may improve adaptive functioning, quality of life, and rates of relapse in schizophrenia patients. CAT, which involves compensatory strategies or environmental supports, is tailored to each individual and is based on executive functioning levels and other factors. Participants are randomly assigned to CAT, Minimal Environmental Supports (MES), or treatment as usual for 2 years. Participants receiving CAT will have a trained therapist make weekly visits to their home for 9 months. Over the following 3 months, the frequency of CAT visits will be slowly reduced to once a month. For the remaining 12 months of treatment, patients receive CAT only once a month. Participants assigned to the MES group receive a generic set of supplies and equipment (calendar, alarm clock, watch, bus passes, etc.) at the beginning of the 2-year period. Each month, the supplies are replenished as necessary during the patient's scheduled clinic visit. In all groups, assessments of adaptive function and quality of life occur at study start and at 3, 6, 9, 18, and 24 months.</detailed_description>
