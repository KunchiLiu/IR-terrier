	<brief_title>Therapy for Depression With Co-occurring Panic or Anxiety Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many depressed patients also experience significant symptoms of panic or anxiety. This study will compare the effectiveness of a new therapy called interpersonal psychotherapy for depression with panic or anxiety symptoms (IPT-PS) with that of traditional interpersonal psychotherapy for depression (IPT). Participants are randomly assigned to receive up to 24 weeks of treatment with either IPT-PS or traditional IPT. Improvements in interpersonal functioning, quality of life, and symptoms of depression and anxiety will be assessed at the end of therapy and at a 3-month follow-up.</detailed_description>
