	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Targeted therapy with tumor necrosis factor combined with a fusion protein may stop the growth of solid tumors by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of NGR-TNF in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NGR-TNF in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of tumor vasculature-targeted tumor necrosis factor alpha (NGR-TNF) in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the recommended phase II dose of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Determine the mechanism of action of this drug in these patients. - Determine response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive tumor vasculature-targeted tumor necrosis factor alpha (NGR-TNF) IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of NGR-TNF until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 12 patients receive treatment at the MTD. Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression or the start of a new anticancer treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
