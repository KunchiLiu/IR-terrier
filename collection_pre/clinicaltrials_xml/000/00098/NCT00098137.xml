	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Blocking the angiotensin (AT) II type 1 receptor (Olmesartan) reduces the incidence of episodes of atrial fibrillation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during 12 months by more than 25% compared to standard medication without angiotensin II type 1 receptor. A total of 422 subjects will be included in the two study groups. The treatment arm will receive 40mg Olmesartan per day, the remaining patients will receive placebo. Follow-up is 12 months. Daily Tele-ECG recordings will determine the cardiac rhythm and asymptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) every day. Concomitant therapy with AV-nodal blocking drugs are allowed during the study. In case of severe AF-induced symptoms, an antiarrhythmic "recovery medication" (amiodarone) is allowed during follow-up.</brief_summary>
