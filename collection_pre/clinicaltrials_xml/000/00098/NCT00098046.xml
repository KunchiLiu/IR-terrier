	<brief_summary>Varicella zoster virus causes chickenpox in children and shingles in adults. Chickenpox is usually a self-limiting illness characterized by fever and a rash. Serious complications can include secondary bacterial infections, pneumonia, and encephalitis. Anti-viral treatment is not a standard of care in immunocompetent children, but is recommended whenever a risk of complication exists. This study will evaluate the safety and blood levels of a new formulation of famciclovir in children 1-12 years of age.</brief_summary>
