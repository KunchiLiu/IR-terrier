	<brief_title>Study of the Feasibility to Derive Vaccine From Tumor Tissue in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antigenics is enrolling patients in a Phase II study testing the feasibility to derive an autologous investigational vaccine (HSPPC-96) from the tumor tissue of patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer. All patients will undergo surgery to remove the tumor and will be followed for recurrence and overall survival. The primary goal of this trial is to determine if HSPPC-96 can be made from the tumor tissue of patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer. The secondary goals are to further characterize the safety and efficacy profile, to evaluate disease recurrence in patients receiving, and to evaluate overall survival in patients receiving HSPPC-96. HSPPC-96 is an investigational, immunotherapeutic agent made from an individual patient's own tumor, which is collected at the time of surgery. A portion of the tumor tissue is sent to Antigenics' manufacturing facility where it will undergo processing to create a vaccine. This vaccine may help the patient's immune system attack cancerous cells while leaving healthy cells alone.</detailed_description>
