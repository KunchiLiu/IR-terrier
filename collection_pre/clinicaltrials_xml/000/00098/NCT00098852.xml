	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs such as rosiglitazone may make tumor cells more sensitive to radioactive iodine. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well rosiglitazone works in treating patients with locoregionally extensive or metastatic thyroid cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rosiglitazone in Treating Patients With Locoregionally Extensive or Metastatic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine complete response in patients with locoregionally extensive or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer treated with rosiglitazone. Secondary - Compare the long-term response of patients treated with this drug with historical controls. - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the presence/persistence of tumor in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug. - Determine overall survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients receive oral rosiglitazone once daily on weeks 1-8. Patients also receive oral liothyronine sodium twice daily on weeks 1-6 in preparation for radioactive iodine scan. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At week 8, all patients undergo whole body radioactive iodine scan followed by a treatment dose of radioiodine to assess radioiodine uptake by tumor. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at the end of study treatment. Patients are followed at 2 weeks, 1, 4, and 10 months, and then every 6 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
