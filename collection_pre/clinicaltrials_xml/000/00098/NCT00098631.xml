	<brief_title>Lapatinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the overall response rate in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with lapatinib. II. Determine the progression-free survival, time to progression, and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts according to prior epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy (yes vs no). Patients receive oral lapatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-88 patients (21-50 epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] inhibitor-naive patients [cohort A] and 19-38 EGFR inhibitor-pre-treated patients [cohort B]) will be accrued for this study within 4-12.6 months.</detailed_description>
