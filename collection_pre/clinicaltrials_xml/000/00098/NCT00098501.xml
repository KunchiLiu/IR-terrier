	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects, best way to give, and best dose of CCI-779 and EKB-569 in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CCI-779, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. EKB-569 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their growth. Giving CCI-779 together with EKB-569 may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CCI-779 and EKB-569 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of CCI-779 and EKB-569 in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. Group I: Patients receive oral EKB-569 on days 1-28 and oral CCI-779 on days 1-7 and 15-21. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of EKB-569 and CCI-779 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Group II: Patients receive oral EKB-569 at the MTD on days 4-28 of course 1 and days 1-28 of all subsequent courses and CCI-779 at the MTD on days 1-3 and 15-17. Group III: Patients receive EKB-569 at the MTD as in group I and oral CCI-779 at the MTD on days 7-9 and 19-21 of course 1 and days 1-3 and 15-17 of all subsequent courses. In all groups, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-42 patients (18-30 for group I, 6 for group II, and 6 for group III) will be accrued for this study within 1.35-1.75 years.</detailed_description>
