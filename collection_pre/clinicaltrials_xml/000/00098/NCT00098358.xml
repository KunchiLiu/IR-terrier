	<brief_summary>Tissue inflammation is a major component of the acne disease process. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is thought to be a major player in the development of tissue inflammation. Synthesis of LTB4 is controlled by the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase. Zileuton blocks the activity of 5-lipoxygenase. This study will test the safety and efficacy of zileuton in the treatment of facial acne.</brief_summary>
