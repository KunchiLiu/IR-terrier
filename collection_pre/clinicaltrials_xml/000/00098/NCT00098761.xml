	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as VNP40101M, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of VNP40101M in treating young patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory primary brain tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VNP40101M in Treating Young Patients With Recurrent, Progressive, or Refractory Primary Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of VNP40101M in pediatric patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory primary brain tumors. Secondary - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug and its active metabolite VNP4090CE in these patients. - Determine the efficacy of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to receiving ≥ 1 of the following prior therapies: craniospinal irradiation (yes vs no), autologous bone marrow transplant (yes vs no), and &gt; 2 myelosuppressive chemotherapy or myelosuppressive biologic therapy regimens (yes vs no). Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 2-6 patients per stratum receive escalating doses of VNP40101M until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 25% of patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 12 patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed for 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4-60 patients (2-30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
