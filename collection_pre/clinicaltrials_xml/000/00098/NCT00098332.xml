	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and efficacy of forodesine (BCX-1777) in patients with refractory stage IIA-IVB cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. - Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive oral forodesine (BCX-1777) once daily on days 1-28. Courses may be repeated in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed periodically. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified.</detailed_description>
