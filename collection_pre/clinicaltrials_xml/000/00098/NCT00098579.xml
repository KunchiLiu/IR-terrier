	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of alvocidib when given with doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent sarcoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride and alvocidib, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Alvocidib may also help doxorubicin hydrochloride work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving more than one drug may kill more tumor cells</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxorubicin Hydrochloride and Alvocidib in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Sarcoma That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol (alvocidib) when administered with a fixed dose of doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) in patients with unresectable metastatic or locally recurrent sarcoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the clinical pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine, preliminarily, the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients. III. Correlate pRb, p53, and p21 protein levels with treatment response and apoptosis in patients treated with this regimen. IV. Correlate NMR biochemical patterns with response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of alvocidib. Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 5-10 minutes and alvocidib IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients reaching a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 600 mg/m^2 or experiencing cardiotoxicity may receive alvocidib alone at the discretion of the investigator. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of alvocidib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Ten additional patients receive treatment at the MTD. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
