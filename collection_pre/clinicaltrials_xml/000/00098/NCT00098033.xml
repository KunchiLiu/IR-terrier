	<brief_summary>The goals and objectives of this project are to evaluate the antileukemic activity of the investigational agent clofarabine in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in accelerated and blastic phases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of Clofarabine in Acute Leukemias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aims of the project are (1) conduct the phase II study of clofarabine and evaluate the antileukemic efficacy in AML, ALL, and CML-accelerated and blastic phases in terms of complete response (CR) rate, response duration, and survival; and (2) analyze the relationship between cellular uptake and retention of clofarabine triphosphate (the active metabolite), inhibition of DNA synthesis, and clinical outcome.

	<criteria>Patient is diagnosed with AML, ALL, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and CML in transformation (includes CMLblastic phase and CMLaccelerated phase). No prior chemo, immuno, or radiotherapy for 2 weeks before entering the study, unless progressive lifethreatening leukemia as judged by the treated physician. Adequate liver function (bilirubin &lt;/= 2 mg%) and renal function (creatinine &lt;/= 2 mg%). Pregnant and lactating females not eligible. Zubrod performance status 02 Adequate cardiac status No lifethreatening conditions (e.g. infections) which may cause death within 3 weeks.</criteria>
