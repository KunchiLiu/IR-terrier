	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of flavopiridol in treating patients who have recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flavopiridol in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of flavopiridol in patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-24 months.</detailed_description>
