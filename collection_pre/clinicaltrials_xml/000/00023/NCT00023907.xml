	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients who have recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of paclitaxel in patients with recurrent or persistent platinum- and paclitaxel-resistant ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12 months.</detailed_description>
