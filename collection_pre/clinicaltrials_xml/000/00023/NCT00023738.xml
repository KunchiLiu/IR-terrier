	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Drugs such as SU5416 may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy, SU5416, and radiation therapy before and after surgery may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy, SU5416, radiation therapy, and surgery in treating patients who have soft tissue sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy, SU5416, Radiation Therapy, and Surgery in Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of SU5416 when administered with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high-grade stage IIC-III soft tissue sarcoma. - Determine the disease-free survival, local control, and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine histological response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the quantitative antiangiogenic effects of SU5416 in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of SU5416. Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine IV continuously on days 1-3, 22-24, and 43-45. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients undergo 2 courses of radiotherapy, given once daily for 11 doses per course over days 7-20 and 28-41. Patients also receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice weekly beginning on day 1 and continuing until 2 days before surgery. Patients undergo surgical resection on day 80. Patients then receive adjuvant chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine IV continuously on days 101-103, 122-124, and 143-145. Patients also receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice weekly beginning on day 101 and continuing until the end of adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with positive surgical margins receive additional radiotherapy beginning 2 weeks after resection for a total of 8 doses. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SU5416 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 68-80 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
