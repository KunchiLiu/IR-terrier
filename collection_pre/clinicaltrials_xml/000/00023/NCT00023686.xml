	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether surgery is more effective than internal radiation in treating prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery with that of internal radiation in treating patients who have stage II prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery Versus Internal Radiation in Treating Patients With Stage II Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare overall survival in patients with stage II prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy vs brachytherapy. - Compare metastasis-free survival and probability of survival without symptoms of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the side effects of these treatment regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo radical prostatectomy. - Arm II: Patients undergo brachytherapy with implanted iodine I 125 or palladium Pd 103 seeds Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,980 patients (990 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 5.5 years.</detailed_description>
