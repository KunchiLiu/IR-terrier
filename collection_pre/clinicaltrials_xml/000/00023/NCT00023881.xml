	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who have chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of bortezomib, in terms of response rate, duration of response, and survival of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase. - Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib intravenous (IV) over 3-5 seconds twice weekly on weeks 1-2. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 15-30 months.</detailed_description>
