	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells and white blood cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who have non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and feasibility of immunization with autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. - Determine the immunologic response in patients treated with this vaccine. OUTLINE: Patients undergo surgery to remove all or most of the gross evidence of tumor. Two months after surgery (or 4 months if chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are required), patients undergo leukapheresis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are isolated and cultured with interleukin-4 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) to generate dendritic cells (DC). DC are then pulsed with tumor lysate prepared from previously removed tumor. Patients receive autologous tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccine subcutaneously twice, 4 weeks apart. Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
