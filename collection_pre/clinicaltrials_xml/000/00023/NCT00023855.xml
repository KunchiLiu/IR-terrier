	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining PS-341 and doxorubicin in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PS-341 and Doxorubicin in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PS-341 in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PS-341. Patients receive PS-341 IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; and doxorubicin IV on over 3-5 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PS-341 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-31 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
