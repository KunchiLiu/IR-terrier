	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To compare the pharmacokinetics of rifapentine and 25-desacetyl rifapentine at three different doses: 600 mg, 900 mg, and 1200 mg. Secondary objective: To describe any correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters of three different doses of rifapentine plus a standard dose of isoniazid and the occurrence of toxicity attributed to anti-tuberculosis treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TBTC Study 25PK: Intensive Pharmacokinetic Study of Three Doses of Rifapentine and 25-Desacetyl Rifapentine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will enroll 24-36 patients, 8-12 at each dose of 600, 900 and 1200 mg rifapentine Admissions for pharmacokinetic studies will take place during the continuation phase of tuberculosis therapy. Patients participating in a double-blinded trial of the tolerability and safety of higher doses of rifapentine during continuation phase therapy and consenting to participate in the pharmacokinetic study may be admitted to a Clinical Research Center (CRC) to allow for frequent blood sampling over a 24-hour period. Otherwise, patients will be evaluated in the clinic.</detailed_description>
