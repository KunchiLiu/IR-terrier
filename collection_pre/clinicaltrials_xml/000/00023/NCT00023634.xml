	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a peptide may make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying two different vaccines to treat patients who have gastric, prostate, or ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0114 Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Gastric, Prostate, or Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity of EGFRvIII peptide vaccine with sargramostim (GM-CSF) or keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as adjuvant in patients with EGFRvIII-expressing cancer. - Determine the preexisting antibody and T-cell responses to EGFRvIII in these patients. - Determine the antibody and T-cell responses to EGFRvIII peptide after immunization with this vaccine with GM-CSF or KLH as adjuvant. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive a vaccine containing EGFRvIII peptide admixed with sargramostim (GM-CSF) intradermally monthly. - Arm II: Patients receive a vaccine containing EGFRvIII peptide admixed with keyhole limpet hemocyanin subcutaneously monthly. Treatment in both arms continues for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients (12 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
