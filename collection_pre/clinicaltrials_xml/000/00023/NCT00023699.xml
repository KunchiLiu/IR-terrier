	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as gefitinib may interfere with the growth of the tumor cells and may slow the growth of ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gefitinib in treating patients who have recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor cytostatic activity of gefitinib, in terms of 6-month progression-free survival, in patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal carcinoma. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the partial and complete response rates in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the duration of progression-free and overall survival in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.</detailed_description>
