	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who have persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity of bortezomib in patients with persistent or recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal carcinoma. II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bortezomib IV twice weekly for 2 weeks. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
