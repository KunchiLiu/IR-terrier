	<brief_summary>Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for head and neck cancer. This phase I trial is to see if combining bevacizumab, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea with radiation therapy works in treating patients who have advanced head and neck cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab, Fluorouracil, and Hydroxyurea Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of bevacizumab when given in combination with fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, and radiotherapy in patients with advanced head and neck cancer. II. Determine the time to progression, pattern of failure, local control, and distant failure rate in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the local toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bevacizumab. Patients receive oral hydroxyurea every 12 hours on days 1-6, fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-5, and bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Patients also undergo radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 6-12. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 7 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bevacizumab until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at the MTD. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 5.4-19.5 months.</detailed_description>
