	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-247550 in treating patients who have liver or gallbladder cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-247550 in Treating Patients With Liver or Gallbladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate of patients with hepatobiliary cancer treated with BMS-247550. II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the duration of response, median and overall survival, and time to progression in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression</detailed_description>
