	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of different doses of ibuprofen on neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte; PMN) delivery to a mucosal surface (the oral mucosa) in patients with cystic fibrosis and healthy controls. II. Determine the duration of effect (and possible rebound effect) of ibuprofen on PMN delivery to a mucosal surface in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Ibuprofen to Preserve Lung Function in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients are randomized into 5 arms, each consisting of 10 healthy volunteers and 5 patients with cystic fibrosis, based on the amount of ibuprofen received during the treatment period. The study period lasts for at least 15 days and consists of 3 periods: baseline (days 1-3), treatment (days 3-12), and recovery (days 13-15 or longer). During the treatment period patients receive ibuprofen orally every 12 hours (except for a control arm that receives no ibuprofen).</detailed_description>
