	<brief_summary>This study will examine whether pretreatment with two doses of acamprosate for seven days prior to abstinence lessens the intensity of acute withdrawal from alcohol compared with a placebo. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either one of two doses of acamprosate or placebo for seven days. This will be followed by a four- day inpatient period when withdrawal will be monitored. Additional drinking information will be obtained at a three month followup interview.</brief_summary>
