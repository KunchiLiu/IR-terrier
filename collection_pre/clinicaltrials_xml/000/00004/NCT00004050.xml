	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Inserting the gene for interleukin-2 into a person's cancer cells may improve the body's ability to fight cancer. Using Leuvectin to deliver this gene may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of Leuvectin followed by surgery in treating patients who have stage II or stage III prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Leuvectin Followed By Surgery in Treating Patients With Stage II or Stage III Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the toxicity and tolerability of neoadjuvant Leuvectin in patients with stage II or III prostate cancer. - Evaluate the efficacy of this regimen in preventing or delaying manifestations of disease progression as demonstrated by biochemical failure or clinical recurrence in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive Leuvectin intraprostatically over 10-30 seconds under ultrasound guidance on day 0 followed by a second injection between days 4 and 7. Between days 8 and 14, patients undergo retropubic prostatectomy. All patients are followed at 2 months. Patients with a PSA no greater than 0.2 ng/mL are followed at 4 months and 6 months, every 3 months for 12 months, and then every 6 months for 3.5 years in the absence of disease progression or biochemical failure. ACTUAL ACCRUAL: 13 patients were accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
