	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of interferon beta and thalidomide in male patients with adrenoleukodystrophy who show evidence of brain inflammatory response and are receiving concurrent glyceryl trierucate and glyceryl trioleate (Lorenzo's oil). II. Evaluate the progress of the disease and possible side effects of the medication in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study of Beta Interferon and Thalidomide in Patients With Adrenoleukodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are randomized to receive beta interferon and thalidomide placebo (arm I), thalidomide and beta interferon placebo (arm II), or placebo for both beta interferon and thalidomide (arm III).
