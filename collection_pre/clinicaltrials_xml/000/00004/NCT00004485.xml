	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder in which abnormal, crescent-shaped red blood cells interfere with the ability of the blood to carry oxygen through the body and can cause severe pain, stroke, and organ damage. Bone marrow transplantation, is a procedure in which the soft, sponge-like tissue in the center of bones producing white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets is replaced by bone marrow from a another person. Bone marrow transplantation may be an effective treatment in relieving the symptoms of sickle cell disease. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation in treating children who have sickle cell disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo total body irradiation on day 0, followed by allogeneic bone marrow transfusion. Patients also receive fludarabine IV daily and cyclosporine IV twice a day on days -1 to 1. Patients then receive oral cyclosporine on days 1-90, and oral mycophenolate mofetil twice a day on days 0-27. Patients are followed for 100 days, monthly for 6 months and then annually for 2 years.</detailed_description>
