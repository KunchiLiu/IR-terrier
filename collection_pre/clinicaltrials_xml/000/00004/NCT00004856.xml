	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab in treating patients who have previously treated, locally advanced, or metastatic cancer of the urothelium. Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab in Treating Patients With Previously Treated, Locally Advanced, or Metastatic Cancer of the Urothelium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate in patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium treated with trastuzumab (Herceptin). II. Determine the safety of this drug in this patient population. III. Determine overall and progression-free survival of this patient population treated with this drug. OUTLINE: Patients receive a loading dose of trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of week 1. For all subsequent doses, patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes weekly. Treatment may continue for more than 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
