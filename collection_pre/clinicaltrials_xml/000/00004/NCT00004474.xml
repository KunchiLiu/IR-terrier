	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare outcome, including graft failure, graft versus host disease, and survival of HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplants for aplastic anemia using cyclophosphamide with or without antithymocyte globulin as a conditioning regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Randomized Study of Cyclophosphamide With or Without Antithymocyte Globulin Before Bone Marrow Transplantation in Patients With Aplastic Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to receive cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes on days -5 to -2 with or without antithymocyte globulin IV over 4 hours. All patients then receive bone marrow over 60-120 minutes on day 0, 36 hours after the last dose of cyclophosphamide. Patients are followed at day 100, at 6 months, and at 1 year posttransplant.</detailed_description>
