	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal daunorubicin in treating patients who have metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liposomal Daunorubicin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of daunorubicin liposomal in patients with metastatic breast cancer. II. Assess the antineoplastic activity and safety profile of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive daunorubicin liposomal IV over a minimum of 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of daunorubicin liposomal until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease are followed at 1 and 3 months, then every 3 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
