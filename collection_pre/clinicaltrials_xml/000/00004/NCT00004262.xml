	<brief_summary>Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy and gadolinium texaphyrin in treating patients who have supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs such as gadolinium texaphyrin may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy and Gadolinium Texaphyrin in Treating Patients With Supratentorial Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the frequency and grade of toxicity of gadolinium texaphyrin as a radiosensitizer at two dose levels in patients with supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery. II. Compare the tumor, normal brain, and plasma concentrations of this drug regimen to 1.5 and 8 Tesla MRI images in this patient population. III. Determine if the 8 Tesla images provide more data than the 1.5 Tesla images in terms of the radiosensitizing drug distribution in the tumor in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Within 5 weeks following surgery, patients receive daily external beam radiotherapy five days a week for 5 weeks. Within 2 weeks following completion of radiotherapy, patients receive gadolinium texaphyrin IV over 2 hours followed 3 hours later by stereotactic radiosurgery. Patients undergoing surgical debulking of tumor prior to external beam radiotherapy receive gadolinium texaphyrin IV over 2 hours, 3 hours prior to surgery in addition to the dose prior to stereotactic radiosurgery. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gadolinium texaphyrin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, and then every 3 months for 5 years or until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
