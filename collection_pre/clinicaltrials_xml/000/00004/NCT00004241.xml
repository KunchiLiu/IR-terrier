	<brief_summary>Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin in treating patients with advanced epithelial cancer, malignant lymphoma, or sarcoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>17-N-Allylamino-17-Demethoxygeldanamycin in Treating Patients With Advanced Epithelial Cancer, Malignant Lymphoma, or Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in patients with advanced epithelial cancer, malignant lymphoma, or sarcoma. II. Determine the significant toxic effects associated with this drug in these patients. III. Determine the response in patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of 17-AAG and 17AG in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive treatment according to 1 of 2 schedules. Schedule B: Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 1-2 hours twice weekly for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Schedule C: Patients receive 17-AAG IV over 1-2 hours twice weekly for 2 weeks. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In both schedules, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-AAG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients receive treatment at the MTD. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
