	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Rosiglitazone may help liposarcoma cells develop into normal fat cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rosiglitazone in treating patients who have liposarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rosiglitazone in Treating Patients With Liposarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the clinical activity of rosiglitazone in patients with liposarcoma. - Assess the impact of this regimen on markers of tumor proliferation and differentiation status in these patients using biologic and biochemical testing and correlative imaging. - Determine the tolerance and safety of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by histologic subtype (well differentiated vs dedifferentiated vs myxoid/round cell vs pleomorphic). Patients receive oral rosiglitazone twice daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1-3 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56-120 patients (14-30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 15 months.</detailed_description>
