	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a mood management intervention on abstinent alcoholic smokers with a history of major depression. The second aim is to determine the effect of smoking treatments on alcohol abstinence and to identify factors associated with smoking and alcohol outcomes (e.g., more days of abstinence). A randomized, two-group design will be used to evaluate the added benefit of mood management compared to a state-of-the-art smoking cessation treatment. Treatment will consist of 8 weekly group sessions and 1, 3, 6, and 12-month follow-up.</brief_summary>
