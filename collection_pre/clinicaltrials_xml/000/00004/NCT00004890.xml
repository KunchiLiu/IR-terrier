	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill kidney cancer cells. Biomed 101 may protect normal cells from the side effects of interleukin-2. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of Biomed 101 in treating patients receiving interleukin-2 for kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomed 101 and Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose of Biomed 101 in patients with renal cell cancer currently treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2). II. Evaluate the effect of different doses of Biomed 101 on the incidence and severity of IL-2 related toxicities and on the incidence and frequency of IL-2 dose reduction due to IL-2 induced toxicity. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of Biomed 101. Patients receive oral Biomed 101 three times daily, followed by interleukin-2 IV on days 1-5 and 16-20. Cohorts of 5 patients receive escalating doses of Biomed 101 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 5 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed for 1 month. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
