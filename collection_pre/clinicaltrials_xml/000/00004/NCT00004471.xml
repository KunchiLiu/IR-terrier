	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: Determine whether copies of the cystic fibrosis gene (pGT-1) can be delivered to the cells lining the nose of cystic fibrosis patients using cationic liposome (DMRIE/DOPE) mediated gene transfer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Pilot Study of Gene Therapy for Cystic Fibrosis Using Cationic Liposome Mediated Gene Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Under direct visualization, patients receive lipid/DNA formulation (pGT-1 lipid complex) by syringe instillation over 30 minutes to the right inferior nasal turbinate. Patients are followed daily for 7 days, twice a week for 3 weeks, every 2-3 weeks for 10 weeks, then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
