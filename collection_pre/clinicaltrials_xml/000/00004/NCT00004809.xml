	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Develop an approach for treating patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia using gene therapy with autologous hepatocytes transduced with a normal low-density lipoprotein receptor gene.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of Ex Vivo Liver-Directed Gene Therapy for Familial Hypercholesterolemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Autologous hepatocytes are obtained from a partial hepatectomy and transduced with a recombinant retroviral vector containing the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene. The transduced hepatocytes are infused via the inferior mesenteric vein 3 days following surgery. Traditional therapy is discontinued for 4 weeks prior to protocol therapy and may resume 6 weeks after the hepatocyte infusion.</detailed_description>
