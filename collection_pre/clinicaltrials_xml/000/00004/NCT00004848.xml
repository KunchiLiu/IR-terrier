	<brief_summary>This protocol represents a continuation of a series of prospective studies to define the incidence and etiology of transfusion-associated hepatitis (TAH) and to examine the impact on TAH of various modifications in the selection of blood donors. The primary goal of the study will be to determine TAH incidence after the institution of a variety of interventive measures to exclude hepatitis and AIDS virus carriers: including surrogate assays (ALT, anti-HBc), a specific assay for the hepatitis C virus (HCV), a specific assay for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and intensified donor questioning for high-risk behavior patterns. There is high probability that the exclusion of donors at high risk for AIDS transmission will also exclude donors at high risk for hepatitis transmission. Incidence data obtained in the study will be enhanced by the simultaneous follow-up of a control population undergoing identical surgical procedures, but receiving no blood or only autologous blood. This control population, made possible by the recent dramatic increase in the amount of autologous blood utilized, will allow for a clear distinction between transfusion-associated hepatitis and that due to nosocomial transmission or other background causes of hepatocellular inflammation in cardiac surgery patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Consecutive patients undergoing openheart surgery at Georgetown University and Fairfax Hospital will be admitted to the study if: They are 18 years of age or older; They provide informed consent; They reside in the United States and will be available for at least six months of follow up. Patients with known hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus carriers with or without evidence of chronic hepatitis will be excluded. Persons with a history of prior hepatitis will not be excluded, but will be analyzed as a separate cohort. Patients with close exposure (household or sexual contact) to hepatitis in the preceding six months will be excluded. Patients with elevated preoperative alanine aminotransferase (ALT) will be excluded. An aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of between 45 and 75 IU per L will not serve as cause for exclusion if the corresponding ALT is normal on at least two occasions. A preoperative AST greater than 75 IU/L will serve to exclude patients from study independent of the ALT. Patients with blood transfusion in the six months preceding surgery will be excluded. Patients will also be retrospectively excluded if they receive blood more than one month after surgery. The six month followup period will be timed from the date of the last transfusion. Patients with alcoholism or other known liver or active biliary tract disease at the time of entrance into the study will be excluded. Patients with inadequate veins from which to obtain required samples will be excluded.</criteria>
