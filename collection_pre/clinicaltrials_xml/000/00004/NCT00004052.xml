	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and immunogenicity of a multivalent tumor-specific breakpoint peptide vaccine in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. - Determine the antileukemic effects of vaccination with these peptides in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive bcr/abl breakpoint peptide vaccine in QS21 adjuvant subcutaneously at rotated sites every 1-3 weeks (on or about days 0, 7, 21, 35, and 56) over 8 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients demonstrating a response by week 10 may receive 3 additional monthly vaccinations initiated within 8 weeks of the fifth dose. Patients demonstrating a response by vaccination 8 may receive 3 additional vaccinations administered at two-month intervals. Patients are followed at 2 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
