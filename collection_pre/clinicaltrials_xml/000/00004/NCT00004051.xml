	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, and safety profile of oral irinotecan in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Characterize the single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of oral irinotecan and its metabolites, SN-38 and SN-38 glucuronide, in these patients. III. Document any antitumor activity in these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral irinotecan once daily for 14 days. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
