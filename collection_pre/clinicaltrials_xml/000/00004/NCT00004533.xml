	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of recombinant adeno-associated virus-CFTR vector in patients with cystic fibrosis. II. Assess the safety of this gene therapy in these patients. III. Assess the in vivo gene transfer of this vector in these patients. IV. Assess the CFTR gene expression and physiologic activity following gene transfer in these patients. V. Assess the clinical impact of CFTR gene expression following gene transfer in these patients. VI. Monitor patient immune response directed against CFTR or vector components following vector administration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Randomized Study of Adeno-Associated Virus-CFTR Vector in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, dose escalation, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to receive either adeno-associated virus-CFTR (AAV-CFTR) vector or placebo. Patients undergo tests on days -10 to -4 to rule out adenovirus and adeno-associated virus infections. Patients then receive AAV-CFTR vector intranasally to the right or left inferior turbinates and placebo to the other side of the nose. The next day, patients receive an endobronchial dose of AAV-CFTR vector to the superior segment of the right lower lobe. Cohorts of 2-4 patients each receive escalating doses of AAV-CFTR vector until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose level immediately preceding the dose at which at least 2 subjects develop dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at day 10, then at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.</detailed_description>
