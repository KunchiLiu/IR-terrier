	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as ABX-EGF can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF in treating patients who have either renal (kidney), prostate, pancreatic, non-small cell lung, colon, rectal, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody ABX-EGF in Treating Patients With Renal (Kidney), Prostate, Pancreatic, Non-Small Cell Lung, Colon or Rectal, Esophageal, or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety of monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF in patients with renal, prostate, pancreatic, non-small cell lung, colorectal, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction cancer. - Determine the pharmacokinetics and the dose-response relationship of this drug in this patient population. - Evaluate the clinical effect of this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF IV over 1 hour once weekly on weeks 0-3* (enrollment for the weekly dosing schedule completed as of 4/21/03 [with the exception of patients undergoing full pharmacokinetic analyses, described below]) OR once every 2 weeks on weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6* OR once every 3 weeks on weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9*. Patients undergoing full pharmacokinetic analyses receive a loading dose on week 0 and the subsequent 3 doses on weeks 3-5. NOTE: *All patients receive a total of 4 doses. Cohorts of 2-8 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 or 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 5 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 76 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 14 months.</detailed_description>
