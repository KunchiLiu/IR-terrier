	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether Cushing's syndrome and stress-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome can be differentiated by evaluating endogenous corticotropin-releasing hormone activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Hypercortisolism in Cushing's Syndrome and Stress-Induced Pseudo-Cushing's Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients undergo a 30-hour infusion of deuterated cortisol with peripheral and petrosal vein measurements of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Patients also have a 2-day, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. Patients with ACTH tumors are referred for pituitary surgery as indicated. Patients without Cushing's syndrome are entered as controls. During scheduled radiologic procedures, these subjects undergo ACTH and CRH sampling from the petrosal vein or cavernous sinus following a deuterated cortisol infusion.</detailed_description>
