	<brief_title>DX-8951f in Treating Women Who Have Advanced or Recurrent Cancer of the Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of DX-8951f in women with advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. - Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive DX-8951f IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 37 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
