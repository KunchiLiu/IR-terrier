	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel in treating women who have ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer that has not responded to previous treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel in Treating Women With Ovarian Epithelial or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the activity of docetaxel in women with platinum resistant, refractory ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal serous cancer. OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive a minimum of 6 courses of therapy, including 2 courses beyond CR. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
