	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the biosynthesis of cholesterol and cholestanol, and measure the turnover of individual sterols and bile acids in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis before and after a cholesterol- and cholestanol-free diet. II. Assess the biosynthesis of cholesterol and cholestanol, and measure the turnover of individual sterols and bile acids in these patients before and after lovastatin and chenodeoxycholic acid.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Cholesterol- and Cholestanol-Free Diet, Lovastatin, and Chenodeoxycholic Acid for Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Following a 2-week baseline assessment, patients participate in a feeding study for up to 3 weeks. The diet is free of cholesterol and cholestanol. For the next 4 weeks, patients return to their typical diet and are medicated with daily lovastatin and chenodeoxycholic acid. The feeding study is repeated for an additional 3 weeks, with the patient taking either lovastatin or chenodeoxycholic acid.</detailed_description>
