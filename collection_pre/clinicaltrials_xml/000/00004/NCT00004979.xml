	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining topotecan and paclitaxel in treating patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer or other advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topotecan and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer or Other Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Phase I: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral topotecan combined with a fixed dose of paclitaxel in patients with advanced non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) and other advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the response rate of NSCLC patients treated at the MTD of oral topotecan combined with intravenous paclitaxel. III. Determine the dose limiting toxicities of this drug combination in this patient population. Phase II: IV. Determine the toxicities of this regimen at its MTD in patients with NSCLC. V. Determine time to response, response duration, survival, time to progression, and rate of stable disease of patients with NSCLC treated with this regimen at the MTD. VI. Assess changes in well-being of patients with NSCLC treated with this regimen at the MTD. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan. Patients receive oral topotecan on days 1-5 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients with non-small cell lung cancer are accrued to receive treatment with topotecan and paclitaxel at the recommended phase II dose. Quality of life is assessed in the phase II portion of the study at baseline, before each treatment course, and at the end of the study. Patients are followed at 3 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for the phase I dose escalation portion of this study. A total of 14-40 additional non-small cell lung cancer patients will be accrued to the phase II portion of this study.</detailed_description>
