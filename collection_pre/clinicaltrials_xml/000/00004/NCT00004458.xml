	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the developmental course (language acquisition, diagnostic stability, predictors of outcome, and restricted interests and behaviors) of childhood disintegrative disorder versus autism and non-autistic developmental delays. II. Collect data on molecular genetics of proband and family members.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longitudinal and Biological Study of Childhood Disintegrative Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are evaluated with the following questionnaires at ages 2-3 years and again at ages 5-9: The Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI); The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS); Assessment of cognitive functioning; Expressive and receptive language; Adaptive functioning; Measures of burden and functional assessment; The Aberrant Behavior Checklist; The Connors Rating Scale - Parent and Teacher version; and Autism Behavior Checklist An MRI and EEG are performed, and blood samples are collected from patients and family members for molecular genetic studies.</detailed_description>
