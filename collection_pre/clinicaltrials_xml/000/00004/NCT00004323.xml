	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of related, HLA-identical bone marrow transplantation following cyclophosphamide (CTX) and antithymocyte globulin in patients with aplastic anemia. II. Evaluate the efficacy of related, HLA-nonidentical bone marrow transplantation following CTX and total-body irradiation/total-lymphoid irradiation in patients with aplastic anemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Bone Marrow Transplantation Using Related Donors in Patients With Aplastic Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients with HLA-identical donors receive cyclophosphamide/mesna, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), and methylprednisolone (MePRDL), followed by allogeneic marrow transplantation. Patients with HLA-nonidentical (5/6 or 4/6) donors and those with a systemic reaction to ATG receive the same dosage of myeloablative chemotherapy and rescue. In addition, these patients are treated with total-body irradiation, total-lymphoid irradiation, and methotrexate. All patients received MePRDL and cyclosporine for graft-versus-host prophylaxis.</detailed_description>
