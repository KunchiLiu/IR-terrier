	<brief_title>Randomized Study of L-Baclofen in Patients With Refractory Trigeminal Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel study. Patients are randomized to receive either L-baclofen or placebo orally at increasing daily doses for 1 week. Patients then continue to receive the maximum dosage acceptable for a 1 week maintenance period. Patients, thereafter, may enroll in a long term open label study with L-baclofen. Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Completion date provided represents the completion date of the grant per OOPD records</detailed_description>
