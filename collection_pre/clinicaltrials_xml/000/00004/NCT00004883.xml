	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer that overexpresses HER2. Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Overexpresses HER2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the activity of trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients with stage IIIB or IV HER2-overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen. II. Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Assess levels of circulating HER2 and correlate with HER2 expression in this patient population. V. Correlate circulating HER2 levels with non-small cell lung cancer tissue HER2 expression. OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment continues once a week in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression or death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 84 patients (42 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 17.5 months.</detailed_description>
