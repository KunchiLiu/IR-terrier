	<brief_title>ISIS 2503 in Treating Patients With Metastatic and/or Locally Recurrent Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, duration of response, and time to progression in patients with metastatic and/or locally recurrent adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum treated with ISIS 2503, an antisense inhibitor of H-ras. II. Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ISIS 2503 IV continuously for 14 days. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
