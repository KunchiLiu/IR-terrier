	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Describe the psychosocial response of parents and caretakers who learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques for infants at high risk for respiratory or cardiac arrest. II. Compare the effect of 4 methods of CPR instruction on psychosocial response. III. Evaluate a psychological intervention based on social support theory designed to offset the potential adverse psychological outcomes of CPR instruction. IV. Evaluate a self-paced CPR learning module using the principles of adult learning theory. V. Document the level of CPR knowledge and skill retention over time. VI. Document the frequency of CPR and its outcome following a witnessed respiratory or cardiac arrest.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Effect of Four Methods of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Instruction on Psychosocial Response of Parents With Infants at Risk of Sudden Death</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Parents of high-risk infants are randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups; groups are alternated at each site and the sequence of groups at each site is randomly assigned. The first group receives a 90-minute, 1-person cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and obstructed airways management instruction. The second group receives the same instruction plus a 1-hour social support discussion. Ongoing support is provided with weekly phone calls to assess caretaker status and answer questions regarding the infant's health. The third group learns CPR using a self-paced multimedia learning module. The control group receives the standard CPR instruction at hospital discharge. Participants are followed at 2 weeks, then at 3 and 6 months.</detailed_description>
