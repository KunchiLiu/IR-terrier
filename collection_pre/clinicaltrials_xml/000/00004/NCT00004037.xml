	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel in treating patients with recurrent or refractory ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Ovarian or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the antitumor activity of docetaxel in patients with paclitaxel- and platinum-resistant, recurrent or refractory, ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer who have failed on higher priority treatment protocols. II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of docetaxel in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel as a 1 hour continuous intravenous infusion. Courses are repeated every 21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxic effects or disease progression. All patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-56 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
