	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of human botulism immune globulin (BIG) in patients with infant botulism by monitoring side effects (e.g., rash, fever, hypotension, and anaphylaxis). II. Assess the efficacy of BIG in these patients by monitoring disease severity, incidence of complications (respiratory arrest, aspiration, pneumonia, etc.), and length of hospital stay.</brief_summary>
