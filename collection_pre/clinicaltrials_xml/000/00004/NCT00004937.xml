	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of acridine carboxamide in treating patients who have recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acridine Carboxamide in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy acridine carboxzmide in terms of objective response rate and response duration in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. II. Determine the toxicities of this treatment regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive acridine carboxamide IV continuously over days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses and up to a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
