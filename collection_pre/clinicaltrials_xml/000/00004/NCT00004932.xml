	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may interfere with the growth of cancer cells and may be an effective treatment for leukemia. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in treating patients who have recurrent leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>STI571 in Treating Patients With Recurrent Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of imatinib mesylate in patients with recurrent Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia. - Characterize the pharmacokinetic behavior of this drug in this patient population. - Determine preliminarily the antileukemic activity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate (STI571) once daily for 28 days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of STI571 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 32 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.</detailed_description>
