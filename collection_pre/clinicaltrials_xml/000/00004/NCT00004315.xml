	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the bioavailability of polymer-coated and buffered ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) to unmodified ursodiol in patients with cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease or chronic cholestatic liver disease. II. Compare the differences in pruritus, weight gain, and liver function for both treatments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Pilot Study to Compare the Bioavailability of Buffered, Enteric-Coated Ursodiol With Unmodified Ursodiol for Chronic Cholestatic Liver Disease and Cystic Fibrosis-Associated Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are sequentially treated with 2 formulations of ursodeoxycholic acid: unmodified ursodiol (Actigall) and buffered, enteric-coated ursodiol (Ursocarb). There is a 24-hour washout between each 4-week course of therapy.</detailed_description>
