	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and efficacy of gene transfer into the nasal epithelium using Ad5-CB-CFTR, an E1-deleted adenovirus vector containing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene, in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). II. Determine whether ion transport abnormalities in CF airway cells can be corrected.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Pilot Study of Ad5-CB-CFTR, an Adenovirus Vector Containing the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Gene, in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Groups of 3 patients receive 1 of 4 doses of Ad5-CB-CFTR, a recombinant E1-deleted adenovirus serotype 5 vector containing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. Ad5-CB-CFTR is administered to 1 nasal cavity and the vehicle alone is administered to the opposite nasal cavity as the control.</detailed_description>
