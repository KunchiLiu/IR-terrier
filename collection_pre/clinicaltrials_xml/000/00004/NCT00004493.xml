	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) in patients with congenital lactic acidemia. II. Determine the efficacy of DCA in decreasing the frequency and/or severity of acute episodes of acidotic illness, improving linear growth, improving neurological or developmental function, or slowing neurological or developmental deterioration in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Pilot Randomized Study of Sodium Dichloroacetate in Patients With Congenital Lactic Acidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, cross over study. Patients are randomized to start with one of two different doses of sodium dichloroacetate (DCA). Patients receive one of two doses of oral DCA for 6 months, then switch to the alternate dose for 6 months. This course is repeated once. Patients are followed for up to 2 years. Completion date provided represents the completion date of the grant per OOPD records</detailed_description>
