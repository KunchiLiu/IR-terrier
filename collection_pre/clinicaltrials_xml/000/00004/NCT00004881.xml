	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, tolerance, and maximum tolerated dose of TG4010 in patients with MUC1 positive advanced cancer. II. Determine the biological and immunological effects of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive TG4010 IM weekly for 4 weeks, every other week for 8 weeks, and then every 4 weeks. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of TG4010 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients experience treatment related grade 3 toxicity. If any patient experiences grade 4 toxicity, the prior dose level is considered the MTD. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 months.</detailed_description>
