	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Biological therapies, such as QS21, use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus QS21 in treating patients who have small cell lung cancer that has responded to initial therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Plus QS21 in Treating Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Responded to Initial Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the antibody response after immunization with polysialic acid keyhole limpet hemocyanin (PSA-KLH) conjugate or N-propionylated PSA-KLH conjugate plus immunological adjuvant QS21 in patients with small cell lung cancer. II. Assess the clinical toxicities resulting from these regimens and from the immune response in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive polysialic acid keyhole limpet hemocyanin (PSA-KLH) conjugate or N-propionylated PSA-KLH conjugate plus immunological adjuvant QS21 subcutaneously weekly on weeks 1-4 and on weeks 8 and 16 for a total of 6 vaccinations. Patients are followed at 2 weeks, and then every 3 months for up to 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
