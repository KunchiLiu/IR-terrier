	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of gemcitabine plus either docetaxel or irinotecan in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Plus Docetaxel or Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the complete and overall response rate to gemcitabine and docetaxel versus gemcitabine and irinotecan in chemotherapy naive patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer. II. Compare the overall and failure free survival, duration of response, and toxicity associated with these combination regimens in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage (stage IIIB vs stage IV without CNS involvement vs stage IV with CNS involvement vs recurrent/progressive disease post surgery and/or radiotherapy). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes immediately followed by irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes immediately followed by docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving partial or complete response or stable disease receive treatment for least 6 courses and for 2 additional courses beyond the maximum response, and then at the investigator's discretion. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter until disease progression or death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients (36 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
