	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody F19 in treating patients who have advanced or metastatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody F19 in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Identify the toxicity associated with increasing doses of monoclonal antibody F19 (BIBH-1) administered weekly by intravenous infusion in patients with unresectable, advanced or metastatic fibroblast activation protein-positive colorectal cancer. II. Determine the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients. III. Measure induction titers of human anti-human antibody to BIBH-1 and correlate immunologic-related clinical effects. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and imaging characteristics of increasing intravenous doses of the drug. V. Document tumor responses in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, open label, multicenter study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody F19 (BIBH-1) IV over 60 minutes weekly for 12 weeks. The first, fifth, and ninth treatments are combined with iodine I 131. Patients with stable or responding disease may continue treatment for up to 12 months. The dose of BIBH-1 is escalated in cohorts of 3-6 patients until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months.</detailed_description>
