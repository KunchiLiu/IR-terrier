	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine specific clinical features, molecular abnormalities, and laboratory-based biological markers of free radical stress that are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and influence disease severity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determinants of Disease Severity in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a screening and diagnostic study. Blood and urine samples are collected from patients every 2 months for 1 year. All samples are evaluated for measures of free radical damage and levels of the body's own antioxidant activity.</detailed_description>
