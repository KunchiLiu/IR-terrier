	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of intravenous immunoglobulin on recovery time of patients with proximal diabetic neuropathy. II. Determine whether rate of response is dose dependent in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) in Patients With Subacute Proximal Diabetic Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are randomized to treatment with low dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), high dose IVIg, or placebo. Patients must first complete baseline evaluation. Patients receive IVIg or placebo on days 1, 2, 3, and 5, biweekly at weeks 2-4, weekly at weeks 5-8, and every other week at weeks 9-12. Patients are assessed at 6, 12, 36, 52, and 104 weeks. Completion date provided represents the completion date of the grant per OOPD records</detailed_description>
