	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of procarbazine in treating patients who have progressive or recurrent astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, or glioblastoma multiforme following treatment with radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Procarbazine in Treating Patients With Recurrent Brain Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral procarbazine when administered to patients with recurrent glioma receiving or not receiving anticonvulsants metabolized by the P450 hepatic enzyme complex. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of oral procarbazine, including any effects of hepatic enzyme inducing drugs, in these patients. - Assess the response rate to procarbazine in these patients. - Evaluate this regimen in terms of overall survival and duration of disease free survival in these patients. - Evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Phase I of this study is a dose escalation study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent use of anticonvulsant drugs that induce cytochrome P450 (yes vs no drugs or modest-induction drugs). - Phase I: Patients receive oral procarbazine once daily for 5 days. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of oral procarbazine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. - Phase II: Once the MTD is determined, patients receive procarbazine as in Phase I. Patients are followed every 2 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
