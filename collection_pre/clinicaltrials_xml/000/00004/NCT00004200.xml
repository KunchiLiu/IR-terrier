	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Prinomastat may stop the growth of glioblastoma multiforme by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of prinomastat plus temozolomide in treating patients who have newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prinomastat Plus Temozolomide Following Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the one year survival rate and progression free survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme treated with prinomastat (AG3340) or placebo and temozolomide following radiotherapy. II. Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients. III. Compare the quality of life in these patients on these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients receive oral prinomastat or placebo twice daily in combination with oral temozolomide daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
