	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the effects of ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid), with and without methotrexate, on pruritus, incapacitation index, and serum markers of activity and severity in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. II. Compare the effects of these regimens on the development of ascites, encephalopathy, varices (or bleeding from pre-existing varices), histologic liver changes, transplantation, and survival. III. Compare the toxicity and safety of each regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Randomized Study of Ursodiol With Vs Without Methotrexate for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by participating institution and Ludwig histologic stage. All patients are treated with ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid, UDCA) for 6 months. If entry criteria continue to be met, patients are randomly assigned to UDCA/methotrexate or UDCA/placebo. Combination therapy continues for at least 5 years.</detailed_description>
