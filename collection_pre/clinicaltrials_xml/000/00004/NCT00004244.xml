	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of interleukin-12 and interferon alfa in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer or malignant melanoma. Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Combining interleukin-12 and interferon alfa may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-12 and Interferon Alfa in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer or Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity of interleukin-12 and interferon alfa in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma or malignant melanoma. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of these drugs when concurrently administered in this patient population. III. Obtain preliminary data on the antitumor efficacy of this combination in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study, followed by a randomized study. Patients receive interleukin-12 subcutaneously (SC) twice a week and interferon alfa SC three times a week every week for 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of interleukin-12 and interferon alfa until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Once the MTD is established, additional patients are accrued and randomized to 1 of the following treatment arms: ARM I: Patients receive interleukin-12 SC twice a week for 2 weeks, followed by treatment with interleukin-12 in combination with interferon alfa as described above. ARM II: Patients receive interferon alfa SC three times a week for 2 weeks, followed by treatment with interleukin-12 in combination with interferon alfa as described above. ARM III: Patients receive treatment with interleukin-12 in combination with interferon alfa at the MTD as described above. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for the dose escalation portion of this study. An additional 18 patients (5 in arm I, 5 in arm II, and 8 in arm III) will be accrued to the randomized portion of this study.</detailed_description>
