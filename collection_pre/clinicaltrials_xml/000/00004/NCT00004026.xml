	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. CT-2584 may stop the growth of prostate cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CT-2584 in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to previous therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT-2584 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Previous Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of 2 different treatment schedules of CT-2584 in patients with hormone refractory, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive CT-2584 IV over 6 hours daily for 3 days every 3 weeks. Arm II: Patients receive CT-2584 IV over 6 hours once every 7 days for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 80 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
