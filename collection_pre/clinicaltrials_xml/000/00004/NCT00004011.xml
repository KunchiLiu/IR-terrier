	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known if surgery plus combination chemotherapy is more effective than surgery alone for non-small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery with or without combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S9900: Surgery With or Without Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare survival of patients with previously untreated stage IB, II, or selected IIIA non-small cell lung cancer after preoperative chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel and carboplatin plus surgery vs surgery alone. - Compare these regimens in terms of operative mortality and other toxic effects in these patients. - Evaluate the response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed) and toxic effects associated with combined paclitaxel and carboplatin in these patients. - Obtain samples for correlation of radiologic, pathologic, molecular, and biologic factors with the outcome in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to clinical stage (IB or IIA vs IIB or IIIA). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms: - Arm I: Patients undergo thoracotomy. All accessible hilar (level 10) lymph nodes are dissected, and complete mediastinal lymph node sampling is performed. - Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 2-6 weeks of course 3, patients undergo thoracotomy and lymph node dissection as in arm I. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually until year 10. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients (300 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 4 years.</detailed_description>
