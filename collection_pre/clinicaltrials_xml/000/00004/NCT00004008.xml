	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 in treating patients who have ovarian epithelial cancer that has not responded to previous chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bryostatin 1 in Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the antitumor activity and toxicity of bryostatin 1 in patients with platinum resistant ovarian epithelial cancer. - Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours. Treatment repeats weekly for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable or regressive disease may receive additional treatment. Patients are followed for at least 4 weeks after treatment, then every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
