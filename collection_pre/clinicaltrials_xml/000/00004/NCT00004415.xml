	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether combined intercostal muscle and diaphragm pacing can maintain full-time ventilatory support in patients with ventilatory dependent quadriplegia who are not candidates for phrenic nerve pacing alone. II. Evaluate the efficacy of the Medlink device to produce synchronous intercostal and diagram activation in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Combined Intercostal and Diaphragm Pacing for Artificial Respiration in Quadriplegic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients have a Medlink spinal cord electrode surgically implanted and attached to a radiofrequency receiver implanted subcutaneously over the anterior chest wall. If substantial inspired volumes can be generated by intercostal pacing, a phrenic nerve cuff electrode and radiofrequency receiver are implanted, and patients undergo combined intercostal muscle and diaphragm pacing.
