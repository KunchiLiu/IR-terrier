	<brief_title>Phase II/III Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Dehydroepiandrosterone in Women With Mild to Moderate Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by participating institution. Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 doses of oral dehydroepiandrosterone or placebo, administered daily for a minimum of 7 months.
