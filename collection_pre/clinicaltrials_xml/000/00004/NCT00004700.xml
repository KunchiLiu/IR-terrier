	<brief_title>Phase II Long Term, Randomized Study of Recombinant Human Insulin-like Growth Factor I in Children With Hyperinsulinism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study. Patients are randomized to receive recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) or placebo subcutaneously twice daily for 4 weeks. After a 2 week washout period, patients are crossed over to the other regimen for an additional 4 weeks.
