	<brief_summary>Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carboxyamidotriazole plus radiation therapy in treating patients who have newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboxyamidotriazole + RT in Treating Patients Newly Diagnosed Supratentorial GBM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate overall survival rate in patients administered CAI (carboxyamidotriazole) and radiation therapy to adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. II. To determine the toxicity of CAI when combined with cranial irradiation. III. To estimate correlations between pharmacokinetic parameters, including steady state CAI concentration, with toxicity and/or drug activity in this patient population. IV. To estimate duration of disease free progression with this treatment regime. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive induction therapy consisting of radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week plus oral carboxyamidotriazole once daily for 6 weeks followed by carboxyamidotriazole alone daily for 4 weeks. Patients continue on oral carboxyamidotriazole once daily as maintenance therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued for this study over 1.5 years.</detailed_description>
