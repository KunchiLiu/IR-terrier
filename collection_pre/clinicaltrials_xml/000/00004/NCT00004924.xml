	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel together with irinotecan works in treating patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel and Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity and toxicities of irinotecan and paclitaxel in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed immediately by irinotecan IV over 30 minutes. Treatment continues weekly for 2 weeks followed by one week of rest. Courses are repeated every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-22 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.</detailed_description>
