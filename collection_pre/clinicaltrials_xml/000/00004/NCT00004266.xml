	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Establish a long-term working relationship between clinical investigators and the Minnesota American Indian community. II. Compare the effectiveness of lisinopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) and nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) in preventing nephropathy and vascular disease in Minnesota American Indians with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria. III. Compare the effectiveness of simvastatin (a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor) with lipid-lowering strategies recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program in preventing nephropathy and vascular diseases in these patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups; therapy continues for 3 years. All patients receive instruction on diet, exercise, and smoking cessation. The first group receives daily nifedipine at a dose adjusted for high blood pressure. Cholestyramine or gemfibrozil is administered per National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. Diuretics and doxazosin may be given concurrently. The second group receives daily lisinopril at a dose adjusted for high blood pressure. Cholestyramine or gemfibrozil is administered per National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. Diuretics and doxazosin may be given concurrently. The third group receives daily nifedipine at a dose adjusted for high blood pressure, and simvastatin at a dose adjusted for high low-density lipoproteins. Supplemental cholestyramine may be given as needed. If cholestyramine is not tolerated or if triglycerides are high, gemfibrozil is substituted for cholestyramine. The fourth group receives lisinopril at a dose adjusted for high blood pressure and simvastatin at a dose adjusted for high low-density lipoproteins.</detailed_description>
