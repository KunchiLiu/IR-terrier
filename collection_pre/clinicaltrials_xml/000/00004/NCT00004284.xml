	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the ability of a slow-releasing formulation of neutral potassium phosphate to correct hypercalciuria and prevent recurrent stone formation in patients with absorptive hypercalciuria. II. Evaluate the safety of this treatment. III. Compare the efficacy of potassium phosphate to that of potassium citrate.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by participating institution. Patients receive potassium phosphate or potassium citrate tablets twice a day for 3 years.</detailed_description>
