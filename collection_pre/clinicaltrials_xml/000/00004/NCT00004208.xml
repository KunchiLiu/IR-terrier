	<brief_summary>The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of intensive immuno-suppression with ATG + CSA versus best supportive care in patients with transfusion dependent low and intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antithymocyte Globulin and Cyclosporine in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial will answer the question whether immuno-suppression improves hematopoesis and reduces transfusion requirements analogous to patients with aplastic anemia as the short-term outcome, and whether immuno-suppression accelerates leukemic transformation and influences survival as the long-term outcome. Primary endpoint: best response (CR + PR) rate at month 6</detailed_description>
