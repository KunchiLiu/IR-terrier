	<brief_summary>Please note that the continuation study can be found at http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00633880. RATIONALE: Neurogenic hypotension is a fall in blood pressure that occurs when one moves from a lying down to a standing position or after eating a meal. It causes one to feel dizzy, light headed, and weak. Neurogenic hypotension is caused by a problem in the part of the nervous system that controls such functions as heart rate and blood pressure. Droxidopa, a drug that may increase blood pressure, may be an effective treatment for neurogenic hypotension. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of droxidopa in treating patients who have neurogenic hypotension.</brief_summary>
