	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of acridine carboxamide in treating patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be treated with surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acridine Carboxamide in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of acridine carboxamide on objective response, response rate, and duration of response in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, progressive or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive acridine carboxamide IV over 24 hours for 5 days. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression or commencement of another treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
