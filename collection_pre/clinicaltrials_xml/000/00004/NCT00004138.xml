	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET), may improve the ability to detect the extent of non-small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to study the effectiveness of PET for detecting lesions in patients who have newly diagnosed stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Positron Emission Tomography for Detecting Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary Objective: To ascertain whether FDG-PET scanning can detect lesions that would preclude pulmonary resection in patients found to be surgical candidates by standard imaging procedures. Secondary Objectives: To use the data collected to generate hypotheses to be used in future studies, such as which types of previously undetected lesions FDG-PET is best able to identify. Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) IV followed 45-60 minutes later by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Confirmatory studies, such as biopsy, fine needle aspiration, or other imaging studies are then conducted to confirm the PET findings. Patients with no mediastinal nodal or distant metastases identified by FDG-PET scan may undergo thoracotomy and pulmonary resection within 1 month of evaluation. Patients are followed at 5-6 months after surgery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient must be â‰¥ 18 years of age. 2. a) Patient must have histologically or cytologically confirmed, newly diagnosed, untreated, single lesion bronchogenic NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, nonlobar/non diffuse bronchioloalveolor cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma). OR b) Patient is eligible based upon mediastinal node histology diagnosed by transbronchial biopsy, and if a separate ipsilateral lung lesion is clearly evident on radiographs, biopsy of the lung tumor is not required for this patient. OR c) Patient may be eligible without histologic or cytologic proof if; The patient is strongly suspected to have primary bronchogenic carcinoma (e.g., heavy smoker with a new peripheral mass with typical appearance of lung cancer on chest radiograph although bronchoscopy and/or fine needle aspiration is nondiagnostic), and The tumor is clinically resectable, and An exploratory thoracotomy is planned. 3. Patient must be medically fit for surgical staging procedures following the thoracic surgeon's evaluation of general medical fitness. 4. Patient must be a candidate for resection of the clinical stage I, II, or IIIa lesion. 5. Patient must be able to tolerate PET, (i.e., not claustrophobic and able to lie supine for 1.5 hrs). 6. A signed and dated written informed consent must be obtained from the patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative prior to study participation. 7. Female patient of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test, 72 hours prior to FDGPET. NOTE: This is in order to avoid unnecessary fetal radiation exposure and because the use of furosemide is contraindicated in pregnancy. 8. Patient must complete the following standard staging procedures 60 days prior to registration. CT scan of the chest and upper abdomen (include adrenals) with contrast NOTE: Noncontrast CT scan may be used for patients with a peripheral suspicious nodule and no evidence of hilar or mediastinal adenopathy or invasion of central structures. All other lesions require IV contrast. Bone scan CT scan of the brain with and without contrast or MRI of brain 9. A cancer survivor is eligible provided that ALL the following criteria are met and documented: the patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies, and there has been no evidence of any prior malignancies for at least five years (except for completely resected cervical or nonmelanoma skin cancer), and the patient is deemed by their treating physician to be at low risk for recurrence from prior malignancies. 1. Patient has had a prior PET scan for evaluation of their NSCLC. 2. Patient has evidence of stage IIIB or IV disease confirmed by diagnostic imaging such as chest Xray, CT chest, CT abdomen, CT brain or MRI brain, and bone scan. 3. Patient has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, as evidenced by a fasting blood glucose value &gt;200 mg/dL, within 12 hours of PET scan.</criteria>
