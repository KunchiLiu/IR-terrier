	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imaging procedures such as MRI or CT scans may improve the ability to detect cervical cancer and determine the extent of disease. PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to determine the effectiveness of MRI and CT scans in evaluating invasive cervical cancer before treatment of patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI and CT Scans to Evaluate Invasive Cervical Cancer Before Treating Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and clinical FIGO staging in patients with invasive cervical cancer. - Compare the accuracy of MRI, CT, and clinical FIGO staging in the evaluation of morphologic tumor prognostic factors in FIGO stage IB1 and stage IB2 and greater in these patients. - Examine the value of imaging assessment of tumor prognostic factors (alone or in combination) as predictors of recurrence within 2 years of surgery in these patients. - Evaluate the quality of life in the 12-month period after staging and treatment to potentially change staging accuracy. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo a computed tomography scan with iodinated contrast dye followed by a magnetic resonance imaging scan with or without contrast comprising gadopentetate dimeglumine or vice versa. Within 6 weeks of first protocol imaging study, patients undergo one of the following surgeries: - Laparoscopic, transabdominal, or transvaginal hysterectomy - Extrafascial total abdominal hysterectomy - Trachelectomy Quality of life is assessed at 1 and 12 months. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 465 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
