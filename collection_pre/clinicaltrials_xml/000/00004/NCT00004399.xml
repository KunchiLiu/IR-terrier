	<brief_title>Randomized Study of Nimodipine Versus Magnesium Sulfate in the Prevention of Eclamptic Seizures in Patients With Severe Preeclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, international, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to receive either nimodipine or magnesium sulfate. Arm I: Patients receive nimodipine by mouth every 4 hours. Treatment is continued until 24 hours post-partum. Arm II: Patients receive a loading dose of magnesium sulfate IV for 20 minutes, followed by continuous infusion of magnesium sulfate. Treatment is continued until 24 hours post-partum.</detailed_description>
