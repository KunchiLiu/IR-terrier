	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of tocladesine in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tocladesine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of 8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-chloro-cAMP) in patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma. II. Evaluate the efficacy of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive 8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-chloro-cAMP) over 120 hours every 2 weeks for up to 4 courses. Beginning with course 5, patients with stable or responsive disease receive 8-chloro-cAMP over 120 hours every 3 weeks until disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 29 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
