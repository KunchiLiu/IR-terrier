	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is more effective than placebo in restoring neurologic function (muscle strength) in patients with multiple sclerosis. II. Determine the time to recovery following IVIG.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Intravenous Immune Globulin for Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are treated with intravenous immune globulin or placebo. In the absence of a hypersensitivity reaction to a test dose, a total of 11 doses is administered: daily for 5 days, then every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Patients are followed at 3 months.</detailed_description>
