	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy or radiation therapy that was used to kill cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who have multiple myeloma, chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, or agnogenic myeloid metaplasia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma, Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, or Agnogenic Myeloid Metaplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) following high-dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation in patients with multiple myeloma, agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, or chronic myelogenous leukemia in first or second chronic phase. - Determine the efficacy of BMT following busulfan and cyclophosphamide in these patients. - Determine the toxic effects of these preparative regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by remission (first vs second vs third). Patients who have not undergone prior radiotherapy receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -6 and -5 and then undergo total body irradiation twice a day on days -4 to -1. Allogeneic bone marrow is infused on day 0. Patients who have undergone prior radiotherapy receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 or -6 to -3 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2. Allogeneic bone marrow is infused on day 0. Patients are followed at days 30 and 90, at 6 months, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
