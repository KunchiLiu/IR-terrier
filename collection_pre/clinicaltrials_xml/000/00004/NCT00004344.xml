	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Subjects are treated for 2 months with depot injections of leuprolide acetate every 4 weeks and testosterone replacement every 2 weeks. Hormone levels are tested every other week. If luteinizing hormone and follicular-stimulating hormone levels are at or below detection on day 56, blood is drawn for a testis-stimulating factor bioassay and subsequent factor purification and characterization. Volunteers are asked to repeat this 2-month procedure no more than 2 times every 12 months.</detailed_description>
