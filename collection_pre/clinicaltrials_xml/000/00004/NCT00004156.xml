	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if immunization with glycosylated MUC-1 antigen containing MUC-1(106) or MUC-1(33) with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate plus immunological adjuvant QS21 induces an antibody, helper T cell and/or cytotoxic T cell response against MUC-1 in patients with high risk breast cancer expressing MUC-1. OUTLINE: Patients receive glycosylated MUC-1 antigen containing MUC-1(106) or MUC-1(33) with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate subcutaneously (SQ) plus immunological adjuvant QS21 SQ on weeks 1-3, 7, and 19 for a total of 5 vaccinations. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
