	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of local care alone vs local care plus arginine butyrate in terms of healing rate in patients with refractory sickle cell ulcers. II. Determine the effect of arginine butyrate therapy on tissue factors related to promotion or inhibition of wound healing in these patients. III. Determine whether the regimen used in this study is appropriate for testing in pivotal trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Randomized Trial:Arginine Butyrate Plus Standard Local Therapy in Patients With Refractory Sickle Cell Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive arginine butyrate IV over 6-9 hours at night 5 days a week for 12 weeks, plus concurrent standard local therapy consisting of cleaning, saline irrigation, and dressing changes as prescribed by each patient's physician. Patients who experience progressive healing receive arginine butyrate 3-4 times a week. Arginine butyrate treatment may be discontinued and reinstated following a single 2 week medical complication. Arm II: Patients receive standard local therapy alone for 12 weeks. Patients randomized to arm II may cross over to receive arginine butyrate if no or less than 25% healing is observed after 12 weeks. Patients whose ulcers have closed by at least 15% per cycle may receive 2 additional 8-week cycles of arginine butyrate therapy and are followed for 2 months after healing is completed.</detailed_description>
