	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety, tolerance, and potential efficacy of 3 doses of human anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) monoclonal antibody SDZ MSL-109 (MOAB MSL-109) in the treatment of newborns with congenital CMV infection and no central nervous system disease. II. Determine the relationship between plasma concentrations of MOAB MSL-109 and therapeutic outcome. III. Determine whether MOAB MSL-109 influences the antibody response and clearance of virus from the urine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study of Human Anti-Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Monoclonal Antibody MSL-109 in Newborns With Symptomatic Congenital CMV Infection Without Central Nervous System Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are treated with human anti-cytomegalovirus monoclonal antibody MSL-109, administered intravenously every other week for a total of 3 doses. Groups of 6 patients are treated at each of 3 MSL-109 doses; there is no intrapatient escalation. No concurrent therapy with antibiotics for systemic infection, parenteral antifungal agents, biological response modifiers, or other antiviral agents is allowed. Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 6 weeks, every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, then annually for 5 years.</detailed_description>
