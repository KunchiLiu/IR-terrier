	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of vasoactive intestinal peptide in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. II. Evaluate the safety and pharmacodynamic activity of this peptide in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide in Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) IV over either 6 or 12 hours. Cohorts of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of VIP over either 6 or 12 hours until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. Patients are followed for 30 days.</detailed_description>
