	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Establish linkage in families with hereditary pancreatitis between the phenotype and a chromosomal locus (loci) that contains the responsible gene.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Linkage Study for Hereditary Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a genetics study. Blood samples are collected from patients and family members. DNA is extracted from the blood and used for genotypic analysis and linkage analysis. Patients do not necessarily receive the results of the genetic testing and the results do not influence the type or duration of treatment.</detailed_description>
