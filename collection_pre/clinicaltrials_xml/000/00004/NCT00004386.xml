	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering recombinant adenovirus containing the ornithine transcarbamylase gene to adults with partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Pilot Study of Liver-Directed Gene Therapy for Partial Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This a dose escalation study to estimate the maximum tolerated dose of recombinant adenovirus encoded with the ornithine transcarbamylase gene. Patients receive a single dose of virus infused into the liver under fluoroscopic guidance. Groups of 3 patients receive successively higher doses of virus; each cohort is observed for safety for 3 weeks before entry of the next group. Patients are followed weekly for 1 month, then every 3 months until stable.</detailed_description>
