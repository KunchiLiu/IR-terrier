	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine and cisplatin in treating patients who have metastatic or recurrent solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with metastatic or recurrent nonhematologic malignancies. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of gemcitabine. Patients receive gemcitabine IV on days 1 and 8, followed immediately by cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 8. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 5 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
