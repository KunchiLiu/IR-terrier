	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of capecitabine in treating patients who have malignant mesothelioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, overall survival, and failure free survival of patients with malignant mesothelioma treated with capecitabine. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-9 months.</detailed_description>
