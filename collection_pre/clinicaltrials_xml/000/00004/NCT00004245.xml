	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of sodium salicylate in treating patients who have advanced myelodysplastic syndrome , acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sodium Salicylate in Treating Patients With Advanced Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the safety, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of sodium salicylate in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome; newly diagnosed, relapsed, or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia; or relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. - Define biologic characteristics that influence the likelihood of a clinical response to this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sodium salicylate twice a day. Intrapatient dose escalation or de-escalation is permitted. Treatment continues for up to 6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Responding patients may continue to receive sodium salicylate beyond the 6-week period. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia are followed until the end of therapy. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome are followed until death or progression to leukemia. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
