	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Clinically evaluate members from families with a dominantly inherited ataxia and collect blood, skin and muscle samples for detailed molecular studies. II. Perform detailed clinical evaluations on patients with recessively inherited ataxias.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical and Molecular Correlations in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 10 (SCA10)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Participants undergo a comprehensive clinical and molecular evaluation. Studies include: neurologic evaluation, including magnetic resonance imaging and nerve conduction studies; ophthalmologic exam; audiologic exam, including auditory brain stem evoked response; DNA extraction from blood, skin and muscle; genotype phenotype correlation. A neuropathologic evaluation is conducted postmortem, when possible.</detailed_description>
