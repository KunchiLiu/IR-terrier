	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying temozolomide to see how well it works in treating patients with mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome that has not responded to previous treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Mycosis Fungoides or Sezary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate to temozolomide in patients with relapsed mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Correlate pretreatment AGT activity in tumor cells with response to this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for a maximum of 1 year. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
