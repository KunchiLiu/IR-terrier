	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of inhaled doxorubicin in treating patients who have primary lung cancer or lung metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inhaled Doxorubicin in Treating Patients With Primary Lung Cancer or Lung Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and phase II dose of inhaled doxorubicin administered every 3 weeks in patients with primary lung cancer or cancer metastatic to the lung. - Determine the toxic effects and pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in this patient population. - Examine the relationship between pharmacodynamic parameters and toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Obtain preliminary evidence of therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive inhaled doxorubicin every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for a maximum of 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients may reenter at a higher dose level after a 3-month waiting period. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 6 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
