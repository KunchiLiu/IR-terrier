	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: To compare efficacy, toxicity and quality of life of the sequential administration of Her alone followed, at PD, by the combination with Chemotherapy (Arm A) vs. the upfront combination of Her and Chemotherapy (Arm B) in patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer. PURPOSE: Trial SAKK 22/99 addresses clinically relevant and currently unresolved questions regarding the optimal use of Herceptin in the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
