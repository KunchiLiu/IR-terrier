	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Hypogonadotropism is an abnormal condition caused by decreased production of gonadotropins, a group of hormones that stimulate the parts of the reproductive system that produce and release eggs from the ovaries or sperm from the testicles. Leuprolide may stimulate the production of gonadotropins and be effective in increasing testosterone in men and inducing ovulation in women. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of leuprolide in treating adults who have hypogonadotropism.</brief_summary>
