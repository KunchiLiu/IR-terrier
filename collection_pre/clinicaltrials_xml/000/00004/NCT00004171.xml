	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation Following Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Hodgkin's Disease or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and response to intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have received prior chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -9 to -6 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -5 to -2. Autologous peripheral blood stem cells are reinfused on day 0. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven Hodgkin's disease OR Histologically proven nonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) Intermediate grade OR Large cell immunoblastic (high grade) Refractory to standard therapy or relapsed following initial complete remission Must have received radiotherapy to the extent that no longer eligible for involved field radiation, cyclophosphamide, or total body irradiation No CNS disease A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
