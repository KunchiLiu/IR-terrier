	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of oral ribose in patients with a complex 5'-nucleotidase syndrome who have not received uridine (UR) and thymidine (TDR). II. Evaluate the efficacy of UR/oral ribose and UR/TDR. III. Evaluate the efficacy of oral ribose given in combination with UR/TDR.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Ribose, Uridine, and Thymidine for a Complex Syndrome Involving Excessive 5'-Nucleotidase Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Newly identified patients receive ribose daily for 8 weeks. Patients who improve continue therapy. If improvement then reaches a plateau, uridine (UR) and thymidine (TDR) are added to the regimen. Patients who receive no benefit after 8 weeks of ribose are treated with UR/TDR. Patients who improve after 8 weeks of this combination continue therapy. Ribose is added to the treatment regimen for patients on UR/TDR at entry. At maximal improvement, TDR and UR are sequentially tapered.</detailed_description>
