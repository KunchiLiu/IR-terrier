	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of DX-8951f in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity of DX-8951f in women with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who have failed prior therapy with an anthracycline and a taxane. II. Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this drug in these patients. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive DX-8951f IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Courses repeat every 21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
