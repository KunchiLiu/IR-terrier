	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of antiparasitic treatment with albendazole on the severity and duration of epilepsy due to neurocysticercosis. II. Determine the effect of a short course of albendazole on Taenia solium cysts present in the brain. III. Determine the natural regression of cerebral T. solium cysts in patients given placebo and their response to treatment at the end of the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study of Albendazole in Patients With Epilepsy Due to Neurocysticercosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are randomized to receive either albendazole and dexamethasone or placebo. Patients receive phenytoin daily starting on day 1 and continuing until seizure free for 1 year. Albendazole and dexamethasone or placebo only is administered orally once daily on days 5-15. Patients are asked to maintain a diary. Patients are followed on day 15 and 30, then every 3 months for 3 years. Completion date provided represents the completion date of the grant per OOPD records</detailed_description>
