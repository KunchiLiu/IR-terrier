	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, carmustine, and lomustine, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy and temozolomide to see how well they work compared to radiation therapy and carmustine or lomustine in treating patients with anaplastic astrocytoma or mixed gliomas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Combined With Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Anaplastic Astrocytoma or Mixed Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the overall survival and time to tumor progression in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma or mixed gliomas treated with radiotherapy combined with temozolomide vs carmustine or lomustine vs temozolomide and carmustine (arm discontinued as of 8/15/02). - Compare the relative toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. - Correlate molecular analyses with overall survival and time to tumor progression in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (under 50 vs 50 and over), Karnofsky performance status (60-80% vs 90-100%), and prior surgery (biopsy only vs resection). Phase I (closed as of 8/15/02) - Prior to initiating the randomization to 1 of 3 treatment arms in phase III, 15 patients are accrued to arm III. If 2 or more of the first 15 patients experience grade 3 or worse pulmonary toxicity OR if 5 or more of the first 15 patients experience grade 4-5 thrombocytopenia/neutropenia, then arm III treatment is discontinued. Phase III - Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5 of the first week of radiotherapy. Chemotherapy repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 12 courses. - Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients receive carmustine IV or lomustine IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3 of the first week of radiotherapy and a second course on days 56-58. Chemotherapy repeats every 8 weeks for a total of 6 courses. - Arm III (discontinued as of 8/15/02): Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients receive carmustine IV or lomustine IV over 3 hours on day 5 and oral temozolomide (2 hours after completion of carmustine or lomustine infusion) on days 1-5 of the first week of radiotherapy. Combination chemotherapy repeats every 8 weeks for 6 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study and then a total of 454 patients (227 per treatment arm) will be accrued for phase III of the study within 4 years. (Phase I closed as of 8/15/02)</detailed_description>
