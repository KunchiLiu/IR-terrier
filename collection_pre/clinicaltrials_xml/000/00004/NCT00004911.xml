	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: The use of endoscopy to place a metal stent in the large intestine is less invasive than surgery for treating cancer-related bowel obstruction and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of endoscopic placement of a metal stent in treating patients who have cancer-related bowel obstruction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Placement of Metal Stent in Patients With Cancer-Related Bowel Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response and clinical outcome in patients with colonic obstruction secondary to malignancy treated with enteral Wallstents. - Evaluate the efficacy and safety of this treatment in these patients. - Evaluate the quality of life of these patients after enteral Wallstent placement. OUTLINE: All patient undergo a colonoscopy, followed by placement of an enteral Wallstent through an endoscope under fluoroscopic guidance into the large intestine. Quality of life is assessed at 48 hours and 6 months after the procedure. Patients are followed at 48 hours, 30 days, 6 months, and then yearly thereafter until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
