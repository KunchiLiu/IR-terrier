	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and efficacy of tobramycin in patients with cystic fibrosis who are chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. II. Determine whether this treatment produces tobramycin-resistant bacteria at a frequency different from the placebo group and whether the emergence of resistance is associated with a lack of clinical response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Randomized Study of the Inhalation of Tobramycin in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients receive tobramycin or placebo by inhalation twice daily for 28 days followed by 28 days of rest. This treatment is repeated twice, for a total of 3 courses of therapy. Patients are followed every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks, then every 4 weeks, and then at 4 weeks after the last treatment.</detailed_description>
