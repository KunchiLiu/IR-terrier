	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Confirm the efficacy demonstrated in a pilot study using high dose cyclophosphamide in patients with severe aplastic anemia. II. Determine whether the addition of filgrastim (G-CSF) to high dose cyclophosphamide shortens the time to recovery in these patients. III. Determine whether this regimen is efficacious in treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of High Dose Cyclophosphamide in Patients With Severe Aplastic Anemia and Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive high dose cyclophosphamide IV on days 1-4. Beginning on day 10, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) until the absolute neutrophil count is greater than 1,000/mm3 for 2 consecutive days. Patients are followed every 3 months for at least 2 years and annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
