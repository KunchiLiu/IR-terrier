	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin and paclitaxel in treating patients who have metastatic or unresectable cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin and paclitaxel in patients with metastatic or unresectable cancer. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the therapeutic response to this regimen in these patients. - Determine the relationship between the pharmacokinetics of this regimen and toxicity and response in these patients. - Determine the effects of oxaliplatin on peripheral blood cells and correlate this to pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and response in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours followed by paclitaxel IV over 1 hour weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin and paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
