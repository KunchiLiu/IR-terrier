	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of lucinactant administered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in the treatment of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) in newborn infants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Randomized Study of Lucinactant in Full Term Newborn Infants With Meconium Aspiration Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive lucinactant by bronchoalveolar lavage, into the right and left lung, followed by lung drainage. Treatment repeats when patient stabilizes or every 15 minutes for 2 courses.
