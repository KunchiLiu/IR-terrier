	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known which regimen of combination chemotherapy is most effective for lymphoblastic lymphoma. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying different regimens of combination chemotherapy to compare how well they work in treating children or adolescents with newly diagnosed stage III or stage IV lymphoblastic lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotx in Treating Children or Adolescents With Newly Diagnosed Stg III or Stg IV Lymphoblastic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the event-free survival and overall survival of children or adolescents with newly diagnosed disseminated stage III or IV lymphoblastic lymphoma treated with 4 chemotherapy regimens*. - Determine whether treatment with a regimen without methotrexate maintains the same disease-free survival as NHL/BFM 90 in these patients. - Determine whether intensification with anthracycline and cyclophosphamide improves disease-free survival in these patients. - Collect outcome data on uniformly treated patients with localized disease or CNS-positive disease. - Determine whether rapid reduction in tumor volume by chest radiography and CT scan is predictive of improved outcome in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the prevalence of bone marrow involvement at presentation in these patients. - Determine whether peripheral blood can replace bone marrow in the initial staging of these patients. - Determine the clinical significance of bone marrow and peripheral blood involvement in these patients. NOTE: *All patients as of 4/2006 receive treatment on Arm III regimen only OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease characteristics (disseminated lymphoblastic lymphoma vs localized lymphoblastic lymphoma [localized lymphoblastic lymphoma is closed to accrual as of 10/2005]) and age. Patients with CNS negative disseminated lymphoblastic lymphoma are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms*. Patients with testicular involvement at diagnosis are nonrandomly assigned to arm IV and do not receive testicular radiotherapy. Patients with localized lymphoblastic lymphoma (closed to accrual as of 10/2005) are not randomized.
