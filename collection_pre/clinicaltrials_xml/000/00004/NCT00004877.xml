	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-214662 in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-214662 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, recommended phase II dose, and safety of BMS-214662 in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of BMS-214662 in these patients. III. Assess the absolute oral bioavailability of BMS-214662 using a capsule and single intravenous dose in these patients. IV. Determine any preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of BMS-214662 in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive BMS-214662 IV over 1 hour on day -7, followed by oral BMS-214662 daily on days 0-14 for course 1 only. Beginning with course 2, patients receive oral BMS-214662 twice daily for 14 days. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-214662 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which fewer than 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until toxicities resolve. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
