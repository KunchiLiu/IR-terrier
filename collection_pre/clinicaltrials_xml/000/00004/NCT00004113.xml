	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who have recurrent malignant glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and efficacy of temozolomide in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. II. Determine the radiographic response to this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the time to tumor progression of these patients on this regimen. IV. Determine the quality of life of these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily for 42 days. Courses repeat every 70 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed every 1-2 months. Patients are followed every 3-4 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
