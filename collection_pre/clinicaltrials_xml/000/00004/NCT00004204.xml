	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who have recurrent or progressive malignant glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the progression-free survival and response rate of patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma treated with temozolomide. - Determine whether certain categories of malignant gliomas, such as oligodendroglioma, are more sensitive to temozolomide. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to histologic categories (recurrent glioblastoma multiforme [closed to accrual 11/30/01] vs recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma vs recurrent anaplastic oligodendroglioma). Patients receive oral temozolomide twice daily for 5 consecutive days. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
