	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of carmustine in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for recurrent malignant glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carmustine in Treating Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety of polifeprosan 20 with carmustine implant (GLIADEL) in patients undergoing surgery for recurrent malignant glioma. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. All patients undergo maximal tumor resection. At the time of surgery, groups of 6 patients receive up to 8 polifeprosan 20 wafers containing increasing doses of carmustine implanted into the resection cavity. Patients with an intraoperative diagnosis other than glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma do not receive wafer implantation, and are removed from study. Patients are followed 3, 6, and 12 months after implantation. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
