	<brief_title>Phase I Study of the Third Generation Adenovirus H5.001CBCFTR in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: H5.001CBCFTR, an adenovirus vector containing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene, is administered endobronchially. Cohort of 2 patients receive 1 of 6 H5.001CBCFTR concentrations. There is no intrapatient dose escalation.</detailed_description>
