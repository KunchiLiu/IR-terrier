	<brief_title>Heat Therapy in Treating Patients With Unresectable Primary or Metastatic Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation in patients with primary or metastatic liver cancer. II. Determine disease free survival, local recurrence rate in treated lesions as compared to known recurrence rates after hepatic cryoablation, and overall survival in this patient population receiving this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients undergo laparoscopic or open laparotomy surgical procedure to identify unresectable tumors by ultrasound. Tumors are heated to a target temperature by electrodes for a maximum of 20 minutes. To achieve a 1 cm margin of ablated tissue around each lesion, multiple ablation courses may be performed, depending on the size of the lesions and the time required to complete the treatment. Patients may be retreated if tumor recurs or new disease appears. Patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for next 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 59 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
