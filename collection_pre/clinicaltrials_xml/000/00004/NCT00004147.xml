	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: COL-3 may stop the growth of brain tumors by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of COL-3 in treating patients who have progressive or recurrent brain tumors following radiation therapy or chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COL-3 in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, and safety profile of oral COL-3 alone or when combined with anticonvulsants known to be metabolized by CYP450 in patients with progressive or recurrent high grade anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, or glioblastoma multiforme. - Define the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of COL-3 on this schedule and determine the effects of hepatic enzyme inducing drugs, such as anticonvulsants, on the pharmacokinetics. - Determine the response rate, disease free survival, and survival in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study of COL-3. Patients are stratified by anticonvulsant (anticonvulsants that cause induction of CYP450 vs anticonvulsants that cause modest or no induction of CYP450 or no anticonvulsant). - Phase I: Patients receive oral COL-3 daily. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of COL-3 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. - Phase II: Patients receive oral COL-3 daily at the MTD from the phase I portion of this study. Patients are followed every 2 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-18 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study and a total of 35 patients will be accrued for phase II of the study at a rate of 3 patients per month.</detailed_description>
