	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate whether thalidomide modulates toxic host inflammatory responses in patients receiving antitubercular therapy. II. Evaluate whether thalidomide modifies tumor necrosis factor-mediated toxic symptoms of HIV and mycobacterial infections, and limits progression of HIV immunodeficiency. III. Evaluate whether thalidomide stimulates immunity in patients with HIV and/or mycobacterial infections.</brief_summary>
