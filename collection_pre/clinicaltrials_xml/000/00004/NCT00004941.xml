	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of chimeric monoclonal antibody (cA2) compared with placebo in closure of enterocutaneous fistulae in patients with Crohn's disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Randomized Study of Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody (cA2) for Patients With Enterocutaneous Fistulae as a Complication of Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to investigational site and number of fistulae (single vs multiple). Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive an infusion of chimeric monoclonal antibody (cA2) on weeks 0, 2, and 6. Arm II: Patients receive an infusion of cA2 on weeks 0 and 2, and an infusion of placebo on week 6. Arm III: Patients receive an infusion of placebo on day 1 of weeks 0, 2, and 6. Patients are followed every month for 3 months, then every 6-12 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
