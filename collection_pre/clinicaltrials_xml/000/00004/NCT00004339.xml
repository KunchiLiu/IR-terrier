	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate alone and compared with trientine therapy as initial treatment in patients with Wilson disease presenting neurologically.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Tetrathiomolybdate in Patients With Wilson Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This a double blind, randomized study. Patients are randomized into one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive tetrathiomolybdate (TM) 3 times a day with meals and 3 times a day between meals for 8 weeks in the absence of neurologic deterioration or unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive trientine therapy for 8 weeks in the absence of neurologic deterioration and unacceptable toxicity. Additional therapy (off study): Patients in the TM group may receive maintenance zinc, while those in the trientine group may continue on trientine or switch to zinc.</detailed_description>
