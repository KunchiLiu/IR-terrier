	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the optimal safe dose of intravesical capsaicin in patients with interstitial cystitis. II. Evaluate the efficacy of 0.025% topical capsaicin in relieving chronic burning pain in patients with vulvar vestibulitis. III. Evaluate the effect of capsaicin on type C nerve fibers in bladder mucosa and vulvar skin. IV. Evaluate the effect of C fiber depletion on urinary levels of histamine and prostaglandin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study of Capsaicin for Interstitial Cystitis and Vulvar Vestibulitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients with interstitial cystitis are randomly assigned to 1 of 3 pain control therapies. The first group is treated with capsaicin. A second group is given individually titrated doses of capsaicin: the dose is increased as tolerated or until symptomatic response is acceptable. A control group receives a placebo. Therapy for all groups is administered intravesically every week for 5 weeks. Patients with vulvar vestibulitis are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 pain control therapies. One group applies topical capsaicin cream to the painful area 4 times a day for 6 weeks. The dose is individually titrated if burning discomfort persists and the patient is compliant with the application schedule. The control group applies a placebo. Patients with vulvar vestibulitis may continue or cross to capsaicin for 6 additional weeks.</detailed_description>
