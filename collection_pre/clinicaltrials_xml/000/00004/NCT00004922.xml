	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating patients who have advanced neuroendocrine tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of irinotecan in terms of tumor response, time to tumor progression, and survival in patients with advanced high grade neuroendocrine tumors. - Evaluate the dose limiting and nondose limiting toxicities of this treatment regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes once weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-31 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
