	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab in treating patients who have advanced salivary gland cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab in Treating Patients With Advanced Salivary Gland Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate to trastuzumab in patients with advanced or metastatic salivary gland cancer. II. Determine the time to progression in these patients after this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of trastuzumab in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to histology: intercalated duct (adenoid cystic carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, malignant mixed tumor, polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, adenocarcinoma) vs excretory duct (squamous cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma). Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
