	<brief_title>Study of Heparin Prophylaxis of Hereditary Angioedema Exacerbations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 3 way crossover study. All patients complete diary cards for the first month of the study in order to determine compliance in providing a daily record of symptoms and medication taken. All compliant patients receive subcutaneously injected heparin twice daily, inhaled heparin daily, or matched saline placebo in a random order. Each of the three drug administration periods lasts 2 months, for a total of 6 months of treatment. Patients who have a flare in disease activity that requires hospitalization are terminated from that drug administration period of the study. Patients are followed biweekly during the first month and again at the end of the second month for each of the three 2 month drug administration periods.
