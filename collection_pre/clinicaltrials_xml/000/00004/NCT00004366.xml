	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate whether vestibular rehabilitation training is of value in reducing anxiety symptoms in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia who have vestibular dysfunction as identified by clinical vestibular tests.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Vestibular Rehabilitation Training for Panic Disorder With Vestibular Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: During the first 4 weeks of study, patients meet with a clinical nurse specialist once a week for approximately 1 hour. During this time, the nature of the anxiety disorder is explained and exposure to previously feared situations is encouraged. Only patients who remain symptomatic at a stable level following self-exposure will proceed with rehabilitation training. Patients meet with a physical therapist once a week for 4 weeks to further evaluate the extent of problems associated with balance. Then, patients undergo weekly 1 hour exercises for 8 weeks with the physical therapist, focusing on sensation, head and eye coordination, movement with eyes opened and closed, and gait. Concurrently, patients meet with the clinical nurse specialist every 4 weeks during and after physical therapy to evaluate the effects of vestibular treatment on anxiety symptoms. Training is continued if patient is symptomatic; otherwise, patient is discharged from study.</detailed_description>
