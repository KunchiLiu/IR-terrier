	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and effectiveness of budesonide in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis or primary biliary cirrhosis experiencing a suboptimal response to ursodeoxycholic acid. II. Estimate the efficacy of this therapy in these patient groups as a means of evaluating the feasibility of a long-term randomized trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Budesonide for Patients With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive budesonide by mouth 3 times daily for a minimum of 6 months. If liver biochemistries become normal, dosage is reduced to once daily. Treatment discontinues after 1 year.</detailed_description>
