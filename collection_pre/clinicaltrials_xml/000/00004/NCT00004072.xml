	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining O6-benzylguanine with carmustine in treating patients who have previously untreated, refractory, or relapsing multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>O6-benzylguanine And Carmustine in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the efficacy of O6-benzylguanine combined with carmustine in patients with previously untreated or refractory multiple myeloma. - Assess the effects of O6-benzylguanine on bone marrow myeloma cells in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 60 minutes followed 1 hour later by carmustine IV over 60 minutes. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive 2 additional courses beyond attainment of best response (partial or complete response or stable or plateau disease). Patients are followed every 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
