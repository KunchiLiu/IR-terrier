	<brief_title>A Randomized Study of Surgery Vs No Surgery in Patients With Mild Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by gender. Patients are randomized to receive surgery or follow up without surgery. Patients receive parathyroidectomy (current standard care) or long term follow up without parathyroidectomy. Quality of life is assessed before the study and then every 6 months. All patients are followed every 6 months until death.</detailed_description>
