	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, feasibility, and potential efficacy of intravascular adenoviral vector mediated gene transfer in the liver in adults with partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of Adenoviral Vector Mediated Gene Transfer for Ornithine Transcarbamylase in Adults With Partial Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients undergo a femoral arterial placement of a hepatic intraarterial catheter. Patients then receive adenoviral vector mediated gene transfer intravascularly over 30 minutes. Cohorts of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of adenoviral vector until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. Patients are followed at 3, 5, 7, 8, 15, and 29 days, at 2 months, and then every 3 months thereafter. Completion date provided represents the completion date of the grant per OOPD records</detailed_description>
