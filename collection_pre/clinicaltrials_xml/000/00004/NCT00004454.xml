	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety and feasibility of treating mucopolysaccharidosis II (mild Hunter syndrome) by lymphocyte gene therapy. II. Determine the levels of iduronate-2-sulfatase enzyme in these patients attained by infusing increasing doses of lymphocytes transduced with a retroviral vector designed for insertion and expression of this iduronate-2-sulfatase gene (L2SN). III. Determine the duration of survival of these transduced cells in these patients. IV. Determine whether monthly infusion of L2SN-transduced lymphocytes accomplishes metabolic correction (as measured by glycosaminoglycan excretion), decrease in liver or spleen volume, any therapeutic effect upon cardiac and pulmonary dysfunction, or any other effects from treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study of Retroviral-Mediated Transfer of Iduronate-2-Sulfatase Gene Into Lymphocytes of Patients With Mucopolysaccharidosis II (Mild Hunter Syndrome)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Peripheral blood lymphocytes are harvested from patient by apheresis, stimulated to initiate the growth of T-lymphocytes, transduced with retrovirus L2SN containing iduronate-2-sulfatase, and reinfused into the patient. Patients receive 12 monthly infusions of these retroviral-mediated gene transduced lymphocytes with the first three infusions in a dose escalation format. Patients are monitored for at least 2 hours after completion of each infusion. Patients are followed at 1 year after treatment, and then until death.</detailed_description>
