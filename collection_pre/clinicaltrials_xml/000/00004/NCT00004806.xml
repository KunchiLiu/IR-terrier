	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of lipid-mediated transfer of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene to nasal epithelium in patients with cystic fibrosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of Liposome-Mediated Gene Transfer in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene complexed with lipid is administered intranasally to the right inferior turbinate. Lipid without CFTR is administered to the left nostril as a control. Cohorts of 3 patients are given successively lower doses of CFTR, each dose complexed with 500 micrograms of lipid. Patients are followed at days 2-12, 15, and 21, then every 3-4 days for 3 weeks, every 2-3 weeks for 10 weeks, and every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
