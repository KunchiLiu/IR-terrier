	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining docetaxel, carboplatin, and gemcitabine in treating patients who have previously untreated, newly diagnosed epithelial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated, Newly Diagnosed Epithelial Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel, carboplatin, and gemcitabine in patients with previously untreated, newly diagnosed, high-risk epithelial cancer of mullerian origin. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of docetaxel and gemcitabine. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Carboplatin IV is administered over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21-28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel and gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 5 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5-2 years.</detailed_description>
