	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacteria in sputum cultures from patients with cystic fibrosis. II. Compare the clinical course of patients with negative versus positive cultures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter Study of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria in Cystic Fibrosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Participants are screened for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) with 3 sputum acid-fast bacilli smears and mycobacterial cultures, with speciation of positive cultures, collected over 1 year. Demographic data, diagnostic criteria, clinical measurements, and other respiratory pathogen data are collected using the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry Questionnaire. NTM-positive patients (cases) matched with NTM-negative controls identified in screening are followed every 3 months for 15 months. Cases are evaluated for NTM burden during the first 3 months. Appropriate therapy is offered to consistently NTM-positive cases. Lung transplant recipients are removed from study.</detailed_description>
