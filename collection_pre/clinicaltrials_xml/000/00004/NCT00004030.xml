	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of VX-853 in treating patients who have solid tumors who are receiving liposomal doxorubicin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VX-853 in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors Who Are Receiving Liposomal Doxorubicin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and tolerability of VX-853 in combination with doxorubicin HCl liposome in patients with relapsed or incurable solid tumors. II. Obtain pharmacokinetic profiles for various dosages of VX-853 administered in combination with doxorubicin HCl liposome. III. Achieve whole blood concentrations of VX-853 in the predicted therapeutically effective range and characterize the pharmacokinetics at these doses. IV. Document antitumor effects of VX-853 in combination with doxorubicin HCl liposome in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of VX-853. Patients receive VX-853 orally every 8 hours on days 1-3 and doxorubicin HCL liposome IV over approximately 15 minutes beginning 26 hours after starting VX-853. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of VX-853 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 18 months.</detailed_description>
