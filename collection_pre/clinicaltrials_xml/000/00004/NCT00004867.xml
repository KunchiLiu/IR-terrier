	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imaging procedures such as positron emission tomography may improve the ability to determine the stage of esophageal cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography determines tumor stage in patients with esophageal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Positron Emission Tomography in Determining Stage of Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary Objective: To evaluate whether FDG-PET imaging can detect lesions that would preclude surgery (esophagectomy) in patients found to be surgical candidates by standard imaging procedures. Secondary Objective: To use the collected data to generate hypotheses to be used in future studies, such as which types of previously undetected lesions FDG-PET imaging is best able to identify.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient must be â‰¥ 18 years of age. 2. Patient must have histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the thoracic esophagus (greater than or equal to 20 cm from incisors) or gastroesophageal junction. (Pathology report must be submitted). 3. Patient must be deemed medically fit for surgical staging procedures and esophagectomy following the thoracic surgeon's evaluation of general medical fitness. 4. Patient's clinical staging data (clinical examination, laboratory tests, and standard radiological staging assessments) must be obtained within 60 days prior to registration and must suggest that the tumor is potentially resectable, including tumors staged T13, N01, M0. 5. Patient must be able to tolerate FDGPET scan (e.g., not claustrophobic and able to lie supine for 1.5 hrs). 6. Female patient of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to FDGPET. NOTE: Pregnancy test is required to avoid unnecessary fetal radiation exposure and because the use of furosemide is contraindicated in pregnancy. 7. Patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative must provide a signed and dated written informed consent prior to registration and any study related procedures. 8. Patient must provide written authorization to allow the use and disclosure of their protected health information. NOTE: This may be obtained in either the studyspecific informed consent or in a separate authorization form and must be obtained from the patient prior to study preregistration. 9. A cancer survivor is eligible provided that ALL of the following criteria are met and documented: the patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies and there has been no evidence of any prior malignancies for at least five years (except for completely resected cervical or nonmelanoma skin cancer) and the patient is deemed by their treating physician to be at low risk for recurrence from prior malignancies. 1. Patient has proximal esophageal cancer (less than 20 cm from incisors) potentially requiring pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy. 2. Patient has unresectable lesions (stage M1b, with biopsy confirmation of distant metastatic disease; or those with unresectable locoregional invasion, T4 Nx Mx). 3. Patient has evidence of metastatic disease. NOTE: Obvious metastasis that is based on clinical evaluation includes any or all of the following: positive cytology of pleura, pericardium, or peritoneum; metastasis to brain, bone, lung, liver, or adrenals; positive biopsy or cytology of metastasis to supraclavicular lymph nodes; and involvement of the tracheobronchial tree (positive bronchoscopic biopsy or overt esophagorespiratory fistula). 4. Patient has had a prior FDGPET scan for evaluation of their esophageal cancer. 5. Patient has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, as evidenced by a fasting blood glucose value &gt;200 mg/dL, within 12 hours of FDGPET scan. 6. Patient has received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy PRIOR to FDGPET scan being performed.</criteria>
