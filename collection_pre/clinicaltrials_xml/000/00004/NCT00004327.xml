	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of octreotide, a somatostatin octapeptide analog, in decreasing gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with hormone-refractory hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or senile ectasia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Pilot Study of Octreotide, a Somatostatin Octapeptide Analog, for Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage in Hormone-Refractory Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia and Senile Ectasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are treated with subcutaneous injections of octreotide twice a day. The dose is adjusted based on response. If there is no requirement for transfusions or intravenous iron for 4 weeks and the hemoglobin is greater than 10 mg/dL, therapy is continued for 1 year. If there is no decrease in bleeding after 10 weeks, the patient is removed from study.</detailed_description>
