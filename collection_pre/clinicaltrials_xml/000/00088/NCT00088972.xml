	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. The use of celecoxib may be effective in preventing breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well celecoxib works in preventing breast cancer in premenopausal women who are at risk for developing the disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0300, Celecoxib in Preventing Breast Cancer in Premenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare 1-year mammographic density in premenopausal women at high risk for developing breast cancer treated with celecoxib vs placebo. - Compare 1-year proliferation of breast epithelial cells, as measured by Ki67 staining, in patients treated with these drugs. - Compare the expression of other biomarkers, including cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme and a marker of apoptosis, in breast tissue of patients treated with these drugs. - Compare 1-year plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF binding protein-3, and prostaglandin E_2 in patients treated with these drugs. - Compare the toxicity of these drugs in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk category (lobular carcinoma in situ or ductal carcinoma in situ vs BRCA1/2 mutation AND any Gail risk vs Gail risk ≥1.7% but &lt; 5% vs Gail risk ≥ 5%) and prior tamoxifen use (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Celocoxib: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily. - Placebo: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms, treatment continues for 12 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or diagnosis of cancer. Patients are followed at 1 month. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
