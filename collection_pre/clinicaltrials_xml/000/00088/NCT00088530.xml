	<brief_summary>BBR 2778 is a novel aza-anthracenedione that has activity in experimental tumors and shows reduced potential for cardiotoxicity in animal models. This cytotoxic agent has structural similarities with mitoxantrone as well as general similarities with anthracyclines (such as the tricyclic central quinoid chromophore). The primary study objective is to compare the efficacy of BBR 2778 to a selection of single agents. Secondary objectives are to compare the safety and tolerability of BBR 2778 to a selection of single agents, and to assess the pharmacokinetic parameters of BBR 2778 in a subset of this patient population.</brief_summary>
