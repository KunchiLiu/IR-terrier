	<brief_title>Safety Study of PT-523 in Cancer Patients to Treat Solid Tumors Including a Preliminary Assessment of Effectiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this study are 1) to evaluate the safety of a short intravenous infusion of PT-523 when administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle to patients with solid tumors who have failed curative or survival prolonging therapy or for whom no such therapies exist; and 2) to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and identify the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of PT-523. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and to evaluate preliminary efficacy of PT-523.</detailed_description>
