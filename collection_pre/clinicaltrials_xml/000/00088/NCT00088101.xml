	<criteria>Male and female patients 18 years or older with one of the following malignancies: Histologically or cytologically confirmed hematological malignancy (other than Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome) and if treatment is medically indicated, or, Histologicallyconfirmed nonhematological malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which no standard therapy is available. Patients with CLL, PLL, CML, CTCL, ATL, and NonHodgkin's Lymphoma may be entered if they are refractory to or have relapsed following conventional chemotherapy regimens such as alkylating agents (e.g. chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide), anthracycline combinations [e.g. CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone)], and/or purine analogues (e.g. fludarabine monophosphate and 2CDA) and are not currently being considered for retreatment with conventional regimens Patients with CLL and other leukemic malignancies will be staged according to the modified Rai staging criteria [lowrisk, intermediaterisk and high risk]. All patients in the highrisk group (Stage III and IV) are eligible. Intermediate risk patients (Stage I and II) with one or more criteria of active disease (such as progressive lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly, weight loss &gt; 10% within 6 months, extreme fatigue, fever and/or night sweats without evidence of infection, etc.) are also eligible ECOG Performance Status of 02 Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks. Patients must have acceptable organ and marrow function at screening and predose visits as defined below unless approved medically by the clinical investigator. Absolute neutrophils count greater than 1,000 cells/ul for patients with hematologic malignancies and â‰¥1,500 cells/ul for patients with solid tumors Platelets greater than 100,000/ul Hgb greater than 8.5 g/dL Total bilirubin must be &lt;1.5 mg/dL or &lt; 2X upper limit of normal AST (SGOT) &lt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal Adequate renal function (serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL or a calculated creatinine clearance greater than 50 mL/min) Electrocardiogram without evidence of clinically significant conduction abnormalities or active ischemia as determined by the investigator. NCI grade 01 left ventricular ejection fraction within 30 days of dosing. The effects of STA5312 on the developing human fetus are unknown. Therefore, women of childbearing potential (defined as women under 50 years of age or history of amenorrhea for &lt; 12 months prior to study entry) must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a female patient become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform the treating physician immediately. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Women who are pregnant or lactating. Patients who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except palliative radiation delivered to &lt; 20% of bone marrow), immunotherapy, or corticosteroids ( &gt; 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. The use of nitrosoureas or mitomycin C within 6 weeks prior to study entry. Patients with prior peripheral blood stem cell rescue or bone marrow transplantation. History of primary brain tumors or active brain metastases. (Patients with previously treated brain metastases who are not receiving corticosteroids or anticonvulsants may be considered for enrollment) History of stroke or other significant neurologic limitations within 6 months prior to study enrollment Use of any investigational agents within 4 weeks of study enrollment. History of severe allergic reactions to excipients (e.g. Tween 80) or had hypersensitivity reactions to other chemotherapeutic agents similar in structure to STA5312. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, as determined by the investigator. History of active CNSlymphoma, AIDSrelated lymphoma, or any uncontrolled severe medical illness or infection. Grade 2 or higher sensory or motor neuropathy at screening. Major surgery (excluding that for diagnosis) within 4 weeks of enrollment.</criteria>
