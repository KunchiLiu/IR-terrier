	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of celecoxib when given together with erlotinib in treating former smokers with stage IIIB, stage IV, recurrent, or progressive non-small cell lung cancer. Celecoxib and erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib and Erlotinib in Treating Former Smokers With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To estimate the clinical toxicity and tolerability of erlotinib combined with celecoxib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the tumor response rate of erlotinib combined with celecoxib in patients with advanced NSCLC. II. To estimate the dose of celecoxib that results in maximal induction of apoptosis, maximal inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid, and maximal inhibition of bronchial cell proliferation when combined with erlotinib. III. To estimate the effect of erlotinib and the combination of erlotinib and celecoxib on bronchial expression of COX-2. IV. To estimate the effect of erlotinib and the combination of erlotinib (and celecoxib on autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in skin and endobronchial biopsies. V. To estimate the degree of correlation of autophosphorylation of EGFR in skin and endobronchial samples. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the effect of the combination of erlotinib and COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) on the frequency of fractional allelic loss (FAL) in endobronchial biopsies, metaplasia and dysplasia in endobronchial biopsies, and endobronchial proliferation. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of celecoxib. Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of celecoxib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, up to 6 additional patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed at 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
