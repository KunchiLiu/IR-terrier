	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as monoclonal antibody 3F8, can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Beta-glucan, isotretinoin, and sargramostim may increase the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody 3F8 by making tumor cells more sensitive to the monoclonal antibody. Combining different types of biological therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving beta-glucan, isotretinoin, and sargramostim together with monoclonal antibody 3F8 works in treating patients with neuroblastoma that has not responded to previous treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of beta-glucan, isotretinoin, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) in enhancing monoclonal antibody 3F8-mediated ablation in patients with high-risk refractory neuroblastoma. - Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen, in terms of assessing disease status in the bone marrow by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, in these patients. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are stratified according to refractory disease (primary refractory [never had disease progression or disease recurrence] vs secondary refractory [recurrent disease that did not respond completely to reinduction therapy]). - Courses 1 and 2: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously once daily on days -5 to 11. Patients also receive oral beta-glucan once daily on days -2 to 11 and monoclonal antibody (MOAB) 3F8 IV over 30-90 minutes on days 0-4 and 7-11. - Courses 3 and 4: Patients receive GM-CSF, beta-glucan, and MOAB 3F8 as above. Patients also receive oral isotretinoin twice daily on days -2 to 11. Treatment repeats every 2-4 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-74 patients (10-33 for stratum 1 and 17-41 for stratum 2) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
