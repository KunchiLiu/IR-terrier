	<brief_title>SPRiNG: SCIO-469 Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis Not Receiving Methotrexate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 24 week randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double blind (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo controlled, parallel group study assessing the safety and effectiveness of oral SCIO-469 in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are not receiving liver damaging (hepatotoxic) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The patient will participate in the study for approximately 183 days. Safety measures will include vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, breathing rate), 12-lead electro-cardiogram, adverse events, concomitant medications, and clinical laboratory evaluations (including serum chemistry, hematology, qualitative urinalysis, and liver function tests). The patient may be assigned to receive 30 mg capsule orally (by mouth) as one or two capsules three times daily, or receive 100 mg tablet orally once daily, or placebo (no active drug) orally as two capsules three times daily and placebo tablet orally once daily for 24 weeks.</detailed_description>
