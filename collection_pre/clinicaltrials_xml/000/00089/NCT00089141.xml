	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Mycophenolate mofetil added to immunosuppressive treatment regimens may be effective in treating newly diagnosed chronic graft-versus-host disease caused by stem cell transplantation. It is not yet known whether immunosuppressive treatment regimens are more effective with or without mycophenolate mofetil in treating chronic graft-versus-host disease. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying whether the addition of mycophenolate mofetil improves the efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment regimens in patients with newly diagnosed chronic graft-versus-host disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) for Treatment of Chronic Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment regimens with vs without mycophenolate mofetil in patients with newly diagnosed chronic graft-vs-host disease. - Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to organ involvement of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (single organ vs multiple organs) and transplant center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. All patients receive usual therapy for chronic GVHD comprising oral prednisone twice daily and oral cyclosporine, oral tacrolimus or oral sirolimus twice daily until 2 weeks after the first evidence of improvement of symptoms of chronic GVHD. - Arm I: Patients receive oral mycophenolate mofetil twice daily. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms administration of the study drug continues for 3 months after completion of prednisone and cyclosporine, tacrolimus or sirolimus in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 months. Patients are followed every 3 months for 3-5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 230 patients (115 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
