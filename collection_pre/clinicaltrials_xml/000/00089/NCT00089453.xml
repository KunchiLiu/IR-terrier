	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to induce anti-myeloma responses in patients with high risk or relapsed myeloma using combination chemo- and immunotherapy comprising sequentially: 1) lymphoid and myeloid suppressive conditioning, 2) adoptive transfer of purified KIR-ligand mismatched Natural Killer cells from a haplo-identical donor, and 3) autografting two weeks after infusion of NK cells to ensure autologous reconstitution. Other objectives include establishing the response rate, disease free survival, progression free survival and toxicity of regimen. Secondary objectives are to monitor the persistence of haplo-identical purified KIR-ligand mismatched Natural Killer cells by molecular methods, select haplo-identical purified KIR-ligand mismatched donors and predict prior to therapy which donor will induce a response, monitor Natural Killer cell reconstitution prior to and after autografting, and establish Natural Killer cell clones after autografting and determine origin and specificity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will induce anti-myeloma responses in patients with high risk or relapsed myeloma using combination chemo- and immunotherapy comprising sequentially: 1) lymphoid suppressive conditioning to avoid rejection of the donor NK cells, 2) adoptive transfer of purified KIR-ligand mismatched Natural Killer cells from a haplo-identical donor, and 3) autografting two weeks after infusion of NK cells to ensure autologous reconstitution.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>MM in frank relapse after a single or tandem transplant or high risk Myeloma Patients with prior transplant must be more than 4 months after the last transplant Karnofsky performance score &gt;or =70, or a performance score of 5070 exclusively due to bone pain caused by myeloma 18 years of age or older An expected survival greater than 3 months ANC &gt;1,000/microliters, platelet count &gt; 100,000/microliters Donor and patient must have signed an IRBapproved consent and been informed about the investigational nature of the study Donor must have negative serology for HIV Available haploidentical family donor fit to undergo leukapheresis and mismatched for KIRligand(s) with the patient in the graftversus host direction. Stored cells for autografting of at least 30 million CD34+ cells/kg Backup cells of at least 20 million CD34+ cells/kg in case of nonengraftment. There must be an unambiguous marker for response to therapy in the first ten patients. Therefore the patient must have detectable and quantifiable Mprotein or light chain excretion in urine, light chain quantification in serum (FREELITE) or clear radiological signal lesion(s) in order to be eligible After 10 relapsed patients have been treated and toxicity is deemed acceptable, highrisk myeloma (defined as the presence of abnormal cytogenetics or metaphase analysis) patients without relapse can be entered Intravenous chemotherapy or antibody therapy affecting Tlymphocytes and/or natural killer cells e.g. cyclophosphamide, melphalan, ATG, Campath1H etc. within the past 2 weeks prior to commencement of conditioning. Last therapy is less than 14 days prior to starting fludarabine Fever or active infection, requiring IV antibiotics Liver function: total bilirubin &gt; 2xULN or AST/ALT &gt;3xULN Renal function: patients on dialysis</criteria>
