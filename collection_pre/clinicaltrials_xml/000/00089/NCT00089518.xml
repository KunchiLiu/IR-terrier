	<brief_summary>The angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan is a drug commonly used to treat high blood pressure. Valsartan may also help slow down the progression of kidney disease in HIV infected people. The purpose of this study is to compare valsartan and antiretroviral therapy (ART) to ART alone in slowing kidney disease progression in people with HIV.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ART for the treatment of HIV may slow the progression of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) to end-stage renal disease (ESRD); nevertheless, it is predicted that many HIV infected patients on ART will reach ESRD by the next decade. Medications that affect the renin-angiotensin system, such as the ARB valsartan, may be useful in treating HIVAN. In a small study of HIV infected patients with HIVAN treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) fosinopril, kidney function was stable in patients who took the ACEI, but function decreased in patients who did not. These data are promising, and suggest that an ARB like valsartan may also slow the progression of HIVAN and improve patients' prognosis. This study will compare valsartan and ART to ART alone in slowing kidney disease progression in people with HIV. This study will last 96 weeks. All participants will continue taking their current ART regimen during the study and will be randomly assigned to one of two arms: Arm 1 will receive valsartan daily, while Arm 2 will receive placebo daily. Doses of drug or placebo may be adjusted during the first 8 weeks based on blood pressure readings taken during the study. In addition, if patients are on other antihypertensive drugs, dosage adjustments may be necessary for those drugs during the study. No ART or antihypertensive drugs other than valsartan will be provided by the study. Study visits will occur every week until Week 8, then every 8 weeks until the end of the study at Week 96. Study visits will include physical examination, medication assessment, and blood pressure readings. In addition, blood collection will occur at entry, Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8, and every 8 weeks thereafter.</detailed_description>

Patients who are receiving maintenance therapy for OIs and have no evidence of active disease are not excluded. Diabetes mellitus for 2 years or longer prior to study entry. Onset of diabetes is defined as the point at which patients began oral hypoglycemics or insulin. Pregnancy or breastfeeding</criteria>
