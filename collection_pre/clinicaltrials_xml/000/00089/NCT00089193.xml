	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Combining vaccine therapy with sargramostim may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying vaccine therapy and sargramostim to see how well they work compared to vaccine therapy alone in treating patients with stage II B, stage IIC, stage III, or stage IV melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With or Without Sargramostim in Treating Patients With Stage IIB, Stage IIC, Stage III, or Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare immune response in patients with stage IIB-IV melanoma treated with vaccination comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides and Montanide ISA-51 with vs without sargramostim (GM-CSF). - Compare immune response in patients treated with these vaccinations administered at 1 vs 2 sites. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive vaccination comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides and Montanide ISA-51 at 1 injection site. - Arm II: Patients receive vaccination comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides and Montanide ISA-51 at 2 injection sites. - Arm III: Patients receive vaccination comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides, Montanide ISA-51, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) at 1 injection site. - Arm IV: Patients receive vaccination comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides, Montanide ISA-51, and GM-CSF at 2 injection sites. In all arms, treatment repeats once weekly for 6 weeks. Patients return for booster vaccinations at weeks 12, 26, 39, and 52. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 124 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
