	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying three different doses of a vaccine and comparing them to see how well they work in treating patients with stage IIIB, stage IIIC, or stage IV melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB, Stage IIIC, or Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the immune response in patients with stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV melanoma treated with vaccine comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides, Montanide ISA-51, and sargramostim (GM-CSF). OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive vaccine comprising low-dose multiple synthetic melanoma peptides, Montanide ISA-51, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, and 43. - Arm II: Patients receive vaccine comprising medium-dose multiple synthetic melanoma peptides, Montanide ISA-51, and GM-CSF as in arm I. - Arm III: Patients receive vaccine comprising high-dose multiple synthetic melanoma peptides, Montanide ISA-51, and GM-CSF as in arm I. On day 22, the lymph node draining the vaccination site is removed to determine whether the immune system is responding to the vaccine. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 38 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
