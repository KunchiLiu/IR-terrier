	<brief_summary>Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver radioactive cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Motexafin gadolinium may increase the effectiveness of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan by making the cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of motexafin gadolinium when administered with rituximab and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage II, stage III, or stage IV relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Trial of Redox Regulation in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory CD20+ NHL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of motexafin gadolinium followed by a phase II study. Patients are stratified according to extent of lymphomatous involvement (≤ 5% vs &gt; 5 but ≤ 24% of cellular elements). Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of motexafin gadolinium until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) OR the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 3 of 6 patients experience DLT. - Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are treated at that dose level as in phase I. Patients are followed weekly for 3 months and then monthly for 5 years.</detailed_description>
