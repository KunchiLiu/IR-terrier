	<brief_summary>Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are commonly included in anti-HIV drug regimens. However, HIV infected women who have previously taken the single dose NNRTI nevirapine (SD NVP) for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV may not respond as well to NNRTIs as women who have never taken NVP. Another class of anti-HIV drugs, protease inhibitors (PIs), may be more effective for women who have previously taken NNRTIs. This study will compare the effectiveness of NNRTI- and PI-based regimens in women who have taken NVP for prevention of MTCT of HIV. This study will also compare regimens including an NNRTI with regimens including a PI in women who have never taken NVP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NNRTI vs PI Regimens for HIV Infected Women After They Have Taken Nevirapine to Prevent Mother-To-Child HIV Transmission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NVP is the NNRTI of choice to prevent MTCT of HIV, especially in resource-limited settings. However, prolonged use of NVP may result in drug resistance, decreasing the efficacy of future anti-HIV regimens containing NVP. PIs are more expensive and cause different adverse effects than NNRTIs, but PI-containing regimens may be more effective than NNRTI-containing regimens in treating HIV infected women who previously took NVP for MTCT prophylaxis. This study will compare the efficacy of NNRTI- and PI-containing anti-HIV regimens in women who have previously taken NVP for MTCT of HIV and in women who have never taken NVP. The study will last a minimum of 48 weeks. Participants will be grouped by previous NVP exposure: participants who have previously taken NVP as MTCT prophylaxis (Trial 1 participants), and participants who have never taken NVP (Trial 2 participants). Participants in each trial will be randomly assigned to one of two arms, NVP-containing arm(NVP/NVP for trial 1 participants and NoNVP/NVP for trial 2 participants) or PI-containing arm(NVP/LPV_r for Trial 1 participants and NoNVP/LPV_r for Trial 2 participants). At the start of the study, Arm NVP/NVP and NoNVP/NVP participants will receive emtricitabine (FTC) daily, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) daily, and NVP daily for the first 14 days and then twice daily. Arm NVP/LPV_r and NoNVP/LPV_r participants will receive both FTC and TDF daily and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) twice daily. FTC and TDF may be replaced in either arm with the combination drug FTC/TDF. If participants experience virologic failure, toxicity, or otherwise cannot tolerate their regimens, they will switch to a different regimen. Arm NVP/NVP and NoNVP/NVP participants will switch to a regimen of two or more nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and LPV/RTV; Arm NVP/LPV_r and NoNVP/LPV_r participants will switch to a regimen of two or more NRTIs and NVP. Study visits will occur at entry and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Visits will consist of a physical exam, medication assessment, and blood collection. Participants will be asked to complete adherence questionnaires at Weeks 4, 12, 24, and every 24 weeks thereafter, and quality of life questionnaires at Weeks 24 and ever 24 weeks thereafter. Study drugs will be provided for all participants through 48 weeks after the final participant is randomized. As per an amendment (dated April 13, 2009), participants will be asked to take part in an extension of this study. Enrollment in the extension is completely voluntary. The purpose of the extension is to monitor, in greater extent, the participants' health as they transition from study treatment to local, clinical care. During the study extension participants will not receive any medications through the study; it is expected that participants will receive their treatments through a local clinic. Participants enrolling in the extension will enter the extension at the same time as their last visit in the current study. For the extension, participants will be asked to come back to the clinic two times for study visits: at 12 and 72 weeks after entry into the extension. Because there will be a long time between these study visits, participants will also be contacted by phone (or through some other means) close to 48 weeks after entry into the extension. At each of these visits, participants will be asked about their health and medications, including current anti-HIV drugs. Participants will also be asked about any HIV care received outside of the study. As part of this study, investigators may need to review participants' non-study medical records and speak with their non-study care providers, to find out more about their HIV care and medical problems, and also to check results of lab tests. During the study extension period, participants will have blood drawn and also be tested for pregnancy.</detailed_description>
