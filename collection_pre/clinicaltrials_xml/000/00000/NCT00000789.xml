	<brief_summary>PRIMARY: To compare the relative safety and tolerance of oral zidovudine (AZT) versus oral stavudine (d4T) in symptomatic HIV-infected children. SECONDARY: To compare the clinical, virologic, and immunologic responses between the two treatment groups, and to obtain pharmacokinetic data for both drugs. At present, AZT is considered the drug of choice for initial treatment of most children with HIV infection, although disease progression or drug intolerance is associated with its long-term use. In preliminary studies in children, d4T, another HIV inhibitor, has been well tolerated, although an optimum dose has not been determined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized, Comparative Trial of Zidovudine (AZT) Versus 2',3'-Didehydro-3'-Deoxythymidine (Stavudine; d4T) in Children With HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present, AZT is considered the drug of choice for initial treatment of most children with HIV infection, although disease progression or drug intolerance is associated with its long-term use. In preliminary studies in children, d4T, another HIV inhibitor, has been well tolerated, although an optimum dose has not been determined. Patients are randomized to receive either oral AZT or oral d4T. Treatment continues until the last patient enrolled has received 52 weeks of therapy, or until the study is terminated.</detailed_description>
