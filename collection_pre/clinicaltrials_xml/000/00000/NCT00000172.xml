	<brief_summary>Galantamine is an experimental drug being evaluated in the United States for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Results from previous clinical trials suggest that galantamine may improve cognitive performance in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. It is not a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Nerve cells in the brain responsible for memory and cognitive function communicate using a chemical called acetylcholine. Research has shown that deterioration of cells that produce acetylcholine in the brain affects thought processes. Galantamine is thought to work in two ways to increase the amount of acetylcholine available in the brain. It inhibits an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine and it also stimulates the nicotinic receptors in the brain to release more acetylcholine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Galantamine in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After a 1-month single-blind run in phase, 910 subjects will be titrated, over a period of up to 8 weeks, to target doses of either: 0 (placebo); 24 mg/day galantamine; 16 mg/day galantamine; or 8 mg/day galantamine, in a 2:2:2:1 randomization ratio. Double-blind treatment will continue for a total of 5 months. The change from baseline in ADAS-cog and CIVIC-plus scores at Month 5 will be the primary efficacy endpoints. Tolerability will be evaluated based on adverse event reports, laboratory values, ECG, and vital signs with particular focus on the adverse event rates in the slower titration schedule for 24 mg/day. Efficacy of 24 mg/day and 16 mg/day galantamine will be compared with that of placebo. Information on the dose response relationship of galantamine will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
