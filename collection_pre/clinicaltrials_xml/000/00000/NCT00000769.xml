	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study of Recombinant Interleukin-4 in AIDS and Kaposi's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IL-4 exhibits a variety of beneficial effects on the immune system and is a potent inhibitor of Kaposi's sarcoma cells in vitro. Patients are stratified into two groups according to CD4 count (less than 100 cells/mm3 and greater than or equal to 100 cells/mm3) and are enrolled in cohorts of four patients at each of four dose levels of IL-4 per stratum. Within each stratum, if patients at a given dose level have received at least 2 weeks of study therapy and no more than two patients experienced grade 3 or 4 drug-related toxicity, dose escalation in subsequent patients may begin. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 50 percent of patients develop grade 3 or worse toxicity. Patients with CD4 count less than 500 cells/mm3 (per 12/30/94 amendment) must be on antiretroviral therapy during study treatment. PER AMENDMENT 11/20/95: Group I - enrollment is closed, the objective has been defined. Group II - patients must have CD4 cells greater than or equal to 100/mm3 and less than 500/mm3. PER AMENDMENT 11/20/95: All patients will receive antiretroviral therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Required: Antiretroviral therapy during study treatment only in patients with CD4 count &lt; 500 cells/mm3 (per 12/30/94 amendment). Allowed: GCSF for a second occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (per 12/30/94 amendment). Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents including acetaminophen for drugrelated fevers. Systemic steroids for no more than 1 week in any 30day period. PCP prophylaxis with TMP/SMX, dapsone, or inhaled pentamidine, if patient has a history of PCP or a CD4 count &lt; 250 cells/mm3. Allowed only in patients with CD4 count &lt; 100 cells/mm3: Maintenance doses of ganciclovir, pyrimethamine/sulfa and TMP/SMX for stable, wellcontrolled opportunistic infections.

Prior Medication: Required: PER AMENDMENT 11/20/95: Stable dose of antiretroviral therapy required for at least 21 days prior to study entry for all patients. (Changed from Stable dose of antiretroviral therapy for at least 21 days prior to study entry in patients with CD4 count &lt; 500 cells/mm3 (per 12/30/94 amendment). Patients must have: AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma. PER AMENDMENT 11/20/95: CD4 lymphocyte count &gt;= 100 but &lt; 500 cells/mm3. (Changed from HIV infection.) PER AMENDMENT 11/20/95: All Patients will receive antiretroviral therapy. (Changed from Current antiretroviral therapy IF CD4 count &lt; 500 cells/mm3 (per 12/30/94 amendment).) No active opportunistic infections requiring induction therapy. Consent of parent or guardian if less than 18 years of age. Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded: Other active malignancies (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin and in situ cervical cancer). Alteration in mental status that may prevent compliance. Cardiac functional capacity of Class II or worse OR regional wall abnormalities or abnormal ejection fraction on twodimensional echocardiogram, if performed. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: Chemotherapy, interferons, or immune modulators for Kaposi's sarcoma. Myelosuppressive agents such as induction doses of ganciclovir, Fansidar (pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine), or any other investigational drugs (with the exception of nonmyelosuppressive treatment IND medications in specific patients). GMCSF or erythropoietin (except for a second grade 3/4 neutropenia or anemia). GCSF. Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded: History of myocardial infarction or significant arrhythmias. History of symptomatic hypoglycemia. Prior Medication: Excluded: Systemic therapy (including chemotherapy, interferons, and immune modulators) for Kaposi's sarcoma within 4 weeks prior to study entry.</criteria>
