	<brief_summary>To determine the toxicity and response to treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy using doxorubicin (Adriamycin), bleomycin, and vincristine (DBV) for advanced AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma in combination with either didanosine (ddI) or zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine; ddC). AIDS patients with extensive Kaposi's sarcoma require treatment with effective cytotoxic agents to reduce the tumor burden, and they also require treatment with other possibly effective antiretroviral agents such as ddI or ddC to ameliorate (delay) the development of opportunistic infections.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Chemotherapy Plus ddI or ddC in the Treatment of AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIDS patients with extensive Kaposi's sarcoma require treatment with effective cytotoxic agents to reduce the tumor burden, and they also require treatment with other possibly effective antiretroviral agents such as ddI or ddC to ameliorate (delay) the development of opportunistic infections. In Phase I, eligible patients with advanced Kaposi's sarcoma are randomly assigned to either ddI or ddC in combination with DBV chemotherapy. On the average, patients receive 12-44 weeks of combined chemotherapy and antiretroviral therapy. If vincristine is deleted from Phase I because of excess neurotoxicity, it will not be administered as part of the combination chemotherapy if that treatment is continued in the Phase II study. The Phase II trial proceeds when at least six cycles (12 weeks) of DBV have been completed by six patients enrolled in Phase I, and an overall evaluation of tolerance to each combination treatment plan has been completed. Study medication is administered as in Phase I, with the possible deletion of vincristine. All patients who complete DBV chemotherapy with complete or partial response or stable disease will continue to receive the originally assigned investigational antiretroviral drug (ddC or ddI) for an additional 24 weeks.</detailed_description>

Prior history or current clinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy (= or &gt; grade 1), pancreatitis, intractable diarrhea, or active seizure disorder not controlled by antiseizure medication. Significant pulmonary insufficiency (exertional dyspnea with minimal exertion, except that due to pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma) or cardiac insufficiency (New York Heart Association status &gt; 2). Neuropsychiatric history or altered mental status that would prevent informed consent or that would not permit compliance with this protocol.
