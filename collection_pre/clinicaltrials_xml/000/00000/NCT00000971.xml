	<brief_summary>To evaluate three doses of clarithromycin in children with AIDS and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection who are receiving concurrent antiretroviral therapy. Before more extensive evaluation of this promising drug for treatment of MAC infection in children can be done, it is important to study the pharmacokinetics of this drug in this population, to get information regarding its use in pediatric patients receiving currently available antiretroviral drugs, and to get information on the antimycobacterial activity of this drug.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before more extensive evaluation of this promising drug for treatment of MAC infection in children can be done, it is important to study the pharmacokinetics of this drug in this population, to get information regarding its use in pediatric patients receiving currently available antiretroviral drugs, and to get information on the antimycobacterial activity of this drug. Patients that are included are HIV infected and have started zidovudine (AZT) or didanosine (ddI) at least 4 weeks before entry into this study. Patients continue taking the medications at prescribed doses. In addition they also take clarithromycin. Patients continue treatment with AZT or ddI plus clarithromycin for 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
