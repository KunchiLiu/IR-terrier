	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and tolerance of concurrent administration of standard-dose didanosine (ddI) with low-dose ribavirin in HIV-positive patients. To determine the pharmacokinetic interactions of concurrent administration of ddI and ribavirin and correlate pharmacokinetic parameters with toxicity. To investigate antiviral activity of the combined regimen. Combination ddI/ribavirin therapy, if safe and effective, offers an alternative combination antiretroviral regimen for patients unable to tolerate regimens containing zidovudine (AZT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Open-Label Study of the Safety, Tolerance, and Pharmacokinetic Interactions of Combination Didanosine and Ribavirin in HIV-Positive Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combination ddI/ribavirin therapy, if safe and effective, offers an alternative combination antiretroviral regimen for patients unable to tolerate regimens containing zidovudine (AZT). Patients receive ddI alone for 4 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of combination ddI/ribavirin. Patients who complete the first 12 weeks without major toxicity may receive an additional 12 weeks of combination therapy on an optional basis. Patients are followed for 60 days after the last treatment visit.</detailed_description>
