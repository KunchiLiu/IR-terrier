	<brief_summary>The long-range goal of this ongoing research program is to find more effective treatments for alcohol dependence by combining medication with the appropriate psychosocial support. This proposal has three specific aims: (1) to compare the effectiveness of naltrexone (Revia) in three types of treatment settings; (2) to assess the effects of psychosocial support on medication compliance and treatment retention; and (3) to investigate the individual characteristics that may predict who is likely to benefit from additional psychosocial support versus simple medication management.</brief_summary>
