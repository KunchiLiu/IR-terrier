	<brief_summary>To compare the efficacy of fluconazole versus placebo for the prevention of Candida esophagitis and vaginal/oropharyngeal candidiasis, including a comparison of the development of clinical resistance. Fluconazole has been shown to be effective in preventing or suppressing candidiasis in HIV-negative women. An increasing likelihood of oral and esophageal candidiasis in conjunction with progressive immunosuppression raises the question of the potential role of prophylactic antifungal therapy in high-risk persons.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fluconazole has been shown to be effective in preventing or suppressing candidiasis in HIV-negative women. An increasing likelihood of oral and esophageal candidiasis in conjunction with progressive immunosuppression raises the question of the potential role of prophylactic antifungal therapy in high-risk persons. Four hundred HIV-infected women are randomized to receive fluconazole or placebo weekly for up to 2 years. Patients undergo follow-up every 3 months or more often if signs and symptoms of mucosal candidiasis occur.</detailed_description>
