	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is better to treat patients with fluconazole on a continuous basis to prevent thrush (yeast infection in the mouth) from coming back or to wait and treat each episode of thrush. Fluconazole is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs to treat thrush and other yeast infections. However, the number of patients with fluconazole-resistant thrush is increasing, and it is not known whether continuous or intermittent use of fluconazole leads to greater resistance. Therefore, it is important to determine the most effective treatment strategy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Compare the Use of Fluconazole as Continuous Therapy Versus Periodic Therapy in HIV-Positive Patients With Recurrent Thrush</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate two different management strategies for patients with advanced HIV infection who are at risk for recurrent and fluconazole-refractory oropharyngeal candidiasis. The treatment duration will be at least 24 months in order to evaluate the long-term effects of the treatment strategies on the development of fluconazole-refractory thrush. In addition to investigating antifungal treatment as it relates to fluconazole-refractory infections, the study will evaluate host factors and organism-related factors in order to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of oropharyngeal candidiasis and fluconazole-refractory infections. Prior to randomization to a long-term management strategy using fluconazole, patients are stratified into one of three groups according to their baseline CD4+ count (cells/mm3): 0-49, 50-100, and 101-150. Patients without oropharyngeal candidiasis (no thrush present) at enrollment and those patients who respond (no thrush present) to the initial acute therapy for an active infection are randomized 1:1 to one of two management strategies for fluconazole: Arm A (episodic therapy) or Arm B (chronic suppressive therapy with continuous fluconazole). Patients are then followed for a duration of 24 months after enrollment of the last subject. Patients with active oropharyngeal candidiasis at time of enrollment will be treated with fluconazole for up to 2 weeks and patients who respond (no thrush present) are then randomized to a long-term management strategy. Those who do not respond (refractory disease) to the acute treatment are permanently discontinued from the study. Women in both groups will have the option of being treated for vulvovaginal candidiasis either through or outside the study.</detailed_description>
