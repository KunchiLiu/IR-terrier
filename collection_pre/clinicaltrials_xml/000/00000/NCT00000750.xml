	<brief_summary>Primary: To determine the efficacy of early treatment with zidovudine (AZT) in HIV-infected asymptomatic infants. To determine the safety and tolerance of AZT in this patient population. Secondary: To compare the virologic and immunologic parameters between the treatment groups. To determine the efficacy of AZT as an early treatment to prevent development of CD4+ cell depletion in HIV-infected asymptomatic infants. AZT is currently indicated for primary treatment in children with HIV-associated signs and symptoms and for those with significant immunodeficiency. This study will attempt to determine whether early treatment with AZT prevents the development of symptoms in HIV-infected infants who are asymptomatic.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase III Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerance, and Efficacy of Early Treatment With Zidovudine (AZT) in Asymptomatic Infants With HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AZT is currently indicated for primary treatment in children with HIV-associated signs and symptoms and for those with significant immunodeficiency. This study will attempt to determine whether early treatment with AZT prevents the development of symptoms in HIV-infected infants who are asymptomatic. Patients are randomized to receive oral AZT (at age-adjusted doses) or placebo. Patients are evaluated at weeks 2 and 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter; those who reach a study endpoint will have their treatment unblinded to allow the clinician to determine which treatment regimen the patient should then receive. Patients who meet the criteria for changes to open-label AZT will be given the appropriate age-adjusted dose without unblinding the original randomization assignment. Patients who complete or discontinue treatment are followed every 6 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
