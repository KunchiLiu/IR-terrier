	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and immune response to vaccinia-derived HIV-1 recombinant envelope glycoprotein (gp160) using an accelerated dosage schedule; to evaluate duration of antibody response and its relationship to the dose and frequency of inoculation. Although recent advances have been made in antiviral therapy against AIDS, there is currently no cure for AIDS. It is likely that ultimate control of the disease depends on the development of safe and effective vaccines against HIV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Multicenter Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Vaccinia Derived HIV-1 Recombinant Envelope Glycoprotein (gp160) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus: Evaluation of Accelerated Schedules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although recent advances have been made in antiviral therapy against AIDS, there is currently no cure for AIDS. It is likely that ultimate control of the disease depends on the development of safe and effective vaccines against HIV. Thirty healthy adult volunteers without identifiable high-risk behavior for HIV-1 are randomly assigned to receive vaccination with gp160 (50 mcg) according to one of the following schedules: Group 1 receives vaccine on days 0, 28, 56, and 140 and placebo on days 84 and 112; Group 2 receives vaccine on days 0, 28, 56, 84, and 112 and placebo on day 140. Subjects are followed for 1 year after the last injection. Per 05/13/94 amendment, 10 subjects at the St. Louis University site receive an additional boost 18-24 months after the last injection.</detailed_description>
