	<brief_summary>To compare the safety and efficacy of two dosage regimens (daily and thrice-weekly) of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP; TMS) in the prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in high-risk HIV-infected patients. Previous tests have shown that SMX/TMP given daily is effective in preventing recurrence of PCP and may be effective in preventing PCP in patients who have never developed it. Because SMX/TMP can cause side effects, this study will attempt to determine the safest and most effective dose of this combination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized, Comparative, Prospective Study of Daily Trimethoprim / Sulfamethoxazole (TMS) and Thrice-Weekly TMS for Prophylaxis Against PCP in HIV-Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous tests have shown that SMX/TMP given daily is effective in preventing recurrence of PCP and may be effective in preventing PCP in patients who have never developed it. Because SMX/TMP can cause side effects, this study will attempt to determine the safest and most effective dose of this combination. Patients receive SMX/TMP orally on a daily or thrice-weekly basis. Patients are clinically evaluated every 4 months. Patients on daily SMX/TMP who develop a drug-related toxicity may be switched to thrice-weekly SMX/TMP. Duration of follow-up is 12 months.</detailed_description>
