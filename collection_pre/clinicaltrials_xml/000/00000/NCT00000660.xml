	<brief_summary>To define the toxicity and maximum-tolerated dose of weekly oral etoposide (VP-16) in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma; to determine the clinical pharmacology of orally administered VP-16 in AIDS patients. A secondary objective is to obtain preliminary data for determining the effect of oral VP-16 on Kaposi's sarcoma. VP-16 is an antitumor agent. Previous problems with VP-16 include the route of administration and the toxicities. VP-16 has been given intravenously for 3 consecutive days in a 21-day cycle for lung cancer and testicular cancer. VP-16 has also been used in lymphoma therapy. Oral VP-16 would eliminate the need for an intravenous catheter and so a patient could avoid the pain, inconvenience, and potential complications associated with medications administered intravenously. The relative ease of outpatient administration and the potentially significant antitumor activity of oral VP-16 motivates this study. The possibility of weekly drug administration is the other focus of this study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>VP-16 is an antitumor agent. Previous problems with VP-16 include the route of administration and the toxicities. VP-16 has been given intravenously for 3 consecutive days in a 21-day cycle for lung cancer and testicular cancer. VP-16 has also been used in lymphoma therapy. Oral VP-16 would eliminate the need for an intravenous catheter and so a patient could avoid the pain, inconvenience, and potential complications associated with medications administered intravenously. The relative ease of outpatient administration and the potentially significant antitumor activity of oral VP-16 motivates this study. The possibility of weekly drug administration is the other focus of this study. Four patients are entered at each dose level starting with level 1. Patients are not entered into the next higher dose level until at least two patients at the previous dose level have completed at least 3 weeks of therapy with grade 2 or less maximum tolerated dose-defining toxicities. Treatment is repeated weekly for 52 weeks until either a grade 3 or 4 toxicity occurs, or until a patient shows a complete response or progressive disease. Patients with a complete response are continued on drug for 4 additional weeks from the time that complete response is first documented. Patients with progressive disease are withdrawn from study. Patients with partial response or stable disease continue until either unacceptable toxicity occurs or a complete response or progression of disease is reached.</detailed_description>

Allowed: Aerosolized pentamidine for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis (PCP). Concurrent Treatment: Allowed: Local radiotherapy or laser therapy to cosmetically apparent, nonindicator lesions provided the dose to any one lesion does not exceed 300 rads and the total surface area of all lesions treated does not exceed 10 cm2. Risk Behavior: Allowed: All risk groups. Patients must: Have AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma. Be ineligible for protocols of higher priority at study center.

Concurrent Medication: Excluded: Therapy with potentially myelosuppressive, hepatotoxic, or nephrotoxic drugs for an opportunistic infection. Patients with the following are excluded: Active opportunistic infection not specifically allowed. Ongoing therapy, including maintenance therapy, for an opportunistic infection with potentially myelosuppressive, hepatotoxic, or nephrotoxic drugs. Concurrent neoplasm not specifically allowed.
