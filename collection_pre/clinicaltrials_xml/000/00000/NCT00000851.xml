	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and determine the pharmacokinetic disposition of stavudine (d4T) alone and in combination with didanosine (ddI), and whether concurrent administration alters the disposition of either drug. To compare d4T versus d4T plus ddI with respect to short and long term changes from baseline in plasma HIV RNA concentrations. To determine the relationship, if any, between drug exposure and viral burden. In a pilot study of d4T and ddI given to eight children with advanced HIV for 24 weeks, the three children with baseline counts greater than 50 cells/micro liter experienced a 20% increase in their CD4+ lymphocyte counts. Based on these results, controlled trials of the same regimen for children with less advanced HIV disease should be undertaken.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Stavudine Used Alone or in Combination With Didanosine in HIV-Infected Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a pilot study of d4T and ddI given to eight children with advanced HIV for 24 weeks, the three children with baseline counts greater than 50 cells/micro liter experienced a 20% increase in their CD4+ lymphocyte counts. Based on these results, controlled trials of the same regimen for children with less advanced HIV disease should be undertaken. Eligible subjects receiving d4T will be assigned in an open manner to Arm 1, and subjects who have been receiving zidovudine (AZT) will be assigned in a randomized, double blind manner to Arms 2 and 3. Each subject will receive study drug for 48 weeks as follows: Arm 1 - d4T plus ddI, Arm 2 - d4T alone, Arm 3 - d4T plus ddI.</detailed_description>
