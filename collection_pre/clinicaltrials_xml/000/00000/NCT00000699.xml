	<brief_summary>To determine the safety and effectiveness of treatment with ribavirin (RBV) plus isoprinosine (INPX) in preventing the development of AIDS in patients infected with the AIDS virus (HIV). Also to determine the maximal dose of RBV that can be tolerated by HIV-infected patients when RBV is given with INPX. The patients may or may not have generalized lymphadenopathy syndrome (LAS). RBV has prevented the development of AIDS in some HIV-infected patients with LAS and INPX has stimulated the immune system of patients infected with HIV. The immune system fights infections in the human body, and the HIV attacks T cells that are an important part of the immune system. Reports from individual cases treated with both RBV and INPX suggest that clinical improvements occurred in HIV-infected patients, but there is no reliable information on the safety and effectiveness of this drug combination in such patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Trial of Ribavirin (With Escalation) + Isoprinosine in Asymptomatic HIV-Viremic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RBV has prevented the development of AIDS in some HIV-infected patients with LAS and INPX has stimulated the immune system of patients infected with HIV. The immune system fights infections in the human body, and the HIV attacks T cells that are an important part of the immune system. Reports from individual cases treated with both RBV and INPX suggest that clinical improvements occurred in HIV-infected patients, but there is no reliable information on the safety and effectiveness of this drug combination in such patients. All patients take INPX capsules 4 times a day and RBV capsules 2 or 3 times a day. The first group of patients take the dose of RBV shown to be effective in an earlier trial and subsequent groups take higher doses until toxic effects occur. The planned treatment period is 3 months, but further treatment may be allowed for patients showing improvement. Blood samples are taken from an arm vein and used to evaluate possible changes in the patient's immune system, any toxic effects that might be detected in the blood and possible changes in the presence of HIV in the blood.</detailed_description>
