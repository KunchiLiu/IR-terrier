	<brief_summary>To assess the safety and tolerance of the combination of zidovudine (AZT) and didanosine (ddI) in children with HIV infection. New approaches to using available agents may provide increased or improved treatment options for AIDS. Combination therapy is expected to play a major role in improving survival and quality of life for HIV-infected individuals. AZT and ddI are two agents that have been most extensively evaluated and for which the evidence for antiretroviral effectiveness is strongest.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety and Toxicity of the Combination of Zidovudine and 2',3'-Dideoxyinosine (Didanosine) in Children With HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New approaches to using available agents may provide increased or improved treatment options for AIDS. Combination therapy is expected to play a major role in improving survival and quality of life for HIV-infected individuals. AZT and ddI are two agents that have been most extensively evaluated and for which the evidence for antiretroviral effectiveness is strongest. Patients take AZT and ddI on an empty stomach; ddI is taken 2 minutes after taking antacid. Part A patients receive AZT plus ddI each at ranging doses. Patients in part B may receive a higher dose of ddI than patients in part A. The first patients enrolled are given the lowest dose. Subsequent patients receive increasingly higher doses until a dose limiting toxicity occurs.</detailed_description>
