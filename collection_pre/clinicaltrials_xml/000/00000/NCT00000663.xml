	<brief_summary>To determine the safety profile, assess pharmacokinetic properties (blood levels), and obtain preliminary indication of the antiviral and immunologic effects of recombinant CD4 immunoglobulin G (CD4-IgG). CD4-IgG may be effective in blocking HIV transmission and spread, that is, CD4-IgG has antiviral effects. Studies done in adult patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC) have shown that rCD4 can be safely administered by intravenous bolus, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. No serious or dose-limiting, drug-related toxicities have been observed to date.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Recombinant CD4 Immunoglobulin G (rCD4-IgG) in Infants and Children With Documented HIV-1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CD4-IgG may be effective in blocking HIV transmission and spread, that is, CD4-IgG has antiviral effects. Studies done in adult patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC) have shown that rCD4 can be safely administered by intravenous bolus, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. No serious or dose-limiting, drug-related toxicities have been observed to date. Patients receive one intravenous injection the first week, followed by a 6 day washout period and then intravenous injections on a twice weekly basis from week 2 to week 12. The dose per injection may vary. The study evaluates 2 groups: (1) Children 3 months to 5 years of age; (2) Infants 0-3 months of age.</detailed_description>
