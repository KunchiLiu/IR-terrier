	<brief_summary>To determine the reactivity and safety of HIV-1 recombinant envelope glycoprotein gp160. To determine the immunogenicity of gp160. Although recent advances have been made in antiviral therapy against AIDS, there is currently no cure. It is likely that ultimate control of the disease will depend on the development of safe and effective vaccines against HIV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of HIV-1 Recombinant Envelope Glycoprotein gp160</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although recent advances have been made in antiviral therapy against AIDS, there is currently no cure. It is likely that ultimate control of the disease will depend on the development of safe and effective vaccines against HIV. Healthy volunteers are injected on days 0, 30, and 180 with one of four preparations: gp160 vaccine (40 mcg), gp160 vaccine (80 mcg), hepatitis B vaccine, and placebo. The hepatitis B vaccine group will serve as an additional control for immunological evaluations. An optional fourth injection may be given 15-21 months following the initial inoculation.</detailed_description>
