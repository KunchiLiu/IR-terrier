	<brief_summary>To determine the safety and anti-HIV activity of two doses of SC-49483 in combination with zidovudine (AZT) versus AZT alone. To determine the influences of viral phenotype on the anti-HIV activity of these treatment regimens. SC-49483 has no inherent activity against HIV-1 but is converted in the intestinal wall to SC-48334, which has demonstrated anti-HIV activity. Since SC-49483 causes significantly less gastrointestinal toxicity than SC-48334, the combination of SC-49483 with AZT may improve the benefits of both drugs in patients with HIV infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Double-Blind Study of Two Doses of SC-49483 in Combination With Zidovudine (ZDV) Versus ZDV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SC-49483 has no inherent activity against HIV-1 but is converted in the intestinal wall to SC-48334, which has demonstrated anti-HIV activity. Since SC-49483 causes significantly less gastrointestinal toxicity than SC-48334, the combination of SC-49483 with AZT may improve the benefits of both drugs in patients with HIV infection. Patients are randomized to receive AZT alone or in combination with one of two doses of SC-49483, administered three times daily. Treatment continues for 16 to 24 weeks. Per 07/19/94 amendment: At the end of 24 weeks, blinded treatment continues for an additional 4 weeks, at which time patients may receive open-label drug on an optional basis for 90 days.</detailed_description>
