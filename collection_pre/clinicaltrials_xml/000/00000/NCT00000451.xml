	<brief_summary>This study will assess the ability of naltrexone (Revia) to reduce the risk of relapse in Alaska natives with alcohol dependence. The study will also examine whether a combination of naltrexone and sertraline (Zoloft) yields better abstinence rates than naltrexone used alone. Alaska Native individuals will be recruited into a 16 week outpatient study.</brief_summary>
