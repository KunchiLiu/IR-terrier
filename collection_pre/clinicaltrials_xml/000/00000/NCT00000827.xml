	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of human anti-HIV immune serum globulin ( HIVIG ) at three dosage levels in HIV-infected children. Passive antibody therapy has been used with limited success in treating advanced HIV disease in adults. HIVIG is manufactured from HIV antibody-rich plasma taken from asymptomatic donors. It is hypothesized that HIVIG will decrease the viral burden of moderately advanced HIV-positive children.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Passive antibody therapy has been used with limited success in treating advanced HIV disease in adults. HIVIG is manufactured from HIV antibody-rich plasma taken from asymptomatic donors. It is hypothesized that HIVIG will decrease the viral burden of moderately advanced HIV-positive children. Children are randomized to receive HIVIG every 4 weeks for 6 months at one of three dose levels, then are followed for 3 months after the final infusion.</detailed_description>
