	<brief_title>Multi-Center Trial of Anti-Thymocyte Globulin in Treatment of Aplastic Anemia and Other Hematologic Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Aplastic anemia has been shown to respond to ATG. An immunological basis for aplastic anemia has been suggested by previous observations although the precise mechanism of action of ATG has not been defined. This serum, produced by immunization of horses with human thymocytes, may have broad reactivity with many human cells. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Patients in Group I with acute severe disease were randomized to receive ATG in either ten day or twenty-eight day courses. Patients in Group II with moderate or chronic disease were randomized to receive either ATG for ten days or high doses of the androgen, nandrolone decanoate. Patients in Group III with a variety of bone marrow diseases were also treated with ATG. The study completion date listed in this record was inferred from the last publication listed in the Citations section of this study record.</detailed_description>
