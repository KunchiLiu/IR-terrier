	<brief_summary>To provide information on the response of HIV infected, neurosyphilis patients to the currently recommended treatment for neurosyphilis; to determine whether possible co-infection with both HIV and syphilis makes more difficult the diagnosis of syphilis; to explore the usefulness of an alternative treatment which, if effective, would permit outpatient treatment for neurosyphilis that until now required prolonged hospitalization. Studies suggest that syphilis treatment failures may be more common in HIV infected patients than in patients without HIV infection and that treatment failures occur due to and/or are displayed as central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Very little is known about the best treatment course for neurosyphilis in patients who are also infected with HIV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluating Penicillin G and Ceftriaxone as Therapies for Presumed Neurosyphilis in HIV Seropositive Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies suggest that syphilis treatment failures may be more common in HIV infected patients than in patients without HIV infection and that treatment failures occur due to and/or are displayed as central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Very little is known about the best treatment course for neurosyphilis in patients who are also infected with HIV. HIV infected patients who are presumed to have neurosyphilis or have definitive neurosyphilis are treated for the neurosyphilis with either penicillin G or ceftriaxone. Patients are treated for 10 days and followed for 50 weeks after treatment. Patients receiving penicillin G are hospitalized while receiving the penicillin. Patients receiving ceftriaxone are treated on an inpatient basis for at least the first three days and may then be discharged to receive outpatient treatment. During treatment, patients are permitted to take antiretroviral drugs or other drugs for opportunistic infections except for drugs that are antisyphilitic. Lumbar punctures will be performed.</detailed_description>
