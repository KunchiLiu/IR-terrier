	<brief_summary>PRIMARY: To determine the effect of 8 weeks of zidovudine (AZT) treatment on the HIV-1 burden in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue in HIV-1-infected, AZT-naive patients with CD4+ T lymphocyte counts between 100 and 500 cells/mm3. SECONDARY: To determine the extent to which apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs in these patients. In previous trials of AZT treatment in HIV-infected patients, an antiviral effect has been clearly demonstrated by quantitative measurement of virus in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, the lymphoid tissues appear to be a major reservoir for HIV-1 and a major site of virus replication in HIV-infected persons. Further data is needed to assess the effect of treatment on viral burden and HIV-1 replication in lymphoid tissue.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Changes in HIV-1 Burden in Peripheral Blood and Lymphoid Tissue Following Zidovudine ( AZT ) Treatment in HIV-1-Infected Patients With CD4+ Cells Between 100 and 500 Cells/mm3.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In previous trials of AZT treatment in HIV-infected patients, an antiviral effect has been clearly demonstrated by quantitative measurement of virus in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, the lymphoid tissues appear to be a major reservoir for HIV-1 and a major site of virus replication in HIV-infected persons. Further data is needed to assess the effect of treatment on viral burden and HIV-1 replication in lymphoid tissue. Patients receive AZT daily for 8 weeks and are followed in clinic at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 14 (or possibly via telephone call at week 14). Patients undergo a lymph node biopsy at day 0 and week 8.</detailed_description>
