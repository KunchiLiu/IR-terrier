	<brief_summary>Group A: To compare the time to confirmed virologic failure (2 consecutive plasma HIV-RNA concentrations of 500 copies/ml or more) between the treatment arms: abacavir (ABC) or placebo in combination with zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), and indinavir (IDV). To evaluate the safety and tolerability of these treatment arms. [AS PER AMENDMENT 06/16/99: To compare the time to confirmed treatment failure, permanent discontinuation of treatment, or death between the treatment arms.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/27/01: Groups B, C, and D completed follow-up on March 4, 1999. Therefore, only information pertinent to Group A is applicable.] Group B: To compare the proportion of patients who achieve plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations below 500 copies/ml, as assessed by the standard Roche Amplicor assay at Week 16, or to compare the absolute changes in plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations at Week 16 across the treatment arms: ABC or approved nucleoside analogs and nelfinavir (NFV) or placebo in combination with efavirenz (EFV) and adefovir dipivoxil. To compare the safety and tolerability of these treatment arms. Group C: To monitor plasma HIV-1 RNA trajectory over time and determine the time to a confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration above 2,000 copies/ml on 2 consecutive determinations for patients treated with ZDV or stavudine (d4T) plus 3TC and IDV. Group D: To evaluate plasma HIV-1 RNA responses at Weeks 16 and 48. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatment arms: ABC, EFV, adefovir dipivoxil, and NFV. This study explores new treatment options for ACTG 320 enrollees (and, if needed, a limited number of non-ACTG 320 volunteers) who have been receiving ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC and IDV and are currently exhibiting a range of virologic responses. By dividing the study into the corresponding, nonsequential cohorts (Groups A, B, C, D), different approaches to evaluating virologic success, i.e., undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, and virologic failure, i.e., plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of 500 copies/ml or more [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/27/01: 200 copies/ml or more], are explored while maintaining long-term follow-up of ACTG 320 patients. [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/27/01: Groups B, C, and D completed follow-up on March 4, 1999. Therefore, only information pertinent to Group A is applicable. This study will examine the question of whether intensification of therapy can prolong the virologic benefit in individuals whose plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations have been below the limits of assay detection on ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC plus IDV.]</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study explores new treatment options for ACTG 320 enrollees (and, if needed, a limited number of non-ACTG 320 volunteers) who have been receiving ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC and IDV and are currently exhibiting a range of virologic responses. By dividing the study into the corresponding, nonsequential cohorts (Groups A, B, C, D), different approaches to evaluating virologic success, i.e., undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, and virologic failure, i.e., plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of 500 copies/ml or more [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/27/01: 200 copies/ml or more], are explored while maintaining long-term follow-up of ACTG 320 patients. [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/27/01: Groups B, C, and D completed follow-up on March 4, 1999. Therefore, only information pertinent to Group A is included. This study will examine the question of whether intensification of therapy can prolong the virologic benefit in individuals whose plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations have been below the limits of assay detection on ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC plus IDV.] Rollover patients from ACTG 320 are given enrollment priority and permitted to enroll in all 4 study groups; non-ACTG patients are permitted to enroll in Groups A and B if accrual objectives are not met with ACTG 320 patients. GROUP A: Patients with screening plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations below 500 copies/ml are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms and stratified according to their participation in ACTG 320 (original randomization to IDV versus open-label IDV). The 2 treatment arms are as follows: ARM A1: IDV plus ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC plus ABC. ARM A2: IDV plus ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC plus ABC placebo. Patients who achieve a plasma HIV-1 RNA level of 500 copies/ml or more on 2 consecutive determinations may continue their assigned arm in a blinded fashion, or seek the best alternative therapy selected by the local investigator or primary care physician. GROUP B: Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-naive patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA plasma concentrations of 500 copies/ml or more are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms and stratified by plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations (above versus below 15,000 RNA copies/ml) and participation in ACTG 320 (original randomization to IDV versus open-label IDV). The treatment arms are as follows: ARM B1: ABC plus EFV plus adefovir dipivoxil plus NFV. ARM B2: ABC plus EFV plus adefovir dipivoxil plus NFV placebo. ARM B3: 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (or 1 if 2 not tolerated) (chosen from ZDV, 3TC, d4T, or didanosine [ddI]) plus EFV plus adefovir dipivoxil plus NFV. ARM B4: 2 NRTIs (or 1 if 2 not tolerated) (chosen from ZDV, 3TC, d4T, or ddI) plus EFV plus adefovir dipivoxil plus NFV placebo. GROUP C: NNRTI-naive patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations of 500-2,000 copies/ml at screening may elect to be randomized to a treatment arm in Group B or continue with their current ACTG 320 regimen as follows: ARM C: ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC plus IDV. Patients who elect this treatment are randomized in Group B if their plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations are confirmed to be above 2,000 copies. GROUP D: NNRTI-experienced, ACTG 320 patients with screening plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations of 500 copies/ml or more receive open-label treatment as follows: ARM D: ABC plus EFV plus adefovir dipivoxil plus NFV. [AS PER AMENDMENT 06/29/98: Enrollment to Group B is closed to accrual. Group A patients with HIV-1 RNA of 200 copies/ml or more on 2 consecutive determinations may continue their assigned treatment or seek best alternative antiretroviral therapy, which may include access to ABC. Group B patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA of 500 copies/ml or more may continue their assigned treatment or seek best available antiretroviral therapy, which may include access to ABC, EFV, and adefovir dipivoxil with L-carnitine supplementation. Group C patients with HIV-1 RNA levels above 2,000 copies/ml and Group D patients with levels above 500 copies/ml may no longer be randomized to a treatment arm in Group B. Such patients may continue their assigned treatment or seek best available therapy, which may include access to therapy as per Group B patients.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 06/16/99: Study treatment for Groups B, C, and D has been completed. Group A patients with a confirmed plasma HIV-2 endpoint who remain on study may have access to ABC while on study.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/27/01: With Version 4.0 of the protocol, many of the metabolic assessments and the cardiovascular risk assessment will be repeated, and a self-reported questionnaire of body shape changes will be added. In addition, an investigation of the effect of long-term IDV on pyuria/hematuria is added, as well as a study of HIV-1 RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).]</detailed_description>
