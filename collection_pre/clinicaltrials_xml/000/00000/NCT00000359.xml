	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine the relative short- and long-term efficacy of several physical treatment paradigms commonly employed for the treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), including the canalith repositioning (Epley) maneuver, the liberatory (Semont) maneuver, the Brandt-Daroff exercises and nonspecific vestibular habituation exercises. These procedures involve exercises and head manipulations. Vertigo intensity and frequency, the presence/absence of slow-phase eye movements, the degree of dizziness handicap and acts of daily living (ADL) were assessed. The study also ascertained the effects of co-morbid conditions on the response to treatment. While BPPV is a common and significant public health problem that has been recognized for several decades, this is the first systematic study of the relative treatment efficacy of different physical treatment modalities for this disorder.</brief_summary>
