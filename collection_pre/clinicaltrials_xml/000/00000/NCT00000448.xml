	<brief_title>Naltrexone Treatment for Alcoholic Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Despite important gender differences in drinking patterns, physiological effects of alcohol, and co-occurring psychiatric conditions, relatively little is known about the efficacy of naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence in women. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of naltrexone in combination with Cognitive Behavioral Coping Skills Therapy (CBCST) in a sample of alcohol-dependent women, some with comorbid eating pathology. Methods: One hundred three women meeting DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence (29 with comorbid eating disturbances) were randomized to receive either naltrexone or placebo for 12 weeks in addition to weekly group CBCST.</detailed_description>
