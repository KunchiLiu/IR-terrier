	<brief_summary>To evaluate short-term and long-term safety and efficacy of intravenous cidofovir (HPMPC) for treatment of small peripheral cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis lesions. To provide data on the relative safety and efficacy of 2 doses of HPMPC as maintenance regimens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HPMPC (Cidofovir) Peripheral CMV Retinitis Trial Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Stage 1, up to 30 patients are randomized to either observation with deferral of treatment until the retinitis progresses (observation group), or to intravenous HPMPC at the higher dose for two consecutive weekly induction doses, followed by the lower dose every other week for maintenance. In Stage 2, up to 70 patients are randomized to observation or to HPMPC at the higher dose for two consecutive weekly induction doses followed by either dose every other week for maintenance, for a total of three treatment groups. Concomitant saline hydration and probenecid are administered to patients receiving HPMPC.</detailed_description>
