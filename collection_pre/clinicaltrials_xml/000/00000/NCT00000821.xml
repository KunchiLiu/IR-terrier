	<brief_summary>To compare the effects of low-dose versus high-dose subcutaneous ( SC ) aldesleukin ( interleukin-2; IL-2 ) on immunologic and virologic markers in HIV-infected patients. To compare the effects of monthly versus bimonthly administration of SC IL-2 on these markers. Interleukin-2 is a protein that is naturally produced by lymphocytes. In an initial study, patients in an earlier stage of HIV-1 infection tended to tolerate SC IL-2 better than those with more advanced infections, and those with higher baseline CD4+ counts tended to derive the greatest benefit.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Interleukin-2 is a protein that is naturally produced by lymphocytes. In an initial study, patients in an earlier stage of HIV-1 infection tended to tolerate SC IL-2 better than those with more advanced infections, and those with higher baseline CD4+ counts tended to derive the greatest benefit. Patients are randomized to one of four treatment arms; patients receive either low-dose or high-dose SC IL-2 for 5 days either on a monthly or bimonthly schedule for approximately 6 months.</detailed_description>
