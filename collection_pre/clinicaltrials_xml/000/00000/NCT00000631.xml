	<brief_summary>Primary: To determine whether additional boosting with soluble recombinant gp160 vaccine (VaxSyn) after priming with a vaccinia-HIV envelope recombinant (HIVAC-1e) provides a significant advantage in the degree and duration of immunogenicity. Secondary: To learn more about the safety of the combination use of the two HIV envelope vaccines in the study (VaxSyn and HIVAC-1e). Recent Phase I trials conducted at the AIDS Vaccine Units have shown that antibodies have persisted in most recipients for 6 months after boosting, and responses seem significantly higher and more persistent than responses achieved by just two doses of soluble protein vaccine alone or two doses of HIVAC-1e alone. This study tests in a previously recruited cohort of volunteers whether additional boosting with soluble recombinant gp160 results in increased immunogenicity of longer duration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Vaccinia-HIV Envelope Recombinant Vaccine (HIVAC-1e) in Combination With Soluble Recombinant Envelope Vaccine (VaxSyn)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent Phase I trials conducted at the AIDS Vaccine Units have shown that antibodies have persisted in most recipients for 6 months after boosting, and responses seem significantly higher and more persistent than responses achieved by just two doses of soluble protein vaccine alone or two doses of HIVAC-1e alone. This study tests in a previously recruited cohort of volunteers whether additional boosting with soluble recombinant gp160 results in increased immunogenicity of longer duration. Twelve volunteers who have previously received two doses of HIVAC-1e (or DryVax) and two doses of gp160 receive an additional boost of gp160 at 12-20 months after the last boost and an additional dose of HIVAC-1e at least 9 months after the final gp160 boost.</detailed_description>
