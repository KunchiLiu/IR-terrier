	<brief_summary>To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of amitriptyline hydrochloride versus mexiletine hydrochloride in reducing pain intensity in patients with HIV-related painful peripheral neuropathy. No large-scale controlled clinical trials of symptomatic therapy for painful HIV-related neuropathy have been attempted. Both amitriptyline and mexiletine have been useful in the management of painful neuropathies; however, both are associated with certain toxicities. In this comparative study of amitriptyline and mexiletine, benztropine mesylate also will be included as an active placebo to mimic the side effects of the study drugs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II/III Double-Blind Study of Amitriptyline and Mexiletine for Painful Neuropathy in HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>No large-scale controlled clinical trials of symptomatic therapy for painful HIV-related neuropathy have been attempted. Both amitriptyline and mexiletine have been useful in the management of painful neuropathies; however, both are associated with certain toxicities. In this comparative study of amitriptyline and mexiletine, benztropine mesylate also will be included as an active placebo to mimic the side effects of the study drugs. Patients are randomized to receive amitriptyline, mexiletine, or benztropine mesylate as an active placebo to mimic the mild side effects associated with both amitriptyline and mexiletine. Doses are gradually increased over 4 weeks until a minimum effective dose or MTD is reached, then patients are treated for at least 4 additional weeks at the final dose before gradually tapering off. Neurologic exams are performed at screening and at the end of treatment. Intensity of pain is rated twice daily by the patient. Patients are followed at Weeks 2, 4, and 8, and at 10 days after completely tapering off of drug. PER 3/16/95 AMENDMENT: Patients with no pain relief 14 days after initiation of study therapy may have dose doubled or increased to maximum allowable dose, whichever is lower. Then if no improvement occurs within 14 days after dose increase, patients have the option of discontinuing study medication.</detailed_description>

Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded: Diabetes mellitus. Neurological disease of sufficient severity to confound the evaluation of peripheral neuropathy, such as myelopathy without neuropathy. (NOTE: Patients with both myelopathy AND painful peripheral neuropathy are eligible.) Electrocardiogram (EKG) indicating malignant arrhythmia or cardiac conduction disturbances (such as second or third degree AV block, anterior hemiblock, or prolonged QT interval). Suicidal thoughts of sufficient severity to require treatment with antidepressant medication. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: Phenytoin or carbamazepine (unless on stable dose for 8 weeks prior to study entry). Capsaicin.

Chloramphenicol, disulfiram, ethionamide glutethimide, gold, hydralazine, iodoquinol, metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, or ribavirin (only in patients in whom the onset or clear worsening of painful peripheral neuropathy was attributed to previously taking these drugs). Any investigational drugs other than 3TC (except with permission of the protocol team). Terfenadine (if concurrent with ketoconazole). Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded: Documented history of cardiac disease. History of allergy to, or intolerance of, tricyclic antidepressants, mexiletine, or benztropine. Prior Medication: Excluded: Prior disopyramide. Prior procainamide. Prior quinidine. Prior tocainide. Prior flecainide acetate. Prior encainide. Prior lidocaine.

Chloramphenicol, disulfiram, ethionamide glutethimide, gold, hydralazine, iodoquinol, metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, or ribavirin within 8 weeks prior to study entry (only in patients in whom the onset or clear worsening of painful peripheral neuropathy was attributed to taking these drugs). Any MAO inhibitor antidepressants, any tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants, certain serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, and venlafaxine), or mexiletine, within 4 weeks prior to study entry. More than 50 percent change in the weekly dosage of any pain control medications within 2 weeks prior to study entry. Per 3/16/95 amendment: ddI, ddC, d4T, or 3TC within 8 weeks prior to study entry ONLY IF dideoxynucleoside dosing was suspended or permanently discontinued.
