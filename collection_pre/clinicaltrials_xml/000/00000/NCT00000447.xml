	<brief_summary>This study will develop a behavioral and drug relapse prevention program for individuals who are dependent on both alcohol and tobacco. The study's goal is to show that individuals receiving nicotine replacement therapy and naltrexone (Revia) with behavior therapy will have higher rates of abstinence from both smoking and drinking than individuals who do not receive the drug therapies. Individuals will be placed in a 12-week outpatient treatment program with followup assessments 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment.</brief_summary>
