	<brief_title>A Study to Collect Information About HIV-Positive Pregnant Women and Their Babies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The population served at affiliated ACTG sites has not been officially described. Anecdotal evidence, however, has surfaced regarding the characteristics of HIV-infected pregnant women and the current standard of care during pregnancy. This chart abstraction study is designed to define, more accurately, the pertinent characteristics and general numbers of women in these trials. In this medical chart abstraction study, pertinent information is collected on all HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants who receive primary or consultative care at PACTG 367 study sites. Part A profiles all HIV-infected women who received care or consultation at study sites and who had a pregnancy outcome between January 1, 1998 through July 1, 1998. [AS PER AMENDMENT 04/12/02: Part A is closed to enrollment.] Part B profiles HIV-infected pregnant women who receive primary or consultative care and a pregnancy outcome following July 1, 1998.</detailed_description>
