	<brief_summary>To compare the efficacy and safety of dapsone versus atovaquone in preventing or delaying the onset of histologically proven or probable Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts &lt;= 200 cells/mm3 or &lt;= 15 percent of the total lymphocyte count who are intolerant to trimethoprim and/or sulfonamides. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), which is effective for secondary PCP prophylaxis, is associated with allergic manifestations and side effects that limit its use. Patients who are intolerant of TMP/SMX require an effective alternative. Dapsone and atovaquone have both shown promise as PCP prophylactic agents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized, Comparative Study of Daily Dapsone and Daily Atovaquone for Prophylaxis Against PCP in HIV-Infected Patients Who Are Intolerant of Trimethoprim and/or Sulfonamides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), which is effective for secondary PCP prophylaxis, is associated with allergic manifestations and side effects that limit its use. Patients who are intolerant of TMP/SMX require an effective alternative. Dapsone and atovaquone have both shown promise as PCP prophylactic agents. Patients are randomized to receive either dapsone or atovaquone daily, with follow-up at the clinic every 4 months.</detailed_description>
