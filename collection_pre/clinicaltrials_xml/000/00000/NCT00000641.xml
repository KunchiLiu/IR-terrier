	<brief_summary>To compare the effectiveness and toxicity of two combination drug treatment programs for the treatment of disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection in HIV seropositive patients. [Per 03/06/92 amendment: to evaluate the efficacy of azithromycin when given in conjunction with either ethambutol or clofazimine as maintenance therapy.] Disseminated M. avium infection is the most common systemic bacterial infection complicating AIDS in the United States. The prognosis of patients with disseminated M. avium is extremely poor, particularly when it follows other opportunistic infections or is associated with anemia. Test tube studies and clinical data indicate that the best treatment program may include clofazimine, ethambutol, a rifamycin derivative, and ciprofloxacin. Test tube and animal studies indicate that amikacin is a bactericidal (bacteria destroying) drug that works better when used with ciprofloxacin. Its role in treatment programs is a key issue because of toxicity and because it must be administered parenterally (by injection or intravenously).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Disseminated M. avium infection is the most common systemic bacterial infection complicating AIDS in the United States. The prognosis of patients with disseminated M. avium is extremely poor, particularly when it follows other opportunistic infections or is associated with anemia. Test tube studies and clinical data indicate that the best treatment program may include clofazimine, ethambutol, a rifamycin derivative, and ciprofloxacin. Test tube and animal studies indicate that amikacin is a bactericidal (bacteria destroying) drug that works better when used with ciprofloxacin. Its role in treatment programs is a key issue because of toxicity and because it must be administered parenterally (by injection or intravenously). Patients undergo an initial 2-week observation period (days 1 - 14) during which time baseline evaluations are performed and type and severity of symptoms are monitored. Eligible patients are randomized on day 15 to one of two treatment programs: (1) ciprofloxacin, clofazimine, ethambutol, and rifampin (all taken orally), or (2) the same four drugs plus amikacin. Only patients for whom blood cultures obtained on either day 1 or day 14/15 are positive by week 6 continue on study drugs. Patients receive combination therapy for 24 weeks. Patients may have an indwelling central venous catheter in place for long-term administration of intravenous drug. PER 03/06/92 AMENDMENT: Newly enrolled patients who demonstrate a complete or partial clinical response at the end of study week 10 (8 weeks of drug therapy) discontinue their current regimen and begin maintenance therapy with azithromycin plus either ethambutol or clofazimine for an additional 24 weeks. Patients who do not demonstrate a response at study week 10 are discontinued from all study therapy. Patients enrolled on earlier versions of the protocol who have surpassed study week 16 (14 weeks of drug therapy) continue treatment with their originally assigned regimen through study week 26; those who have not surpassed study week 16 are considered for inclusion in the maintenance phase of the study.</detailed_description>

Antacids within 2 hours of ingestion of study drugs. Immunomodulators (except interferonalfa) and other antimycobacterial drugs (including quinolones and aminoglycosides). All experimental therapies (except ddI, ddC, and other experimental agents granted "Treatment IND" or "expanded access" status) will be prohibited (specific exemptions must be obtained from one of the protocol chairs). Patients with the following are excluded: Known or suspected allergy to any of the study medications. Cannot take drugs orally. Severe hearing loss, at the discretion of the investigator.
