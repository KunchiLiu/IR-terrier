	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and immune response of 100 mcg Env 2-3 antigen administered on days 0, 30, 180, and 365. Preliminary immunologic data from protocol VEU 005B show evidence of the development of functional antibodies in the form of increased peptide binding and development of neutralizing antibodies. Evaluation of an antigen dose having potentially greater immunogenicity is therefore of particular interest.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of 100 mcg of Env 2-3 in MF59</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary immunologic data from protocol VEU 005B show evidence of the development of functional antibodies in the form of increased peptide binding and development of neutralizing antibodies. Evaluation of an antigen dose having potentially greater immunogenicity is therefore of particular interest. Twelve healthy volunteers receive injections of 100 mcg Env 2-3 in MF59 emulsion and two volunteers receive MF59 only on days 0, 30, 180, and 365. Follow-up continues for 6 months after the last injection.</detailed_description>
