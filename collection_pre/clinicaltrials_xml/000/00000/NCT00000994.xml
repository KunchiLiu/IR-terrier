	<brief_summary>To determine whether taking zidovudine (AZT) will change the natural course of HIV infection in patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and whether administering AZT at a similar dose but at different intervals will reduce toxicity in a more manageable treatment plan. Patients infected with AIDS can benefit from therapy with an effective anti-AIDS virus agent. AZT is a drug that is effective in inhibiting the effects of HIV infection. The study will show whether toxicity of AZT can be reduced in a more manageable treatment plan, and whether AZT therapy will delay the development of opportunistic infections and/or KS lesions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients infected with AIDS can benefit from therapy with an effective anti-AIDS virus agent. AZT is a drug that is effective in inhibiting the effects of HIV infection. The study will show whether toxicity of AZT can be reduced in a more manageable treatment plan, and whether AZT therapy will delay the development of opportunistic infections and/or KS lesions. Patients are divided into two treatment groups, the first receiving AZT for 5 doses a day, and the second receiving AZT for 3 doses per day. A placebo group is divided into two to match the two treatment groups. Study patients are stratified according to whether they have (a) 10 or fewer cutaneous lesions without oral lesions or (b) more extensive cutaneous lesions or oral lesions. Patients are seen on an outpatient basis weekly for the first 2 months, every other week for the next 2 months, and monthly thereafter.</detailed_description>
