	<brief_summary>PRIMARY: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and ethanol exposure of two dose regimens and formulations of SC-52151. SECONDARY: To evaluate the preliminary anti-HIV activity of these treatment regimens and the relationship between day 14 plasma concentrations of SC-52151 and immunological and virological markers and toxicity. Since viral isolates with decreased susceptibility to the protease inhibitor SC-52151 occur in vitro after multiple passages, and since prolonged post infectious effects occur in vitro, comparison of two formulations, an elixir and a self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS), is needed to determine the appropriate dose formulation for Phase II studies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Randomized Dose/Formulation Comparison Study of SC-52151</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since viral isolates with decreased susceptibility to the protease inhibitor SC-52151 occur in vitro after multiple passages, and since prolonged post infectious effects occur in vitro, comparison of two formulations, an elixir and a self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS), is needed to determine the appropriate dose formulation for Phase II studies. Patients are randomized to four treatment arms to receive SC-52151 elixir or SEDDS formulation at 1 of 2 doses for 2 weeks, with follow-up for 14 days.</detailed_description>
