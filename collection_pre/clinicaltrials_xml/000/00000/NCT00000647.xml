	<brief_summary>To restore immunologic function and virus-free state in HIV-infected patients. Based on previous studies showing temporary improvement in immune function in HIV-infected patients using peripheral lymphocyte transfers and bone marrow transplantation, and based on studies documenting the antiretroviral effects of zidovudine (AZT) and interferon-alfa (IFN-A) as well as the preliminary test tube and patient studies suggesting anti-HIV effects of recombinant CD4-IgG, we propose to treat HIV-infected patients using combination antiretroviral therapy with transplantation of bone marrow and peripheral lymphocytes from previously immunized donors in an attempt to restore immunologic function and a virus-free state.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Trial Combining Zidovudine, Interferon-alfa, and Recombinant CD4-IgG With Transplantation of Syngeneic Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes From Healthy gp160-Immunized Donors in the Treatment of Patients With HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on previous studies showing temporary improvement in immune function in HIV-infected patients using peripheral lymphocyte transfers and bone marrow transplantation, and based on studies documenting the antiretroviral effects of zidovudine (AZT) and interferon-alfa (IFN-A) as well as the preliminary test tube and patient studies suggesting anti-HIV effects of recombinant CD4-IgG, we propose to treat HIV-infected patients using combination antiretroviral therapy with transplantation of bone marrow and peripheral lymphocytes from previously immunized donors in an attempt to restore immunologic function and a virus-free state. Three patients are treated with stable doses of AZT, IFN-A, and CD4-IgG for 12 weeks, followed by six peripheral lymphocyte infusions and transplantation of bone marrow from their respective identical twins. Following bone marrow transplantation, patients continue to receive the three drugs. Additional periods of lymphocyte apheresis and transfer may be offered to each donor/recipient pair.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Each patient must have an identical twin in a normal state of health with a normal screening lab panel and a normal immune profile who is documented to be antibody and culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative for HIV. Ability to provide informed consent. Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded: Malignancy other than Kaposi's sarcoma. Patients with the following are excluded: Unwillingness to comply with current NIH Clinical Center guidelines concerning appropriate notification of all current sexual partners of an individual regarding his or her positive HIV serostatus and the risk of transmission of HIV infection. Presence of a serious opportunistic infection or other illness or condition that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, warrants exclusion from participation in the study. Current use of illicit drugs or significant amounts of alcohol that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, would interfere with compliance with the study.</criteria>
