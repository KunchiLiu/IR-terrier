	<brief_summary>To test the effectiveness of itraconazole in preventing the recurrence of disseminated histoplasmosis in AIDS patients. Histoplasmosis is a serious opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Amphotericin B has been used to treat the infection. Although the response to this treatment is generally good, up to 90 percent of AIDS patients who have taken amphotericin B to treat their histoplasmosis infection will have a relapse (that is, they will get the disease again) within 12 months following treatment. Ketoconazole has been used to prevent relapse, but available information suggests that up to 50 percent of AIDS patients relapse even with ketoconazole treatment. A more effective therapy to prevent recurrence is needed. Itraconazole has been used successfully to treat disseminated histoplasmosis in non-AIDS patients and it is hoped that it may be more effective in preventing histoplasmosis relapse.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Histoplasmosis is a serious opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Amphotericin B has been used to treat the infection. Although the response to this treatment is generally good, up to 90 percent of AIDS patients who have taken amphotericin B to treat their histoplasmosis infection will have a relapse (that is, they will get the disease again) within 12 months following treatment. Ketoconazole has been used to prevent relapse, but available information suggests that up to 50 percent of AIDS patients relapse even with ketoconazole treatment. A more effective therapy to prevent recurrence is needed. Itraconazole has been used successfully to treat disseminated histoplasmosis in non-AIDS patients and it is hoped that it may be more effective in preventing histoplasmosis relapse. AIDS patients who have been successfully treated with amphotericin B for an acute first episode of disseminated histoplasmosis are selected for treatment. They receive daily oral doses of itraconazole for a total of 52 weeks. Patients who do not experience significant toxicity related to the drug may continue to receive itraconazole until the last patient completes 52 weeks of itraconazole therapy or has the study drug discontinued prior to completing 52 weeks of therapy. AMENDED: Patients will be treated for a minimum of 52 weeks. Patients who complete the 52 weeks and remain on the study drug will continue to be followed. If itraconazole becomes licensed for histoplasmosis, study drug must be discontinued at the end of 52 weeks of therapy or at the time of licensure for patients who have received more than 52 weeks of therapy.</detailed_description>
