	<brief_summary>AIT-082 is a novel small molecule that crosses the blood-brain barrier to enhance nerve function by increasing levels of neurotrophic growth factors and encouraging nerve sprouting in the brain. Preclinical studies in animals have shown that AIT-082 improves memory in aged animals and in animals with neurological deficits. This study was a double-blind placebo-controlled safety study that was designed to study whether AIT-082 may delay age-related mental decline. Eight healthy older volunteers at two clinical sites were given single, weekly, rising doses of AIT-082 or placebo for 5 weeks; were tested for side effects and absorption; and underwent a battery of neuropsychological memory tests, including word and number recall tests.</brief_summary>
