	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of various combinations of anti-HIV drugs in HIV-positive men and women. Patients receive specific combinations of 3 or 4 of the following 6 drugs: didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T) efavirenz (EFV), nelfinavir (NFV), lamivudine (3TC), or zidovudine (ZDV). Anti-HIV therapy is effective in preventing the spread of HIV in the body. However, patients often experience unpleasant side effects and have difficulties following the dosing schedule. This study looks for combinations of anti-HIV drugs ("cocktails") which will be the most effective with the fewest problems.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Various Combinations of Anti-HIV Medications to Treat Early HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Highly active antiretroviral therapy, though effective in the suppression of HIV proliferation, is often complicated by difficulties with adherence and drug toxicity. Various combinations of highly active antiretroviral therapy exist; all have proved efficacious in related trials. The question addressed in this trial is which combination of antiretroviral "cocktails" provides the single greatest advantage in preventing the spread of HIV in the body. In effect, which therapy provides the greatest benefit with the fewest complications. Step 1: Patients are randomized to 1 of 6 arms: Arm A: didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), efavirenz (EFV), and nelfinavir (NFV) placebo. Arm B: ddI, d4T, EFV placebo, and NFV. Arm C: lamivudine (3TC)/zidovudine (ZDV), EFV, and NFV placebo. Arm D: 3TC/ZDV, EFV placebo, and NFV. Arm E: ddI, d4T, EFV, and NFV. Arm F: 3TC/ZDV, EFV, and NFV. Patients with virologic failure on 2 successive measurements or study-drug intolerance discontinue their randomized study therapy and proceed to Step 2. [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/5/00: Patients must switch regimens as soon as possible after confirmation of virologic failure to prevent development of drug resistance.] Step 2: Arm A: Patients receive treatment as in Arm D of Step 1. Arm B: Patients receive treatment as in Arm C of Step 1. Arm C: Patients receive treatment as in Arm B of Step 1. Arm D: Patients receive treatment as in Arm A of Step 1. Arms A, B, C, and D: Patients who fail Step 2 treatment proceed to Step 3. Arms E and F: Patients with virologic failure on Step 1 proceed immediately to Step 3. Step 3 (salvage therapy): Arm A, B, C, and D: Patients receive indinavir (IDV), amprenavir (APV), ddI, and hydroxyurea (HU). [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/5/00: Patients now receive treatment on Regimen 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Regimen 1 consists of IDV, ritonavir (RTV), ddI, and HU. Regimen 2 consists of APV, RTV, ddI, and HU. Regimen 3 consists of IDV, RTV, abacavir (ABC), and 3TC/ZDV. Regimen 4 consists of APV, RTV, ABC, and 3TC/ZDV. Regimen 5 consists of IDV, RTV, ABC, d4T, and 3TC. Regimen 6 consists of APV, RTV, ABC, d4T, and 3TC.] Arm E: Patients receive IDV, APV, and 3TC/ZDV. [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/5/00: Patients now receive treatment on Regimen 7 or 8. Regimen 7 consists of IDV, RTV, and 3TC/ZDV. Regimen 8 consists of APV, RTV, and 3TC/ZDV.] Arm F: Patients receive IDV, APV, ddI, and d4T. [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/5/00: Patients now receive treatment on Regimen 9 or 10. Regimen 9 consists of IDV, RTV, ddI, and d4T. Regimen 10 consists of APV, RTV, ddI, and d4T.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/5/00: Patients already enrolled in Step 3 before site registration to Version 4.0 of this protocol have the option of receiving 1 of the appropriate new Step 3 regimens as outlined above or staying on their originally assigned Step 3 therapy.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 3/21/01: If virologic failure on Step 1 or 2 is confirmed, then HIV-1 RNA genotype resistance testing (in real-time, if possible) is performed. Patients receive 1 of the Step 3 drug regimens based on the results of the resistance testing.] Patients may co-enroll in metabolic, pharmacologic, immunologic, or adherence substudies.</detailed_description>
