	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining liposomal doxorubicin with ifosfamide in treating patients who have advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liposomal Doxorubicin Plus Ifosfamide in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of ifosfamide in combination with doxorubicin HCl liposome in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. - Determine the objective response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the dose-limiting toxicity in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of ifosfamide. Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour on day 1 and ifosfamide IV over 4 hours on days 1-3 OR on days 1-4 (for patients enrolled on dose level 6). Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ifosfamide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression and then every 12 weeks thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
