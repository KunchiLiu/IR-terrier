	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of homoharringtonine in treating patients who have refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Homoharringtonine in Treating Patients With Refractory Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety of salvage therapy comprising homoharringtonine in patients with refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia. - Determine the antileukemic efficacy of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive remission induction therapy comprising homoharringtonine (HH) IV continuously on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity until a complete remission (CR) is achieved or the patient fails to respond after 3 courses. Patients who achieve a CR during induction therapy receive maintenance therapy comprising HH IV continuously on days 1-7. Maintenance treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
