	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and cisplatin, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet known if chemotherapy plus radiation therapy is more effective than chemotherapy alone before surgery in treating non-small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying docetaxel and cisplatin with or without radiation therapy to see how well they work when given before surgery in treating patients with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to lymph nodes in the chest.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy vs. Chemotherapy Alone in NSCLC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of this trial is to compare feasibility and efficacy of sequential neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with 44 Gy concomitant boost to neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. Secondary objectives are to assess the value of PET in predicting pathological response and eventfree survival in stage IIIA NSCLC, and a health economic analysis of the two regimens. Further to compare the amount of serum DNA in patients with stage IIIA, pN2 NSCLC before chemotherapy, before surgery and at the second follow-up visit (i.e. four months after surgery or treatment failure for patients who can not be operated) in patients randomized into the trial SAKK 16/00 and to correlate the DNA variation with tumor response, remission duration and overall survival. OUTLINE: This is a prospective randomized phase III trial. Patients are stratified according to mediastinal bulk (5 cm or more vs less than 5 cm), weight loss in the past 6 months (5% or more vs less than 5%), and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.</detailed_description>
