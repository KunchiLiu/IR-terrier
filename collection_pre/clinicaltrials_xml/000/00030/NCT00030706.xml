	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ixabepilone in treating patients who have relapsed and/or refractory stage III or stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixabepilone in Treating Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Stage III or Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the antitumor activity of ixabepilone, in terms of clinical response and progression-free survival, in patients with relapsed and/or refractory stage III or IV ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Correlate pre-ixabepilone survivin mRNA and protein levels in patient-derived ovarian cancer cells with quality of response (i.e., at least partial response vs no response). - Correlate CYP3A4 (3A4*1B), 3A5 (3A5*1), and 3A7 (ER6 p variation) allelic polymorphisms with parent drug kinetic parameters, toxicity, and efficacy of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour once weekly on weeks 1-3. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
