	<brief_title>Iododoxorubicin in Treating Patients With Primary Systemic Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of iododoxorubicin in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, especially cardiac safety, of this drug in these patients. II. Determine the survival rate of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine, preliminarily, the clinical efficacy of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive iododoxorubicin IV over 15 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 12 weeks for a total of 4 courses or a cumulative dose of 400 mg/m^2 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of iododoxorubicin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 months.</detailed_description>
