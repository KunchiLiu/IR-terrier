	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Radiosurgery may be able to deliver x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. It is not yet known if radiosurgery is more effective with or without whole-brain radiation therapy in treating brain metastases. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiosurgery with or without whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients who have brain metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiosurgery With or Without Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the overall survival of patients with 1 to 3 cerebral metastases treated with radiosurgery with or without whole brain radiotherapy. - Compare the time to CNS failure (brain) in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the quality of life, duration of functional independence, and long-term neurocognitive status in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the post-treatment toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (60 and over vs under 60), extracranial disease (controlled for more than 3 months vs controlled for 3 months or less), and number of brain metastases (1 vs more than 1). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo radiosurgery. - Arm II: Patients undergo radiosurgery. Within 14 days, patients then undergo whole brain radiotherapy 5 days a week for 2.5 weeks. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, the beginning of each treatment, at week 6, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years. Patients are followed at weeks 6 and 12, every 3 months for 9 months, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 480 patients (240 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 5 years.</detailed_description>
