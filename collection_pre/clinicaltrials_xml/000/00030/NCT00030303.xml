	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells may make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who have chronic myelogenous leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of vaccination with autologous heat shock protein 70 in patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. - Determine the toxicity of this vaccination in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNCs). Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is derived from the autologous PMNCs. Patients receive HSP70 intradermally once weekly for 8 weeks. Patients are followed for 2 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
