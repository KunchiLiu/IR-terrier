	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of UCN-01 in treating patients who have unresectable stage III or stage IV kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>UCN-01 in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of UCN-01, in terms of time to objective progression, in patients with stage IV or unresectable stage III renal cell carcinoma. - Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-61 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months.</detailed_description>
