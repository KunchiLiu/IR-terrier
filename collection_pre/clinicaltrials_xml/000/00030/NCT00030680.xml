	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Aggressive Fibromatoses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of moderate-dose radiotherapy, in terms of local control, in patients with aggressive fibromatoses. - Determine the acute and late side-effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks for a total of 56 Gy in 28 fractions. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
