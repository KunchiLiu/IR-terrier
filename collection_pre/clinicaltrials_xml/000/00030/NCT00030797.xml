	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the efficacy of different schedules of irinotecan in combination with capecitabine as first-line therapy, in terms of objective response rate, in patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. - Compare the time to treatment failure, time to progression, and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the safety profile, in terms of toxicity, of these regimens in these patients. - Determine the quality of life in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to performance status (0 vs 1); disease symptoms, including pain, weight loss, loss of appetite, malaise, and fever of unknown origin (yes vs no); weight loss during the past 6 months (more than 5% vs 5% or less); and disease-free interval (more than 6 months vs 6 months or less). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14 and 22-35. - Arm II: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 22 and oral capecitabine as in arm I. Treatment in both arms repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of each course, and at the first visit after treatment failure. Patients are followed every 12 weeks for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-74 patients (14-37 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
