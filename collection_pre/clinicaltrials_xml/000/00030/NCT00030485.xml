	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as erlotinib may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of erlotinib in treating patients who have locally advanced and/or metastatic endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of erlotinib, in terms of response rate and duration of stable disease, in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic carcinoma of the endometrium. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the time to progression and duration of response in patients treated with this drug. - Correlate objective tumor response with levels of epidermal growth factor receptor expression in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks. Patients with complete or partial response or stable disease are also followed every 3 months until relapse or death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
