	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as DJ-927, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well DJ-927 works as second-line therapy in treating patients with progressive locally advanced or metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma (cancer).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DJ-927 as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Progressive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with progressive locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum treated with DJ-927 as second-line treatment. Secondary - Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the median survival time in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior first-line treatment regimen (irinotecan-containing vs oxaliplatin-containing). Patients receive oral DJ-927* on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *Patients receive 1 of 2 selected doses to confirm the previously established maximum tolerated dose Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56-62 patients (28-31 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
