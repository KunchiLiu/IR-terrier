	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an experimental drug called LMB-2 for treating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients who have a protein called cluster of differentiation 25 (CD25) on their cancer cells. LMB-2 is a recombinant immunotoxin. It is made up of two parts: a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody that binds to CD25, and a toxin produced by bacteria that kills the cancer cells to which it binds. LMB-2 has killed CD25-containing cells in laboratory experiments and has caused tumors in mice to shrink. Preliminary studies in humans have shown some effectiveness in shrinking tumors in patients with various types of lymph and blood cancers. Patients 18 years of age and older with stage 1b to IV cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that has progressed within 2 years of systemic or topical therapy and who have CD25 receptor proteins on their cancer cells may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram, chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, skin punch biopsy to evaluate tumor infiltration in the skin, and a bone marrow biopsy on patients with stage IIa disease and higher. In addition, the patient's blood, bone marrow, tumor, or other tissue is tested to determine the presence of CD25 on cancer cells. Participants receive up to nine cycles of LMB-2 therapy as long as their cancer does not worsen and they do not develop serious side effects. Each 28-day cycle consists of 30-minute infusions of LMB-2 on cycle days 1, 3, and 5. The drug is infused through an intravenous (IV) catheter (plastic tube placed in a vein) or a central venous line - an IV tube placed in a large vein in the neck or chest that leads to the heart. In addition to drug therapy, patients undergo the following procedures: Blood draws: Blood is drawn before, during, and after each LMB-2 infusion to measure blood levels of the drug, evaluate its effects on the cancer cells, and monitor side effects. Blood tests are also done before and during each cycle to determine how the immune system is interacting with the drug. Disease evaluations: Patients undergo a careful skin examination, blood tests, chest x-ray, and EKG before each treatment cycle and at follow-up visits. A CT scan and echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) are done before the first cycle. Before the first and second cycles, patients have a biopsy of the lymphoma on the skin. If the biopsy is helpful in evaluating the disease response to LMB-2, additional biopsies may be requested prior to other cycles as well. A nuclear medicine scan may be done, and a bone marrow biopsy may be done in patients with stage II to IV disease. If these tests are helpful in understanding the response of the lymphoma to treatment, they may also be repeated prior to other cycles, with the patient's permission. Patients are admitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center for the first treatment cycle. Subsequent cycles are given as outpatients. If the infusions are well tolerated, patients may return home after about one week (or possibly longer if complications occur). After returning home, patients have blood tests done weekly by their local physicians.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-Tac(Fv)-PE38 (LMB-2) to Treat Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: It is estimated that 40-50% of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) have tumors that express cluster of differentiation 25 (CD25) (Tac or IL2Ra). Normal resting T-cells do not express CD25. LMB-2 is an anti-CD25 recombinant immunotoxin containing variable domains of MAb anti-Tac and truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin. A phase I trial at National Cancer Institute (NCI) found that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LMB-2 was 40 microg/Kg intravenous (IV) given every other day for 3 doses (QOD times 3) with prophylactic IV fluid. The most common adverse events were transient fever, hypoalbuminemia and transaminase elevations. In that trial, two of two patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma had clinical benefit (1 partial response (PR), 1 stable disease (SD)). In 1999 another recombinant fusion protein, denileukin diftitox, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent CTCL expressing the high affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor. This receptor is composed of three subunits: CD25, CD122 and CD132. Because LMB-2 is cytotoxic to cells expressing CD25 without the other IL-2 receptor subunits needed to form the high affinity receptor, CD25+ CTCL patients are good candidates for further testing with LMB-2. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to determine the activity of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE38 (LMB-2) in patients with Tac-expressing Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL). The primary endpoints of this trial are the response rate and response duration. We will also evaluate LMB-2 immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity, and monitor soluble Tac levels in the serum. These will be evaluated using routine hematologic and clinical evaluation, and when appropriate, by monitoring the phenotype of circulating T-cells or of biopsied tissues using antibodies to CD25. Eligibility: CD25+ CTCL based on immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry of blood. Patients must have measurable stage 1b-IV disease which progressed after greater than or equal 2 prior systemic or topical therapies. Labs required: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to 2.5-time upper limit, albumin greater than or equal 3, bilirubin less than or equal to 2.2, creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 (unless creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50 ml/min), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1000/ul, and platelets greater than or equal to 50,000/ul (ANC and platelets greater than or equal 500 and 10,000 if blood/marrow involvement). Design: Patients receive LMB-2 30 ug/Kg QOD time 3 every 4 weeks in absence of neutralizing antibodies or progressive disease. Dose escalation to 40 ug/Kg QOD times 3 if less than 2/6 dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at 30 ug/Kg times 3. 1st stage is 16 patients, to expand to 25 if greater than 1 of 16 patients respond.</detailed_description>
