	<detailed_description>Suicide is the third leading cause of death in adolescents and is a major public health problem. Depression is the most common diagnosis for adolescent suicide attempts. Little is known about what treatment is best for these adolescents since they are usually excluded from participation in research studies. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive carefully monitored antidepressant medication with routine support and management, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or a combination of antidepressant medication plus CBT.</detailed_description>
