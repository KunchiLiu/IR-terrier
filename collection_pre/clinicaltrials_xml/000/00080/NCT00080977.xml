	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well high-dose intravenous interleukin-2 works in treating patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that has not responded to previous low-dose intravenous or subcutaneous interleukin-2.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Intravenous Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (Kidney Cancer) That Has Not Responded to Previous Low-Dose Intravenous or Subcutaneous Interleukin-2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate (complete, partial, and minor) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who failed prior low-dose intravenous or subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) when treated with high-dose intravenous IL-2. - Determine the overall survival, disease-free survival, and time to progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients receive high-dose interleukin-2 IV every 8 hours for 15 doses followed 7-10 days later by another 15 doses (course 1). Patients are assesed for response 2 months after initiation of treatment. Patients with responding or stable disease receive a second course of therapy. Patients with an ongoing response receive subsequent courses of treatment in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
