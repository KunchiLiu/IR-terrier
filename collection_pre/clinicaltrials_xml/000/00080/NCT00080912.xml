	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known whether single-fraction (single-dose) re-irradiation therapy is as effective as multiple-fraction (many small doses of radiation therapy) re-irradiation therapy in relieving bone pain caused by bone metastases. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying single-dose radiation therapy to see if it works as well as multiple-dose radiation therapy in treating patients previously irradiated with painful bone metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single-Fraction Compared With Multiple-Fraction Therapy in Treating Patients With Previously Irradiated Painful Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare pain relief in patients undergoing single-fraction vs multiple-fraction re-irradiation of painful bone metastases at 2 months after treatment. Secondary - Compare overall pain relief in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare time to pain progression in patients treated with these regimens. - Assess relationship between response to initial radiation and pain relief after re-irradiation in these patients. - Compare changes in functional interference after re-irradiation using the Brief Pain Inventory in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens (patients in Canada, France, the Netherlands, and patients registered through RTOG). - Determine characteristics of non-responders (to both initial and re-irradiation) among patients treated with these regimens. - Monitor the incidence of acute severe radiation-related side effects in patients treated with these regimens. - Monitor the incidence of in-field pathological fractures and spinal cord compression in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to response to initial radiotherapy (yes vs no), initial fractionation (single fraction vs multiple fraction), and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive single-fraction radiotherapy (8Gy) on day 1. - Arm II: Patients receive multiple-fraction radiotherapy (to a total of 20Gy) over 5 days or over 8 days if re-irradiation of the spine and/or whole pelvis is involved AND prior initial radiotherapy was given in multiple fractions. At least 4 weeks after the first re-treatment, patients in both arms may receive a second re-treatment at the discretion of the treating oncologist. Patients complete a Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire at baseline, on days 7 and 14, monthly during months 1-6, and at months 9 and 12. Acute Toxicities are assessed on days 7 and 14. Quality of Life is assessed at baseline and then monthly during months 1-6 for patients from participating groups. Patients are followed for up to 1 year. Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 850 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
