	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether treatment with Armodafinil (CEP-10953) is more effective than placebo treatment for patients with excessive sleepiness associated with chronic shift work sleep disorder (SWSD) by measuring mean sleep latency from the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) (20 minutes) (average of 4 naps at 0200, 0400, 0600, and 0800) and by Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) ratings.</brief_summary>

The patient must work at least 5 night shifts per month, of which at least 3 nights are consecutive, and plan to maintain this schedule.

The patient is in good health as determined by a medical and psychiatric history, physical examination, ECG, and serum chemistry and hematology. Women must be surgically sterile, 2 years postmenopausal, or, if of childbearing potential, using a medically accepted method of birth control (ie, barrier method with spermicide, steroidal contraceptive, or intrauterine device [IUD]) and agree to continued use of this method for the duration of the study. Steroidal contraceptives must be used with a barrier method while taking the study drug and for at least a full cycle after discontinuation of the study drug. The patient has a mean sleep latency of 6 minutes or less as determined by the MSLT The patient has a CGIS rating as it pertains to sleepiness during night shifts including the commute to and from work. The patient does not have any medical or psychiatric disorders that could account for the excessive sleepiness during the night shift. The patient is able to complete self rating scales and computerbased testing. The patient is willing and able to comply with study restrictions and to attend regularly scheduled clinic visits as specified in this protocol. Patients are excluded from participating in this study if 1 or more of the following criteria are met: has any clinically significant, uncontrolled medical or psychiatric conditions (treated or untreated) has a probable diagnosis of a current sleep disorder other than SWSD consumes caffeine including coffee, tea and/or other caffeine containing beverages or food averaging more than 600 mg of caffeine per day used any prescription drugs disallowed by the protocol or clinically significant use of over thecounter (OTC) drugs within 7 days before the screening/baseline visit has a history of alcohol, narcotic, or any other drug abuse as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association, 4th Edition (DSM IV) has a positive urine drug screen (UDS) at the screening visit has a clinically significant deviation from normal in the physical examination is a pregnant or lactating woman.
