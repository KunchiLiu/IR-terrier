	<brief_title>Treatment for Post-Stroke Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial will compare outcomes in depressed patients receiving the Activate-Initiate-Monitor (AIM) intervention vs. those receiving usual care, and will also compare outcomes in depressed and non-depressed stroke survivors. Patients are screened for depression 1 to 2 months post-stroke. Patients with depression are then randomized to the AIM intervention or control group. Patients without depression are also enrolled at the same time and are matched by hospital site to the depressed patients. The AIM intervention is a 3-part program consisting of activating or educating the patient and his/her family about post-stroke depression, instituting treatment for depression, and monitoring antidepressant treatments for side effects, efficacy, and compliance. Control patients are evaluated and treated with usual care by their physicians. Patients without depression do not receive the intervention but complete the same assessments on the same schedule as the patients with depression.</detailed_description>
