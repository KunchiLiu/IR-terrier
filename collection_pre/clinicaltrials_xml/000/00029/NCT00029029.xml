	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses high-frequency electric current to kill tumor cells and may help to relieve pain caused by bone metastases. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation in relieving pain in patients who have bone metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation in Relieving Pain in Patients With Bones Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation, in terms of pain relief at 4 weeks, in patients with painful bone metastases. - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. - Compare the change in pain interference with daily life and analgesic use at 4 weeks vs baseline in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the time to recurrence of worst pain in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to targeted tumor(s) on day 0 (multiple tumors may receive ablation in multiple sessions). Patients who achieve a reduction in worst pain of at least 2 points within 4-8 weeks but experience recurring pain at the RFA site or are diagnosed with a new painful lesion within 4-24 weeks receive 1 additional treatment to the recurring or new site. Pain (using the Brief Pain Inventory scale of 0-10), analgesic use, and quality of life are assessed at baseline, on day 1, weekly for 4 weeks, and then every 2 weeks for 20 weeks. Patients are followed for 6 months beyond the last RFA treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
