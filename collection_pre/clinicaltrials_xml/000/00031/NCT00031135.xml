	<brief_summary>This is a study to determine whether choline, when added to total parenteral nutrition (TPN), can help prevent the development of hepatic steatosis, a liver disease, in patients on TPN.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Total Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Choline deficiency-induced hepatic steatosis occurs in patients that require long-term TPN and may progress to significant hepatic disease and death. Initial studies indicate choline-supplemented TPN may reverse TPN-associated hepatic steatosis. Choline chloride or placebo will be added to each patient's TPN for 16 weeks by the hospital or pharmacy providing their usual TPN. Patients will receive their TPN in the hospital until they are medically stable for discharge. If patients are discharged before study completion, the pharmacy will deliver the TPN supply to them. Evaluation of hepatic steatosis is done by CT scans and blood analyses. Blood will be drawn on a biweekly basis during the first 4 weeks and at Week 8, 12, 16 or withdrawal. CT scans will be done at Week 4, 8, 16, or withdrawal. Completion date provided represents the completion date of the grant per OOPD records</detailed_description>
