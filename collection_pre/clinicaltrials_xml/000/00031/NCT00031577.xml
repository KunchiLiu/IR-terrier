	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Paclitaxel may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel with radiation therapy in treating children who have newly diagnosed brain stem glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Children With Newly Diagnosed Brain Stem Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel when combined with involved-field radiotherapy in children with newly diagnosed, diffuse, intrinsic brain stem glioma. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Assess the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of paclitaxel. Patients receive induction therapy comprising paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once weekly and involved-field radiotherapy (after paclitaxel infusion) once daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. Beginning 6 weeks after completion of induction therapy, patients may receive maintenance therapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once every 3 weeks for a total of 8 courses. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 12 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
