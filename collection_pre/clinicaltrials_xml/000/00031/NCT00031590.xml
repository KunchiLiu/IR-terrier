	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining low-dose radiation therapy with combination chemotherapy may be effective in treating primitive neuroectodermal tumor and medulloblastoma. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving low-dose radiation therapy together with combination chemotherapy after surgery to see how well it works in treating children with newly diagnosed primitive neuroectodermal tumor or medulloblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Dose Radiation Therapy and Combination Chemotherapy Following Surgery in Treating Children With Newly Diagnosed Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor or Medulloblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Reduce the late cognitive, auditory, and endocrinologic effects in children with newly diagnosed standard-risk posterior fossa primitive neuroectodermal tumor or medulloblastoma by reducing the adjuvant craniospinal radiotherapy dose by 25%, but maintaining a therapeutic efficacy (86% 3-year relapse-free survival) of current standard therapy by using maintenance chemotherapy comprising lomustine, cisplatin, and vincristine alternated with cyclophosphamide and etoposide. - Evaluate the acute and subacute toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Evaluate the late neurotoxic effects of low-dose craniospinal radiotherapy, in terms of cognitive, endocrinologic, and auditory function, in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. - Adjuvant induction chemoradiotherapy: Beginning within 28 days after prior resection, patients undergo radiotherapy to the craniospinal axis 5 days a week for 2 weeks and then conformal radiotherapy to the tumor bed 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Beginning 1 week after the initiation of radiotherapy, patients receive vincristine IV weekly for 6 weeks. - Maintenance chemotherapy: Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of induction chemoradiotherapy, patients receive two 6-week courses of regimen A as outlined below alternated with one 6-week course of regimen B as outlined below for a total of 9 courses (6 courses of regimen A and 3 courses of regimen B). - Regimen A: Patients receive oral lomustine and cisplatin IV over 8 hours on day 0 and vincristine IV on days 0, 7, and 14. - Regimen B: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days 0 and 1 and etoposide IV on days 0 and 1 and then orally on days 14-34. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
