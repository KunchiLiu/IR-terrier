	<brief_title>Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Azelaic Acid 15% Gel With Its Vehicle in Subjects With Mild to Moderate Acne</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acne is a common inflammatory skin condition characterized by skin eruptions around hair follicles. People with acne can have pustules (zits or pimples), papules, whiteheads or blackheads, nodules, and redness of the skin. Acne usually involves the face and shoulders, but can also involve the chest, arms, and legs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an investigational gel containing active medication compared to the same gel without any active medication (placebo or vehicle) in subjects with mild to moderate facial acne. This study has initially been posted by Berlex, Inc. Berlex, Inc. has been renamed to Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Intendis Inc., a Bayer HealthCare company, is the sponsor of the trial.</detailed_description>

To be included in the study you MUST NOT have: Localization of acne predominantly on the chest and/or the back or confined to the chest and/or the back Sandpaper acne with hundreds of small facial comedones Moderate or severe acne requiring systemic therapy Multitude of small nodules and/or multiple large nodules, cysts, polyporous comedones, draining sinuses e.g. nodulocystic/conglobate acne Other skin conditions that might interfere with acne diagnosis and/or evaluation (such as facial psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, perioral dermatitis and papulopustular rosacea) Anticipated or scheduled hospitalization, e.g. for surgery, during the study Female patients who have not continuously used their present brand of oral contraceptive (if any) or other hormone therapy for at least 3 months Continuous concurrent use of any topical and/or systemic treatment which affects acne History of hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the trial drugs Concurrent involvement in another investigational study or participation within 30 days prior to the start of this study You must not have taken or have had the following types of treatment or therapy prior to being admitted into the study: Oral isotretinoin (i.e. Accutane) for 6 months Ortho TriCyclen or Estrostep for 3 months Oral antibiotics (i.e. tetracyclines, erythromycin) for 4 weeks Systemic corticosteroids for 4 weeks Systemic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at antiinflammatory doses for 4 weeks Topical (applied to skin) retinoid creams, ointments, gels for 2 weeks Topical antibiotics (i.e. tetracyclines, erythromycin, clindamycin) for 2 weeks Topical corticosteroids or topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory (NSAIDs) drugs for 2 weeks Topical imidazole antimycotics for 2 weeks Topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO) for 2 weeks Topical overthecounter remedies for acne (salicylic acid) for 2 weeks If you have had any of the above, you may still qualify for the study following a washout period (time for your body to completely eliminate, or get rid of, the medication). The study doctor will evaluate whether there is anything else in your history that may affect your safety in the study or interfere with evaluations. He/she may therefore advise you not to participate.</criteria>
