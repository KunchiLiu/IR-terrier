	<brief_title>Cyclosporine in Treating Patients With Low Blood Counts Caused By Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the frequency of cytopenic response in patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia treated with cyclosporine. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral cyclosporine every 12 hours. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 9 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
