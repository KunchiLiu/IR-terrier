	<brief_summary>This is a study to determine the safety and efficacy of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) to prevent acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Keratinocyte Growth Factor to Prevent Acute GVHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GVHD remains the major complication of allogeneic BM transplantation and is initiated during the conditioning of the recipient for transplant when the host tissues are damaged. Research has demonstrated that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a critical organ in GVHD pathophysiology. Agents that protect the GI tract may provide prophylaxis against the cytokine cascade and can lead to a reduced incidence and severity of GVHD. KGF is a protein that stimulates the growth of epithelial cells including those of the GI tract. KGF can protect the GI tract, prevent GVHD, and preserve donor T-cell function. Patients will receive standard GVHD prophylaxis in addition to the study drug. Overall GVHD will be graded weekly during the first 2 months after transplant, then every other week to Day 100. Response to therapy will be measured through the use of severity indices, physical exam, and laboratory serum values.</detailed_description>
