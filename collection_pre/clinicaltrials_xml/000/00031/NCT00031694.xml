	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel and bryostatin-1 in treating patients who have locally advanced unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Bryostatin-1 may help paclitaxel kill more cancer cells by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel and Bryostatin 1 in Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the response rates to weekly, sequential paclitaxel/ bryostatin-1 in patients with unresectable and metastatic pancreatic cancer. II. To determine the toxicity of therapy. III. To determine patient survival after therapy. IV. To determine Bryostatin-1 pharmacokinetics. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 followed by bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on day 2 of weeks 1-3. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
