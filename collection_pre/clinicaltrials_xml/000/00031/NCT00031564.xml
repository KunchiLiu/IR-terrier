	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made by inserting a laboratory-treated gene into a person's tumor cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 in treating patients who have stage IV kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of a B7-1 Gene-Modified Autologous Tumor Cell Vaccine and Systemic IL-2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the percentage of patients with stage IV renal cell carcinoma with a reduction in tumor size after treatment with B7-1 gene-modified autologous tumor cell vaccine and interleukin-2. - Determine the immunogenicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the local and systemic toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Tumor tissue for vaccine preparation is obtained when patients undergo palliative surgical resection of primary tumor or therapeutic resection of metastasis. At approximately 3-6 weeks after surgery, patients receive B7-1 gene-modified autologous tumor cell vaccine subcutaneously (SC) once on days 1, 29, and 57. At 6 weeks after the first vaccination, patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) SC five days a week for 6 weeks (days 43-82). Patients with stable or responding disease after day 106 may receive additional vaccinations in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 weeks after the last dose of IL-2. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
