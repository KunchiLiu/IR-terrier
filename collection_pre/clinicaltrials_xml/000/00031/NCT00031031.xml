In June of 2001, the Phase I study of KLT commenced at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City, Utah, with the objectives of 1) To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the safety profile of KLT in patients with refractory solid tumors; 2) To determine the pharmacokinetics of KLT in patients with refractory solid tumors; and 3) To gather preliminary efficacy data. The method of testing is open-label, sequential cohort, dose-escalation study.</brief_summary>
