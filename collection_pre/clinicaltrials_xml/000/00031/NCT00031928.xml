	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to determine the effectiveness of mafosfamide in treating patients who have progressive or refractory meningeal tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mafosfamide in Treating Patients With Progressive or Refractory Meningeal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of mafosfamide in patients with progressive or refractory meningeal malignancy. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients. - Determine the cerebrospinal fluid pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive intrathecal mafosfamide over 20 minutes twice weekly for 6 weeks (induction therapy). Patients then receive intrathecal mafosfamide once weekly for 4 weeks (consolidation therapy), twice a month for 4 months, and then monthly thereafter (maintenance therapy) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of mafosfamide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3000 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
