	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response. Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-12 and either alum or sargramostim may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-12 and either alum or sargramostim in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage II, stage III, or stage IV melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy and Interleukin-12 With Either Alum or Sargramostim After Surgery in Treating Patients With Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the immune reactivity in patients with resected stage IIB, IIC, III, or IV melanoma vaccinated with tyrosinase, gp100, and MART-1 peptides emulsified with Montanide ISA-51 with interleukin-12 and either alum adjuvant or sargramostim (GM-CSF). OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage (cutaneous stage IIB, IIC, III, and IV vs ocular and mucosal stage III and IV). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive vaccine with tyrosinase:368-376 (370D)/gp100:209-217 (210M)/MART-1:26-27 (27L) peptides emulsified with Montanide ISA-51 (ISA-51), low-dose interleukin-12 (IL-12) subcutaneously (SC), and alum adjuvant SC on day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 19, 27, and 53. - Arm II: Patients receive peptide vaccine emulsified with ISA-51, high-dose IL-12 SC, and alum adjuvant SC on day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 19, 27, and 53. - Arm III: Patients receive peptide vaccine emulsified with ISA-51 on day 1 and low-dose IL-12 SC and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-5 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 19, 27, and 53. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (20 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
