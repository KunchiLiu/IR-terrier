	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of NB1011 in treating patients who have metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer that has not responded to previous treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NB1011 in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of NB1011 in patients with fluoropyrimidine-resistant metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer. - Determine the safety and toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the efficacy of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study. - Phase I: Patients receive NB1011 IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of NB1011 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase II: Additional patients receive NB1011 at the MTD as in phase I. Patients are followed at day 30 and then for 5 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 25 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this study. A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study.</detailed_description>
