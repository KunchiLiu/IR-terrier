	<brief_title>Anti-Angiogenesis Therapy Using Thalidomide in Patients With Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will receive thalidomide in the oral form each night before bed. The dose of thalidomide will be increased each week until week 7 as long as there are no significant side effects. Routine physical examinations and blood tests will be done to monitor the effect of treatment and the toxicities encountered, if any, and provide the available treatments for side effects accordingly. Blood tests will be done to monitor the tumor response.</detailed_description>
