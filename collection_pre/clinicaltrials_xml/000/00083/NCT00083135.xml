	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Giving iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (^131I-MIBG) may kill neuroblastoma cells by delivering radiation directly to the tumor. A stem cell transplant using the patient's stem cells may be able to replace blood-forming cells destroyed by radiation therapy. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of a double infusion of ^131I-MIBG followed by autologous stem cell transplantation in treating patients with refractory neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>N2000-01: Double Infusion of Iodine I 131 Metaiodobenzylguanidine Followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated red marrow radiation dose delivered and associated toxic effects of escalating activity of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (^131I-MIBG) followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with refractory neuroblastoma. - Determine the number of days after stem cell transplantation to achieve absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500/mm^3 for 3 days and platelet count ≥ 20,000/mm^3 for 3 days (without transfusions) in patients treated with this regimen. Secondary - Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen, based on lesions measurable by CT or MRI at study entry, patients with ^131I-MIBG scan-positive lesions only, and patients with minimal residual tumor in bone marrow who have complete response by immunocytology and morphology. - Determine the tumor absorbed radiation dose in patients with measurable soft tissue lesions treated with this regimen. - Correlate, if possible, TP53 mutations with response in patients with accessible bone marrow tumor treated with ^131I-MIBG. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. - Iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) therapy: Patients receive^131I-MIBG IV over 2 hours on days 0 and 14. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ^131I-MIBG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Stem cell transplantation therapy: Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 28. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV over 1 hour OR subcutaneously daily beginning on day 28 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
