	<brief_summary>This study will collect blood, urine, and other tissue samples from patients with Pentalogy of Cantrell (POC) and other inherited diseases that may involve mutations in non-muscle myosin II-B heavy chain (MYH10). We will also collect samples from the relatives of affected individuals. POC is a very rare disorder in which patients have a combination of severe defects of the middle of the chest including the sternum (breastbone), diaphragm, heart, and abdominal wall. The defect are apparent before birth or at birth. Participants may undergo a medical evaluation that could include a medical history routine blood tests, urine collection, chest x-ray, and electrocardiogram. In addition, blood, urine, saliva, buccal swab or tissue samples may be collected for protein and gene studies. The blood is drawn through a very small needle placed in an arm vein. Children may choose to have a buccal (cheek) sample taken instead of blood draw. Buccal samples can be collected by a cheek swab, in which a soft brush is rubbed on the inside lining of the mouth, or by having the child hold a tablespoon of mouthwash in his or her mouth for a full minute and then spit the mouthwash into a container. In addition, tissue samples may be collected from patients if they undergoing any surgical procedures that may be required as part of their general medical care. Some of the cells obtained from patients or their relatives may be used to establish cell lines (a living tissue sample) that can be grown in the laboratory and used for experiments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mutations in Genes Associated With Pentalogy of Cantrell</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this protocol is to collect protein, DNA, and RNA from blood, sputum, urine and/or tissue samples from patients with the diagnosis of Pentalogy of Cantrell (POC) or other related syndromes in order to identify possible causative genes. We will use whole exome/genome sequencing of probands, their parents, and, if available, the affected relatives of probands to look for any exomic/genomic mutations that could be associated with this syndrome. We have produced a mouse model with the mutant mice exhibiting problems with ventral wall closure including extrathoracic location of the heart (ectopia cordis), and defects in the abdominal wall with protrusion of the guts and liver. The mice, which have a single amino acid substitution in nonmuslce myosin II-B, have severe defects in both the heart and brain, and resemble humans born with POC, who manifest these same abnormalities.</detailed_description>
