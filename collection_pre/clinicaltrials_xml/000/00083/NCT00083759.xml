	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of natalizumab in subjects diagnosed with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving concomitant treatment with methotrexate (MTX). It is thought that natalizumab may stop the movement of certain white blood cells, known as lymphocytes, into joint tissue. These cells are thought to cause damage in the joints leading to the symptoms of RA.</brief_summary>

Subjects will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following exclusion criteria: Subject is pregnant or lactating; Subject who has experienced an inadequate therapeutic response after at least 3 months of treatment with at least one TNFalpha inhibitor; Subject who has received treatment with anakinra; Subject who has received prior treatment with natalizumab; Subject does not meet the following criteria regarding concomitant medications for RA: Use of any oral steroid exceeding 10 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent dose) and not administered at a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to randomization (Month 0); Use of any NSAIDs unless stable for at least 1 month prior to randomization (Month 0); Use of other antiarthritic treatments, including approved or experimental oral, topical, or injectable biologics or drugs, or devices within 1 month prior to randomization (Month 0); Intraarticular corticosteroid injections within 1 month prior to randomization (Month 0); Treatment with any TNFalpha inhibitor within 2 months prior to randomization (Month 0); Subject who is expected to be unavailable for the duration of the trial, likely to be noncompliant with the Protocol, or felt to be unsuitable by the Investigator for any other reason; Subject who has a history of a malignancy (other than basal cell carcinoma of the skin); Subject who has a history of clinically significant and/or persistent gastrointestinal, pulmonary, chronic infection, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, neurological, dermatological, immunological, major psychiatric (including drug or alcohol abusers) or hematological illness, which, in the opinion of the Investigator placed the subject at unacceptable risk for participation in the study; Subject who has any laboratory test at Screening considered significantly abnormal. An alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) ≥1.5 x upper limits of normal (ULN) and cytopenia (included any of the following: WBC &lt;3.5 x 1000/uL; hemoglobin [Hb] &lt;8 g/dL; platelets &lt;100 x 1000/uL; and/or neutrophils absolute &lt;1.0 x 1000/uL) were considered significantly abnormal; Subject who intends to donate blood or blood products during the period of the study or within 1 month following completion of the study; Subject who has a positive tuberculosis (TB) skin test at Screening or within the 30 days prior to Screening (defined as ≥10 mm induration); Subject who plans or requires any surgical procedure during the study treatment period.</criteria>
