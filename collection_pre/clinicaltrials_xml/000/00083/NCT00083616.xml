	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine that panitumumab will have clinically meaningful anti-tumor activity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have developed progressive disease or relapsed while on or after prior fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and oxaliplatin chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Panitumumab (ABX-EGF) Monotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Following Treatment With Fluoropyrimidine, Irinotecan, and Oxaliplatin Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Panitumumab was administered once every 2 weeks until participants developed progressive disease, were unable to tolerate panitumumab, or discontinued treatment for other reasons (eg, administrative decision). Participants then attended a safety follow-up visit 4 weeks from the last panitumumab infusion. Participants were subsequently contacted every 3 months from the last panitumumab infusion through month 24 to assess disease status and survival.</detailed_description>
