	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of temozolomide in treating young patients with refractory or recurrent leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide in Treating Young Patients With Refractory or Recurrent Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of temozolomide in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent leukemia. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Determine the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the biologic activity and mechanism(s) of resistance to this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.</detailed_description>
