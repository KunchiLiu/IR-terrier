	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test if denufosol will remove the fluid build-up in the eye so that the retina can be re-attached without invasive surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Denufosol (INS37217) in Subjects With Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this trial is to determine if administration of denufosol is well-tolerated and more efficacious than placebo in stimulating subretinal fluid reabsorption and retinal reattachment without surgical intervention in subjects presenting with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>have rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in only one eye be able to receive intravitreal injection of study drug and be able to wait 24(+/ 6) hours to have detachment surgically treated or retinal breaks repaired per judgement of investigator no more than 3 separate identifiable retinal breaks that are clustered together and confined within an area no more than 2 clock hours in extent retinal detachment must be large enough such that it cannot be immediately repaired with laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy have pinhole acuity (using ETDRS) of maculaon, 20/50 or better in both eyes OR maculaoff, 20/50 or better in nonstudy eye and have history, prior to detachment, of reading capability in study eye have a nonrhegmatogenous retinal detachment have large retinal break(s) whose total break area is greater than 1 clock hour in extent have evidence of atrophic retinal pigment epithelium, choroid, choroidal detachment or intraocular inflammation be monocular have a prior retinal detachment repair or a congenital condition that places a greater risk for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment have proliferative vitreoretinopathy greater than grade B have preexisting subretinal or vitreous hemorrhage, corneal opacity, or other conditions which limit the view of peripheral retina have any coexisting macular pathology or other retinal conditions that can limit visual acuity currently have uncontrollable elevated intraocular pressure, advanced glaucoma, or any history or current evidence of endophthalmitis in the affected eye have symptoms consistent with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment such as visual disturbance greater than 14 days prior to screening if maculaon OR history of loss of reading vision in affected eye for greater than 6 days prior to screening if maculaoff have a retinal detachment with evidence of demarcation lines or evidence of subretinal fibrosis visible upon fundus examination be currently taking medications that could obscure or confound study results including acetazolamide (Diamox) and dorzolamide have had a periocular, retrobulbar or intravitreal injection in the affected eye, including corticosteroids in the 3 months prior to screening or require one</criteria>
