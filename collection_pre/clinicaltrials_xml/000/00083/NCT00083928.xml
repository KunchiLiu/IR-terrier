	<criteria>Females ≥18 years of age Histologically or cytologically documented primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma, cancer of the Fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma Completion of firstline chemotherapy Clinical remission as a result of chemotherapy History of normal CA125 level after initial course of therapy CA125 serum level has shown 2 consecutive rises based on 3 consecutive samples which are mutually &gt;= 28 days apart, provided that: 1. the 3rd sample is above the institution's ULN, and 2. the 3rd sample is confirmed by a 4th sample which is likewise higher than the 2nd sample value and is above the institution's ULN No clinically evident disease progression, as assessed by history, physical examination, computed tomographic (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1 No clinically significantly abnormal clinical laboratory tests or concomitant illnesses Ability and willingness to selfadminister subcutaneous injections Although pregnancy is extremely unlikely in this patient population because of the disease and prior treatment, patients who have the potential to become pregnant must have a negative pregnancy test and must agree to practice an effective method of contraception throughout the trial. Persistent adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier More than 1 course of previous chemotherapy for the qualifying cancer Disease requiring chemotherapy or radiotherapy Ascites Recent history of active infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, thromboembolic disorders, or anticoagulation</criteria>
