	<brief_title>Kava Kava for the Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kava kava (KAV) is a plant-derived treatment widely used in Europe to treat anxiety disorders. Several studies suggest that KAV may be effective in reducing anxiety symptoms; however, trial data are limited. This study will compare KAV, the drug venlafaxine-XR (VEN), and placebo for the treatment of GAD. This study will last 10 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive KAV, VEN, or placebo for 8 weeks. Participants will then undergo a 1-week tapering of their medication followed by an additional week of observation. Self-report scales and questionnaires will be used to assess the anxiety, depression, and functional impairment of participants. Side effects, vital signs, and laboratory measures will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
