	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if vaccination with autologous idiotype- or tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells induces the generation of anti-idiotypic and anti-tumor immunologic responses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Tumor Antigen-Pulsed Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccination Administrated Subcutaneously or Intranodally</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an experimental treatment that will consist of receiving special white blood cell administrations either underneath the skin or in the lymph nodes. In this protocol, treatment will be given according to the "risk group". If there are certain abnormalities in the chromosomes, the disease is considered to be high risk. High-risk patients will first receive one cycle of chemotherapy with a regimen called DT PACE, after which the white blood cells will be collected. Leukapheresis is a procedure in which blood is removed, white blood cells are saved, and the remaining blood is given back to you. These dendritic cells will then be mixed with your individual myeloma protein and/or cells, and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) that is necessary for the enhancement of immune response against myeloma antigens. It is hoped that this will cause these cells to interact with and activate T cells, which will then destroy myeloma cells in your body. Half of these white cells will be injected into your lymph nodes (intranodally) and half will be given subcutaneously. High risk patients will receive a chemotherapy regimen called DT PACE.</detailed_description>
