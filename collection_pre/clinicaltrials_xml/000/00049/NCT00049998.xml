	<criteria>Written informed consent Patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients who have received one previous chemotherapy for NSCLC. Full recovery from previous chemotherapy. Presence of either measurable or nonmeasurable disease by radiologic study or physical examination. At least 3 weeks since last major surgery (a lesser period is acceptable if deemed in the best interest of the patient). At least 24 hours since prior radiotherapy providing that marked bone marrow suppression is NOT expected. Patients who have received radiotherapy must have recovered from any reversible side effects (e.g. nausea and vomiting). Laboratory criteria: Patients must have adequate bone marrow reserve and adequate kidney and liver function. Symptoms of brain metastasis (cancer spreading to the brain), requiring treatment with steroids. Active infection. Severe medical problems other than the diagnosis of NSCLC, that would limit the ability of the patient to follow study guidelines or expose the patient to extreme risk. Ongoing or planned chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or investigational therapy for the treatment of NSCLC. Use of investigational drug within 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication. Women who are pregnant or lactating. Patients of childbearing potential refusing to practice adequate birth control methods. Patients with conditions which might alter absorption of an oral drug.</criteria>
