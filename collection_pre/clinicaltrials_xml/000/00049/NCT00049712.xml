	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have refractory advanced solid tumors or lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of monoclonal antibody anti-alpha V beta 3 integrin (MEDI 522) in patients with refractory advanced solid tumors or lymphoma. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. - Demonstrate significant binding of this drug to its molecular target in vivo in these patients. - Determine the effects of this drug on angiogenesis in these patients. - Determine antitumor activity of this drug by measuring tumor size and glucose uptake in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine a recommended phase II dose of this drug based on either the MTD or the optimal biologic response in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody anti-alpha V beta 3 integrin (Medi 522) IV over 30 minutes weekly. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of Medi 522 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
