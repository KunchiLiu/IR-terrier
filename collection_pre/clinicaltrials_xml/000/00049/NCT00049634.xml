	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy drugs before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer and abnormal cells and helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, to the donor helps the stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying how well donor peripheral stem cell transplant works in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, or myeloproliferative disorder.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the incidence of grades II, III, and IV graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia transformed from MDS, or myeloproliferative disorders treated with immunologically engineered, filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized, allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. - Determine the incidence of graft failure, relapse, and transplant-related mortality by day 100 in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the incidence of chronic GVHD, in terms of number and duration of immunosuppressant therapies, in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the feasibility of partial T-cell depletion in G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. OUTLINE: Patients receive conditioning with oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2. Immunologically engineered, filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized, allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells are infused on day 0. Patients receive graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis comprising methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and cyclosporine IV over 1-4 hours (orally twice daily when tolerated) on days -1 to 80 and then gradually tapered over 5 months beginning on day 81. Patients are followed regularly through day 100 and then at 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
