	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Peginterferon (PEG-interferon) alfa-2b may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of PEG-interferon alfa-2b in treating patients who have stage IV melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PEG-Interferon Alfa-2b in Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the ability of low-dose PEG-interferon alfa-2b to suppress plasma basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) levels to normal in patients with metastatic melanoma over-expressing b-FGF. - Determine the antitumor effect of this drug, in terms of progression-free and overall survival and tumor response, in these patients. - Correlate tumor activity of this drug with b-FGF and vascular endothelial growth factor levels in the plasma and urine of these patients. - Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) once weekly. Treatment continues until basic fibroblast growth factor level is suppressed to normal or until a maximum weekly dose is reached. If there is disease progression, patients then discontinue treatment. If there is no disease progression, patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b SC weekly for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
