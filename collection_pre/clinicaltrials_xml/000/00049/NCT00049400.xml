	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ixabepilone in treating patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas and liver dysfunction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0355 Ixabepilone in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas and Liver Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the levels of hepatic impairment at which dose modifications of ixabepilone are required in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas and varying levels of liver dysfunction. - Determine the effect of hepatic dysfunction on the plasma pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug at varying levels of hepatic dysfunction in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to liver function (normal vs mild dysfunction vs moderate dysfunction vs severe dysfunction). Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ixabepilone until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, at least 6 but no more than 12 patients are treated at the recommended phase II dose. Patients are followed for 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-84 patients (6-12 for stratum 1; 2-18 for stratum 2; 2-24 for stratum 3; and 2-30 for stratum 4) will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
