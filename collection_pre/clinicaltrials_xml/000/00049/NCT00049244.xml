	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining BMS-247550 with capecitabine in treating patients who have metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous chemotherapy with a taxane and an anthracycline.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-247550 Plus Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of BMS-247550 and capecitabine, on 2 different schedules, in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with a taxane and an anthracycline. - Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients. - Determine, preliminarily, any antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups. - Group I: Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. - Group II: Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 and capecitabine as in group I. Treatment in both groups repeats every 3 weeks for 2-18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-247550 and capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined for each group. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed for at least 30 days and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 34-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-12 months.</detailed_description>
