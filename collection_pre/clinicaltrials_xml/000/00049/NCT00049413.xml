	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining pentostatin and cyclophosphamide with rituximab in treating patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphocytic lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy and Rituximab in Treating Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, in terms of response rate, time to treatment failure, time to disease progression, durability of response, and overall survival, in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma. - Determine the safety of this regimen, in terms of acute, subacute, and chronic toxicity, in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy (no prior chemotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia vs prior purine analog-based therapy [fludarabine or cladribine] but no alkylator therapy vs prior alkylator-based therapy [chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide] but no prior purine analog therapy vs prior therapy with alkylators and purine analogs, but not as combination therapy). - First course: Patients receive rituximab IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-3 and pentostatin IV over 10-30 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. - All subsequent courses: Patients receive rituximab IV over 60 minutes, pentostatin IV over 10-30 minutes, and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 160-240 patients (40-60 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
