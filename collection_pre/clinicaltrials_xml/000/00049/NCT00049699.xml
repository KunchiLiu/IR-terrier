	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of VNP40101M in treating patients who have advanced or metastatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VNP40101M in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxic effects of VNP40101M in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor or lymphoma. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the antitumor effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 15 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of VNP40101M until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
