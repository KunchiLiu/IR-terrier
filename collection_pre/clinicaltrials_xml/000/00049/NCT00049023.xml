	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiolabeled octreotide can locate tumor cells and deliver radioactive tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is to study the safety and effectiveness of radiolabeled octreotide in treating children who have advanced or refractory solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiolabeled Octreotide in Treating Children With Advanced or Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide in children with advanced or refractory somatostatin receptor-positive tumors. - Determine the short-term and long-term safety and the serious adverse-event profiles of this drug in these patients. - Determine any potential antitumor effect of this drug in these patients. - Correlate level of somatostatin receptor type 2 expression with response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide IV over 5-10 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed weekly after each treatment course, 6 weeks after the last course, and then every 6 months thereafter for life. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
