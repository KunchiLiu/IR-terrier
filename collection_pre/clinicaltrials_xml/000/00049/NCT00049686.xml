	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of VNP40101M in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VNP40101M in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxic effects of VNP40101M in patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia or poor-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the antitumor effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 15 minutes once every 4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
