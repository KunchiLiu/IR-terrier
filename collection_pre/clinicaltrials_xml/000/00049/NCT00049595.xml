	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating stage III or stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two combination chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Combination Chemotherapy Regimens in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare event-free survival of patients with stage III or IV Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone vs doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine. - Compare complete response, disease-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare occurrence of second malignancies in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to International Prognostic Score (3 vs 4 or more) and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I (BEACOPP): Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 5 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV on day 1; etoposide IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3; oral procarbazine on days 1-7; oral prednisone on days 1-14; and vincristine IV and bleomycin IV or intramuscularly (IM) on day 8. Patients may receive dexamethasone in place of prednisone. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 9 and continuing until blood counts recover or pegfilgrastim SC on day 9 only. Treatment repeats every 22 days for 8 courses (4 courses escalated dose followed by 4 courses baseline dose) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II (ABVD): Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 5 minutes, bleomycin IV or IM, vinblastine IV, and dacarbazine IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the end of therapy, and then annually for 10 years. Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 550 patients (225 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 5.5 years.</detailed_description>
