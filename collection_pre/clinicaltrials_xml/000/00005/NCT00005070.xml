	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irofulven in treating patients who have stage IVB or recurrent cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irofulven in Treating Patients With Stage IVB or Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene in patients with stage IVB or recurrent cervical carcinoma. II. Determine the safety of this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene IV over 5 minutes daily for 5 consecutive days. Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-19 months.</detailed_description>
