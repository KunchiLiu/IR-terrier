	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to kill tumor cells. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Eliminating the T cells from the donor cells before transplanting them may prevent this from happening. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of T cell removal to prevent graft-versus-host disease in patients who are undergoing bone marrow transplantation from a donor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Removal of T Cells to Prevent Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Patients Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the incidence and severity of graft vs host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation with marrow grafts modified by T cell depletion with counterflow centrifugal elutriation and CD34+ cell selection in patients at high risk for GVHD. II. Determine the incidence of graft failure following this treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Determine the relapse rate and overall survival in this patient population treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients with unrelated donors, mismatched related donors, or matched related donors diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myeloma, or advanced acute myeloid leukemia (AML), receive cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes on days -6 and -5 and fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) 3 times a day on days -3 through -1, and twice on day 0. Patients receive graft vs host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) IV over 8 hours on days -2 and -1. Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) on day 0 with marrow grafts modified by T cell depletion with counterflow centrifugal elutriation and CD34+ selection. Patients unable to receive TBI due to matched or mismatched related donors, or age (56 to 60), or patients diagnosed with AML-CR1, chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myeloproliferative disorders with matched related donors, receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -7 through -4, cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes on days -3 and -2, and ATG IV over 8 hours on days -2 and -1 for GVHD prophylaxis. Patients undergo T cell depleted ABMT on day 0. At pretransplantation, patients with acute leukemia receive intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX) following lumbar puncture. At 48 hours following IT MTX, patients with CNS involvement receive a second dose of IT MTX followed by oral leucovorin calcium every 6 hours for 4 doses. Patients with prior CNS involvement receive cranial radiotherapy for 2 weeks. Following AMBT, patients undergo GVHD prophylaxis consisting of methylprednisolone IV every 12 hours on days 5-22, and then once daily on days 23-28 and cyclosporine IV or orally twice daily beginning on day -1 and continuing until 7-9 months following ABMT. Patients are followed every 3 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
