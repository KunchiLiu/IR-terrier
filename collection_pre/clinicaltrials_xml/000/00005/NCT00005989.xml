	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of R115777 in treating patients who have recurrent or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>R115777 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the response rate of patients with recurrent or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer when treated with tipifarnib. - Determine the clinical toxicities of this treatment in these patients. - Assess the overall survival and time to progression of this patient population when treated with this regimen. - Evaluate the inhibition of protein farnesylation in vivo and correlate such inhibition to plasma levels of tipifarnib. - Evaluate the occurrence of CYP450 polymorphisms and relate these to drug toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and response to this treatment in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.</detailed_description>
