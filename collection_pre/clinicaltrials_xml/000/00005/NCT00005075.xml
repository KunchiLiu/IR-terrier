	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Ultrasound therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above body temperature. This treatment may be effective for prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of ultrasound therapy in treating patients who have stage I or stage II prostate cancer that has recurred following radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound in Treating Patients With Recurrent Stage I or Stage II Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effectiveness of the Ablatherm high-intensity focused ultrasound device in providing control of disease for at least 12 months after treatment in patients with stage I or II prostate cancer recurring after external beam radiotherapy. II. Determine the safety of this treatment device in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. A probe is inserted into the rectum. Ultrasound energy is then delivered through probe to prostate tissue over 2-3 hours. Quality of life is assessed at study initiation; at 14 days and 3, 6, and 12 months; and then annually thereafter. Patients are followed at 14 days; at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months; and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
