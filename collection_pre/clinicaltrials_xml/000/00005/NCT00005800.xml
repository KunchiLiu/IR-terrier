	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of doxorubicin and docetaxel in treating women who have stage III breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxorubicin and Docetaxel in Treating Women With Stage III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the clinical and pathological response rate of sequential doxorubicin and docetaxel chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of women with stage III breast cancer. - Measure signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) activation before and after this neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in this patient population. - Correlate response to chemotherapy with STAT activation before and after this neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in these patients. - Determine how other potential predictors of response correlate with STAT activation by measuring Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax protein levels, tyrosine kinase levels, growth rate of the tumor, and apoptotic index before and after this neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in these patients. - Correlate response to chemotherapy with levels of STAT activation in association with the presence of Bcl-2 proteins and tyrosine kinases, growth rate of the tumor, and apoptotic index in these patients. - Evaluate the toxicity of this neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen given in a dose-dense fashion in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin IV on day 1 every 2 weeks for 3 courses. After 3 weeks of rest, patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 every 2 weeks for 3 courses. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously on days 3-10 of each doxorubicin and docetaxel course. Within 6 weeks of completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo surgery with mastectomy or lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.</detailed_description>
