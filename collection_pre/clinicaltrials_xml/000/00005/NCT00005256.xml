	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Because of its low cost and non-invasive nature, fluoroscopy was thought to be a potentially powerful screening tool for coronary heart disease if its efficiency could be demonstrated. The utility of exercise testing for screening had been limited by its relatively low sensitivity since it could only detect atherosclerotic plaque large enough to significantly impede coronary flow. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Asymptomatic high risk subjects were screened with cardiac fluoroscopy and exercise testing at baseline and followed for six years with annual visits. The sensitivity and specificity of fluoroscopy in relation to the incidence of coronary heart disease and the incidence of cardiovascular mortality was determined and compared at 3.5 and 6 years of follow-up. The predictive utility of fluoroscopy and exercise testing, in relation to the incidence of coronary events, was assessed by logistic regression analysis. Multivariate analysis was also performed on baseline risk factors. The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.</detailed_description>
