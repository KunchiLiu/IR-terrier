	<brief_title>Epidemiology of Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn - SCOR in Lung Biology and Diseases in Infants and Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: The study on the epidemiology of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) was a subproject within a Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) in Lung Biology and Diseases in Infants and Children. The SCOR and its subproject were awarded in December, 1991. Dollars were estimated at 20 percent of total center dollars. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Data from a previous study of PPHN were analyzed. The objectives were to: identify the effects of a variety of potentially adverse prenatal exposures from interview data; formulate multi-variate models of risk of PPHN to determine if smoking or use of prostaglandin inhibitors increased the risk of PPHN; explore associations of PPHN with history of illicit drug use and maternal hypoxia; examine the relationships of postnatal care and perinatal risk factors on the incidence and outcome of PPHN; test the relationships of PPHN to the biochemical presence of nicotine and drugs in neonatal urine. The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.</detailed_description>
