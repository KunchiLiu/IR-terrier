	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill kidney cancer cells. Histamine dihydrochloride may prolong survival and improve quality of life in patients with metastatic kidney cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of interleukin-2 with or without histamine dihydrochloride in treating patients who have metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 With or Without Histamine Dihydrochloride in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the clinical efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (SC) histamine dihydrochloride given in conjunction with SC recombinant human interleukin-2 in patients with stage IV renal cell carcinoma in terms of survival at 1 year, objective tumor response rate, duration of response, and median survival. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label study. Patients are randomized to receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) with or without histamine dihydrochloride. - Arm I: Patients receive IL-2 subcutaneously (SC) once daily and histamine dihydrochloride SC twice daily on days 1-5 of weeks 1-3 followed by 2 weeks of rest. - Arm II: Patients receive IL-2 as in arm I. Treatment continues for a minimum of 2 courses in both arms in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
