	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE: The study examined the relative efficacy of a pharmacologic, cognitive behavioral, and conjoint pharmacological/behavioral intervention for chronic sleep-onset insomnia. Sixty-three medication-free, chronic sleep-onset insomniacs completed evaluations, baseline sleep diaries, daytime functioning and mood inventories and home-based objective sleep assessments (OSA). Subjects were then randomized to one of four interventions: 1) six week Zolpidem intervention (D for drug); 2) six week multifactor behavioral intervention (B for behavioral); 3) six week conjoint Zolpidem and multifactor behavioral intervention (DB); and 4) placebo medication intervention (P for placebo). The main outcome measures were sleep-onset latency as measured by sleep diaries; secondary measures included sleep diary measures of sleep efficiency and total sleep time, objective measures of sleep variables (Nightcap sleep monitor recorder), and measures of daytime functioning. The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.</detailed_description>
