	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of DX-8951f in treating patients who have biliary cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DX-8951f in Treating Patients With Biliary Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity of DX-8951f in terms of antitumor response, response duration, and survival in patients with biliary tree cancer. II. Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of DX-8951 in plasma. OUTLINE: Patients receive DX-8951f IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
