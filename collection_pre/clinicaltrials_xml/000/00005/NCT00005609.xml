	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab in treating patients who have Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab in Treating Patients With Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate in previously treated and previously untreated patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia receiving rituximab. II. Determine the associated toxicities with this treatment, specifically the frequency of febrile or hypotensive events, in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment (yes vs no). Patients with prior treatment are further stratified according to type of treatment (alkylating agents vs purine nucleoside analogues). Patients receive rituximab IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients (33 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 36 months.</detailed_description>
