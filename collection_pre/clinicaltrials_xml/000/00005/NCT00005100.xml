	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare growth hormone (GH) levels at baseline and after glucose suppression measured with both a polyclonal radioimmunoassay and a highly sensitive immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) in patients with acromegaly and normal volunteers. II. Measure the levels of IGF-I and its binding protein, IGFBP-3, in these cohorts. III. Determine any correlation between levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and GH suppressibility as assessed by sensitive IRMA. IV. Determine if patients who demonstrate biochemical features of mild GH excess are at risk for progression to active disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected and assessed for growth hormone and IGF-I by polyclonal radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). Growth hormone is measured at baseline and 60, 90, and 120 minutes after a 100 g glucose drink. Serum glucose is measured at baseline and at 2 hours post dextrose administration by the glucose hexokinase method. Clinical scores are determined for headache, perspiration, fatigue, joint pain, and acne. Exams and tests may be repeated every 6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
