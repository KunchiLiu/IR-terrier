	<brief_title>R115777 in Treating Patients Who Have Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and effectiveness of R115777 in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. II. Determine the response rate, time to progression, and 6 month survival rate of these patients with this treatment regimen. III. Assess the pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral R115777 twice daily for 21 consecutive days. Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
