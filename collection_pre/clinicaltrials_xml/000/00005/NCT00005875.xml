	<brief_title>Nitrocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy and toxicity of nitrocamptothecin in patients with metastatic melanoma. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (choroidal vs nonchoroidal). Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues weekly for at least 8 weeks (2 courses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-74 patients (14-37 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
