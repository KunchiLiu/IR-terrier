	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-188797 in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors that have not responded to previous treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-188797 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors That Have Not Responded to Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose, dose limiting toxicities, and safety of BMS-188787 in patients with nonhematologic malignancies. II. Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of BMS-188797 in these patients. III. Describe any antitumor activity of this treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive BMS-188797 IV over 1 hour. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-188797 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until toxicities resolve, and then at the investigator's discretion. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study over 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
