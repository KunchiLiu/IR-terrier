	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin in treating men who have stage IV prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitrocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Stage IV Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the therapeutic efficacy of nitrocamptothecin in patients with metastatic, hormone refractory prostate cancer. - Determine time to disease progression and duration of response in this patient population as a result of this treatment regimen. - Determine the safety, tolerance, and toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive nitrocamptothecin orally daily for 5 consecutive days each week for 3 consecutive weeks. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until evidence of progression or relapse for a maximum of 2 years from the date of registration. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-46 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.</detailed_description>
