	<brief_summary>Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-12 plus interleukin-2 in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors. Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Combining the two drugs may kill more cancer cells</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-12 Plus Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the toxicity profile and MTD of low-dose SC IL-2 administered in conjunction with BIW regimen of IV rhIL-12. II. To determine the antitumor effects of combination therapy with IV rhIL-12 and SC IL-2. III. To determine the impact low-dose SC IL-2 has on the magnitude and duration of in vivo immune activation induced by a BIW schedule of IV rhIL-12. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive interleukin-12 (IL-12) IV on days 1 and 4 for 6 weeks. Beginning on day 4 of the third week, patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously 1 hour before and 20 hours after each dose of IL-12. On subsequent courses, IL-2 and IL-12 are administered on days 1 and 4 of each week. Treatment continues for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease response may continue treatment until complete response or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IL-12 and IL-2 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 weeks.</detailed_description>
