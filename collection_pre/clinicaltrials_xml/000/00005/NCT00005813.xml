	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Bispecific antibodies plus white blood cells may be able to locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining bispecific antibodies with white blood cells in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bispecific Antibody Plus White Blood Cells in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the safety and tolerability of bispecific antibody MDX447 and activated monocytes in patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma multiforme. - Determine the response, time to tumor progression, and overall survival of these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients undergo maximal surgical debulking of the tumor at the time of reservoir placement. Within 2-4 weeks after surgery, patients receive one treatment of intratumoral bispecific antibody MDX447 and activated monocytes. Stable or responding patients may receive a second treatment 1 month later. Cohorts of 1 or 3 patients receive escalating doses of bispecific antibody MDX447 and activated monocytes until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
