	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from melanoma cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Vaccine therapy plus filgrastim combined with a specific protein may be a more effective treatment for melanoma. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma that has been completely removed during surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of filgrastim (G-CSF)-fetal liver tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt3K) fusion protein when combined with melanoma peptide vaccine comprising tyrosinase:368-376 peptide, gp100:209-217 antigen, and MART-1:26-35 antigen emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 in patients with completely resected stage III or IV melanoma. II. Determine the toxicity and safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the immune responses to tyrosinase, MART-1, and gp100 antigens in patients before, during, and after receiving these vaccinations. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of filgrastim (G-CSF)-fetal liver tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt3K) (G-CSF-Flt3K) fusion protein. Patients receive melanoma peptide vaccine comprising tyrosinase:368-376 peptide, gp100:209-217 antigen, and MART-1:26-35 antigen emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SQ) monthly for 6 months, and then at 9 and 12 months for a total of 8 vaccinations. Patients receive G-CSF-Flt3K fusion protein SQ daily for 3 days before, immediately after, and then daily for 6 days after each vaccination. Cohorts of 6-10 patients receive escalating doses of G-CSF-Flt3K fusion protein until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6-10 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months through year 2 after resection, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
