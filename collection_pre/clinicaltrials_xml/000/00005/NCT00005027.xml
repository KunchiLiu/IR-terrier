	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rebeccamycin analog in treating patients who have advanced kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rebeccamycin Analog in Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma when treated with rebeccamycin analogue. - Assess the quantitative and qualitative toxicities associated with this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 30-60 minutes daily for 5 days. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-18 months.</detailed_description>
