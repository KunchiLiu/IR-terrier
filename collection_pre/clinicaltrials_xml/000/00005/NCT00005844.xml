	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating children who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin in Treating Children With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin in children with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Assess the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and toxicity of this regimen and response in these patients. - Determine the anti-tumor effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 (every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses) OR on days 1, 14, and 28 (every 6 weeks for up to 3 courses). Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD for dose levels 1-4 is determined, an additional cohort of 3-6 patients is accrued and treated with oxaliplatin as above every 2 weeks (for up to 9 doses). PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-3.3 years.</detailed_description>
