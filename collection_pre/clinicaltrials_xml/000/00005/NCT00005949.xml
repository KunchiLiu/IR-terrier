	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus interleukin-2 in treating patients who have advanced melanoma. Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Melanoma vaccine plus interleukin-2 may kill more cancer cells</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Plus Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine clinical response rates in patients with advanced melanoma treated with gp100:209-217(210M) melanoma vaccine and low-dose interleukin-2. II. Assess response duration and progression-free intervals in these patients receiving this treatment. OUTLINE: Patients receive gp100:209-217(210M) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and interleukin-2 SC on days 1-5 and 8-13. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 3 additional courses after achieving CR. Patients are followed every 9 weeks for 3 years or until disease recurrence. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.</detailed_description>
