	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of Giving L-743,872 to Patients With Thrush That Has Not Been Cured With Fluconazole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized to treatment with L-743,872 at one of two doses administered intravenously by a peripheral line once-daily. Patients are treated for 48 hours beyond resolution of symptoms or for a maximum of 14 days. Each patient is expected to complete the study, including the 14-day follow-up, within approximately 4 weeks. A physical examination is performed daily during the antifungal treatment period and at the follow-up visits 7 and 14 days post-therapy. Laboratory tests of blood and urine for safety are performed every three days during treatment and at follow-up 7 days post-therapy. Liver enzymes are drawn at the 14-day follow-up visit.</detailed_description>
