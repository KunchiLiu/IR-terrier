	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have advanced cancer of the urothelium with decreased kidney function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer of the Urothelium and Decreased Kidney Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with progressive regional or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium with renal insufficiency when treated with paclitaxel and gemcitabine. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed immediately by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment continues every 4 weeks for a minimum of 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-27 months.</detailed_description>
