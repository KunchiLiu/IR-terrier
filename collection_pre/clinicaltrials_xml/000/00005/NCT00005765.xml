	<brief_summary>The objective of this protocol is to examine the utility of behavioral economics for understanding reinforcer interactions as they pertain to drug self-administration. In a series of 6 experiments, the researchers will attempt to quantify the effects of qualitatively different reinforcers (money, cigarettes, alcohol, nicotine gum) and their interactions. This work represents a continuation of research by this investigator in the area of addiction and pharmacology.</brief_summary>
