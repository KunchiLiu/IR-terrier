	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 506U78 in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or T-cell lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>506U78 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, failure-free survival, and progression-free survival of patients with recurrent or refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or peripheral T-cell lymphoma when treated with 506U78. II. Assess the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of this treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with relapsed or refractory indolent Bcell nonHodgkin's lymphoma or peripheral Tcell lymphoma Indolent Bcell lymphoma will include Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma small lymphocytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and follicular small cleavedcell or mixed cell lymphoma; patients with prior or concurrent evidence of transformation to large cell lymphoma or with follicular large cell lymphoma are ineligible Peripheral Tcell lymphoma will include all entities described in the REAL classification; patients with Bcell ALCL are ineligible; patients with cutaneous Tcell lymphoma and all its variants and/or histologic transformation of cutaneous Tcell lymphoma are not eligible for this protocol, because they will be instead eligible for a separate protocol Relapsed peripheral Tcell lymphomas include all those achieving and maintaining a complete or partial response during initial therapy; refractory includes those achieving all other responses during initial therapy; since the response rate of indolent Bcell lymphomas to upfront therapy exceeds 90% this distinction is not meaningful there No more than 2 prior chemotherapy and one prior immunotherapy regimens; if chemoimmunotherapy was used, the limit will be 3 prior regimens Performance status =&lt; 2 Zubrod Staging workup within 3 weeks and bidimensionally measurable disease No anticancer treatment within the past three weeks ANC &gt;= 1,000/ul; may be included if in the judgment of the study chairman lower counts are explained by marrow or splenic involvement by lymphoma Platelets &gt;= 100,000/ul; may be included if in the judgment of the study chairman lower counts are explained by marrow or splenic involvement by lymphoma Bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x normal SGPT =&lt; 2.5 x normal values Estimated endogenous creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min HIV negative; the patients are excluded because the expected opportunistic infections will render study toxicity difficult to interpret; in addition the possible effects of 506U78 on CD4 cells may be dangerous to these patients; furthermore, indolent Bcell lymphomas and aggressive peripheral Tcell lymphomas are extremely rare in the setting of HIV infection No active CNS disease No other malignancy within the last 5 years, except basal cell carcinoma of the skin or insitu cervical carcinoma treated with curative intent Females must not be pregnant or breast feeding and must be practicing adequate contraception; this is because 506U78 may be harmful to the developing fetus and nursing newborn or infant No preexisting sensory or motor neuropathy of grade ≥ 2, no history of seizures No prior stem cell or bone marrow transplantation; no prior 506U78 All patients, including women or members of a minority that fulfill criteria for study entry will be eligible for treatment; no one fulfilling all these criteria for entry will be denied treatment solely on the basis of sex or minority status Patients with medical, psychiatric, or social conditions that make compliance with treatment or followup unlikely are not eligible No history of symptomatic cardiac dysfunction or pericardial effusion</criteria>
