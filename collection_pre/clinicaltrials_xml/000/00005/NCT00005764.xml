	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if the findings of increased lactic acid and abnormal fat distribution get better when d4T is replaced with abacavir, abacavir plus lamivudine, or Combivir (a pill containing lamivudine plus zidovudine) in HIV-positive patients taking anti-HIV therapy including stavudine (d4T).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Increased Lactic Acid and Abnormal Fat Distribution in HIV-Positive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are allocated as follows: a) zidovudine-naive patients switch Combivir for d4t and b) zidovudine-experienced or -intolerant patients switch abacavir for d4t. Providers may choose between Combivir or abacavir as a switch for d4t when screening lactate levels are 2.2 mmol/L or more. Additionally, providers may choose to switch a maximum of 2 drugs, one of which must be d4t, in the regimen. Each patient receives 48 weeks of therapy. Visits are made at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, and 48. Tests, including biopsies, are performed to measure changes in body fat distribution and changes in lactate levels. Virologic and immunologic outcomes, changes in physical signs of lipodystrophy, changes in self-reports of health-related quality-of-life survey and the Body Image Questionnaire, changes in lipid profile and other markers of metabolism, and safety parameters are evaluated also.</detailed_description>

Have had a reaction to or are unable to take abacavir and have taken Retrovir in the past. Have taken hydroxyurea within the past 3 days or plan to take this drug during the study. Have had chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to screening visit (except for local treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma) or plan to have such treatment during the study. Have taken drugs that affect the immune system, such as systemic corticosteroids, interleukins, vaccines, or interferons, within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit. Have had an HIV vaccine within 3 months of the screening visit. Have taken recombinant Human Growth Hormone (rhGH), megestrol acetate, medicines containing oxandrolone, oxymetholone, nandrolone, DHEA, or other testosterone derivatives, or glucocorticoids or other systemic steroids (except inhaled and topical steroids) in the last 4 months or plan to take these drugs during the study.</criteria>
