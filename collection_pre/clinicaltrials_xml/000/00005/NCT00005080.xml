	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 506U78 in treating patients who have lymphoma that has not been treated previously or that has not responded to previous treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>506U78 in Treating Patients With Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the complete and partial remission rates and remission duration in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or refractory or relapsed noncutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma treated with 506U78. II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response receive up to 8 courses of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year or until relapse. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34-74 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically documented cutaneous Tcell lymphoma (CTCL) or noncutaneous peripheral Tcell lymphoma (PTCL) (needle aspirate or core biopsy of tissue or marrow as the sole means of diagnosis is not acceptable), confirmed by immunophenotyping, including: Mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome Peripheral TCell lymphomas (medium, mixed mediumlarge, large cell) Variants of peripheral TCell lymphoma Angioimmunoblastic TCell lymphoma (AILD); angiocentric lymphoma; intestinal TCell Lymphoma; adult TCell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL); anaplastic Large Cell (CD30+) lymphoma, Tcell type Failure to submit pathology slides within 60 days of patient registration will result in patient being declared ineligible; Note: patients diagnosed more than one year prior to entry on this protocol must have a repeat lymph node biopsy. In the event of rapid tumor growth, rising LDH, or the onset of B symptoms in a period of time less than one year a rebiopsy is also required Biopsy and immunophenotyping should be performed to document relapse after prior treatment CTCL patients may have received one prior course of singleagent systemic chemotherapy for CTCL, but may not have received a multiagent chemotherapy regimen; patients may have received prior local, topical, radiation or electron beambased, or chemotherapybased treatment; examples of the latter would include, but not be limited to, cytokines such as interferon, retinoids, monoclonal antibodies, and fusion toxins PTCL patients may have failed only one or two prior treatment regimens (one of which may include peripheral stem cell transplantation) Patients must have measurable disease; patients with CTCL must have skin lesions which are measurable; whenever CT is specified, it should be understood that MRI may be substituted as long as the measurements for tumor response are made on two successive studies employing the same procedure The following lesions are not considered measurable: Barium studies Ascites or pleural effusion Bony disease (lesions if present should be noted) Bone marrow No CNS lymphoma requiring intrathecal or craniospinal radiation therapy No history of a seizure disorder or grade 3 neurologic toxicity during prior treatment of lymphoma. Baseline neurologic status of all eligible patients is to be carefully recorded (particularly in elderly patients and those with conditions potentially predisposed to neurotoxicity, such as diabetes mellitus and prior exposure to neurotoxic agents); patients with prior neurologic dysfunction or toxicity from any cause must have recovered to grade 1 neurologic toxicity/dysfunction Performance status 02 No known HIV disease; patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse or any other behavior associated with an increased risk of HIV infection should be tested for exposure to the HIV virus; patients who test positive or who are known to be infected are not eligible; an HIV test is not required for entry on protocol, but is required if the patient is perceived to be at risk Calculated Creatinine Clearance &gt;= 50 ml/min Unless attributable to lymphoma To be calculated by method of CockcroftGault Bilirubin &gt;= 1.5 x upper limit of normal Patients with hepatic dysfunction should enroll on CALGB 69803</criteria>
