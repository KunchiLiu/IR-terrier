	<brief_summary>This study will assess the usefulness of a technique called complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) microarray-an examination of a wide array of genes to identify disease-associated patterns-for measuring tumor response to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. The study will look for "markers" that can help select the most effective type of chemotherapy. It will also evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new drug combination of capecitabine and docetaxel. Patients age 18 years and older with stage II or III breast cancer whose tumor is 2 centimeters or larger may be eligible for this study. Those enrolled will be treated with surgery, standard chemotherapy using doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), and the capecitabine and docetaxel combination. Patients will have a physical examination, mammogram and magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate their tumor before beginning treatment. They will then have four 21-day treatment cycles of docetaxel and capecitabine, as follows: docetaxel intravenously (through a vein) on day 1 and capecitabine pills (by mouth) twice a day from days 2 through 15. No drugs will be given from days 16 through 21. This regimen will be repeated four times, after which the tumor will be re-evaluated by physical examination, mammogram, and magnetic resonance imaging. Patients will then have surgery to remove the cancer-either lumpectomy with removal of the underarm lymph nodes; mastectomy and removal of the underarm lymph nodes; or modified radical mastectomy. After recovery, they will have four more cycles of chemotherapy, this time with a doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Both drugs will be given intravenously on day 1 of four 21-day cycles. Some patients who had a mastectomy (depending on their tumor characteristics and whether tumor cells were found in their lymph nodes) and all those who had a lumpectomy will also have radiation therapy. Patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors will also receive tamoxifen treatment for 5 years. In addition to the above procedures, all patients will have tumor biopsies (removal of a small piece of tumor tissue) before beginning treatment, on day 1 of cycle 1, before cycle 2, and at the time of surgery, and physical examinations, chest X-rays, bone scans, computerized tomography (CT) scans, electrocardiograms, multi-gated acquisition scan-MUGA (nuclear medicine test of cardiac function) or echocardiograms of heart function, mammograms and blood tests at various times during the study. Patients will be followed at National Institutes of Health (NIH) for 3 years after diagnosis with physical examinations, blood tests, X-rays, and computed tomography (CT) scans. Although it is not known whether this treatment will help an individual patient's cancer, possible benefits are tumor shrinkage and decreased risk of disease recurrence. In addition, the information gained about genetic changes after chemotherapy will help determine if additional studies on the use of cDNA microarray to measure tumor response are warranted.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Primary Chemotherapy With Docetaxel-Capecitabine and Doxorubicin-Cyclophosphamide in Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II trial in patients with stage II and stage III breast cancer will test the feasibility of using cDNA microarray as a measure of a tumor's biological response to chemotherapeutic agents by characterizing the cDNA expression patterns in breast cancer before and after primary chemotherapy. Thirty-six patients receive docetaxel/capecitabine induction chemotherapy followed by surgery and doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide adjuvant therapy (TX/AC). We will determine the response rate of TX induction therapy and the toxicities of the sequential combinations (TX/AC). We will also obtain tumor tissue for correlative biological determinations.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Stage II or III breast cancer with a tumor size of greater than 2 cm. Patients with a previous biopsy are eligible provided adequate tumor tissue remains for biopsy in this study. At least 18 years of age. Adequate hematopoietic function as defined by absolute neutrophil count greater than 1200/mm^3 and platelet count greater than 100,000/mm^3. Adequate renal function as defined by creatinine less than 1.6 mg/dL. Adequate hepatic function as defined by total (T.) bilirubin less than 1.4 mg/dL and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal and alkaline phosphatase less than 2.5 times upper limit of normal Zubrod Performance status 02. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would preclude chemotherapy administration. Patients may be evaluated by psychiatry or medical subspecialties as appropriate. Pregnant or lactating women Known bleeding disorders Hypersensitivity to Tween 80 (Polysorbate) Cardiac ejection fraction below normal limits, myocardial infarction within the past 12 months, or symptomatic arrhythmia requiring medical intervention. Prior chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for breast cancer. Patients treated with hormonal chemoprevention (tamoxifen or raloxifene) will be eligible. Active malignancy diagnosed within the last 5 years. (Cervical cancer or nonmelanomatous skin cancer that has been treated with curative intent will be eligible).</criteria>
