	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and response duration to rituximab in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura. II. Evaluate the toxicity associated with this treatment regimen in these patients. III. Evaluate the alteration in antiplatelet antibody with this treatment regimen in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Rituximab in Patients With Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients who achieve a clinical response lasting over 4 months may receive a second course of rituximab.
