	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irofulven in treating patients who have persistent or recurrent refractory endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irofulven in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent, Refractory Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the antitumor activity of 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene in patients with persistent or recurrent, refractory endometrial carcinoma. II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene IV over 5 minutes on days 1-4. Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
