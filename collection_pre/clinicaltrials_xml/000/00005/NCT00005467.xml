	<brief_title>Indices of Severity and Prognosis for Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE: Using the database, univariate analysis showed that factors associated with the occurrence of cerebrovascular accident (51 patients) included hematocrit, rate of change of pocked red cell count, and polymer fraction at 40 percent oxygen saturation (PF40). Only low hematocrit was predictive of death in the pediatric cohort. There were 45 disease-related deaths. The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.</detailed_description>
