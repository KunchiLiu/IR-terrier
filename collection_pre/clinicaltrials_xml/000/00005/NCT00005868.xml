	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel and cisplatin in treating patients who have untreated stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Untreated Stage IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the therapeutic activity of docetaxel and cisplatin in patients with untreated stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
