	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of dolastatin 10 in treating patients with indolent lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dolastatin 10 in Treating Patients With Indolent Lymphoma, Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Estimate the efficacy of dolastatin 10 in patients with indolent lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. - Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of dolastatin 10 in this patient population. - Investigate the mechanism of action of dolastatin 10 in regards to apoptosis and effects of microtubules. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by disease (chronic lymphocytic leukemia vs indolent lymphoma vs Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia). All patients receive dolastatin 10 IV bolus every 3 weeks. Patients continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient's withdrawal from the study. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 74 patients will be accrued for this study over 15 months.</detailed_description>
