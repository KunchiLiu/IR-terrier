	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer that has not responded to platinum-based chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Ovarian Epithelial Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer That Has Not Responded to Platinum- Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity of oxaliplatin by measuring response rate in patients with recurrent or refractory, platinum resistant ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal carcinoma who have failed on higher priority treatment protocols. II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours. Treatment continues every 21 days for a maximum of 9 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-14 months.</detailed_description>
