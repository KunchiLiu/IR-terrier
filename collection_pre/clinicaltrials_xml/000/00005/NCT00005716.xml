	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE: Forty-two (42) elementary schools in urban Baltimore and Washington, DC, served as recruitment sites and approximately 300 students with moderate to severe asthma were enrolled. All participants enrolled in the A+ Asthma Program. Primary care practitioners of these students were randomized to a minimal contact program or to the A+ asthma physician partnership. They were offered a menu of educational offerings to improve their knowledge and skills. The primary outcome measure was emergency care use. Secondary measures included physician practices, hospitalization, health care utilization, restricted activities, medication use, school absences and coping skills. The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.</detailed_description>
