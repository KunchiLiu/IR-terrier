	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether vaccine therapy is more effective than observation alone for melanoma. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying vaccine therapy to see how well it works compared to observation alone in treating patients with primary stage II melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Primary Stage II Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the effect of immunization with GM2-KLH and QS21 to observation on the disease-free survival of patients with primary cutaneous stage II melanoma after adequate surgery. - Determine overall survival and toxicity in the two treatment arms. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, parallel, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, tumor thickness (greater than 1.5 to 3.0 mm vs greater than 3.0 to 4.0 mm vs greater than 4.0 mm), gender, ulceration (yes vs no), and presence of additional staging procedures of regional lymph nodes (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two arms. - Arm I: Patients are vaccinated with GM2-KLH and QS21 subcutaneously on day 1 of weeks 1-4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 120, and 144 for a total of 14 vaccinations. - Arm II: Patients undergo observation. Patients are followed every 6 months for 7 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1300 patients (650 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 36 months.</detailed_description>
