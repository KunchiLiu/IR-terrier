	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who have leptomeningeal metastases from a solid tumor or lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Leptomeningeal Metastases From a Solid Tumor or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response rate, survival time, and quality of life of patients with leptomeningeal metastases from a solid tumor or lymphoma when treated with oral temozolomide. - Determine adverse events related to this regimen in this patient population. - Measure temozolomide concentrations in CSF and serum and correlate with appropriate pharmacodynamic parameters (e.g., response) in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide daily for 6 weeks. Courses repeat every 10 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after achieving CR. Patients with a CR except for residual radiographic abnormalities that persist unchanged for 2 full courses continue for 4 courses past best response. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, weekly for the first 4 weeks of therapy, and then monthly thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-24 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
