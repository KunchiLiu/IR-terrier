	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 in treating patients who have progressive kidney cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bryostatin 1 In Treating Patients With Progressive Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rates in patients with progressive hypernephroma treated with bryostatin 1. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses. For patients with stable or responding disease after completion of course 2, treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
