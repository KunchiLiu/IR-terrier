	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether nitrocamptothecin is more effective than gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin with gemcitabine in treating patients who have unresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitrocamptothecin Compared With Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the overall survival, time to treatment failure, clinical benefit response rate (analgesic consumption, pain intensity, performance status, and weight change), and objective response rate in chemotherapy-naive patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with oral nitrocamptothecin vs gemcitabine. II. Compare the toxicity of these 2 regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to measurable disease (yes vs no), Karnofsky performance status (50-70% vs 70-100%), and prior radiotherapy. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every week for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease after week 8 may receive additional courses. Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every week for 7 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo 1 week of rest. Patients with stable or responding disease after week 8 may receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks. Pain is assessed within 7 days prior to study, at days 28 and 56 during study, and then every 28 days after completion of study. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year or until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 994 patients (497 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 22 months.</detailed_description>
