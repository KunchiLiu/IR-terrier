	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with O6-benzylguanine and carmustine. - Evaluate tumor tissue biochemical and immunohistochemical predictors of response in patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate carcinoembryonic antigen levels in the peripheral blood with response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive O6-benzylguanine (BG) IV over 1 hour and carmustine IV over 1 hour (beginning 1 hour after completion of BG infusion) on day 1. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.7-3 years.</detailed_description>
