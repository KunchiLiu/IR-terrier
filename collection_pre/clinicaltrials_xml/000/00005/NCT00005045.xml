	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Carboxyamidotriazole may stop the growth of kidney cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carboxyamidotriazole in treating patients who have advanced kidney cancer that has not responded to biological therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboxyamidotriazole in Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the disease free progression at 6 months in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic renal cell cancer (refractory to immunotherapy) treated with carboxyamidotriazole. II. Evaluate the progression free survival rate and response rate in these patients on this regimen. III. Evaluate the toxic effect of this regimen on these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral carboxyamidotriazole daily. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease may discontinue therapy after 6 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and every 12 months thereafter until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months.</detailed_description>
