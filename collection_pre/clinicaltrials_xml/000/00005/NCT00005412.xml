	<brief_title>Dietary Antioxidants and Atherosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is this nation's leading cause of death for males and females, and Blacks and whites. There is mounting evidence that the oxidation of blood low density lipoproteins (LDL) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. LDL oxidation can be prevented by several dietary antioxidants, in particular, vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene. There is preliminary evidence that dietary antioxidants may slow the natural history of atherosclerosis in humans. Until now studies in this area have included predominantly white males with symptomatic disease. DESIGN NARRATIVE: The case-control study used data collected in ARIC to test the hypothesis that individuals in the lowest quintile of vitamin C, vitamin E and carotenoid consumption were at higher risk of asymptomatic atherosclerosis than those consuming greater amounts. Antioxidant intake was assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire and a diet supplement survey. Cases were those with asymptomatic carotid artery atherosclerosis as determined by B-mode ultrasonography. Controls were those without evidence of carotid artery atherosclerosis. Secondary analyses determined which sex-race subgroups were at particular risk due to low antioxidant consumption. The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.</detailed_description>
