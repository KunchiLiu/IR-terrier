	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. Combining different types of biological therapies may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy in treating patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the frequency of hematologic responses in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome treated with anti-thymocyte globulin and tumor necrosis factor receptor IgG chimera. - Correlate phenotypic, cytogenetic, and functional disease characteristics with treatment responses in these patients. - Determine the safety of this treatment regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 8 hours daily for 4 days followed by tumor necrosis factor receptor IgG chimera subcutaneously twice weekly for 16 weeks. Patients are followed at 8, 16, and 20 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
