	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy and sargramostim in treating patients who have non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy and Sargramostim in Treating Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether a specific T-cell response can be induced in patients with stage IB-IV non-small cell lung cancer treated with mutant K-ras peptide vaccine (limited to the specific K-ras peptide mutation in their tumors) and sargramostim (GM-CSF). - Determine whether skin test reactivity or HLA type correlates with the induction of anti-K-ras immune responses in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) intradermally (ID) on days 1-10 beginning a maximum of 6 months after complete surgical resection. Patients receive mutant K-ras peptide vaccine (limited to the specific K-ras mutation in their tumors) ID on day 7. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 and 12 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
