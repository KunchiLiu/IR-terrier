	<brief_title>Paclitaxel and Capecitabine in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, response rate, and efficacy of combination therapy with paclitaxel and capecitabine as first or second line therapy in women with metastatic breast cancer. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and capecitabine orally twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for survival status every 3 months upon completion of treatment.
