	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin-1 plus cisplatin in treating patients who have recurrent or advanced cancer of the cervix.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bryostatin-1 Plus Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Advanced Cancer of the Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and efficacy of bryostatin-1 plus cisplatin in patients with recurrent or advanced carcinoma of the cervix. II. Determine the response rate, progression free interval, and duration of survival of these patients when treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bryostatin-1 IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37 patients will be accrued for this study over 2-3 years.</detailed_description>
