	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that ingested human recombinant interferon-alpha (hrIFN-a) will prolong the "honeymoon" period and enhance B cell survival in type 1 diabetes in a phase II randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. We have demonstrated that ingested IFN-a prevents type 1 diabetes in the NOD mouse, prolongs the "honeymoon" period in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetics, and delays murine islet allograft rejection. The natural history of type 1 diabetes is unique for a phase frequently referred as the "honeymoon," a period in which the insulin need becomes minimal and glycemic control improves. The B cell (the insulin producing cell) partially recovers. However, as with all honeymoons, they end and the patient becomes completely insulin-deficient. The general consensus of the international diabetes community is to test potential preventive therapies for type 1 diabetes in newly diagnosed patients. Prolongation of the honeymoon as the reversal of the disease is considered a positive result. In this phase II randomized, double-blind, parallel-design clinical trial we will determine whether ingested (oral) human recombinant IFN-a will prolong the "honeymoon" period and increase counterregulatory anti-inflammatory cytokine(s). We will determine the safety and efficacy of 30,000 units ingested hrIFN-a vs placebo in eighty patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes in a phase II trial for one year. Primary outcome measures will be a 30% increase in C-peptide levels released after Sustacal stimulation at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after entry. Secondary outcome will be decreasing titers of islet cell antibodies (ICA). If successful, a larger and longer phase III trial of prevention of type 1 diabetes in high risk patients will be undertaken. We will also determine if ingested hrIFN-a increases IL-4, IL-10 or IFN-a production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMNC) from patients with recent onset type 1 diabetes.</brief_summary>
