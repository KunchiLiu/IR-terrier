	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen or LY353381 may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying how well tamoxifen works on the biomarkers of the tumor tissue, compared with LY353381, in treating women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tamoxifen Compared With LY353381 in Treating Women With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether LY353381 hydrochloride or tamoxifen administered in the interval between biopsy and re-excision alters the expression of tissue biomarkers relative to placebo controls in postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. - Phase I: Patients are randomized to receive either oral LY353381 hydrochloride or oral placebo daily. Upon completion of phase I, all treatment centers begin phase II of the study. - Phase II: Patients are randomized to receive either oral tamoxifen or oral placebo daily. Treatment in both phases continues for 2-6 weeks (until scheduled lumpectomy or mastectomy) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 and 2 weeks after surgery. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 120 patients (60 per treatment phase) will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
