	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving vinorelbine by mouth or infusion is more effective in treating non- small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of vinorelbine given by mouth or as an infusion in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vinorelbine in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the safety and efficacy of oral versus intravenous vinorelbine in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer. II. Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. III. Compare the pharmacokinetics of these treatment regimens in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral vinorelbine weekly. Arm II: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 10 minutes weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed several times during treatment and 4 weeks after treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 195 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
