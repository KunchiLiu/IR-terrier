	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who have stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate to temozolomide in previously treated (closed to accrual 8/01) and chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the freedom from progression median, and 1-year and 2-year survival rates in these patients on this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by prior chemotherapy (yes (closed to accrual 8/01) vs no). Patients receive oral temozolomide daily for 42 days. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 66 patients (33 per stratum (previously treated stratum closed to accrual 8/01)) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
