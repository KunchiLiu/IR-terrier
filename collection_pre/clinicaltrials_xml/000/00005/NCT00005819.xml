	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of combination chemotherapy in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of fenretinide, paclitaxel, and cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the effect of fenretinide on the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel and cisplatin. - Assess the relationship between dose or plasma levels of fenretinide and the safety and antitumor effects, in terms of overall response, response rate, and progression-free survival rate, in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of paclitaxel and cisplatin. Patients receive oral fenretinide twice daily for 7 days. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 7. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel and cisplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are accrued to receive paclitaxel and cisplatin at the recommended phase II dose. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-24 months.</detailed_description>
