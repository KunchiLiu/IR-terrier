	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antiemetic drugs such as granisetron may help to prevent nausea and vomiting in patients treated with chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of granisetron with that of a placebo in preventing nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy in patients who have malignant disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Granisetron to Prevent Nausea and Vomiting After Chemotherapy in Patients With Malignant Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy and safety of oral granisetron versus placebo in preventing nausea and vomiting during the 48 hours that begins 24 hours after administration of cyclophosphamide-based or carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimens in patients with malignant disease. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral granisetron on day 0 at 60 minutes prior to the scheduled administration of IV cyclophosphamide or carboplatin (or doxorubicin) chemotherapy. On days 1 and 2, patients receive oral granisetron at approximately the same time as on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive oral granisetron on day 0 as in arm I. On days 1 and 2, patients receive oral placebo at approximately the same time as the granisetron tablets were taken on day 0. Patients are followed between 5 and 11 days after the last dose of study medication. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 434 patients (217 per arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
