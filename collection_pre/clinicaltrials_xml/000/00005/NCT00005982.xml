	<brief_title>506U78 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, failure-free survival, and progression-free survival of patients with recurrent or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated with 506U78. II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Study the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment continues every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
