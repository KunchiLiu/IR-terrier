	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have ovarian epithelial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Followed by Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and potential efficacy of high dose chemotherapy (HDC) comprised of etoposide, topotecan, and carboplatin (ETC) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with ovarian epithelial cancer. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of topotecan when combined with etoposide and carboplatin in these patients. III. Determine the disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with this regimen. IV. Measure the amount and subcellular location of DNA topoisomerase I and II- alpha in ovarian cancer biopsies before HDC and at relapse to determine the role of alterations of topoisomerases in the drug resistance of ovarian cancer. V. Correlate the amount and location of both enzymes before HDC with clinical outcome (DFS and OS) and plasma concentrations of topotecan and carboplatin in these patients. VI. Correlate the levels of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) and expression of bcl-2 family proteins with response to chemotherapy and clinical outcome (DFS and OS) in these patients. VII. Measure the levels of STAT and determine the expression of bcl-2 family proteins in tumor biopsies before HDC and at relapse to determine the role of these cellular pathways in drug response. VIII. Determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship of high dose topotecan combined with carboplatin in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan. Mobilization: After completion of salvage chemotherapy and within 6 weeks of second look laparotomy, patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours and paclitaxel IV over 2 hours for 2 days. Patients then receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy and continuing until autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested and selected for CD34+ cells. High dose chemotherapy: After priming chemotherapy and within 6 weeks of second look laparotomy, patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days -8 to -6; topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -5 (beginning 12 hours after completion of carboplatin infusion); and etoposide IV over 4 hours on days -5 to -3 (beginning 12 hours after completion of the last topotecan infusion). Cohorts of 4-12 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 6 or more of 12 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Transplantation: PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Patients are followed at 3 and 6 months, then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 4-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-4 years.</detailed_description>
