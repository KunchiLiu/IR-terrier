	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by radiation therapy used to kill tumor cells. Infusions of donor white blood cells may decrease the body's rejection of the transplanted peripheral stem cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining radiation therapy, peripheral stem cell transplantation, and donor white blood cell infusions in treating older patients who have acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Total-Body Irradiation Plus Stem Cell Transplantation And White Blood Cell Infusion in Treating Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether mixed or full donor chimerism can be safely established in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with nonmyeloablative conditioning comprised of low dose total body irradiation, followed by allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, followed by unrelated donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). II. Determine whether mixed chimerism can be safely converted to full donor chimerism in patients treated with DLI. III. Determine the potential efficacy of this regimen in AML patients who are in first remission. OUTLINE: Conditioning: Patients undergo low dose total body irradiation followed by infusion of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) on day 0. Donor lymphocyte infusions: Nonmobilized donor lymphocytes are harvested from the same HLA identical related donor on day 95 after PBSC transplantation. Eligible patients with mixed chimerism and no graft versus host disease (GVHD) receive the first donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) on the same day that donor lymphocytes are collected. Patients who continue to have mixed chimerism and no GVHD receive the second DLI at a higher dose level on day 65 after the first DLI. Patients are followed weekly until day 90, and then monthly thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
