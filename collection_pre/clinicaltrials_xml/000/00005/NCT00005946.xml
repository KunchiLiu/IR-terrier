	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. White blood cells from donors may be able to prevent graft-versus-host disease in patients with hematologic cancer that has relapsed following donor peripheral stem cell transplantation. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus donor white blood cell infusion in treating patients who have relapsed hematologic cancer following donor peripheral stem cell transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Plus Donor White Blood Cell Infusion in Treating Patients With Relapsed Hematologic Cancer Following Donor Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the minimum amount of chemotherapy in combination with donor lymphocyte infusion required to obtain a rate of 30-60% graft versus host disease in patients with hematologic malignancies relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study. Patients receive etoposide IV continuously on days 1-3; cyclophosphamide IV on day 8; donor lymphocyte infusion IV on day 10; and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV beginning on day 10 and continuing until blood counts recover. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive six de-escalating levels of chemotherapy until the minimum amount of chemotherapy in combination with donor lymphocyte infusion required to obtain a rate of 30-60% graft versus host disease (GVHD) is determined. The target dose level is defined as the level at which 2 of 6 patients develop GVHD, and the next lower dose level has no more than 1 patient experiencing GVHD. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months for the second year, and yearly thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-21 patients will be accrued over 2 years.</detailed_description>
