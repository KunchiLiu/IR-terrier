	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. Phenethyl isothiocyanate may be effective in preventing lung cancer in smokers. PURPOSE: Phase I trial of phenethyl isothiocyanate in preventing lung cancer in people who smoke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phenethyl Isothiocyanate in Preventing Lung Cancer in People Who Smoke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral phenethyl isothiocyanate in smokers. II. Measure the steady state pharmacokinetics of phenethyl isothiocyanate required to maintain a steady state of this substance during the hours of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) exposure in these patients. III. Obtain preliminary data on the perturbation of NNK metabolism by phenethyl isothiocyanate in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients complete a questionnaire containing a smoking and dietary log to assess cigarette and cruciferous vegetable consumption. Patients receive phenethyl isothiocyanate orally 4 times a day for 30 days. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of phenethyl isothiocyanate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed on days 35, 36, and 43. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-27 patients will be accrued for this study over 4-6 months.</detailed_description>
