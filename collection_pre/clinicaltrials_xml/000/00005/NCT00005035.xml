	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating patients who have advanced head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Advanced Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck when treated with oxaliplatin. II. Characterize the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of this drug in this patient population. III. Determine the duration of response, time to progression, and survival of these patients receiving this drug. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed until toxicity resolves or for no less than 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34-74 patients will be accrued for this study within 17 months.</detailed_description>
