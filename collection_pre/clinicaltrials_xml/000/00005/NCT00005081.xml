	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining carmustine and O6-benzylguanine in treating patients who have recurrent or progressive glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carmustine Plus O6-benzylguanine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the activity of carmustine and O6-benzylguanine in patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, or gliosarcoma resistant to nitrosourea. II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour, followed 1 hour later by carmustine IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
