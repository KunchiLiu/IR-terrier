	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining tirapazamine, carboplatin, and paclitaxel in treating patients who have advanced malignant solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tirapazamine, Carboplatin, and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of tirapazamine in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors who have or have not received prior chemotherapy. - Assess the toxicity and preliminary efficacy of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients. - Investigate potential predictors of response by studying patient tissue specimens after receiving this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tirapazamine. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy status (previously untreated vs previously treated). Patients receive tirapazamine IV over 2 hours, paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes. Treatment continues every 21 days for a maximum of 8 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Some patients may continue therapy in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tirapazamine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 12 patients in the previously untreated stratum are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed indefinitely. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-68 patients (18-34 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
