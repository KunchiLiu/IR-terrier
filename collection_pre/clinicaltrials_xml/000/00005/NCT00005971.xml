	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of flavopiridol in treating patients who have metastatic malignant melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flavopiridol in Treating Patients With Metastatic Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the efficacy of flavopiridol in patients with previously untreated metastatic malignant melanoma. - Assess the toxicity of this treatment in these patients. - Assess the time to progression, early progression rate, and response duration in these patients when treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment continues every 21 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks, and then every 3 months until disease progression or death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
