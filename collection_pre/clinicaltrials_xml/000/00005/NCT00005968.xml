	<brief_title>Irofulven in Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients with stage IV malignant melanoma treated with 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene IV over 5 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease after completion of course 2 receive additional courses. Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 16-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
