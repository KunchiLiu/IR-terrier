	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of flavopiridol in treating patients who have previously untreated or relapsed mantle cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flavopiridol in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated or Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the efficacy of flavopiridol in terms of response rate in patients with previously untreated or relapsed mantle cell lymphoma. - Assess the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. - Determine the time to progression and, if responses are observed, response duration in these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour daily for 3 days. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after documented CR. Patients with a partial response receive 2 additional courses after documented maximal tumor shrinkage. Patients with stable disease receive a maximum of 4 courses. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months until relapse or death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.</detailed_description>
