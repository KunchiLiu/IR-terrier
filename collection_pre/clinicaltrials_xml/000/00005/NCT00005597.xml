	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who have unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S9926 Temozolomide in Patients With Unresectable/Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the complete and partial response (confirmed and unconfirmed) in patients with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors treated with temozolomide. - Determine the qualitative or quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a confirmed complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after a confirmed CR. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 13-27 months.</detailed_description>
