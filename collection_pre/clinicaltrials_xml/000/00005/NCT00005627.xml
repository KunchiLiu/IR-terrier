	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of estramustine, docetaxel, and carboplatin in treating patients who have prostate cancer that has not responded to hormonal therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Estramustine, Docetaxel, and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of weekly docetaxel when combined with carboplatin and estramustine in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. - Determine the safety and efficacy of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of docetaxel. Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2 of weeks 1-3. Patients also receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2 of week 1 only. Treatment continues every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 5 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
