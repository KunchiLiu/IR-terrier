	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin in treating patients who have recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitrocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, time to progression and overall survival of patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer when treated with nitrocamptothecin. II. Assess the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-55 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
