	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin in treating patients who have glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitrocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the therapeutic activity and toxicities of nitrocamptothecin in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. II. Determine the overall response, duration of response, and progression free survival of these patients after this treatment. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive nitrocamptothecin orally daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues every 7 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression in the absence of further treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
