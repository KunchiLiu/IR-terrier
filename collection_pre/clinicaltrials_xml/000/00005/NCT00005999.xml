	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients who have stage IVB or recurrent cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide in Treating Patients With Stage IVB or Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the efficacy of arsenic trioxide in patients with stage IVB or recurrent cervical carcinoma. - Determine the safety of this treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study over 10-19 months.</detailed_description>
