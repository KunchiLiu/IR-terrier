	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 plus paclitaxel in treating patients who have stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bryostatin 1 Plus Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the overall, partial, and complete response rates in patients with stage IIIB-IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treated with bryostatin 1 and paclitaxel. II. Determine the overall survival and time to tumor progression in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the T cell subset analysis and serum levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in these patients after receiving bryostatin 1 and correlate with clinical endpoints. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on days 2, 9, and 16. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for at least 2 years for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
