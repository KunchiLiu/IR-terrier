	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective in treating metastatic prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with that of chemotherapy plus biological therapy in treating patients who have progressive or metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With or Without Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the effect of estramustine, mitoxantrone, and vinorelbine vs isotretinoin, interferon alfa, and paclitaxel on PSA response in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. - Determine the toxic effects of each regimen in this patient population. - Determine the effect of each regimen on pain, fatigue, and quality of life in these patients. - Determine the objective response rate among the subset of patients who have bidimensionally measurable disease to each regimen after treatment. - Determine the effect of each regimen on peripheral blood mononuclear cell BCL-2 in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease (measurable vs nonmeasurable and elevated PSA). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 10 minutes on days 2 and 9 followed by mitoxantrone IV over 10 minutes on day 2 only. Oral estramustine is administered every 12 hours on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or administration of the maximum cumulative dose of mitoxantrone. - Arm II: Patients receive oral isotretinoin and interferon alfa subcutaneously on days 1 and 2 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2 weekly for 6 weeks. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 2 of courses 2, 4, and 6 (arm I), on day 22 of course 1 and day 1 of courses 2 and 3 (arm II), and then at completion of treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70-114 patients (35-57 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 14-23 months.</detailed_description>
