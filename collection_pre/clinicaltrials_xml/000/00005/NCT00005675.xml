	<brief_title>Oral Type I Collagen for Relieving Scleroderma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SSc is a chronic connective tissue disease that is caused by excess collagen deposits that damage the skin and other organs. This study will determine if a daily oral dose of bovine CI will improve the condition of patients with SSc. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first group will receive 500 mcg bovine CI daily for 15 months; the second group will receive placebo. Study visits will be conducted at Months 4, 8, 12, and 15. Patients will undergo physical examination and blood tests at each visit. Patients will also be evaluated for modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS) and will be given health assessment questionnaires. A chest x-ray will be conducted at study entry and pulmonary function tests will be conducted at study entry and Month 12.</detailed_description>
