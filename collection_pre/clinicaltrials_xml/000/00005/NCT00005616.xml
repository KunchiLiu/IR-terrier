	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine any toxicity associated with increasing single doses of monoclonal antibody F19 (BIBH-1) administered by intravenous infusion in patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for surgical resection. II. Compare the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and imaging characteristics of increasing intravenous doses of iodine I 131 BIBH-1 in this patient population. III. Compare the BIBH-1 related human antihuman antibody (HAHA) serum concentration with immunologic related clinical effects in these patients. IV. Compare the uptake of iodine I 131 BIBH-1 in tumor to the uptake of normal tissue when administered to these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody F19 (BIBH-1) combined with iodine I 131 IV over 60 minutes. Patients undergo surgical resection approximately 7 days after BIBH-1 infusion. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BIBH-1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed once during days 5-14 and then at day 30 after surgery. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 months.</detailed_description>
