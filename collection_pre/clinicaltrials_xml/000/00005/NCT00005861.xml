	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal doxorubicin in treating women who have recurrent, stage III, or stage IV endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liposomal Doxorubicin in Treating Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity and safety of doxorubicin HCl liposome in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. - Determine the response rate, response duration, and overall survival of these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
