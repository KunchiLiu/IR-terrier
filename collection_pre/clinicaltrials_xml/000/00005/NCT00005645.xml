	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ILX-295501 in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV ovarian cancer that has not responded to previous therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ILX-295501 in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Ovarian Cancer That Has Not Responded to Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response in patients with refractory stage III or IV ovarian epithelial cancer treated with ILX-295501. II. Determine the number of patients with at least 50% decrease in CA125 when treated with this regimen. III. Determine the time to tumor progression, overall survival, and toxicity profile in this patient population treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral ILX-295501 once weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
