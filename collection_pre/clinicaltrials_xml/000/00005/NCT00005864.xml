	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide in treating patients who have stage IV colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chloroquinoxaline Sulfonamide in Treating Patients With Stage IV Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the antitumor activity and toxicities of chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide IV over 1 hour weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for at least 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months.</detailed_description>
