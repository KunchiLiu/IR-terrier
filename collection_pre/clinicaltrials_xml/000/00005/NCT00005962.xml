	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining more than one drug or combining monoclonal antibody with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective for acute myelogenous leukemia. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of three treatment regimens in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Three Treatment Regimens in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the rates of complete response (CR) and CR without full platelet recovery in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia treated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin and cytarabine vs daunorubicin liposomal and cytarabine vs cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and topotecan. - Compare the toxicities of these 3 regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by disease status (relapse less than 6 months after first complete response (CR) vs relapse 6-12 months after first CR vs refractory to conventional initial induction chemotherapy (no more than 2 courses) or first reinduction (no more than 1 course) vs second or greater relapse). - Induction: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: - Arm I: Patients receive cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-4 and gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over 2 hours on day 5. - Arm II: Patients receive daunorubicin liposomal IV over a minimum of 2 hours on days 1-3 and cytarabine IV over 2 hours (beginning immediately after completion of daunorubicin liposomal infusion) on days 1-4. - Arm III: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour every 12 hours on days 1-3, cytarabine IV over 2 hours (beginning immediately after completion of cyclophosphamide infusion) on days 2-6, and topotecan IV continuously on days 2-6. - Consolidation: Patients who achieve complete remission (CR) receive 1 additional course of induction therapy on the same arm to which they were originally randomized beginning within 4-6 weeks after initial documentation of CR. Patients on arm II receive no additional daunorubicin liposomal if resting ejection fraction is less than 50% preconsolidation. All patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) IV over 4 hours or SQ daily beginning 24 hours after completion of consolidation therapy and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients are followed every 3 months through year 2, every 6 months through year 5, and then annually thereafter until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 150-165 patients (50-55 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
