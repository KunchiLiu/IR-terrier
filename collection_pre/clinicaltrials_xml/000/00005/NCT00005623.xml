	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Cyproterone acetate may be effective treatment for hot flashes following surgical or chemical castration for prostate cancer. It is not yet known which regimen of cyproterone acetate is more effective for hot flashes. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of cyproterone acetate in treating patients who have hot flashes following surgical or chemical castration for prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyproterone Acetate in Treating Hot Flashes Following Surgical or Chemical Castration for Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of cyproterone acetate in patients with hot flashes following bilateral orchiectomy or medical castration for prostate cancer. - Compare the effectiveness of two doses of cyproterone acetate in these patients. - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the impact of this regimen on the quality of life of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study. Patients receive one of two doses of oral cyproterone acetate or placebo for 12 weeks, followed by a 6-9 month open label extension period with all patients receiving cyproterone acetate. Quality of life is assessed. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified</detailed_description>
