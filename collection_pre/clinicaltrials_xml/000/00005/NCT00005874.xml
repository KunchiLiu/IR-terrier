	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcomas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitrocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy and toxicity of nitrocamptothecin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas or other soft tissue sarcomas. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease (gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas vs other soft tissue sarcomas). Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Responding patients who undergo surgery then receive an additional 4-6 courses (4 weeks/course). PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34-78 patients (17-39 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
