	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining oxaliplatin with capecitabine in treating patients who have colorectal, appendix, or small bowel cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin Plus Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Colorectal, Appendix, or Small Bowel Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine when administered with oxaliplatin in patients with colorectal, appendiceal, or small bowel cancer. - Determine the clinical toxic effects associated with this regimen in these patients. - Characterize the molecular profile of tumor tissue obtained prior to study entry for determinants of sensitivity to this regimen in this patient population. - Characterize the molecular profile of a surrogate normal tissue (bone marrow aspirate) obtained prior to treatment and assess any potential drug-associated induction of DNA damage and inhibition of thymidylate synthase with a repeat bone marrow aspirate during therapy. - Assess any clinical activity of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of capecitabine. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-5 and 8-12. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 106 patients will be accrued for this study within 36 months.</detailed_description>
