	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying vaccine therapy given after standard therapy to see how well it works in treating patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall survival in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer immunized with adjuvant mutant p53 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells after standard therapy. - Assess the safety and immunological efficacy of this regimen in terms of inducing or boosting a mutant p53-specific immune response in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients undergo p53 gene mutation analysis. Patients without a suitable gene mutation receive no vaccination. Patients with a suitable p53 gene mutation receive mutant p53 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells IV over 1-2 minutes weekly for 5 weeks. Patients achieving an immune response with no evidence of progressive disease may receive additional vaccinations every 2 months for a maximum of 10 immunizations. Patients are followed for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 120 patients (40 on the vaccination arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
