	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a peptide may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 and/or sargramostim may be a more effective treatment for solid tumors. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus interleukin-2 and/or sargramostim in treating adults who have metastatic solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Plus Biological Therapy in Treating Adults With Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether endogenous cellular immunity to a tumor-specific mutated ras protein is present in cancer patients. - Determine whether vaccination with synthetic peptides corresponding to the tumor's ras mutation with DetoxPC adjuvant, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and/or sargramostim (GM-CSF) can induce or boost a patient's cellular immunity to that particular mutation. - Determine the type and characteristics of the cellular immune response generated. - Determine the tolerance to and toxicity spectrum of such peptides given with DetoxPC adjuvant along with IL-2 and/or GM-CSF. - Correlate immune response with tumor response in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to one of three treatment groups. - Group I (closed to accrual 6/4/01): Patients receive tumor-specific ras peptide vaccine with DetoxPC subcutaneously (SC) once every 5 weeks for 3 courses. Beginning 4 days after vaccination, patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) SC 5 days a week for 2 weeks. - Group II (closed to accrual 6/4/01): Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC daily beginning 1 day prior to the vaccination and continuing for 4 days. Patients receive the vaccination as in group I immediately followed by GM-CSF on day 2. Patients are vaccinated once every 4 weeks for 3 courses. - Group III: Patients receive the vaccination and IL-2 as in group I and GM-CSF as in group II. In all groups, patients receive up to 15 vaccinations in the absence of disease progression. Patients are followed every 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 60 patients (20 per treatment group) will be accrued for this study within 2-4 years.</detailed_description>
