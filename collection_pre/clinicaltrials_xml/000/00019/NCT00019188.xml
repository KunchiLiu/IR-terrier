	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill their tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-12 in treating patients with AIDS -related Kaposi's sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-12 in Treating Patients With AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of interleukin-12 (IL-12) in patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. II. Determine the antitumor activity of IL-12 in these patients. III. Determine the effect of IL-12 on angiogenic factors, including basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interferon-inducible protein 10 in these patients. IV. Determine the immunologic and virologic effects of IL-12 in these patients. PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive interleukin-12 (IL-12) subcutaneously twice a week (at least 3 days apart) for 6 months. Patients with stable or better disease continue IL-12 treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IL-12 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Ten additional patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed at 4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 55 patients will be entered over approximately 4.0 years.</detailed_description>
