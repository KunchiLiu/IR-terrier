	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: The LMB-9 immunotoxin may be able to locate tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells. This may be an effective treatment for advanced solid tumors. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of LMB-9 immunotoxin in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors that have not responded to standard therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LMB-9 Immunotoxin in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxic effects and the pharmacokinetics of LMB-9 immunotoxin in patients with advanced solid tumors that express Lewis Y antigen. II. Evaluate the anti-tumor activity and the immunogenicity of this treatment regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive LMB-9 immunotoxin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients with negative neutralizing antibody to LMB-9 immunotoxin with stable or responding disease receive additional courses every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of LMB-9 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional cohort of 6 patients may be treated at the MTD. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued within 12-24 months.</detailed_description>
