	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response that will kill cancer cells. Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy with or without interleukin-2 in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With or Without Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the frequency of immunologic response in patients with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer treated with ras peptide-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine with or without interleukin-2. - Determine the tumor response and survival time in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with vaccine plus interleukin-2. - Determine the time to progression in patients with locally advanced colorectal cancer treated with adjuvant vaccine. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups according to extent of disease. Patients with prior locally advanced disease are assigned to treatment group A, while those with metastatic disease are assigned to treatment group B. - Group A: Patients are vaccinated against influenza on day -6. Patients undergo collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) on day -4. The PBMC are cultured with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 for 5 days and CD40 ligand for 24 hours and then pulsed for 2 hours with the appropriate peptide to form a vaccine. Patients receive ras peptide-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine IV over 5 minutes on days 1, 15, 29, 43, and 57. - Group B: Patients undergo collection of PBMC and receive vaccination as in group A. Patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously on days 2-6 and 9-13. Treatment in both groups repeats every 2 weeks for up to 5 vaccinations in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed on days 75, 90, 120, and 365. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
