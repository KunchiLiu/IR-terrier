	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as PET and MRI scans, may help to measure a patient's response to treatment. PURPOSE: This diagnostic trial is studying how well PET and/or MRI scans work in assessing changes in tumor blood supply in patients receiving antiangiogenesis therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET and/or MRI Scans in Assessing Tumor Response in Patients Receiving Antiangiogenesis Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the ability of positron emission tomography (PET) to assess the effect of therapy directed against tumor vasculatures on tumor blood flow and tumor blood volume in patients enrolled on a treatment protocol evaluating a therapeutic modality effecting the tumor associated vasculature. - Evaluate the ability of PET to assess the effects of this type of therapy regimen on tumor uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose in these patients. - Evaluate the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the effects of therapy directed against the tumor vasculature on tumor blood flow and tumor vascular density in these patients. - Compare the findings on PET and/or MRI with those obtained from conventional CT in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a diagnostic study conducted concurrently with a therapeutic modality study. Patients have magnetic resonance imaging and/or positron emission tomography (PET) scans performed prior to start of therapy, 6 weeks and 16 weeks following the initiation of therapy, and 6 weeks following the completion of therapy. Each scan requires about 1-3 hours. Patients receive up to 3 different PET scans including tumor blood flow scan with H2015, tumor blood volume scan with 11CO, and glucose uptake scan with fludeoxyglucose F 18. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 145 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
