	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of flavopiridol in treating patients who have refractory cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flavopiridol in Treating Patients With Refractory Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol in patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphoma. 2. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression. A cohort of 3-6 patients receives treatment at each dose level of flavopiridol. If dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs in no more than 1 of 6 patients, subsequent cohorts of 6 patients each receive escalating doses of drug on the same schedule. Intrapatient dose escalation to the next level is permitted in the absence of DLT. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 27 months.</detailed_description>
