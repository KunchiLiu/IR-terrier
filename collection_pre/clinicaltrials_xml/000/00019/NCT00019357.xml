	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Combining white blood cells, which have been activated by a vaccine, with interleukin-2 may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 plus activated white blood cells in treating patients with cancer that has not responded to chemotherapy or radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 Plus Activated White Blood Cells in Treating Patients With Cancer That Has Not Responded to Chemotherapy or Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility of expansion and the reinfusion of specific T-cell lines (peptide-specific activated lymphocytes), in combination with interleukin-2, in patients who were vaccinated with ras peptides. II. Assess immunologic status or antitumor response that may occur with this treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: Autologous peptide-specific activated lymphocytes (PAL), previously harvested from the patient following vaccination on a different protocol, are expanded and reinfused intravenously; this is followed by a 4 hour observation period. Patients then receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) administered subcutaneously 5 days a week for 2 weeks; the first dose of IL-2 is administered at least 4 hours after PAL infusion. Patients are followed once a month for 2 months after treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
