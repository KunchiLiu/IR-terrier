	<brief_title>Geldanamycin Analogue in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of geldanamycin analogue (AAG) in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. To determine the toxic effects of this drug in this patient population. III. To determine the biochemical and molecular effects of this drug in normal and accessible tumor tissue in these patients. IV. To determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. V. To assess any antitumor activity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive geldanamycin analogue (AAG) IV over 1-6 hours once daily on days 1, 4, 15, and 18. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of AAG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 10 patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed every 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
