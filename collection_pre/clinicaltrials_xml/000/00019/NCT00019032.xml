	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the toxicity of murine monoclonal antibody Mik-beta-1 (MOAB Mik-beta-1) in patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia associated with granulocytopenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia. - Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this drug. - Assess the effect of this drug on the number of circulating CD3+, CD8+ expressing granular lymphocytes and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, red blood cells, and platelets in this patient population. - Monitor patients for the time course of decline in circulating infused MOAB Mik-beta-1 and for the production of human antibodies to IV infused murine MOAB Mik-beta-1. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody Mik-beta-1 (MOAB Mik-beta-1) IV over 2 hours on days 1, 4, 7, and 10. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) may receive 1 additional course beginning no sooner than 4 weeks after completion of the first course, in the absence of antibodies to MOAB Mik-beta-1. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or severe allergic reaction. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MOAB Mik-beta-1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 6-10 days and at 4-6 weeks after therapy. Patients with a PR or CR may be followed every 6 months for 2 years or until relapse. All patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
