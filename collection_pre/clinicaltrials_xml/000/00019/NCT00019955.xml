	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiofrequency interstitial tissue ablation may kill tumor cells by heating tumors to several degrees above body temperature. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying radiofrequency interstitial tissue ablation to see how well it works in treating patients with localized renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Interstitial Tissue Ablation in Treating Patients With Localized Renal Cell Carcinoma (Kidney Cancer)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency interstitial tissue ablation in terms of tumor destruction or slowed tumor growth rate in patients with localized renal cell carcinoma. Secondary - Assess the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo percutaneous radiofrequency interstitial tumor ablation (RFA). Patients are offered laparoscopy-assisted percutaneous RFA in the operating room if their tumors are not safely accessible. Intra-operative ultrasound is used to confirm probe placement and to monitor treatment delivery. If the target temperature or impedance are not reached, treatment is repeated no more than twice. No more than 5 tumors are treated per kidney. All patients are followed at 2 to 3 months, 6 months, and then at 1 year. Patients with tumors greater than 2 cm in diameter are followed every 6 months for up to 5 years. Patients whose tumors become greater than 3 cm are recommended for surgery and removed from study if surgery is performed. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 63 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
