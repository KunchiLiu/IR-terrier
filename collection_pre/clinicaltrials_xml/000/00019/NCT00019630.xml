	<brief_title>Liposomal Doxorubicin in Treating Children With Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the tolerance to and toxicity profile of doxorubicin HCl liposome (Lipodox) at standard doxorubicin doses and doses of Lipodox that were tolerable in adults administered every 3 weeks in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients if dose-limiting toxicity is observed at doses of 105 mg/m2 or less. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. IV. Assess the cardiotoxicity of this drug in children who have previously been treated with free doxorubicin and in children who have not previously received doxorubicin. V. Evaluate the feasibility of using cardiac MRI functional imaging as a screening tool for the quantitative assessment of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. VI. Determine if serum troponin t levels are a useful biomarker for doxorubicin-induced myocardial damage. PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 60 minutes. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a maximum of 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 4-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin HCl liposome until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 4 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.</detailed_description>
