	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 is effective in treating breast and ovarian cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy and interleukin-2 and to see how well they work in treating women with stage IV, recurrent, or progressive breast or ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Plus Interleukin-2 in Treating Women With Stage IV, Recurrent, or Progressive Breast or Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether endogenous cellular immunity to the p53 peptide vaccine is present in patients with stage IV, recurrent, or progressive breast or ovarian cancer and whether vaccination with these peptides and low-dose interleukin-2 can induce or boost the cellular immunity in these patients. - Determine the type and characteristics of cellular immunity generated by this regimen in these patients. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Correlate any immunologic response with any objective tumor response to this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, pilot study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. All patients undergo apheresis of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which are harvested and selected for monocytes on day -6. The monocyte fraction is cultured with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 for 7 days and then pulsed with p53 peptide vaccine. - Arm I: Patients receive p53 peptide vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. - Arm II: Patients receive p53 peptide vaccine IV over 5 minutes on day 1. Treatment in both arms repeats every 3 weeks for a total of 4 vaccinations (4 courses). During courses 3 and 4, patients also receive low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) SC daily on days 3-7 and days 10-14. Patients with stable or responding disease may continue to receive vaccine and IL-2 treatment for up to 2 years. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2-4 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 34 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
