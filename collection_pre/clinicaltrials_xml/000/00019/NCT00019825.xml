	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of decitabine in treating patients who have unresectable lung or esophageal cancer or malignant mesothelioma of the pleura.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine in Treating Patients With Unresectable Lung or Esophageal Cancer or Malignant Mesothelioma of the Pleura</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of decitabine in patients with unresectable primary small cell or non-small cell lung cancer, unresectable esophageal cancer, or malignant pleural mesothelioma. - Measure the expression of NY-ESO-1 in tissue samples of these patients before and after receiving this drug. - Assess the serologic response to NY-ESO-1 in these patients before and after receiving this drug. - Measure the expression of p16 tumor suppressor gene in these patients before and after receiving this drug. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study for each stratification group. Patients are stratified according to number of prior therapies (2 or fewer vs 3 or more). Patients receive decitabine IV continuously on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease after completion of the second course receive 2 additional courses. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of decitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined for a particular stratum, additional patients from that stratum are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed for 1 month. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 72 patients (36 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
