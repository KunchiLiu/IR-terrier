	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody plus pentetic acid calcium in patients with leukemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 daclizumab (90Y daclizumab) when combined with pentetic acid calcium in adults with Tac-expressing T-cell leukemia. - Determine the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Monitor patients treated on this regimen for circulating infused antibody (free and labeled) and for the serum concentration of soluble interleukin-2 receptor. - Evaluate, in a preliminary manner, the immunogenicity of daclizumab. - Determine the effect of 90Y daclizumab on various components of the circulating cellular immune system. - Determine whether there is additional urinary excretion of yttrium Y 90 when compared to that observed previously in patients treated without pentetic acid calcium. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90 daclizumab (90Y daclizumab). Patients receive 90Y daclizumab IV over 2 hours on day 1 and a fixed dose of pentetic acid calcium IV over 5 hours for 3 days. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or circulating antibodies to humanized anti-Tac. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 90Y daclizumab until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Additional patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 15 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of the study. A total of 30 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of the study.</detailed_description>
