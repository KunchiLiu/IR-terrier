	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Thalidomide may kill cancer cells by stopping the growth of new blood vessels to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thalidomide in Treating Patients With HIV-Associated Kaposi's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity of thalidomide in terms of regression or stabilization of disease in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide on day 1. Treatment continues daily for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete or partial response or stable disease after 6 months of treatment may continue treatment for an additional 6 months. Patients are followed at 1, 6, and 12 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study within 3.75-6.25 months.</detailed_description>
