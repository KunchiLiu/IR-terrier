	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of perifosine in treating patients who have refractory solid tumors or hematologic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perifosine in Treating Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors or Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of perifosine administered as a varying series of loading and maintenance doses in patients with refractory solid tumors, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, or Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Determine the profile of adverse reactions (including changes in laboratory parameters) in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine any disease responses that may occur in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the steady-state pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive a loading dose of oral perifosine on day 1 followed by a maintenance dose 2-3 times daily beginning on day 2 or 3 and continuing until day 21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating loading and maintenance doses of perifosine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 10 patients are treated at that dose level. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
