	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving them in different ways may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of melphalan given as an isolated hepatic perfusion followed by chemotherapy infused into the liver in patients who have unresectable colorectal cancer that is metastatic to the liver.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Isolated Hepatic Perfusion With Melphalan Followed By Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Unresectable Colorectal Cancer That is Metastatic to the Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and response duration in patients with unresectable colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver treated with isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan followed by postoperative hepatic arterial chemotherapy. II. Determine the patterns of recurrence in this patient population with this treatment regimen. III. Evaluate the disease-free survival and overall survival in these patients. IV. Evaluate health related quality of life and determine whether baseline correlates with the length of survival. PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients undergo surgery and hyperthermic isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan given intra-arterially over 60 minutes. At six weeks post-hepatic perfusion, patients receive floxuridine and leucovorin calcium intra-arterially as a continuous infusion over 14 days. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed prior to study and then at each followup visit. Patients are followed every 3-4 months for 3 years and then every 6 months thereafter or until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
