	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: CC-5013 may stop the growth of gliomas by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of CC-5013 in treating patients who have recurrent glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CC-5013 in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CC-5013 in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the antiangiogenic activity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (yes vs no). Patients receive oral CC-5013 weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CC-5013 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 80 patients (40 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 20 months.</detailed_description>
