	<brief_title>BMS-247550 in Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of BMS-247550 in patients with stage IV melanoma. II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to the number of prior chemotherapy regimens (0 vs 1-2, including dacarbazine or temozolomide). Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
