	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effectiveness of the study drug, Talampanel, when used to treat patients with involuntary movements known as dyskinesias, as a result of treatment to Parkinson's disease. It is not clear why people with Parkinson's disease develop involuntary movements (dyskinesias) but studies show that blocking receptors in the brain for a chemical called glutamate decreases these movements. Talampanel is a drug which blocks these receptors.</brief_summary>
