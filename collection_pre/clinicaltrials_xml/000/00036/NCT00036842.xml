	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating men who have germ cell cancer that has not responded to previous treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide in Treating Men With Germ Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate (confirmed complete and partial responses) in men with refractory testicular or extragonadal germ cell malignancies treated with arsenic trioxide. - Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Assess the biomarker response rate in patients with elevated biomarkers treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 3 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a confirmed complete or partial response receive up to 3 additional courses past response. Patients are followed every 2 months for 3 years or until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-40 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed testicular or extragonadal germ cell cancer Refractory disease, defined by at least 1 of the following criteria: Disease progression during or within 4 weeks of cisplatincontaining regimen Progression is defined as the appearance of new or progression of known locally advanced or metastatic disease or a rise in tumor markers (betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (betaHCG) or alpha fetoprotein (AFP)) by at least 50% relative to the nadir When the only evidence of germ cell progression or recurrence before study entry is the appearance of a new lesion in the absence of tumor marker elevation, a biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis Disease recurrence after at least 2 chemotherapy regimens, one of which includes highdose therapy (chemotherapy with stem cell support) Disease recurrence after at least 2 chemotherapy regimens and not eligible for highdose therapy At least 1 of the following: Unidimensionally measurable disease Soft tissue, irradiated within the past 2 months, is not considered measurable Elevated betaHCG (more than 20 mIU/mL) AFP greater than 2 times upper limit of normal PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 16 and over Sex: Male Performance status: Zubrod 02 Life expectancy: Not specified Hematopoietic: Absolute granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm^3 Platelet count at least 100,000/mm^3 WBC at least 3,000/mm^3 Hepatic: Bilirubin less than 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) SGOT less than 5 times ULN Alkaline phosphatase less than 5 times ULN Renal: Creatinine no greater than 2.5 times ULN OR Creatinine clearance at least 40 mL/min Potassium normal Magnesium normal No renal dialysis Cardiovascular: No prior torsades de pointestype ventricular arrhythmia No prolonged QT interval (greater than 450 msec) on ECG in presence of normal potassium and magnesium Other: Fertile patients must use effective contraception No active serious infection not controlled by antibiotics No known hypersensitivity to arsenic No other malignancy within the past 5 years except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or stage I or II disease in complete remission PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: See Disease Characteristics Chemotherapy: See Disease Characteristics More than 28 days since prior cytotoxic agents Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: See Disease Characteristics At least 28 days since prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery: Not specified Other: More than 28 days since prior experimental agents No concurrent or planned drugs known to prolong the QT interval</criteria>
