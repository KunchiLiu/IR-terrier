	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: VEGF Trap may stop the growth of solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by stopping blood flow to the cancer. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of VEGF Trap in patients who have relapsed or refractory solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VEGF Trap in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and tolerability of VEGF Trap in patients with incurable relapsed or refractory solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Evaluate the ability of this drug to bind and inactivate circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in these patients. - Determine the dosing regimen that is optimal for neutralization of circulating VEGF in these patients. - Determine whether antibodies to this drug develop in these patients. - Assess, preliminarily, the ability of this drug to alter tumor vascular permeability and tumor growth in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive VEGF Trap subcutaneously once daily on days 1, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, and 64 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of VEGF Trap until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 5 additional patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed at 1 and 4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
