	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells and decrease the recurrence of melanoma of the eye. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who are at high risk for recurrent melanoma of the eye.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether adjuvant NA17-A and melanoma differentiation peptides are effective in decreasing the occurrence of liver metastasis in HLA-A2-positive patients with primary ocular melanoma at high risk of relapse. - Determine whether this regimen increases survival of these patients. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor size (medium vs large), prior treatment of primary tumor (surgery vs radiotherapy), and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive vaccination with NA17-A and melanoma differentiation peptides (e.g., tyrosinase, Melan-A, and gp100 antigens) subcutaneously and intradermally on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients then receive a vaccination once every 14 days for 4 doses, once every 28 days for 4 doses, once every 56 days for 4 doses, and then once every 3 months for a total of 4 years. - Arm II: Patients undergo observation only every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 2 years. All patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients (300 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
