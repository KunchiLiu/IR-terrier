	<detailed_description>Mifepristone is a potent anti-glucocorticoid compound that effectively inhibits replication of both laboratory and clinical HIV isolates in vitro. This study will evaluate the anti-HIV activity and safety of 3 different doses of mifepristone in HIV infected people. This study will last approximately 2 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 4 study arms, and will receive either mifepristone or placebo daily for 28 days. Arm A participants will receive one of three doses of placebo; Arm B participants will receive 75 mg mifepristone; Arm C participants will receive 150 mg mifepristone; and Arm D participants will receive 225 mg mifepristone. A thorough neck and thyroid examination will be performed within 30 days prior to study entry. Blood collection and vital signs measurement will occur at study entry and Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56.
