	<brief_summary>MERLIN-TIMI 36 is a multi-national, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ranolazine during acute and long-term treatment in approximately 5,500 patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (ACS) treated with standard therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint in MERLIN-TIMI 36 is time to first occurrence of any element of the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or recurrent ischemia in patients with non-ST elevation ACS receiving standard therapy. The study also evaluates the safety of long-term treatment with ranolazine compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
