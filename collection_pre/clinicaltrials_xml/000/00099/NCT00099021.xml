	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well pioglitazone hydrochloride works in preventing head and neck cancer in patients who have oral leukoplakia. Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. The use of pioglitazone hydrochloride may be effective in preventing head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pioglitazone Hydrochloride in Preventing Head and Neck Cancer in Patients With Oral Leukoplakia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether pioglitazone (pioglitazone hydrochloride) reverses leukoplakia in patients with hyperplastic or dysplastic oral cavity or oropharyngeal leukoplakia. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive pioglitazone hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the development of carcinoma. Patients are followed up at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks.</detailed_description>
