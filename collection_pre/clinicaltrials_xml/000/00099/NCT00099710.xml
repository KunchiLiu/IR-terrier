	<brief_title>Curcumin in Patients With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Curcumin, a yellow substance found in the spice Turmeric, has antioxidant, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), and cholesterol-lowering properties, all of which make it a good candidate in the prevention and treatment of AD. The study will examine the safety and tolerability of 2 different doses of curcumin C3 complex. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests will be used to examine how the curcumin is absorbed in the body, and whether it has an effect on inflammation, oxidative damage, and cholesterol levels. Participants will also be tested to determine the potential effect of curcumin on cognition, behavior, and daily function in patients with mild to moderate AD. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of two doses of curcumin, or a placebo, for the initial 6 months of the trial. For the final 6 months, those receiving a placebo will be switched to one of the two doses of the drug. The 33 participants will make 7 visits to the study site over a 12-month period. These visits may include a physical and neurological examination, routine laboratory tests, lumbar puncture, and neuropsychological (mood and memory) evaluations.</detailed_description>
