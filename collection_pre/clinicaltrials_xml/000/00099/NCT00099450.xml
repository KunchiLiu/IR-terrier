	<brief_title>Study of the Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of INS50589 Intravenous Infusion in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purposes of this trial are to determine if administration of INS50589 Intravenous Infusion is well tolerated, to determine the pharmacological effects of INS50589 at different doses, and to identify an appropriate dose for later efficacy studies. More specifically, the objectives are to: - Evaluate safety and tolerability - Evaluate pharmacokinetics of INS50589 and its major metabolite(s) - Evaluate effects of INS50589 on platelet function at various dose levels - Evaluate potential relationship between plasma concentrations of INS50589 and various pharmacodynamic endpoints - Identify one or more dose levels of INS50589 for future studies</detailed_description>
