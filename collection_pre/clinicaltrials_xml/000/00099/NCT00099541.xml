	<brief_summary>This trial will evaluate two separate groups of patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer. The objective of Group 1 is to investigate an FDA-approved drug in stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer patients that has spread to the bones. The objective of Group 2 is to see if a blood test can be used to predict when cancer-related bone lesions develop. This trial is seeking patients 18 years or older that have been diagnosed with Stage IIIB or Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be treated by surgery.</brief_summary>
