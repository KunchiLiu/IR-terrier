	<detailed_description>This project will focus on the development and testing of efficient, cost effective measures that are specifically designed for use in AD primary prevention trials. The new or improved measures that have been developed will then be evaluated in 650 nondemented subjects enrolled in a simulated Alzheimer's disease prevention trial. Once enrolled, subjects will be followed for four years with annual clinical evaluations and interim six-month phone calls.</detailed_description>
