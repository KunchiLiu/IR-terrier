	<brief_summary>Approximately 300 patients will be entered into this study taking place throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. This study aims to determine if an investigational drug is safe and effective for treating the symptoms of C. difficile-associated diarrhea and lowering the risk of repeat episodes of diarrhea. The investigational drug will be evaluated in comparison to current standard antibiotic treatment, so all patients will receive active medication. All study-related care is provided including doctor visits, physical exams, laboratory tests and study medication. Total length of participation is approximately 10 weeks.</brief_summary>
