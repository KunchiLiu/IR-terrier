	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether overall survival is prolonged in subjects with metastatic, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab in combination with irinotecan compared with irinotecan alone as second-line therapy following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin based, non-irinotecan-containing regimen.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically documented colorectal cancer which is EGFRpositive by immunohistochemistry [IHC] (may be based on archival samples) and is metastatic. Prior oxaliplatin administered for the firstline treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Prior fluoropyrimidinecontaining regimen (5fluorouracil [5FU], capecitabine, or uracil/tegafur [UFT]), for the firstline treatment of metastatic disease. A serious uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy Unresolved diarrhea, bowel obstruction, or history of inflammatory bowel disease Known or documented brain metastases</criteria>
