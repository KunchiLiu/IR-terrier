	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center trial to test the safety, efficacy and tolerability of alicaforsen (ISIS 2302), a new type of drug called an antisense drug, in patients with mild to moderate active Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Alicaforsen is designed to reduce the production of a specific protein, called ICAM-1, a substance that plays a significant role in the increase of inflammation and is likely to be involved in inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis. The ISIS 2302-CS22 study will examine the effects of one of two dosages of alicaforsen delivered by enema over a six-week period as compared to an active control, mesalamine enema (The probability of receiving the alicaforsen formulation is 2:1). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the percentage reduction in DAI at Week 6.</brief_summary>
