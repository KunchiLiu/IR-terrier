	<brief_summary>This non-randomized, open-label clinical trial is designed to determine safety and clinical activity of a new chemotherapeutic agent, MAC-321, when given intravenously to patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Clinical activity will be evaluated by determining the percentage of patients with an objective tumor response after treatment with MAC-321. Patients must have been previously treated with a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen. A total of 96 patients will be enrolled in this trial. Eligible patients will receive MAC-321 intravenously every 3 weeks for up to a total of 6 courses of treatment. All patients will receive MAC-321 at the same dose. MAC-321 is an experimental drug, and is not offered outside of this research trial.</brief_summary>
