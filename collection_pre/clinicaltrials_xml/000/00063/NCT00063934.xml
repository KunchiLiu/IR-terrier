	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of oblimersen when given together with doxorubicin and docetaxel and to see how well they work in treating women with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Oblimersen may increase the effectiveness of doxorubicin and docetaxel by making the tumor cells more sensitive to the drugs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oblimersen Plus Doxorubicin and Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of G3139, doxorubicin and docetaxel in breast cancer patients receiving G3139/AT therapy. (Phase I) II. To determine the safety of bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide G3139 (GenasenseTM) together with docetaxel plus doxorubicin (AT) in patients with metastatic and locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). (Phase I) III. To determine the therapeutic efficacy of neoadjuvant G3139 in combination with AT chemotherapy in patients with LABC. (Phase II) IV. To further evaluate the safety of bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide G3139 (GenasenseTM) together with docetaxel plus doxorubicin (AT) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the clinical and imaging response to neoadjuvant G3139/AT in the breast and the axillary lymph nodes. (Phase II) II. To determine the disease-free survival of breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant G3139/AT. (Phase II) III. To further define the pharmacokinetics of G3139/AT. (Phase II) IV. To evaluate the role of Bcl-2 expression as a predictor of response to neoadjuvant G3139/AT therapy. (Phase II) V. To obtain serial breast cancer samples from patients treated with G3139. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of oblimersen. PHASE I (COMPLETED AS OF 8/16/04): Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-6 interrupted only to administer doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes and docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 6. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 7-13 or pegfilgrastim SC on day 7. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oblimersen until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PHASE II: Patients receive doxorubicin, docetaxel, G-CSF or pegfilgrastim, and oblimersen at the MTD as in phase I. Patients with resectable tumors after 6 courses undergo surgical resection. Patients are followed every 3-6 months for 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PHASE I: Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer PHASE I: To be eligible for the phase I component of this study, patients must have stage IIIB, IIIC or IV breast cancer; these include patients with T4, any N, M0; any T, N3, M0; any T, any N, M1 PHASE I: Measurable disease is not required for patients participating in the phase I component PHASE I: Prior G3139, taxane or anthracycline therapy is not allowed PHASE I: Patients may have received up to 3 prior chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer (excluding anthracyclines and taxanes), either as adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy or for metastatic disease PHASE I: Life expectancy of greater than 6 months PHASE I: ECOG performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%) PHASE I: Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/L PHASE I: Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/L PHASE I: Platelets &gt;= 100,000/L PHASE I: Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 mg/dl PHASE I: ALT(SGPT) =&lt; 2.5 X upper limit of normal PHASE I: Creatinine =&lt; 2.0 mg/dl PHASE I: Normal cardiac function (LVEF &gt;= 45%) as documented by MUGA scan and/or echocardiogram PHASE I: The effects of G3139 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason and because anthracycline and taxanes used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately PHASE I: Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document PHASE II: Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer PHASE II: Patients must have stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC breast cancer; these include patients with T4, any N, M0; any T, N23, M0; T3, N1, M0; patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastases (IIIC) are eligible; patients with evidence of distant metastases (stage IV) are not eligible PHASE II: Measurable disease is required; disease will be measured prior to initiation of G3139/doxorubicin/docetaxel therapy by physical exam, mammography and ultrasound of the affected areas; pathologic response will be measured at the time of definitive surgery PHASE II: Prior G3139 therapy is not allowed PHASE II: Prior chemotherapy, hormone therapy, definitive surgery, or radiation therapy for breast cancer are not allowed PHASE II: Life expectancy of greater than 6 months PHASE II: ECOG performance status =&lt;

patients are excluded if known hypersensitivity to drugs formulated in polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) PHASE I: Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements PHASE I: Patients with neuropathy grade 2 or higher PHASE I: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because G3139 is an oligonucleotide agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with G3139, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with G3139; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study, such as doxorubicin and docetaxel PHASE II: Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents PHASE II: History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to G3139 or other agents used in the study;
