	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the progression-free survival obtained with cetuximab (C225)/paclitaxel/carboplatin in subjects with newly diagnosed advanced stage ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study in Patients With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) + Advanced Stage Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal and Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The population being studied in this trial is subjects with advanced stage ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer will be enrolled. By receiving combination therapy with cetuximab (C225)/paclitaxel/carboplatin, these subjects will experience longer progression-free survival than previously reported for subjects receiving only paclitaxel and carboplatin.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Subjects must have signed an approved informed consent. 2. Subjects with histologic diagnosis of epithelial ovarian carcinoma, primary peritoneal carcinoma, or fallopian tube carcinoma, Stage III or IV, with either optimal (≤ 1 cm residual disease) or suboptimal residual disease following initial surgery. All subjects must have had appropriate surgery for ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma with appropriate tissue available for histologic evaluation. Pathology must be verified at the participating institution 3. Subjects with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: Serous adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, malignant Brenner's Tumor, or adenocarcinoma N.O.S. 4. Subjects with tumor tissue available for assessment of EGFR status by IHC. 5. EGFR expression must be positive (e.g., 1+). 6. Subjects must have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥ 70%. 7. Subjects must be entered no more than 12 weeks postoperatively. 8. Women, ages 18 and older. 9. Bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/ul, equivalent to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 1. Platelets ≥ the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN), CTC grade 0. 10. Renal function: creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), CTC grade 1. 11. Hepatic function: bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN, CTC grade 1. AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN, CTC grade 1. 12. Neurologic function: neuropathy (sensory) ≤ CTC grade 1. Exclusion Criteria 1. WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for up to 4 weeks after the study. 2. WOCBP using a prohibited contraceptive method. 3. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding 4. Women with a positive pregnancy test on enrollment or prior to study drug administration. 5. Subjects with a current diagnosis of epithelial ovarian tumor of low malignant potential (borderline carcinomas) are not eligible. Subjects with a prior diagnosis of a low malignant potential tumor that was surgically resected and who subsequently develop invasive adenocarcinoma are eligible, provided that they have not received prior chemotherapy for any ovarian tumor. 6. Subjects who have received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis are excluded. Prior radiation for localized cancer of the breast, head and neck, or skin is permitted, provided that it was completed more than 3 years prior to registration, and the subject remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease. 7. Subjects who have received prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor are excluded. Subjects may have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy for localized breast cancer, provided that it was completed more than 3 years prior to registration,and that the subject remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease. 8. With the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer and other specific malignancies as noted above, subjects with other invasive malignancies who had (or have) any evidence of the other cancer present within the last 5 years or whose previous cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy are excluded. 9. Subjects with acute hepatitis. 10. Subjects with active or uncontrolled infection are not eligible. 11. Subjects with a significant history of cardiac disease, i.e., uncontrolled hypertension,unstable angina, and congestive heart failure. 12. Subjects with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below the institutional range of normal on a baseline multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram. 13. A history of prior cetuximab or other therapy which targets the EGFR pathway or a history of prior chimerized or murine monoclonal antibody therapy. 14. Subjects with a known allergy to murine proteins or Cremophor EL.</criteria>
