	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Laparoscopic-assisted surgery and video-assisted thoracoscopy are less invasive types of surgery for esophageal cancer that may have fewer side effects and improve recovery. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well laparoscopic-assisted surgery and video-assisted thoracoscopy work in treating patients who are undergoing esophagectomy for high-grade dysplasia of the esophagus or stage I, stage II, or stage III esophageal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Esophagectomy in Treating Patients With High-Grade Dysplasia of the Esophagus or Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of performing minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE), in terms of 30-day mortality, in patients with high-grade dysplasia of the esophagus or stage I-III esophageal cancer. - Determine the complications associated with this procedure in these patients. - Determine the rate at which conversion to open operation is required in patients undergoing this procedure. - Determine the length of the operation, duration of intensive care unit stay, and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing this procedure. - Determine feasibility and conversion rate of MIE after neoadjuvant therapy. - Assess the effectiveness of lymph node dissection by MIE by recording the total number of lymph nodes dissected. - Assess outcomes at follow-up to three years. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo minimally invasive esophagectomy comprising video-assisted thoracoscopy to mobilize the thoracic esophagus in combination with laparoscopy to complete the esophagectomy and a neck incision to mobilize the cervical esophagus. Mortality at 30 days is assessed. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year. ACTUAL ACCRUAL: A total of 110 patients were accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: High grade dysplasia of the esophagus who would undergo esophagectomy OR esophageal cancer at stage T1T3, N0N1 who require esophagectomy (patients with M1 disease and/or bulky lymph node involvement were excluded). Pathological confirmation of a diagnosis of cancer or highgrade dysplasia of the esophagus by biopsy. Computerized tomography (CT) scan of chest and abdomen within 6 weeks prior to registration Stomach must be available for conduit Age of 18 and over ECOG performance status of 02 Creatinine less than 2 mg/dL Patients with esophageal cancer who would be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation were eligible. If patients were registered prior to receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy they were allowed up to 5 months to complete therapy and any restaging that was necessary before operation was performed. The patient was considered an appropriate candidate for surgery based on preoperative clinical staging and physiological factors prior to registration as documented in the surgical plan. Preoperative staging should include: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) Positron emission tomography (PET) scan and/or laparoscopic staging (Laparoscopic staging could be performed on the day of resection. Additional evaluation was recommended if the PET scan suggested distant metastatic disease.) EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Cancer extending into the stomach more than 20% Prior antireflux or gastric operations Prior right thoracotomy Prior major neck operation other than the removal of superficial skin lesion</criteria>
