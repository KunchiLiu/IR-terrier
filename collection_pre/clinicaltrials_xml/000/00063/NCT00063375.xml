	<brief_title>Interactive Computer Treatment for Panic Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Panic disorder (PD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating condition. Unfortunately, many people with PD go untreated because of the high cost and low availability of treatment. Research shows that CBT is an effective treatment for PD. When administered as a self-help, computer based treatment, CBT may provide a less expensive, more engaging treatment for PD. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive computer based treatment, book based treatment, or no treatment for 10 weeks. After these 10 weeks, symptoms of anxiety and depression will be measured with patient interviews, scales, and questionnaires.</detailed_description>
