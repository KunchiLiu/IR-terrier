	<brief_summary>SUMMARY: This is an open label study combining Rituxan and SDX-105. Rituxan will be given on day 1 followed by a 30-60 minute intravenous infusion of SDX-105 on day 2 and day 3. Treatment will repeat every 21 days (a cycle). Treatment can continue for up to 6 cycles (about 4 months) if tumor status improves and there are no unacceptable side effects. Patients will be followed for up to 2 years or until disease progression. RATIONALE: Rituxan has been shown to increase the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapy. The combination of SDX-105 and Rituxan has been effective in both the laboratory and in a recent clinical study with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. PURPOSE: This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of SDX-105 plus Rituxan in patients with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have relapsed after taking Rituxan.</brief_summary>
