	<brief_summary>Nanocrystalline silver (very small particles of silver) is the active ingredient in Acticoat dressings, which have been approved for the treatment of burns and other wounds. Silver has been used for decades as an effective antimicrobial agent. In animal studies, nanocrystalline silver cream (NPI) has also demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, nanocrystalline silver cream is being evaluated in the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis (eczema). Approximately 180 study subjects with a definitive diagnosis of mild to moderate eczema will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment with placebo, 0.5% NPI or 1% NPI for the 6-week treatment period. Assessments of treatment effect and safety will be performed weekly. Upon completion of the study, subjects may be eligible for 12 weeks of open-label treatment with 1% NPI.</brief_summary>
