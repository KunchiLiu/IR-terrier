	<brief_title>Telbivudine Versus Lamivudine in Adults With Decompensated Chronic Hepatitis B and Evidence of Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind study designed to compare the safety and efficacy of telbivudine (600 mg/day) versus lamivudine (100 mg/day) for 104 weeks in adults with decompensated chronic hepatitis B and evidence of cirrhosis. Patients were pre-stratified by screening Child-Turcotte-Pugh score (CTP score &lt; 9 or â‰¥ 9) and ALT level (within normal limits (WNL) or &gt; 1.0 x ULN) to help assure similar degrees of hepatic insufficiency and liver inflammation on both treatment arms. After 104 weeks of treatment, participants were followed-up with for an additional 16 weeks.</detailed_description>
