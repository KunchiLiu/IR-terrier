	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether doxorubicin and cisplatin are more effective with or without paclitaxel in treating endometrial cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of combining doxorubicin and cisplatin with or without paclitaxel in treating patients who have locally advanced, metastatic, and/or relapsed endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxorubicin and Cisplatin With or Without Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced, Metastatic, and/or Relapsed Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the overall survival of patients with locally advanced, metastatic, and/or relapsed endometrial cancer treated with doxorubicin and cisplatin with or without paclitaxel. - Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the progression-free survival at 18 months of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), metastatic disease (M0 vs M1), prior pelvic radiotherapy for pelvic recurrence (yes vs no), and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 30 minutes, paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin and cisplatin as in arm I. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before each course, after courses 3 and 6, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. In the event of progressive disease, quality of life is assessed every 3 months. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. In the event of progressive disease, patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 140 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
