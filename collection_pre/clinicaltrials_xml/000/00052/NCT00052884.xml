	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of plasma cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Having a peripheral stem cell transplant to replace the blood-forming cells destroyed by chemotherapy, allows higher dose of chemotherapy to be given so that more plasma cells are killed. Giving a chemoprotective drug such as amifostine may protect kidney cells from the side effects of chemotherapy. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of melphalan given together with amifostine in treating patients who are undergoing peripheral stem cell transplant for primary systemic amyloidosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amifostine and Melphalan in Treating Patients With Primary Systemic Amyloidosis Who Are Undergoing Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of high-dose melphalan administered with amifostine in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. - Determine the toxicity of high-dose melphalan when administered at the MTD in these patients. - Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter, dose-escalation study of melphalan. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily until peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection is complete. Apheresis begins on day 5 of G-CSF administration and continues until the target number of PBSCs are collected. Within 6 weeks of PBSC collection, patients receive amifostine IV over 5 minutes on days -2 and -1 and high-dose melphalan IV over 30-60 minutes on day -1. Patients undergo autologous PBSC infusion on day 0. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of melphalan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 10 patients are treated at that dose. Patients are followed approximately 3 months following transplantation, then every 6 months for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.3 years.</detailed_description>
