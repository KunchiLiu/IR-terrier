	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ixabepilone in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory lymphoproliferative disorders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixabepilone in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Lymphoproliferative Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the frequency and duration of complete and partial response rates for patients with relapsed or refractory indolent lymphoproliferative disorders treated with ixabepilone. Secondary - Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour weekly for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-1.5 years.</detailed_description>
