	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Mistletoe may help the body build an immune response and may improve quality of life to help patients live more comfortably. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying mistletoe to see how well it works in treating patients who are receiving palliative chemotherapy for stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mistletoe in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Are Receiving Palliative Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether supplemental treatment with mistletoe increases immune function (as determined by total lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, and lymphocyte subset analysis) in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer receiving palliative chemotherapy. - Determine the tolerability of this drug in these patients. - Correlate immune function and quality of life in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study. Patients receive mistletoe subcutaneously three times a week for 15 weeks. Dose of mistletoe is increased at weeks 2 and 3 and then every 3 weeks until a maximum response is seen, dose-limiting toxicity occurs, or the study ends. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified</detailed_description>
