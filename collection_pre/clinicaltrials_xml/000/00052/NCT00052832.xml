	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Doxercalciferol may improve low blood cell counts and decrease the need for blood transfusions and may be an effective treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of doxercalciferol in treating patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxercalciferol in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia treated with doxercalciferol. - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral doxercalciferol daily for 12 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 41 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
