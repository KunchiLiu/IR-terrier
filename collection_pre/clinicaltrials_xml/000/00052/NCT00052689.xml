	<brief_summary>Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of bortezomib with or without gemcitabine in treating patients who have metastatic pancreatic cancer. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining bortezomib with gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib With or Without Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the objective response rate in previously untreated patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with bortezomib with or without gemcitabine. II. Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. III. Compare the progression-free, 6-month, and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. IV. Compare the change in overall quality of life (QOL) and in subcomponents of QOL of patients after treatment with 2 consecutive courses of these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Patients with progressive disease crossover to arm II. ARM II: Patients receive bortezomib as in arm I and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses in both arms repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life (QOL) is assessed at baseline and before courses 2 and 4. Patients who crossover to arm II from arm I complete QOL questionnaires before the first 2 courses of arm II therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.</detailed_description>
