	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether PTK787/ZK 222584 is effective in treating hemangioblastoma of the brain and/or retina in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. The study will also assess safety and tolerability of PTK787/ZK 222584, and changes in markers of angiogenesis (new blood vessel growth).</brief_summary>
