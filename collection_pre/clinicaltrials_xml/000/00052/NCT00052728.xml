	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen. Combining tipifarnib with tamoxifen may be effective treatment for metastatic breast cancer. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving tipifarnib together with tamoxifen works in treating women with metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tipifarnib Plus Tamoxifen in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of tipifarnib administered with tamoxifen in women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (Phase I closed to accrual effective 10/23/2003). - Determine the acute and chronic toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the response rate and time to progression in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study of tipifarnib (Phase I closed to accrual effective 10/23/2003). Patients are stratified according to benefit from prior hormonal therapy (yes vs no) (phase II). - Phase I (closed to accrual effective 10/23/2003): Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Patients also receive oral tamoxifen daily on days 8-18 (during course I only) and on days 1-28 during all subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase II: Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are accrued and treated at that dose level in the phase II portion of the study. Patients are followed at 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-12 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this study (Phase I closed to accrual effective 10/23/2003). A total of 27-40 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
