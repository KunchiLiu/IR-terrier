	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>10-Propargyl-10-Deazaaminopterin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin, in terms of objective response rate, duration of response, and time to disease progression, in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Determine the impact of pharmacokinetics on toxicity and drug elimination in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the effect of prior chemotherapy response duration on duration of response in patients treated with this drug. - Correlate, if possible, the pharmacodynamics (area under the curve) of this drug with tumor response and toxicity (mucositis) in these patients. - Correlate, if possible, intraerythrocytic folate or homocysteine levels with severity of mucositis in patients treated with this drug. - Determine whether levels of the RFC-1 folate transporter, folylpolyglutamate synthetase, and folylpolyglutamate hydrolase are markers of response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) may receive 2 additional courses beyond the CR. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39-72 patients (12-35 for cohort 1 and 17-37 for cohort 2) will be accrued for this study within 10-36 months.</detailed_description>
