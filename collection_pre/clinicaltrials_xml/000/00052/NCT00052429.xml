	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining high-dose radiation with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining high-dose radiation therapy with chemotherapy in treating patients who have newly diagnosed stage II, stage III, or stage IV nasopharyngeal cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: Cohorts of 10 patients receive the following treatment to assess for dose-limiting toxicity. Phase I - Radiotherapy: Patients receive radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks beginning on day 1. - Concurrent chemotherapy: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 20-30 minutes on days 1-5 and 22-26. - Adjuvant chemotherapy: Approximately 2-5 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy, patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-4 and cisplatin IV over 20-30 minutes on days 1-5 and 22-26. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity in 1 whole cohort of patients, study proceeds to phase II. Phase II - Patients are treated as in phase I. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
