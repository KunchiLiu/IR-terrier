	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Immunotoxins can locate tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells. Immunotoxin therapy may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of immunotoxin therapy in treating children who have progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotoxin Therapy in Treating Children With Progressive or Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme or Anaplastic Astrocytoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intratumoral transferrin-CRM107 in pediatric patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma. - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. - Determine the efficacy of this drug in these patients. - Compare the efficacy of this drug in patients with different histological types of tumor, degrees of transferrin receptor expression, and serum antidiphtheria antibody titer levels. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups by age (5-9 vs 10-18). All patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery for tumor biopsy and placement of 2 intratumoral silastic infusion catheters pre-loaded with transferrin-CRM107 (Tf-CRM107). - Group 1 (ages 5-9): Patients receive intratumoral Tf-CRM107 over 3-7 days via catheter. Treatment repeats after 6-10 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Three cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Tf-CRM107 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. - Group 2 (ages 10-18): Patients receive intratumoral Tf-CRM107 as in group 1. Two cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Tf-CRM107 until the MTD is determined. The MTD in both groups is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months for 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
