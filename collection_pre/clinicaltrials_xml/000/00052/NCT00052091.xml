	<detailed_description>Patients who suffer from a combination of major depression and executive dysfunction symptoms often respond poorly to treatment with antidepressants. It is important, therefore, to find effective alternative therapies to treat these symptoms. Patients are randomly assigned to receive 12 sessions (1 session/week for 12 weeks) of either PST or BST. Following treatment, patients are followed for 6 months to determine functional and clinical outcomes. Depression scales, disability scales, and scales that measure problem solving skills are used to assess patients.</detailed_description>
