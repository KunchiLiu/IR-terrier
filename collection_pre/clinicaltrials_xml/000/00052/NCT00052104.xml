	<brief_title>Telephone-Based Support for Caregivers of Patients With Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Caregivers are randomized to receive either telephone-based intervention or standard medical care. Both groups receive a resource packet containing information about caring for someone with dementia and a list of local resources. Caregivers in the intervention group also receive a series of telephone calls over 12 months, during which education, emotional support, and training in problem-solving skills are provided by trained therapists. Caregivers in the standard care group receive no additional psychosocial intervention. Participants are assessed pre-treatment, mid-treatment (6 months), post-treatment, and at a 3-month follow-up.</detailed_description>
