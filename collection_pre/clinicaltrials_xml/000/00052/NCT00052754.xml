	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as gefitinib may interfere with the growth of the tumor cells and slow the growth of synovial sarcoma. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gefitinib in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Synovial Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the therapeutic activity of gefitinib, in terms of progression-free rate, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma expressing HER1. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the objective response, in terms of time to onset and duration of response, in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study. Patients receive oral gefitinib twice daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
