	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Bortezomib may interfere with the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who have metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of bortezomib, in terms of response rate and stable disease rate, in patients with recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the time to progression and response duration in patients treated with this drug. - Determine whether there is a relationship between levels of transcription factors NF kappa B and HIF-1 alpha and clinical outcome in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-4 months.</detailed_description>
