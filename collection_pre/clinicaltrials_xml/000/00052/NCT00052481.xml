	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Quality of life assessment in patients undergoing prostate cancer treatment may help determine the intermediate-term and long-term effects of surgery and brachytherapy. PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to study quality of life in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy or brachytherapy for stage II prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality of Life in Patients Undergoing Surgery or Brachytherapy for Stage II Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with stage II prostate cancer up to 2 years after treatment with radical prostatectomy or brachytherapy. - Compare the effect of baseline HRQOL, age, and other covariates on HRQOL improvement or deterioration in these patients up to 10 years after these treatments. - Compare the effect of treatment modality on HRQOL improvement or deterioration in these patients up to 10 years after these treatments. - Compare the effects of treatment failure on HRQOL, in terms of disease progression, in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms on ACOSOG-Z0070 (radical prostatectomy vs brachytherapy). Patients in both arms complete a quality of life questionnaire at baseline, 2 and 6 months after treatment, and then at 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 years after treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients (250 per group) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
