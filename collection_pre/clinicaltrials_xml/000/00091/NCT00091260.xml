	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs such as CC-5013 and dexamethasone may be effective in treating primary systemic amyloidosis. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying CC-5013 to see how well it works with or without dexamethasone in treating patients with primary systemic amyloidosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CC-5013 With or Without Dexamethasone in Treating Patients With Primary Systemic Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the tolerability of CC-5013 in patients with primary systemic (AL) amyloidosis. - Determine the objective hematologic response rate in patients treated with this drug. - Determine amyloid organ disease response in patients treated with this drug. Secondary - Determine hematologic and amyloid organ disease response in patients who do not achieve a response to CC-5013 alone and are subsequently treated with CC-5013 and dexamethasone. - Determine the toxicity of CC-5013 in combination with dexamethasone in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral CC-5013 once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients not achieving a hematologic response continue to receive CC-5013 as before and also receive oral dexamethasone twice daily on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 of every other 28-day course for up to 6 courses of combination therapy. Patients who maintain a hematologic response after 6 courses of combination therapy may receive CC-5013 alone in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients not achieving a hematologic response after the initiation of dexamethasone are removed from the study. Patients are followed annually. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-12.5 months.</detailed_description>
