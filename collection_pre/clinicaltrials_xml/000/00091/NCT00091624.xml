Diagnosed with active multiple myeloma and be considered to have disease progression after at least 2 cycles of antimyeloma treatment or have relapsed with progressive disease after treatment. Measurable myeloma paraprotein levels in serum (≥ 0.5g/dL) or urine (≥ 0.2 g excreted in a 24hour collection sample). Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 02. Performance status of 3 and 4 will be allowed if related to bony disease. Bilirubin &lt; 2 x upper limits of normal (ULN). Liver enzymes (ALT or AST) &lt; 3 x ULN. Must have adequate bone marrow function: * Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000 cells/mm3 (1.0 x 109/L) * Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 (100 x 109/L) * Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL Must have adequate renal function: creatinine ≤ 2.5 mg/dL. Must have 2d echocardiogram indicating LVEF ≥ 50% within 42 days prior to first dose of study drug. Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of starting study drug. In addition, sexually active WCBP must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal ligation; intrauterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized partner) while on study drug. WCBP must agree to have pregnancy tests every 4 weeks while on study drug. Severe infection requiring intravenous antibiotic treatment. Life expectancy of less than 3 months. Prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, insitu cervical cancer, or other cancer from which the subject has been diseasefree for at least 5 years. Solitary bone or solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma as the only evidence of plasma cell dyscrasia. Subjects who have received &gt; 500mg/m2 of doxorubicin alone, or Doxil® alone, or doxorubicin plus Doxil®. Prior treatment with CC5013. Prior development of ≥ grade 2 (NCI CTC) allergic reaction/hypersensitivity while taking thalidomide. Prior development of a ≥ grade 3 (NCI CTC) rash or any desquamation while taking thalidomide. History of cardiac disease, with New York Heart Association Class II or greater. Uncontrolled medical problems such as diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension, unstable angina, arrhythmias), pulmonary, hepatic and renal diseases unless renal insufficiency is felt to be secondary to multiple myeloma. Any investigational agent or systemic antimyeloma therapy within 28 days of the first dose of treatment. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form. Pregnant or lactating females. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.</criteria>
