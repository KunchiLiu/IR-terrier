	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining radiation therapy with sargramostim may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving radiation therapy together with sargramostim and to see how well it works in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy and Sargramostim in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety of contrast-enhanced high-dose radiotherapy administered with sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with advanced solid malignancies. - Determine immune response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine tumor response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior therapy (biopsy or simple surgery vs radical surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy). Patients receive a contrast agent intratumorally followed by a single fraction of kilovoltage radiotherapy. Beginning 24 hours after radiotherapy, patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) intratumorally continuously for 1 week and then subcutaneously for 2 weeks. Patients with lung tumors receive GM-CSF by inhalation twice daily for 1 week and then every other week for a total of 3 weeks of drug treatment. Treatment may repeat in several weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 8 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 patients (12 for phase I and 35 for phase II) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
