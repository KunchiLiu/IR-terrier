	<brief_title>Green Tea Extract (Polyphenon E) in Preventing Cancer in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the effect of green tea extract (Polyphenon E) on cytochrome P450 enzyme activities and glutathione S-transferase activities and levels in healthy participants. Secondary - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these participants. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Participants receive oral green tea extract (Polyphenon E) once daily for 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Participants are followed for 2 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 participants will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
