	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other sources to damage tumor cells. Internal radiation therapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving internal radiation therapy together with external-beam radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage II or stage III prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage II or Stage III Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the rate of late grade 3 or greater genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity after treatment with external beam radiotherapy and high-dose rate brachytherapy in patients with stage II or III adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Secondary - Determine acute grade 3 or greater genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine freedom from biochemical failure in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine disease-specific survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine clinical relapse (local and/or distant) in patients treated with this regimen. - Develop a quality assurance process for high-dose rate prostate brachytherapy. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prostate-specific antigen (≤ 10 ng/mL vs 11-20 ng/mL), T stage (T1c-T2c vs T3a-T3b), combined Gleason score (2-6 vs 7 vs 8-10), prior hormonal therapy (no vs yes), and timing of high-dose rate brachytherapy (before external beam radiotherapy vs after external beam radiotherapy). Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy over approximately 15 minutes once daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Patients also receive two fractions (within a 24-hour period) of high-dose rate brachytherapy (delivered through an implant inserted into the prostate) over approximately 5-30 minutes either before or after external beam radiotherapy. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 3, 7, 9, and 12 months, every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 110 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
