	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this Phase 3 study is to definitively confirm the safety and efficacy of BiovaxId, an autologous tumor derived immunoglobulin idiotype vaccine, as measured by a significant prolongation of the period of disease free survival when administered to patients with indolent follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) during their first complete remission.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the BiovaxId Tumor Derived Idiotype Vaccine in Patients With Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with Stage III-IV follicular lymphoma and tumor &gt; 2cm (Stage II allowed if tumor &gt; 5cm), previously untreated by other than local radiation, provide tumor material by tissue biopsy for production of a patient-specific Ig idiotype vaccine conjugated to the immunogenic protein KLH. After completing PACE or CHOP-R chemotherapy and achieving a complete remission, followed by a waiting period to reconstitute the immune system, patients who remain in remission randomized to the active treatment arm receive a series of 5 idiotype vaccinations accompanied by the immune stimulant GM-CSF. Patients randomized to the control arm receive a time-matched series of KLH injections also accompanied by GM-CSF. Patients are subsequently studied to observe their immune responses both to the non-specific immune stimulating agents and for the specific immune response to the vaccine. Patients are followed for a minimum of 4 years post-randomization or until relapse.</detailed_description>
