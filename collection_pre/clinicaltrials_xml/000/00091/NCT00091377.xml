	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Phenoxodiol may help cisplatin and paclitaxel kill more tumor cells by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drugs. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of phenoxodiol when given together with either cisplatin or paclitaxel and to see how well they work in treating patients with recurrent late-stage ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that has not responded to treatment with drugs such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, cisplatin, or carboplatin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phenoxodiol Combined With Either Cisplatin or Paclitaxel in Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the safety and tolerability of phenoxodiol combined with cisplatin or paclitaxel in patients with recurrent late-stage ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that is refractory or resistant to platinum and/or taxane drugs. - Compare, preliminarily, tumor response in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms according to medical history. - Arm I: Patients receive phenoxodiol IV over 10 minutes on days 1 and 2 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2. - Arm II: Patients receive phenoxodiol as in arm I and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2. In both arms, treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks or at the end of study participation. Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
