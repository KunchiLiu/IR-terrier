	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and immunogenicity of adjuvant vaccine comprising ovarian cancer synthetic peptides, tetanus toxoid helper peptide, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 in patients with previously treated ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive vaccine comprising ovarian cancer synthetic peptides, tetanus toxoid helper peptide, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously and intradermally to 2 different sites on days 1, 8, and 15. On day 22, patients undergo removal of the lymph node draining the vaccination site to determine whether the immune system is responding to the vaccine. Patients then receive additional vaccine as above only to the primary vaccination site on days 29, 36, and 43. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 week, 1 month, every 3 months for 9 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 9 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
