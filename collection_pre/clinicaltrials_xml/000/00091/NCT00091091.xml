	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Assessing the long-term effects of cancer treatment in cancer survivors may help improve the ability to plan effective treatment and follow-up care. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the long-term effects of treatment in patients who were previously treated for childhood Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-Term Effects of Treatment in Patients Previously Treated for Childhood Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the cumulative incidence and characterize the spectrum of selected adverse physiologic and psychosocial outcomes, using self-report and clinical evaluation, in patients previously treated for childhood Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Compare the cumulative incidence and spectrum of self-reported adverse outcomes of these patients, using data collected at a comparable time period after diagnosis, with Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). - Compare self-reported health-related outcomes with outcomes detected by clinical evaluation and medical record review of each group of patients. OUTLINE: This is a cohort, cross-sectional, multicenter study. - Contemporary group: Patients complete a self-report of long-term outcomes questionnaire and a comprehensive psychosocial questionnaire. A medical record review is then performed. Patients then undergo a comprehensive risk-based clinical evaluation with specific examinations and studies based upon the Children's Oncology Group Late Effects Screening Guidelines and the patients' specific therapeutic exposures. - Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) group: Patients undergo a telephone interview and have medical records reviewed to validate select self-reported long-term outcomes. Patient replies from the baseline CCSS questionnaire (which was completed at certain timepoints after diagnosis) are reviewed for targeted long-term outcomes. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1,000 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
