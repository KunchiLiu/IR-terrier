	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining celecoxib with radiation therapy in treating patients who have locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose of concurrent celecoxib and limited-field radiotherapy in intermediate-prognosis patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. - Determine the efficacy and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine how the predictors of mortality in the general population (i.e., comorbid conditions, functional status, quality of life, and psychological status) influence prognosis, toxicity, and outcomes of therapy in patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and interleukin-8 (IL8) with survival in patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate circulating levels of interleukin-1 (IL1), interleukin-6 (IL6), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB) with pulmonary toxicity in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of celecoxib followed by a phase II, multicenter study. - Phase I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily. Beginning on day 6, patients undergo thoracic radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3-6.5 weeks . Patients continue to receive celecoxib for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Phase II: If fewer than 3 of the first 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity, then the dose of celecoxib is escalated for all patients in the study, including those in the first cohort. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after start of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-12 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this study and a total of 116 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study within 25 months.</detailed_description>
