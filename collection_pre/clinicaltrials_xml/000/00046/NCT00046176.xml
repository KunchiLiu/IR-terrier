Male or female (Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and agree to an acceptable method of contraception.) History of a CDC Clinical Category C event requiring treatment (not including cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma) within 45 days of the screening visit. Treatment for the acute event must have been completed at least 30 days before screening. Subject is enrolled in one or more investigational drug studies which may impact HIV RNA suppression. Subject is unable to complete the 48week dosing period, evaluations and assessments. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. History of clinically relevant inflammation of the pancreas or hepatitis within 6 months prior to screening. Subject suffers from a serious medical condition, such as diabetes or heart problem. Preexisting mental, physical, or substance abuse disorder. History of inflammatory bowel disease or malignancy, intestinal ischemia, malabsorption, or other gastrointestinal dysfunction. Abnormal laboratory results within 28 days before the first dose of study medication. Required treatment with radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents within 28 days before screening, or will need these during the study. Subject requires treatment with immunomodulating drugs such as systemic corticosteroids, interleukins, vaccines, or interferons within 28 days prior to screening, or subject has received an HIV1 immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 days prior to screening. Asthmatic subjects using inhaled corticosteroids are eligible for enrollment. Subject requires treatment with foscarnet, hydroxyurea or other agents with documented activity against HIV1 in vitro within 28 days of screening.
