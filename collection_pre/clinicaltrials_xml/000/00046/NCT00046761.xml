	<criteria>Patient must have a clinical diagnosis of acute cortical ischemic stroke. Patient must be randomized into the study within six hours after the initial onset of stroke symptoms. Patient must have a measurable focal neurological deficit for a minimum duration of 60 minutes. Patient must have a CT or MRI examination compatible with the clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke. Patient must have had a prestroke mRS scale score of 0 or 1. Other inclusion criteria as specified in the study protocol. Patient must not have a body weight of more than 125 kg. Patient must not have a CT and/or MRI with evidence of a nonischemic mechanism, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or primary intracerebral and/or intraventricular hemorrhage. Patient must not have all three of the following findings: 1. reduced level of consciousness (has score of greater than or equal to two on NIHSS Question 1a) 2. forced eye deviation or total gaze paresis (has score of 2 on NIHSS Question 2) and 3. dense hemiplegia (no movement) of upper and lower extremities (i.e., has score of 4 on NIHSS Question 5 regarding motor arm and has score of 4 on NIHSS Question 6 regarding motor leg). Patient must not have neurological signs and symptoms that are rapidly improving. Patient must not have a severe coexisting or terminal systemic disease. Patient must not be pregnant or lactating. Patient must not have impaired hepatic function; bilirubin greater than 2 mg/dL and or ascites. Patient must not have impaired renal function; serum creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Patient must not have congestive heart failure. Patient must not have a baseline ECG showing a PR interval greater than 200 milliseconds, or a corrected QT interval of greater than 480 milliseconds, or a history of ventricular arrhythmias, or a Mobitz Type 1 or greater AV block. Patient must not have other exclusion criteria as specified in the study protocol.</criteria>
