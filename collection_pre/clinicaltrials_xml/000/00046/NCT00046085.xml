	<brief_summary>This study evaluated the benefits of providing relatives of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia the opportunity to interact with each other using the Internet. It was hypothesized that patients whose relatives had access to the internet intervention would have reduced symptoms and greater community tenure, compared to their counterparts who did not have relative access to the internet education and support program. We also collected information on how frequently the relatives used the website and how well they liked its features.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Online Family Support and Education for Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although psychoeducational programs for schizophrenia can reduce patient relapse rates and reduce family distress, participation rates are often low. This study evaluated an online model to provide the families of schizophrenia patients with knowledge of illness management to reduce family burden and increase perceived social support. Relatives of patients with schizophrenia who received 12 months of customary care with access to the educational website for the first year were compared to matched group of relatives of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia who were receiving customary care and who consented to participate in a family education program. In the education condition, relatives were provided with private, secure access to the website, which features family-to-family chat capabilities, video lectures on the management of schizophrenia, written materials on important issues in schizophrenia management, professionally facilitated online discussions of the material, and additional resource links. Relatives were assessed using 90-minute interviews at the beginning of the project and every 6 months for 12 months. The interviews were used to assess the family member's perception of the patient's symptoms, his or her knowledge of the illness, the illness's impact on the family member, and his or her perception of the website intervention. Patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were also asked to complete interviews and assessments at the beginning of the project and every 6 months for 12 months. The assessments include questions about symptoms, medication compliance and side effects, hospitalizations, and social functioning. The major hypotheses were that relative participation in the online program would be associated with lower symptoms rates and hospitalizations in the patients.</detailed_description>
