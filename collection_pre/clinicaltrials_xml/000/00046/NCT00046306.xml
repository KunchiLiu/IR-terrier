	<brief_summary>Workplace exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)is widespread, effecting between 19 and 49% of the U.S. workforce. The first part of this study is designed to test whether exposure to ETS in the workplace effects a person's risk of developing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. The second part of this study is designed to test whether antioxidant supplementation in this group of ETS exposed individuals can reduce their risk of developing chronic disease. The study will look at 375 non-smokers who either work on a casino floor or as bartenders or cocktail servers. Initial baseline data will be collected (questionnaires and blood samples taken) and the subjects will be randomized into one of three groups, placebo, low antioxidant supplementation and high antioxidant supplementation. They will be followed over a two-year period, coming in for follow-up testing every six months. Statistical analysis will be conducted to see whether this group of ETS exposed individuals has a greater risk of developing chronic disease and whether the use of antioxidant supplements can moderate any risks.</brief_summary>
