	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. O(6)-benzylguanine may increase the effectiveness of carmustine by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining carmustine with O(6)-benzylguanine in treating patients who have newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carmustine and O(6)-Benzylguanine in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Supratentorial Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the activity of carmustine and O6-benzylguanine in patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme not requiring immediate radiotherapy. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour followed approximately 1 hour later by carmustine IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are then referred for radiotherapy. Patients who demonstrate tumor response after completion of the third course of chemotherapy receive 6 additional courses after completion of radiotherapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-36 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
