	<brief_summary>AMD is a progressive disease of the retina which is nourished by a network of tiny blood vessels. There is evidence to suggest that the flow of nutrients to the retina is impaired in patients with AMD. Rheopheresis blood filtration uses blood filters that deplete excesses of large proteins, fats and other substances from the blood, improving blood flow to the macula, potentially improving vision.</brief_summary>
