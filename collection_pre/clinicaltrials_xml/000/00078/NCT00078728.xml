	<brief_title>Family-Based Prevention Program for Childhood Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anxiety disorders are serious conditions that can negatively impact a person's overall functioning. This study will enroll mothers with anxiety disorders and their children to determine whether a brief family-based intervention will reduce childhood anxiety better than standard care. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the family-based prevention program or to evaluation only for 8 weeks. Participants in the prevention program will have weekly sessions with a therapist and will learn skills to help reduce anxiety. Self- and parent-reports, diagnostic interviews, a computerized memory task, and a videotaped parent-child interaction task will be used to assess participants. Assessments will be conducted at study start and one week after intervention completion (Week 9). Follow-up visits will be conducted at 6 and 12 months after intervention completion.</detailed_description>
