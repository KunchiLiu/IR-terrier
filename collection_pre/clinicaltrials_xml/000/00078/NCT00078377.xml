	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether treatment with Armodafinil (CEP-10953) is more effective than placebo treatment for patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy by measuring mean sleep latency from the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) (20-minute version)(average of 4 naps at 0900, 1100, 1300, and 1500) and by the Clinical Global Impressions of Change (CGI-C) ratings (as related to general condition) at week 12 (or last postbaseline observation)</brief_summary>
