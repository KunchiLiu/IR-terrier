	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as exisulind, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving a chemotherapy drug before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well neoadjuvant exisulind works in treating patients who are undergoing radical prostatectomy for stage II or stage III prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Exisulind in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy for Stage II or Stage III Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the effect of neoadjuvant exisulind vs no neoadjuvant treatment on apoptosis in patients with stage II or III prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy. Secondary - Determine the effect of this drug (preoperatively) on surrogate endpoint biomarkers (i.e., prostate-specific antigen, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, MIB-1, and DNA ploidy) in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, controlled study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on the treating physician. - Control group: Patients undergo radical prostatectomy only. - Treatment group: Patients receive oral exisulind once daily for 4 weeks. Patients then undergo radical prostatectomy. Patients are followed at 1 month. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 130 patients (65 per group) will be accrued for this study within approximately 10-12 months.</detailed_description>
