	<brief_title>Study of S-3304 in Patients With Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A two part study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of S-3304 in combination with standard therapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The first part of the study is a Phase I design to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of S-3304 when given in combination with radiation and paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy that is appropriate for further evaluation. The second part of the study is a randomized Phase II design to evaluate the efficacy of recommended S-3304 dose in combination with chemo-radiation.</detailed_description>
