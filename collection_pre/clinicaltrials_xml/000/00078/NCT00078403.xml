	<brief_summary>Infection with both HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) may result in serious and sometimes fatal liver disease. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of long-term pegylated interferon alfa-2a (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin treatment in slowing liver disease progression in people infected with both HIV and HCV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a Maintenance Therapy and Liver Disease Progression in People Infected With Both HIV and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rapid progression of liver disease to liver failure has been observed in people coinfected with HIV and HCV. This observation appears to be directly related to an increase in the rate of fibrotic progression in the liver compared to people infected with HCV alone. PEG-IFN and ribavirin are used in standard treatment of HCV. This study tested the effectiveness of using PEG-IFN in reducing the rate of liver fibrosis progression in participants coinfected with HIV and HCV who could not lower their HCV viral load to undetectable or who could not maintain their HCV viral load at undetectable on PEG-IFN and ribavirin treatment. Participants entered Step 1 (initial run-in period) to receive 12 weeks of 180 mcg PEG-IFN subcutaneously once weekly plus 1 to 1.2 g/day ribavirin based on body weight. At week 12, HCV RNA testing was performed. Participants with early virologic response (EVR), defined as &gt;=2 log10 drop in HCV RNA from baseline or undetectable HCV RNA (&lt;600 IU/ml with quantitative assay used in Step 1) at Week 12, who had tolerated Step 1 treatment, entered into Step 3 to continue receiving the Step 1 treatment for a total of 72 weeks (Arm C). Participants who did not meet the criteria for entry into Step 3 were discontinued from the study. In Step 3, participants were followed for an additional 24 weeks after treatment discontinuation to determine sustained virologic response (SVR). Initially, Step 3 participants who had a detectable HCV viral load (&gt;=60 IU/ml with the qualitative assay used in Step 3) at Week 36 were eligible to enroll in Step 2. After early closure of Step 2, such participants remained in Step 3 until study completion. Participants with &lt;2 log10 drop in HCV RNA from baseline and detectable HCV RNA at Week 12 (non-EVR) discontinued Step 1 treatment. Non-EVRs who met the Step 2 eligibility criteria, were enrolled in Step 2 and randomized to receive 180 mcg PEG-IFN subcutaneously weekly for 72 weeks (Arm A) or observation for 72 weeks (Arm B). Participants who did not meet the criteria for entry into Step 2 were discontinued from the study. Step 2 of the study was closed prematurely in May 2007 due to lower than expected progression rates among the participants in the observation arm such that the primary objective could not be reached. There were no safety concerns. Liver biopsies were conducted at study screening, and at Step 2 entry and exit until the early closure of Step 2. Medical history assessment, physical exams, and blood collection were conducted every 4-12 weeks for participants in Steps 1, 2, and 3. Participants were followed for up to 18 weeks in Step 1, followed by a total of 72 in Step 2 or by up to a total of 84 weeks in Step 3.</detailed_description>

On Step 1 study treatment for no longer than 18 weeks Exclusion Criteria for Steps 1 and 3: Have received HCV treatment within 4 weeks of study entry.
