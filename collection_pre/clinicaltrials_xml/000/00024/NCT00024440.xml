	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Oblimersen may help fludarabine and cyclophosphamide kill more cancer cells by making them more sensitive to the drugs. It is not yet known if fludarabine and cyclophosphamide are more effective with or without oblimersen. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with or without oblimersen in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide With or Without Oblimersen in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the complete response and nodular partial response of patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with or without oblimersen. - Compare the overall response rate, response duration, survival, and time to progression in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the clinical benefit and safety of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease response to prior fludarabine-containing therapy (responsive vs refractory), number of prior regimens (1-2 vs 3 or more), and duration of response to last prior therapy (more than 6 months vs 6 months or fewer). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-7 via an infusion pump (ending on day 8) and fludarabine IV over 20-30 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on days 5-7. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 11 and continuing until blood counts recover. - Arm II: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 20-30 minutes followed by cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1-3. Patients also receive G-CSF SC beginning on day 7 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment in both arms continues every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
