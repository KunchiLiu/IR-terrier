	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor effects of monoclonal antibody huJ591 in patients with progressive androgen-independent prostate cancer. - Determine the biodistribution and dosimetry of this antibody in these patients. - Determine the effect on biodistribution of the delivery sequence of unlabeled vs indium In 111-labeled antibody in these patients. - Determine the HAHA response in patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate the dose of monoclonal antibody huJ591 with antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to one of two treatment groups. - Group I: Patients receive monoclonal antibody huJ591 IV followed by indium In 111 monoclonal antibody huJ591 on day 1. - Group II: Patients receive monoclonal antibody huJ591 concurrently with indium In 111 monoclonal antibody huJ591 as in group I. Treatment in both groups repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for 4 weeks and then monthly for 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14 patients (7 per treatment group) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
