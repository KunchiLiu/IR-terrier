	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Tamoxifen may kill tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cell growth. Combining radiation therapy with tamoxifen may be effective in treating newly diagnosed brain stem glioma. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining radiation therapy and tamoxifen in treating children who have newly diagnosed brain stem glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy and Tamoxifen in Treating Children With Newly Diagnosed Brain Stem Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether high-dose tamoxifen with radiotherapy increases the median survival and overall survival of children with newly diagnosed brain stem gliomas. - Determine the time to neurologic or radiographic progression in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the acute and chronic toxicity of high-dose tamoxifen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Within 2 weeks after the initiation of radiotherapy, patients receive oral high-dose tamoxifen once daily. Tamoxifen continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.</detailed_description>
