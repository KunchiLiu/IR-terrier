	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining carboplatin and irinotecan in treating children who have refractory solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin and Irinotecan in Treating Children With Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of carboplatin and irinotecan in children with refractory solid tumors. - Determine the safety profile and dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the preliminary anti-tumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carboplatin and irinotecan. Patients receive carboplatin IV over 50 minutes on day 1 and irinotecan IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of carboplatin and irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for at least 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-9 months.</detailed_description>
