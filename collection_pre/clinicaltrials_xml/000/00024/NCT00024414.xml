	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of DHA-paclitaxel in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DHA-Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective tumor response rate or prostate-specific antigen response, duration of response, and time to disease progression in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated with DHA-paclitaxel. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. - Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive DHA-paclitaxel IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 2 courses, and off study. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
