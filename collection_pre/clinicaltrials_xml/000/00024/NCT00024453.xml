	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Giving the antibiotic teicoplanin by infusion and allowing bacteria to be exposed to the antibiotic for a longer period of time may be effective in preventing or controlling septicemia. PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to compare two different methods of giving teicoplanin in treating septicemia in patients who are receiving chemotherapy through a central venous catheter.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Teicoplanin in Treating Septicemia in Patients Who Are Receiving Chemotherapy Through a Central Venous Catheter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the response and cure rate of coagulase-negative staphylococcal septicemia in patients receiving chemotherapy through a central venous catheter treated with 2 different schedules of teicoplanin. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center and number of central venous catheter lumens (1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive teicoplanin IV bolus every 12 hours for 3 doses and then once daily for 5 doses (total of 7 days). - Arm II: Patients receive teicoplanin IV over 2 hours and/or by antibiotic lock every 12 hours for 3 doses and then once daily for 5 doses (total of 7 days). PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 490-1,360 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.2-6.2 years.</detailed_description>
