	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Laser therapy may reduce the severity of symptoms and speed healing of oral mucositis. It is not yet known if laser therapy is effective in preventing oral mucositis. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II/III trial to determine the effectiveness of laser therapy in preventing oral mucositis in patients who are undergoing bone marrow transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether low-energy laser therapy can prevent oral mucositis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms. Arm I: Patients undergo low-energy laser therapy with visible red light (650 nm) daily over 15-20 minutes beginning on the first day of their transplant conditioning regimen and continuing until day 2 after bone marrow transplantation. Arm II: Patients undergo low-energy laser therapy with invisible infra-red light (780 nm) daily on the same schedule as in arm I. Arm III: Patients undergo sham laser therapy daily on the same schedule as in arm I. Patients are followed on days 3, 7, 10, 14, 18, 21, and 24. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients (22 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
