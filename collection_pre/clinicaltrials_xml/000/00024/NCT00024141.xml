	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan followed by fluorouracil in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Followed by Fluorouracil in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the optimal dose of irinotecan when administered before fluorouracil in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Correlate the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan with its biologic effects in these patients. - Assess, in a preliminary manner, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study of irinotecan. Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and fluorouracil IV over 5 minutes on days 2, 9, 16, and 23. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 6 patients receive decreasing doses of irinotecan until the optimal dose is determined. The optimal dose is defined as the dose at which at least 3 of 6 patients show evidence of recruitment of cells into the S phase at 24 hours after irinotecan administration. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
