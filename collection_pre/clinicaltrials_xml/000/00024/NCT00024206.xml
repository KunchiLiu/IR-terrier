	<brief_title>SU6668 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the optimal biologically effective dose of SU6668 in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Assess the safety and tolerability of this therapy in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile and interpatient pharmacologic variability of this therapy in these patients. IV. Determine the extent, frequency, and duration of any tumor responses in patients treated with this therapy. V. Determine a recommended phase II dose of SU6668 for future clinical studies. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral SU6668 twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression of 100% or more. Cohorts of at least 6 patients receive escalating doses of SU6668 until the optimal biologically effective dose (OBD) is determined. Once the OBD is reached, dose escalation continues until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined (if possible). The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
