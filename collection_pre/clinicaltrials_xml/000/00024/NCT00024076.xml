	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses high-frequency electric current to kill tumor cells. CT-guided radiofrequency ablation may be effective treatment for lung cancer. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation in treating patients who have refractory or advanced lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation in Treating Patients With Refractory or Advanced Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and toxicity of radiofrequency ablation in patients with refractory or advanced pulmonary malignancies. - Determine the efficacy of this treatment, in terms of local control, in these patients. - Determine whether CT scan is a reasonable imaging assessment tool for treatment delivery and follow-up in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation directly to the tumor over 2 hours. Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
