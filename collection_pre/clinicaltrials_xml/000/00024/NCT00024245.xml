	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Probenecid may increase the effectiveness of 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin and probenecid in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>10-Propargyl-10-Deazaaminopterin Plus Probenecid in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin and probenecid in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin (PDX) and probenecid. Patients receive probenecid IV and PDX IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive sequentially escalating doses of probenecid and PDX until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
