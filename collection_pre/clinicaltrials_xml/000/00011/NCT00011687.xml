	<brief_summary>The Study for Future Families is a multi-center study that is recruiting pregnant women and their partners in four US cities to look for differences between cities in several measures of reproductive health. These measures include how long it took couples to conceive as well as hormone levels and semen quality in the male partners. This study is modeled after a study in four European cities so that,when complete, data on the 300 couples in each of the eight cities can be compared.</brief_summary>
