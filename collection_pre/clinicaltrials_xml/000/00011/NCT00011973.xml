	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of fenretinide in treating patients who have advanced kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with fenretinide. - Determine progression-free and overall survival of this patient population treated with this drug. - Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral fenretinide twice a day for 7 days. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-21 months.</detailed_description>
