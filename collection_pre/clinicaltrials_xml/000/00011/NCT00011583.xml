	<brief_summary>Our long term objectives are to understand the mechanisms of motor impairment following neurologic injury and to develop interventions to improve motor recovery. A series of complementary, overlapping clinical trials and development activities will validate and optimize the use of robot-assisted upper limb therapy for neuro rehabilitation. We have developed a robotic system that assists or resists elbow and shoulder movements in three dimensional space. In addition to unilateral exercise modes, a novel bimanual mode enables hemiparetic subjects to practice mirror image upper limb exercises.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomized controlled clinical trial of the Mirror Image Movement Enabler (MIME) robotic device for shoulder and elbow neurorehabilitation in subacute stroke patients. MIME incorporates a PUMA 560 robot that applies forces to the paretic limb during unilateral and bilateral movements in three dimensions. Robot-assisted treatment (bilateral, unilateral, and combined bilateral and unilateral) was compared with conventional therapy.</detailed_description>
