	<brief_summary>We are examining the role of maternal bone lead turnover during pregnancy and lactation as a potential source of lead exposure for the fetus and the infant (via breast milk). A cohort, ascertained at entry to care, consists of &gt;1000 women to be followed through pregnancy. In the postpartum subjects are recruited for a nested case control study to assess the influence of lactation on maternal bone density, maternal blood lead and breast milk lead.</brief_summary>
