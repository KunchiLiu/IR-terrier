	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of TRIZIVIR (Abacavir/Lamivudine/Zidovudine) With Efavirenz in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Never Taken Anti-HIV Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive TZV plus EFV in the 48-week Induction Phase. Eligible patients, defined as those with plasma HIV-1 RNA under 50 copies/ml, participate in the 48-week Maintenance Phase. Patients are randomized equally to receive either TZV plus EFV or TZV alone. An immunology substudy will be conducted, including approximately the first 100 patients enrolled who agree to participate.</detailed_description>
