	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapy may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of the chemotherapy used in treating chronic myeloid leukemia. Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation, chemotherapy, and biological therapy in treating patients who have chronic myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Marrow Transplantation Plus Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the one year event-free survival in patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia receiving sargramostim (GM-CSF)-treated autologous bone marrow transplantation followed by GM-CSF and interferon alfa. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo harvesting of autologous bone marrow. A portion of the cells are treated ex vivo with sargramostim (GM-CSF) for 3 days. Patients then receive myeloablative chemotherapy with busulfan and cyclophosphamide on days -9 to -2 according to the preparative regimen protocol. Patients undergo sargramostim (GM-CSF)-treated autologous bone marrow transplantation on day 0. Patients receive GM-CSF subcutaneously daily on days 5-180, and interferon alfa daily on days 90-180. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-19 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years.</detailed_description>
