	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate a safe and useful medication for outpatient detoxification that is as effective as benzodiazepines in the short-term, and more effective in the protracted withdrawal period. Gabapentin (Neurontin) will be compared to a standard benzodiazepine, lorazepam (Ativan), for its effectiveness in treating alcohol withdrawal.</brief_summary>
