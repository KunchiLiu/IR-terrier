	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if families who participate in a video support program function better as a family in the areas of communication, togetherness, and overall increased ability to cope when a parent is newly diagnosed with cancer. II. Determine if participation in this program decreases stress-related illness in the well members of the family. III. Determine the safety of this program. IV. Determine patient/family and medical provider satisfaction with this program. OUTLINE: This a randomized study. Adult parent participants and spouses undergo a baseline assessment over approximately 1 hour comprising completion of a self-assessment form followed by an interview. Families are then randomized to one of two arms. Arm I: Adult parent participants receive a video support program comprising 3 videotapes (parent tape, adolescent tape, and child tape) and a parent guidebook. The parents are encouraged to screen the videotapes and decide whether to have their child and/or adolescent view the program. Arm II: Adult parent participants receive no video support material. Families may view the video program after study completion. Adult parent participants in both arms complete follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 weeks.
