	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Increasing knowledge about the complementary or alternative medicine practices used by women who are at increased risk for breast cancer may provide useful information for planning breast-cancer-prevention strategies. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to determine how many women who are at increased risk for breast cancer use complementary or alternative medicine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Complementary or Alternative Medicine Practices Used by Women at Increased Risk for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the prevalence of complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) practices among adult women who are enrolled in the Risk Assessment Clinic at the National Naval Medical Center Breast Care Center and are found to be at increased risk for developing breast cancer. II. Correlate the use of CAM with individual risk for breast cancer. III. Define the types of CAM practices used by this study population. IV. Identify reasons why this study population is using CAM. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine practices (enteral/parenteral vs psychologic/neurologic). Patients complete a Personal Risk Assessment form, pre-test/post-test knowledge questionnaires, and a survey questionnaire. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 102 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 2 years.</detailed_description>
