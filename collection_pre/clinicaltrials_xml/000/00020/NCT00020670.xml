	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of generating a vaccine comprising CD40-activated autologous leukemic cells for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). - Determine the feasibility of this regimen in patients with B-cell ALL. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Assess the ALL-specific immunity in patients treated with this regimen. - Assess the generation of immunity to control antigens in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine, in a preliminary manner, the effect of this regimen on tumor response in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Autologous acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are harvested, cultured with CD40 ligand, pulsed with keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and then irradiated. Beginning a minimum of 1 week after tumor cell collection, patients receive vaccination with autologous CD40-activated ALL cells subcutaneously and intradermally on weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 4 vaccinations, patients who have more aliquots of vaccine available from the initial tumor cell collection may receive additional vaccinations every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Vaccination may be postponed for a maximum of 1 year after tumor cell collection in patients who receive chemotherapy and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Patients are followed at approximately 2 months after last vaccination. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
