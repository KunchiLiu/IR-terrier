	<brief_title>Pirfenidone in Treating Patients With Fibrosis Caused by Radiation Therapy for Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and therapeutic efficacy of pirfenidone in cancer patients with radiation-induced fibrosis. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral pirfenidone 3 times daily. Treatment continues for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Principal functional abilities are assessed at baseline, every 3 months, and at termination of therapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
