	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill the tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with interleukin-12 may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining liposomal doxorubicin with interleukin-12 in treating patients who have AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liposomal Doxorubicin and Interleukin-12 in Treating Patients With AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall response rate in patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) treated with doxorubicin HCl liposome and interleukin-12. - Determine the time to response and the number of complete responses in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Provide pilot information on the ability of interleukin-12 to maintain major responses induced with paclitaxel salvage therapy in patients with aggressive or life-threatening KS after treatment failure with doxorubicin HCl liposome and interleukin-12. - Determine the effect of this regimen on CD4 counts and viral load in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome (LipoDox) IV over 30 minutes once every 3 weeks for a total of 6 doses. Beginning concurrently with the initiation of LipoDox, patients also receive interleukin-12 (IL-12) subcutaneously twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) for up to 3 years. Patients with refractory disease are transferred to the paclitaxel salvage therapy regimen comprising paclitaxel IV continuously on days 1-4 once every 3 weeks until a major response is achieved. Beginning concurrently with the initiation of paclitaxel salvage therapy, patients also receive IL-12 as above for up to 3 years. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response may discontinue IL-12 administration. If necessary, IL-12 treatment may resume at a later time. Patients are followed at 4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-4 years.</detailed_description>
