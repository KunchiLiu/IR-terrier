	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of inhaled doxorubicin in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors affecting the lungs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inhaled Doxorubicin in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Affecting the Lungs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and phase II dose of inhaled doxorubicin in patients with advanced solid tumors affecting the lungs. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of inhaled doxorubicin in blood in these patients. - Determine the relationship between pharmacodynamic parameters and toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive inhaled doxorubicin every 3 weeks for up to 3 doses. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive additional doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 weeks and 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 33 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.</detailed_description>
