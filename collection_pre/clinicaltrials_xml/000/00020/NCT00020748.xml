	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of epirubicin plus irinotecan in treating patients who have advanced cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epirubicin Plus Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of epirubicin and irinotecan in patients with advanced cancer. - Determine the objective antitumor responses in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour followed by epirubicin IV over 5 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Sequential dose escalation of epirubicin is followed by sequential dose escalation of irinotecan. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of epirubicin and irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
