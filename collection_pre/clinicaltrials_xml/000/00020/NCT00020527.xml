	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Giving caspofungin acetate may be effective in preventing or controlling fever and neutropenia caused by chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of caspofungin acetate in treating children who have fever and neutropenia caused by a weakened immune system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Caspofungin Acetate in Treating Children With Fever and Neutropenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the pharmacokinetics and serum levels of caspofungin acetate in immunocompromised children with new-onset fever and neutropenia. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (2 to 11 vs 12 to 17). Patients receive caspofungin acetate IV over 1 hour once daily for 4 to 28 days in the absence of the need to start standard empirical antifungal therapy, a breakthrough fungal infection, any deterioration of patient condition, or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 16 patients (8 per stratum) receive caspofungin acetate at 1 of 2 dose levels. Caspofungin acetate is escalated to dose level 2 if no more than 1 of 8 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity at dose level 1. Patients are followed at 14 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-64 patients (16 per dose level (cohort), 8 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
