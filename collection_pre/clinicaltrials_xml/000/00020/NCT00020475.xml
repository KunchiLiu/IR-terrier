	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 may be a more effective treatment for metastatic melanoma of the eye. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy and interleukin-2 in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma of the eye.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma of the Eye</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the clinical response in patients with metastatic ocular melanoma treated with gp100:209-217 (210M) antigen and MART-1:26-35 (27L) antigen emulsified in Montanide ISA-51. II. Determine the clinical benefit of interleukin-2 in combination with this vaccine in these patients. PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive vaccine subcutaneously once weekly. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with progressive disease may receive vaccine SC on day 1 followed by interleukin-2 IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for a maximum of 12 doses. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
