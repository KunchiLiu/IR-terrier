	<brief_title>Naloxone in Treating Constipation in Patients Who Are Receiving Opioids for Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the long-term safety and efficacy of oral naloxone in treating opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic malignant or non-malignant pain. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral naloxone twice daily. Each patient receives an escalating dose until the minimum effective dose or the maximum dose allowed is reached. The minimum effective dose is defined as the dose at which a patient has at least 4 bowel movements within 7 days. Patients receive the minimum effective dose for 7 days and then continue long-term treatment for a maximum of 72 weeks. Patients receiving the maximum dose allowed with fewer than 4 bowel movements per week will discontinue study therapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 600 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
