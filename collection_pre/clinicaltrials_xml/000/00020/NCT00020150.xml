	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining temozolomide and O6-benzylguanine in treating children who have solid tumors that have not responded to previous therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide and O6-benzylguanine in Treating Children With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of temozolomide administered with a biologically active dose of O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG) in children with refractory solid tumors. - Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and the toxicity profile of this combination in these patients. - Assess the plasma pharmacokinetics of O6-BG and its active metabolite, 8-oxo-O6-BG, in these patients. - Assess the plasma pharmacokinetics of this combination in these patients. - Correlate levels of alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase in peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the degree of hematologic toxicity of this combination in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG) IV over 1 hour followed 30 minutes later by oral temozolomide daily for 5 days. Treatment continues every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Sequential dose escalation of O6-BG is followed by sequential dose escalation of temozolomide. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of O6-BG and temozolomide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and prior to courses 1, 3, 6, 8, and 12. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-48 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.</detailed_description>
