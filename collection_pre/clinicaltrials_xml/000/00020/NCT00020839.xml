	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known if chemotherapy is more effective with or without radiation therapy in treating brain metastases. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy to the brain in treating patients who have stage IV melanoma with asymptomatic brain metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide With or Without Radiation Therapy to the Brain in Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma That Is Metastatic to the Brain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the efficacy of temozolomide with or without radiotherapy in terms of overall survival in patients with stage IV melanoma with asymptomatic brain metastases. - Compare the time to appearance of neurological symptoms in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the quality of life and quality-adjusted survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to LDH levels (less than 225 U/L vs 225 U/L or more), concurrent metastases (visceral vs soft tissue), and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues every 4 weeks for a maximum of 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive temozolomide as in arm I and whole brain radiotherapy on days 8-12 and 15-19 during the first course of chemotherapy. Quality of life is assessed before beginning each course and then every 4 weeks after completion of study drug. Patients are followed every 4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
