	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-247550 in treating women who have stage IV or recurrent metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-247550 in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the clinical activity of BMS-247550, in terms of tumor response rate, in women with taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer. - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. - Determine the duration of response, time to progression, and survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 4-18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 4 additional courses beyond CR. Responding patients may receive additional courses at the investigator's discretion. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
