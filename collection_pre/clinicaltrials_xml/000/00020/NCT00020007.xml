	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Heating paclitaxel to several degrees above body temperature and infusing it to the affected area around the tumor may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of paclitaxel given by hyperthermic perfusion in treating patients with lung cancer or lung metastases that cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel and Hyperthermic Perfusion in Treating Patients With Lung Cancer or Lung Metastases That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and phase II dose of paclitaxel administered via hyperthermic retrograde isolated lung perfusion in patients with unresectable pulmonary malignancies. - Determine the nature of the toxic effects of this regimen in this patient population. - Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the relationship between pharmacodynamic parameters and toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of paclitaxel. Patients undergo posterolateral thoracotomy or median sternotomy. Patients receive paclitaxel over 90 minutes administered via hyperthermic retrograde isolated lung perfusion. The entire surgery lasts approximately 4 hours. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 and 2 months. Patients with responding disease continue to be followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 31 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
