	<brief_title>Celecoxib in Preventing Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Tobacco Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy and feasibility of celecoxib for chemoprevention of primary non-small cell lung cancer in high-risk tobacco smokers. - Determine the safety and long-term side effects of this drug in this population. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 6 months. Patients are followed at 2 weeks and then at 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.</detailed_description>
