	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Analyzing genes that are present in cancer cells may be useful in developing better methods to detect, predict, and treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study genes that are present in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis of Genes Present in Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Identify gene expression patterns in malignant T cells that can be used to diagnose cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. - Determine the patterns of gene expression that distinguish normal skin-homing T cells from malignant T cells. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease (Sezary syndrome vs mycosis fungoides) and prior treatment (yes vs no). All patients receive a physical examination, and a medical history is taken. Patients with Sezary syndrome undergo leukapheresis. Patients with plaque/tumor stage mycosis fungoides undergo skin biopsy of involved skin. Malignant T cells from blood or skin are then isolated and patterns of gene expression in the malignant T cells are compared to those in normal skin-homing T cells from healthy donors using a "gene chip" (Lymphochip). Patients are followed annually for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per disease stratum) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
