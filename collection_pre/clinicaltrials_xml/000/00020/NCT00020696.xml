	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining tirapazamine with cisplatin in treating patients who have recurrent ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tirapazamine Plus Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of tirapazamine and cisplatin in patients with persistent or recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal carcinoma. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive tirapazamine IV over 2 hours followed 1 hour later by cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-65 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
