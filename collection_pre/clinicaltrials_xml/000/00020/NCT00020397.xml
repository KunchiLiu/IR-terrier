	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Refractory Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether an immunologic response can be obtained after administration of ESO-1 peptide vaccine comprising class I , II, or both peptides in HLA-A*201 or HLA-DPB1*04 positive patients with refractory metastatic melanoma expressing ESO-1. - Determine the toxicity of this vaccine in these patients. - Determine whether prior immunization with this vaccine results in increased clinical responsiveness in patients treated with interleukin-2. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups according to HLA type. - Group 1 (HLA-A*201 and HLA-DPB1*04 positive): Patients receive ESO-1 peptide vaccine comprising class I (ESO-1:157-165 [165V]) and class II (ESO-1:161-180) peptides subcutaneously once every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Group 2 (HLA-A*201 positive and HLA-DPB1*04 negative):Patients receive ESO-1 peptide vaccine as in group I comprising class I peptide only. - Group 3 (HLA-A*201 negative and HLA-DPB1*04 positive):Patients receive ESO-1 peptide vaccine as in group I comprising class II peptide only. Patients who develop disease progression discontinue vaccinations and receive high-dose interleukin (IL-2) IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for up to 4 days (maximum of 12 doses). Treatment with IL-2 repeats every 10-14 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression (after at least 2 courses) or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have stable disease or a mixed or partial response to vaccination or IL-2 therapy may be eligible for additional vaccine therapy. Patients who have a complete response to vaccine therapy are eligible for 1 additional treatment. Patients are followed at 3 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45-90 patients (15-30 per treatment group) will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
