	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antiemetic drugs may help to reduce or prevent nausea and vomiting in patients being treated with chemotherapy. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing how well different antiemetic drugs work in preventing delayed nausea after chemotherapy in patients who have cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Antiemetic Drugs in Preventing Delayed Nausea After Chemotherapy in Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the effectiveness of a 5 hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist antiemetic vs prochlorperazine in controlling delayed nausea after chemotherapy in patients with chemotherapy-naive cancer. - Compare the effectiveness of prochlorperazine administered on a preventive vs as needed basis in controlling delayed nausea after chemotherapy in these patients. - Compare the quality of life of patients treated with a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist antiemetic vs prochlorperazine. - Compare the quality of life of patients treated with prochlorperazine administered on a preventive vs as needed basis. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center. Patients receive their scheduled chemotherapy regimen containing doxorubicin and their scheduled oral 5 hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonist antiemetic (ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron, or dolasetron mesylate) combined with dexamethasone on day 1. Patients are then randomized to 1 of 3 antiemetic arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral prochlorperazine every 8 hours on days 2 and 3. - Arm II: Patients receive oral ondansetron every 12 hours, oral granisetron every 12 hours, or oral dolasetron mesylate either once a day or every 12 hours on days 2 and 3. - Arm III: Patients receive oral prochlorperazine as needed, up to 4 times per day, on days 2 and 3. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and on day 4. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 670 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
