	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine and vinorelbine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving capecitabine and vinorelbine together with trastuzumab may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving capecitabine and vinorelbine together with trastuzumab works in treating patients who have metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine, Vinorelbine, and Trastuzumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the overall response rate in patients with HER2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer treated with first- or second-line therapy comprising capecitabine, vinorelbine, and trastuzumab (Herceptin^®). Secondary - Determine the time to disease progression, duration of response, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14, vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1 and 8, and trastuzumab (Herceptin^®) IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
