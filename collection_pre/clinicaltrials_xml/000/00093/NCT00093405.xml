	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>17-N-Allylamino-17-Demethoxygeldanamycin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in patients with metastatic papillary or clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Secondary - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. - Correlate tumor c-met expression with response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are stratified according to histology (papillary vs clear cell). Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 60-90 minutes on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-74 patients (12-37 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 6-20 months (clear cell stratum) and 2-5 years (papillary stratum).</detailed_description>
