	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as arsenic trioxide, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Biological therapies such as etanercept may interfere with the growth of the cancer cells. Combining chemotherapy with biological therapy may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving arsenic trioxide together with etanercept and to see how well it works in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide and Etanercept in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the frequency of hematologic response in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) treated with arsenic trioxide and etanercept. - Determine the efficacy of this regimen in patients with intermediate-1 or low-risk MDS that was refractory to anti-thymocyte globulin and etanercept on protocol FHCRC-1872. - Correlate results of ex vivo and in vitro studies of phenotypic, cytogenetic, and functional disease characteristics with in vivo treatment response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine parameters that are associated with a high probability of disease response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5 of week 1 and then twice weekly on weeks 2-12 during course 1 (twice weekly on weeks 1-12 during course 2). Patients also receive etanercept subcutaneously twice weekly during weeks 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10. Treatment repeats every 12 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-18 months.</detailed_description>
