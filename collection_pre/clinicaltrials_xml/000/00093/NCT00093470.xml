	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies tipifarnib in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in remission. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. It is not yet known whether tipifarnib is more effective than observation alone in preventing the recurrence of AML.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare R115777 (tipifarnib) maintenance therapy to observation only with respect to disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in second or subsequent complete remission or in complete response (CR) following primary induction failure. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare overall survival of patients in both arms. II. To evaluate the long-term safety and toxicity of extended administration of R115777 in AML patients in remission. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients receive tipifarnib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM B: Patients undergo observation only. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.</detailed_description>
