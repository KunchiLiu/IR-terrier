	<brief_summary>PURPOSE: This trial is designed to compare the combination of the investigational oral cytotoxic drug, satraplatin, and radiation therapy for patients with locally advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with no prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy treatment. Please refer to the Eligibility Criteria below for key inclusion and exclusion criteria. WHAT IS SATRAPLATIN: Satraplatin is an oral, investigational anticancer drug that is a member of the platinum-based class of chemotherapy drugs. Platinum-based drugs have been clinically proven to be one of the most effective classes of anticancer therapies. Unlike the currently marketed platinum-based drugs, satraplatin can be given orally. RATIONALE: Intravenously administered platinum-based drugs are currently used in combination with radiation therapy in the treatment of patients with locally advanced NSCLC. The purpose of this Phase I trial is to determine a tolerable dose and schedule for the oral platinum drug (satraplatin) when given to NSCLC patients throughout the course of their radiotherapy treatment.</brief_summary>
