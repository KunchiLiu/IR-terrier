	<brief_title>Optimizing the Effectiveness of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) in Treatment-Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some people with depression do not respond well to antidepressant treatment. S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) is a naturally occurring compound that may have antidepressant effects. SAMe may also enhance the effectiveness of other antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This study will determine the effectiveness of oral SAMe in enhancing the effects of SSRIs in patients currently not responding to SSRI treatment. This study will last 6 weeks. No follow-up visits will occur. Participants will be randomly assigned to add either oral SAMe or placebo to their existing SSRI regimen for 6 weeks. Depression scales and self-report questionnaires regarding depressive symptoms will be used to assess participants at the end of the study.</detailed_description>
