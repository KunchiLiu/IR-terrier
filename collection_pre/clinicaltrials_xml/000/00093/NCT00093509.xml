	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Hyperthermia therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above body temperature. Using MRI to measure heat may help to determine the effectiveness of hyperthermia therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining hyperthermia with radiation therapy and chemotherapy before surgery may kill more tumor cells and shrink the tumor so that it can be removed. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of hyperthermia when given together with radiation therapy and optional chemotherapy and to see how well they work in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for soft tissue sarcoma of the limbs.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the feasibility and accuracy of real time magnetic resonance-based non-invasive thermometry in patients with grade 2 or 3 soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity receiving combination hyperthermia, radiotherapy, surgery, and optional high-dose ifosfamide and doxorubicin. Secondary - Determine the local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine acute and late toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Correlate measurements of tumor physiology, defined by gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and tumor oxygenation, with clinical and/or pathological response and/or metastatic potential in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients may receive high-dose ifosfamide IV continuously over 6 days (144 hours). Beginning 3 weeks after the completion of ifosfamide, patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks. Beginning 1 hour after radiotherapy, patients also undergo hyperthermia (with heat measured by conventional and magnetic resonance-based thermometry) over 1-2 hours once weekly for 5 weeks. Approximately 4 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy and hyperthermia, patients undergo surgery. Approximately 1 month after surgery, patients may then receive high-dose doxorubicin IV once every 4 weeks for 4 courses. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-6 years.</detailed_description>
