	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the safety of clevidipine in the treatment of postoperative hypertension. Approximately 250-500 patients with postoperative hypertension after undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) or minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) surgery and/or valve replacement/repair procedures were anticipated to be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: clevidipine or nicardipine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective was to establish the safety of clevidipine in the treatment of postoperative hypertension, as assessed by comparing the incidences of death, stroke, MI and renal dysfunction in the clevidipine and nicardipine treatment groups from the initiation of study drug infusion through postoperative Day 30. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of study drug, assessed by the blood pressure (BP) lowering effect, and additional safety variables.</detailed_description>
