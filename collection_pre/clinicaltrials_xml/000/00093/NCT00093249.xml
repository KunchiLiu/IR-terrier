	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of clevidipine injection versus placebo in treating preoperative hypertension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Clevidipine Assessing Its Preoperative Antihypertensive Effect in Cardiac Surgery (ESCAPE-1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initiation of study drug infusion will commence with the occurrence of protocol-defined preoperative hypertension (SBP &gt; 160 mmHg) as measured via an indwelling arterial line. The study drug (clevidipine or placebo) may be administered to treat hypertension until one hour has elapsed, or until induction of anesthesia, whichever occurs first. The primary endpoint of bailout described (as defined per protocol) as bailout for lack of efficacy, bailout for safety reason or bailout due to treatment failure will be determined during the 30-minute period from study drug initiation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Prerandomization Provide written informed consent before initiation of any studyrelated procedures. Be at least 18 years of age Be scheduled for cardiac surgery (including Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting [CABG], Off Pump Coronary Artery Bypass [OPCAB], Minimally Invasive Direct Coronary Artery Bypass [MIDCAB] surgery, and/or valve replacement/repair procedures) Have a recent history (within 6 months of randomization) of hypertension requiring treatment with antihypertensive medication(s) or be actively hypertensive upon admission Prerandomization Women of childbearing potential (unless they have a negative pregnancy test) Recent cerebrovascular accident (within 3 months before randomization) Known intolerance to calcium channel blockers Allergy to soybean oil or egg lecithin (components of the lipid vehicle) Preexisting left bundle branch block or permanent ventricular pacing Any other disease or condition, which, in the judgment of the investigator would place a patient at undue risk by being enrolled in the trial. Participation in another therapeutic drug or therapeutic device trial within 30 days of starting study Postrandomization After the insertion of an arterial line, the patient is determined to meet the per protocol preoperative definition of hypertension, i.e. systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; 160 mmHg It is the investigator's intent to lower the patient's SBP by a minimum of 15% from its baseline value</criteria>
