	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy of of clevidipine versus placebo in treating postoperative hypertension. Approximately 100 patients with postoperative hypertension undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) or minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) surgery and/or valve replacement/repair procedures were anticipated to be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: clevidipine or placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Clevidipine Assessing Its Postoperative Antihypertensive Effect in Cardiac Surgery (ESCAPE-2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of clevidipine versus placebo in treating postoperative hypertension by comparing the incidence of bailout in the clevidipine and placebo treatment groups during the 30-minute time period from initiation of study drug. Secondary objectives included assessments of efficacy through measuring time to target blood pressure (BP) lowering effect defined as 15% reduction in SBP, change in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the incidence of bailout by causality. Assessments for safety included change in heart rate (HR) from baseline.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Prerandomization Provide written informed consent before initiation of any studyrelated procedures. Be at least 18 years of age Be scheduled for cardiac surgery (including Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting [CABG], Off Pump Coronary Artery Bypass [OPCAB], Minimally Invasive Direct Coronary Artery Bypass [MIDCAB] surgery, and/or valve replacement/repair procedures) Prerandomization Women of childbearing potential (unless they have a negative pregnancy test) Recent cerebrovascular accident (within 3 months before randomization) Known intolerance to calcium channel blockers Allergy to soybean oil or egg lecithin (components of the lipid vehicle) Preexisting left bundle branch block or permanent ventricular pacing Any other disease or condition, which, in the judgment of the investigator would place a patient at undue risk by being enrolled in the trial. Participation in another therapeutic drug or therapeutic device trial within 30 days of starting study Postrandomization Expected to survive beyond 24 hours postsurgical procedure No surgical complications or conditions, present or anticipated, that preclude them from inclusion in a double blind, placebocontrolled study Determined to be hypertensive (SBP &gt; 140 mm Hg) within 4 hours of arrival in a postoperative setting It is the investigator's intent to lower the patient's SBP by a minimum of 15% from its baseline value</criteria>
