	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining fluorouracil and cisplatin with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving fluorouracil and cisplatin together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage II, stage III, or stage IV nasopharyngeal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorouracil, Cisplatin, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage II, Stage III, or Stage IV Nasopharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine progression-free survival of patients with previously untreated stage IIB-IVB nasopharyngeal cancer treated with fluorouracil, cisplatin, and radiotherapy. Secondary - Determine overall survival and response rate in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine compliance to this regimen in these patients. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-5 and cisplatin IV continuously on days 6-7. Beginning 2-3 days after the completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. With 2-3 days between each course, patients receive a second course of chemotherapy, undergo a second course of radiotherapy, and then receive a third course of chemotherapy. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
