	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging measurements the change in the total volume of brain parenchyma as well as its gray and white matter, T2 and enhanced T1 lesion volume, and the magnetization transfer ratio histogram parameters, and correlate these measurements with clinical measures of disability in patients with multiple sclerosis. II. Measure the quantity of whole brain N-acetylaspartate in patients with multiple sclerosis and compare these values to those from age matched controls. III. Determine the correlation between specific neuropsychological tests which assess global cognitive functioning and the quantitative measurements taken in these patients in this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Study of Quantitative Imaging and Spectroscopy in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy with standard gadolinium contrast followed by neuropsychological testing every 6 months for 5 years. An equal number of age and sex matched healthy patients act as a control group and undergo magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy without standard gadolinium contrast every 6 months for 5 years.</detailed_description>
