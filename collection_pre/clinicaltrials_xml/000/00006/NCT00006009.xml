	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have advanced or recurrent lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and tolerability of monoclonal antibody HuM291 in patients with advanced or recurrent CD3+ T-cell lymphomas. - Evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this treatment regimen in this patient population. - Determine the response in these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody HuM291 IV over 3 hours on days 1-4 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a partial response, complete response with recurrence, or stable disease may receive further therapy. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody HuM291 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed weekly for 1 month and then monthly for 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-15 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
