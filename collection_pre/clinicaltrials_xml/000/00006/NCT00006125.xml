	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining doxorubicin and topotecan in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory intermediate-grade or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Intermediate-Grade or High-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate and time to progression in patients with relapsed or refractory intermediate or high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with doxorubicin and topotecan. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 5-10 minutes on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 3-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and annually for the next 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed recurrent or refractory nonHodgkin's lymphoma of one of the following subtypes: Follicular center lymphoma, grade 3 Diffuse large Bcell lymphoma Diffuse large Bcell lymphoma, primary mediastinal Bcell lymphoma Burkitt's lymphoma High grade Bcell lymphoma, Burkittlike Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, CD30+ cell type Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, Tcell type Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, nullcell type Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's like Bidimensionally measurable disease NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
