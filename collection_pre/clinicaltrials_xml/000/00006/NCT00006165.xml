	<brief_summary>The Native Hawaiian Diabetes Intervention Program is a project focused on determining whether a cultural-based, healthy lifestyles program with family support will have a positive effect on lifestyle behaviors and psychosocial and clinical outcomes. A culturally sensitive, lifestyle intervention program was administered via community peer educators to a population of Native Hawaiians with or at risk for diabetes. The effect of this intervention program on selected outcomes is being compared to a ''standard'' program given to a similar population in a second Native Hawaiian community.</brief_summary>
