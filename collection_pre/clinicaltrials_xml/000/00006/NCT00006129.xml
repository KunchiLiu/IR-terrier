	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether testosterone normalization ameliorates muscle protein hypercatabolism by increasing net protein synthesis in men with burn injury. II. Determine whether the effectiveness of testosterone is enhanced by stimulation of inward amino acid transport as a consequence of hyperaminoacidemia in these men. III. Determine whether testosterone normalization during hospitalization minimizes the need for rehabilitation by increasing net protein synthesis and preserving skeletal muscle in these men. IV. Determine whether testosterone normalization after hospital discharge and throughout convalescence increases muscle strength and lean body mass after burn injury by increasing net protein synthesis. V. Determine whether testosterone combined with progressive resistance exercise during convalescence confers added benefits on muscle protein synthesis, and in turn, lean body mass and muscle strength in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study of Testosterone and Progressive Resistance Exercise in Men With Burn Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to percent of total body surface area (TBSA) burned (no more than 40% vs more than 40%). Patients receive standard inpatient burn care. During hospitalization, patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive testosterone intramuscularly (IM) weekly for 2-3 weeks during hospitalization. Arm II: Patients receive standard care only during hospitalization. After hospital discharge, patients with burns covering no more than 40% of TBSA are randomized to arm III, IV, or V, whereas patients with burns covering more than 40% of TBSA are randomized to arm III or V. Arm III: Patients receive testosterone IM every 2 weeks for 2 months. Arm IV: Patients receive testosterone as in arm III. Patients perform progressive resistance (weight lifting) exercises 3 times a week for 2 months concurrently with testosterone therapy. Arm V.: Patients receive standard convalescence care only.</detailed_description>
