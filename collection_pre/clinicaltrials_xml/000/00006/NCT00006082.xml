	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin in treating patients who have advanced small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitrocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Advanced Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response and duration of objective response in patients with advanced small cell lung cancer treated with nitrocamptothecin. - Determine the probability of objective response as expressed by the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicities of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease status (sensitive vs refractory). Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily for 5 consecutive days each week for 3 weeks. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve stable disease (SD) receive up to 4 additional courses past SD. Patients who achieve partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) receive a minimum of 2 additional courses past CR or PR. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression or initiation of another antitumor treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for the sensitive disease stratum and a total of 19-24 patients will be accrued for the refractory disease stratum</detailed_description>
