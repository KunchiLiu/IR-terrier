	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Celecoxib may be effective in preventing the further development of cancer. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining trastuzumab with celecoxib may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining celecoxib and trastuzumab in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous trastuzumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib and Trastuzumab in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of celecoxib and trastuzumab (Herceptin) in women with HER2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that is refractory to prior trastuzumab. - Determine the safety of celecoxib in these patients. OUTLINE: At least 3 weeks after the last dose of prior chemotherapy, patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily. Patients continue or restart trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes weekly or every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 9 months.</detailed_description>
