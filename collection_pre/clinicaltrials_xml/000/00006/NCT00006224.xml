	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine in treating patients who have persistent or recurrent cancer of the cervix.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Cancer of the Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of gemcitabine in patients with persistent or recurrent nonsquamous cell carcinoma of the cervix who failed higher priority treatment protocols. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes weekly for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
