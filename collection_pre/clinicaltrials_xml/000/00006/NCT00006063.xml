	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of enteric coated pancrelipase with bicarbonate (PANCRECARB) capsules versus the patient's usual enteric coated pancreatic enzyme without bicarbonate in decreasing fecal fat and nitrogen losses in patients with cystic fibrosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study of Pancrelipase With Bicarbonate (PANCRECARB) Capsules in Reducing Steatorrhea in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. In the first treatment period, patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive enteric coated pancrelipase with bicarbonate (PANCRECARB) capsules before meals and snacks for 7 consecutive days. Arm II: Patients receive their usual enteric coated pancreatic enzyme without bicarbonate capsule before meals and snacks for 7 consecutive days. Patients receive approximately 50% of their usual lipase dose during treatment. Food intake is recorded on days 1-3, food intake is weighed and recorded on days 4-7, and stools are collected over 72 hours on days 5-7 to determine fecal fat and nitrogen excretion. Anthropometric measurements including height, weight, and skinfolds are assessed. In the second treatment period, patients are switched to the alternate treatment arm after a 3 day washout period. Patients receive the opposing treatment as per protocol.</detailed_description>
