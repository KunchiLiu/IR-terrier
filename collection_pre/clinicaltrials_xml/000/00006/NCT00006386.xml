	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy followed by carmustine in treating patients who have supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Followed by Carmustine in Treating Patients Who Have Supratentorial Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall and progression-free survival in patients with supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme treated with accelerated radiotherapy and conformal stereotactic radiotherapy boost followed by carmustine. - Determine the short and long-term toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive daily accelerated radiotherapy 5 days a week on weeks 1-2. On weeks 3-6, patients receive accelerated radiotherapy 4 days a week (3 days a week on week 6) and conformal stereotactic radiotherapy boost once weekly. Patients then receive carmustine IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3 every 8 weeks for 6 courses beginning within 1 month after the completion of radiotherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 76 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months.</detailed_description>
