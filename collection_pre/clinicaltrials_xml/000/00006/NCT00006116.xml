	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining cisplatin with gemcitabine in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine in terms of response rate and progression free survival in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer. II. Evaluate this treatment regimen in terms of toxicity and quality of life in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV over 1 hour every 2 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with no disease progression following 6 courses of therapy receive an additional 6 courses of therapy. Quality of life is assessed prior to each course and then every 3 months. Patients are followed every 3 months until death. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37-83 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
