	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody MN-14 in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer. - Determine the dosimetric and pharmacokinetic properties of this treatment regimen in the blood, normal organs, and tumors of these patients. - Determine the stability and complexation with circulating carcinoembryonic antigen of this radioantibody in the plasma of these patients. - Determine the antibody response of these patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the antitumor effects of this treatment regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody MN-14 (90Y-hMN-14). Patients are stratified according to prior radiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients undergo pretherapy imaging with indium In 111 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody MN-14 IV over 30-40 minutes on day -7 or -6 followed by external scintigraphy on days -7 or -6 to 0. Patients who show positive localization of at least one documented tumor site receive 90Y-hMN-14 IV over 30-40 minutes on day 0. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 90Y-hMN-14 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks; every 3 months for 2 years; and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-14 months.</detailed_description>
