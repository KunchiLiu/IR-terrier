	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Bevacizumab may stop the growth of colorectal cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in treating patients who have advanced colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the progression-free survival at 7 months of patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, irinotecan, and bevacizumab. II. Determine the response rate and overall survival of this patient population treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV, and fluorouracil IV once weekly for 4 weeks. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes once every 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
