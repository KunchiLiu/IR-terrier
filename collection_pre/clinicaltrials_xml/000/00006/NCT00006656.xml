	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carmustine in treating patients who have progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carmustine in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intratumoral carmustine in ethanol (DTI-015) in patients with unresectable recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. (Phase I of this study closed to accrual as of 01/15/2002.) - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Assess the activity of this regimen in these patients. - Estimate peripheral blood carmustine levels in these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive carmustine in ethanol (DTI-015) intratumorally over 5 minutes during stereotactic biopsy or open craniotomy. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of DTI-015 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. (Phase I of this study closed to accrual as of 01/15/2002.) Additional patients then receive treatment with DTI-015 at the recommended phase II dose. Patients are followed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and then every 1-3 months until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients were accrued for phase I of this study and approximately 14-18 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study. (Phase I of this study closed to accrual as of 01/15/2002.)</detailed_description>
