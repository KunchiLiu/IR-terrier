	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-188797 and carboplatin in treating patients who have advanced nonhematologic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-188797 and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Advanced Nonhematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the recommended phase II dose based on the maximum tolerated dose of BMS-188797 when administered with carboplatin in patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies. - Assess the dose limiting toxicities and safety of this treatment regimen in these patients. - Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in these patients. - Determine any antitumor activity of this treatment regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of BMS-188797. Patients receive BMS-188797 IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-188797 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed for 4 weeks, and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.</detailed_description>
