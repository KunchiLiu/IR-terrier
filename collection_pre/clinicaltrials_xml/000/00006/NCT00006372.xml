	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of gemcitabine, doxorubicin HCl liposome, and vinorelbine in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1-2.5 hours on day 1, gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin HCl liposome, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
