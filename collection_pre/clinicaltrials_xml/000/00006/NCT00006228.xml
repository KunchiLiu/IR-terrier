	<brief_summary>Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill breast cancer cells. Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab plus interleukin-2 in treating patients who have metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous trastuzumab therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab and Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the response rate and toxicity to low-dose IL-2 with intermediate-"pulse" dose interleukin 2 (IL-2) and trastuzumab in patients with uni-dimensional measurable metastatic breast cancer and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive (3+ overexpression by immunohistochemistry [IHC] method or positive by fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH]) who either have had evidence of progressive disease while receiving a trastuzumab-containing regimen, or have had progressive disease within 12 months of receiving a trastuzumab-containing regimen. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To perform correlative immunologic assays to determine the degree of natural killer (NK) cell expansion in response to low-dose IL-2, and the effectiveness of patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in a standard antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay directed against a HER2 target cell. II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab using an every 2-week schedule. III. To determine Fc-gamma receptor polymorphisms from study patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive trastuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) on days 2-7 and 9-21. Beginning on day 22, patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes every 14 days. Patients also receive aldesleukin SC daily on days 1-14. Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
