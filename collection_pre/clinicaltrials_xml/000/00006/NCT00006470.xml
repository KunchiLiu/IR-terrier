	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining these two treatments may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining vaccine therapy with radiation therapy in treating patients who have stage II or stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer that has been completely removed in surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Been Completely Removed in Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the humoral and T-cell response to adjuvant monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine and monoclonal antibody 3H1 anti-idiotype vaccine with radiotherapy in patients with completely resected stage II or IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine and monoclonal antibody 3H1 anti-idiotype vaccine intracutaneously in separate sites once weekly for 3 weeks beginning 2-7 weeks (no later than 49 days) after surgery and then subcutaneously once monthly for 2 years regardless of disease progression. Beginning no more than 1 week after the third postoperative vaccination, all patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks. Patients with extracapsular nodal metastases or T3 lesions also undergo 6 additional radiotherapy boosts. Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
