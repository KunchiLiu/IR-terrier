	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have myelofibrosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Followed by Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the ability of myeloablative chemotherapy followed by peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation to restore effective marrow hematopoieses in patients with advanced idiopathic myelofibrosis or myelofibrosis secondary to other myeloproliferative disorders. II. Determine the ability of this regimen to palliate symptoms and prolong survival in these patients. III. Determine if there is evidence of clonal hematopoieses before PBSC mobilization, in the PBSC product, and after transplantation in these patients. IV. Correlate the properties of the peripheral blood before mobilization and the PBSC product with engraftment in these patients. V. Correlate the markers of angiogenesis with clinical parameters in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients with evidence of leukemic progression receive cytoreduction therapy consisting of idarubicin IV on days 1-3 and cytarabine IV continuously over days 1-7 followed by filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily until blood counts recover and leukapheresis is completed. Patients undergo leukapheresis beginning when blood counts recover and continuing until the target number of cells are collected. Patients with no evidence of leukemic progression receive filgrastim SC daily until leukapheresis is completed. Patients undergo leukapheresis beginning on day 4 and continuing until the target number of cells are collected. Patients receive myeloablative therapy consisting of oral busulfan every six hours on days -5 to -2. Patients with leukemic progression begin myeloablative therapy at least 28 days after completion of chemotherapy. Patients receive autologous peripheral blood stem cells IV on day 0. Patients are followed at 1 month, 3 months, 1 year, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
