	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of cancer cells. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight cancer by blocking the uptake of estrogen by the tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying fulvestrant to see how well it works in treating patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fulvestrant in Treating Patients With Recurrent, Persistent, or Metastatic Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the probability of clinical response in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive vs ER-negative patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic endometrial cancer treated with fulvestrant. - Compare the relationship between response rate and intensity of receptor expression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the frequency and intensity of toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
