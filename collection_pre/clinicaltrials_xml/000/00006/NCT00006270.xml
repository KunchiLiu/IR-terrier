	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the randomness of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol secretion using approximate entropy in patients who have sustained a head injury. II. Determine the correlation between randomness of ACTH and cortisol secretion and stages of sleep in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Approximate Entropy of Adrenocorticotropic Hormone and Cortisol Secretion in Patients With Head Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of injury (closed head injury due to trauma vs vascular accidents). Patients are admitted two times for overnight assessment. Admission 1: Patients receive cosyntropin IV. Blood is drawn at 30 and 60 minutes after IV infusion. Patients receive oral metyrapone before sleep. A sham sleep study is conducted through the night and patients' blood is drawn in the morning. Admission 2: At least 2 weeks after admission 1, patients return for an overnight admission. Starting in the evening, blood is drawn every 15 minutes for 12 hours. A sleep study is conducted through the night.</detailed_description>
