	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. Donor lymphocytes may attack and destroy cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, peripheral stem cell transplantation, and donor lymphocyte infusion in treating women with stage IV breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Transplantation Using Mini-Conditioning for Treatment of Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the tumor response in women with stage IV breast cancer who achieve partial remission after a mini-conditioning regimen comprising fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). II. Determine the progression free survival in patients who achieve complete remission after this treatment regimen. III. Determine whether DLI exerts graft versus tumor effect in these patients. IV. Determine the acute and delayed toxicities of this regimen in these patients. V. Determine the rates of durable hematologic engraftment in patients treated with this regimen. VI. Determine the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft versus host disease in patients treated with this regimen. VII. Determine the extent of chimerism in patients treated with this nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen. VIII. Determine the rate and quality of immune reconstitution in patients treated with this regimen. IX. Determine the event free and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive salvage chemotherapy comprised of docetaxel IV over 1 hour and doxorubicin IV over several minutes on day 1. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning within 4-10 weeks after completion of salvage chemotherapy, patients achieving complete or partial remission or stable disease receive mini-conditioning comprised of fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -8 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2. Patients then receive filgrastim (G-CSF) and sargramostim (GM-CSF) mobilized allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) IV on day 0. Beginning on day 120 after PBSC transplantation, eligible patients receive unmobilized donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) over 15-30 minutes. Treatment continues monthly for a total of 3 DLIs in the absence of grade III or IV graft versus host disease or marrow aplasia. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
