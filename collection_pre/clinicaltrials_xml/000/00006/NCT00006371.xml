	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs such as aminoglutethimide or ketoconazole may stop the adrenal glands from producing hormones. Combining hydrocortisone with either aminoglutethimide or ketoconazole may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining hydrocortisone with either aminoglutethimide or ketoconazole in treating patients who have localized stage IV prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial of Early Medical Adrenalectomy for "D0.5" Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) response proportion and duration of response of patients with localized stage IV (D0.5) adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with early medical adrenalectomy using hydrocortisone combined with aminoglutethimide or ketoconazole after prior antiandrogen withdrawal. II. Compare the incidence of grades 3-4 toxicities of these regimens in these patients. III. Correlate adrenal androgen suppression with response in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior antiandrogen therapy (yes vs no). Patients with prior antiandrogen therapy begin study therapy after appropriate antiandrogen withdrawal, while those without such prior therapy begin study therapy immediately. Patients undergo medical adrenalectomy using hydrocortisone combined with aminoglutethimide OR ketoconazole. Oral hydrocortisone is administered twice daily. Oral aminoglutethimide is administered twice daily for 1 week and then 4 times daily during subsequent weeks. Oral ketoconazole is administered three times daily. Combination treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
