	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. Donor white blood cells that are treated in the laboratory with Epstein-Barr virus may be effective treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T cells in treating patients who have progressive, relapsed, or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Epstein Barr Virus-Specific Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes in Treating Patients With Progressive, Relapsed, or Refractory Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity of allogeneic Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (EBV CTL) in patients with progressive, relapsed, or refractory EBV-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Detect alterations in the anti-EBV cellular immunity of patients treated with EBV CTL. OUTLINE: Donors undergo leukapheresis. Epstein Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (EBV CTL) are cultured in vitro. Patients receive an infusion of EBV CTL over 10 minutes on day 0. The EBV CTL infusion is preceded by 3 doses of fludarabine. Patients then receive interleukin-2 injections for 12 days after the EBV CTL infusion. Patients are followed weekly for 1.5 months, twice a month for 1.5 months, and then monthly for 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
