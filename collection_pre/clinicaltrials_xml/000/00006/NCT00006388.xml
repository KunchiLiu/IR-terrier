	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs such as tamoxifen may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining radiation therapy with tamoxifen in treating patients who have newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy and Tamoxifen in Treating Adults With Newly Diagnosed Supratentorial Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether high-dose tamoxifen initiated at the beginning of conventional radiotherapy improves the median survival time of adults with newly diagnosed, supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme. II. Determine the feasibility and toxicity of high-dose tamoxifen in these patients. III. Determine the overall survival with respect to protein kinase C lab correlates in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Beginning within 5 weeks after surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy to the brain 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients receive high-dose oral tamoxifen every 6 hours beginning on day 1 of radiotherapy and continuing in the absence of disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months through year 1, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.</detailed_description>
