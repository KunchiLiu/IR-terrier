	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of PS-341 in treating patients who have advanced cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PS-341 in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of PS-341 in patients with advanced malignancies. - Determine, in a preliminary manner, the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. - Regimen A: Patients receive PS-341 IV twice weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PS-341 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1 of 3-4 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Regimen B: Once the MTD has been determined in regimen A, patients receive PS-341 IV twice weekly for 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 78 patients will be accrued for this study within 14 months.</detailed_description>
