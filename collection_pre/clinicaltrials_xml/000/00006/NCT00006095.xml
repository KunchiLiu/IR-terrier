	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vincristine plus irinotecan in treating children who have solid tumors that have not responded to previous therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of vincristine when administered in combination with irinotecan in children with refractory solid tumors. - Determine the safe and tolerable phase II dose of this combination regimen in this patient population. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this combination regimen in these patients. - Determine the incidence and severity of other toxicities of this combination regimen in these patients. - Determine preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of this combination regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vincristine. Patients receive vincristine IV on day 2 of the first course (day 1 of subsequent courses) and days 8, 15, 22, and 29, and irinotecan IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 22-26. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responsive or stable disease receive additional courses of therapy for a maximum of 1 year. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of vincristine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-12 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
