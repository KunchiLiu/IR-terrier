	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining phenylbutyrate, dexamethasone, and sargramostim in treating patients who have refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phenylbutyrate, Dexamethasone, and Sargramostim in Treating Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response (complete hematologic remission induction) of phenylbutyrate, dexamethasone, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with refractory or relapsed t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia. - Determine the correlation between histone acetylation, differentiation, and apoptosis in bone marrow mononuclear cells with response rate in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the overall survival of patients on this regimen. - Determine the correlation between histone acetylation, differentiation, and apoptosis in bone marrow mononuclear cells with pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive phenylbutyrate IV continuously and sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days 1-7 and 15-21. Patients also receive oral dexamethasone on days 1-4 and 15-18. Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity until complete hematologic remission is induced. Patients with stable disease at the end of 1 course receive at least 2 additional courses. Patients are followed twice a week for 3 months, monthly for 1 year, every three months for the next 4 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study in at least 2 years.</detailed_description>
