	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who have metastatic germ cell tumors that have not responded to cisplatin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Metastatic Germ Cell Tumors That Have Not Responded to Cisplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of temozolomide in patients with cisplatin refractory metastatic germ cell tumors. II. Determine the safety of this treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study over 25 months.</detailed_description>
