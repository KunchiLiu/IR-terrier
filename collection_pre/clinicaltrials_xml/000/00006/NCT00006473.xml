	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate to oxaliplatin in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine the treatment-related toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histologic subtype (indolent vs aggressive). Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 72 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years.</detailed_description>
