	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill kidney cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase IV trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 in treating patients who have metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall response rate, complete and partial response rates, and duration of response in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with low-dose interleukin-2. - Determine the overall survival, one-year progression-free survival, and two-year progression-free survival in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the incidence of adverse events in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive low-dose interleukin-2 subcutaneously 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Courses repeat every 9 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 464 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
