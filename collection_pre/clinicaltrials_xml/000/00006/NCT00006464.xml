	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of UCN-01 and cisplatin in treating patients who have advanced or metastatic solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>UCN-01 and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of cisplatin when administered with UCN-01 in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Assess the toxicity and potential antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study of cisplatin. Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and UCN-01 IV continuously over 36-72 hours beginning on day 2. Treatment continues every 4 weeks for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of cisplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 2-3 months for at least 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
