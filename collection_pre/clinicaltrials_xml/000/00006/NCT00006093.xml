	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: EMD 121974 may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of EMD 121974 in treating patients who have progressive or recurrent malignant glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EMD 121974 in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of EMD 121974 in patients with progressive or recurrent malignant glioma. - Determine the 6-month progression-free survival, clinical response rate, duration of progression-free survival, and overall survival in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the effects of this drug on tumor perfusion, measured with magnetic resonance perfusion scan, and markers for angiogenesis in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive EMD 121974 IV over 1 hour twice weekly. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 6-12 patients receive escalating doses of EMD 121974 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which more than 2 of 6 or 4 of 12 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed every 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 6 patients will be accrued for phase I of this study within 2-3 months. A total of 23-38 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study within 5-10 months.</detailed_description>
