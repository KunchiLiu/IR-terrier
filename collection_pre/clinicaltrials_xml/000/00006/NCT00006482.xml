	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine and cisplatin in treating patients who have refractory or recurrent cancer of the cervix.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Refractory or Recurrent Cancer of the Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with refractory or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cisplatin IV and gemcitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-69 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
