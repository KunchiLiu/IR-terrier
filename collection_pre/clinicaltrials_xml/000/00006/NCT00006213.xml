	<brief_summary>Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-214662 in treating patients who have acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-214662 in Treating Patients With Acute Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, or Chronic Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of BMS-214662 in patients with acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase. II. Determine any preliminary evidence of antileukemia activity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive BMS-214662 IV over 1 hour weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues every 4 weeks for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-214662 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 10 months.</detailed_description>
