	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of CC-1088 in treating patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has not responded to previous therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity of CC-1088 in patients with refractory, progressive, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. II. Determine the response rate to this treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral CC-1088 three times a day for 28 days. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
