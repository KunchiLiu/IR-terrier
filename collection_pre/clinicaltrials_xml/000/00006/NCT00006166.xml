	<brief_summary>The NASTRA Clinical Trial is a multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial designed to determine if treatment with transjugular intrahepatic portasystemic shunts (TIPS) is superior to high volume paracentesis (total paracentesis, TP) for the treatment of refractory ascites due to cirrhosis. Only patients with clinically tense symptomatic ascites (shortness of breath, umbilical hernia, abdominal pain and/or distension, and/or limitation of activity) who have either diuretic-resistant ascites or diuretic-intractable ascites are being studied.</brief_summary>
