	<brief_summary>There are no guidelines for appropriate nutritional management of weight loss or wasting in HIV infection. Some treatments may increase weight, but without improving muscle mass or quality of life. In this clinical trial AIDS patients with wasting are randomized to one of three nutritional strategies and studied over a 12-week period: 1) optimal oral nutrition with counseling and protein and calorie supplementation, and a placebo pill; 2) optimal oral nutrition with the oral androgen, oxandrolone at 20 mg daily; and 3) optimal oral nutrition with progressive resistance training (PRT). In all participants, dietary intervention is maximized by weekly personalized counseling to address individual issues and concerns. Two primary outcomes are assessed: thigh muscle mass and quality of life. Our findings can be used to develop guidelines for standards of nutritional care among AIDS patient with the wasting syndrome.</brief_summary>
