	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND: A number of important scientific advances can be made through the study of blood, bone marrow, tumor, or other tissue samples from patients with HIV infection, infection with Kaposi s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV), infection with other oncogenic viruses, or cancer. This protocol provides a mechanism to effect a variety of such studies. OBJECTIVES: Acquisition of serum, circulating cells, bone marrow, and tumor or normal tissue samples from patients with HIV infection, KSHV infection, or with cancer. ELIGIBILITY: Eligibility criteria include age 18 years or older and at lest one of the following: Exposure risk to HIV, KSHV, or HPV; HIV seropositive; KSHV seropositive; EBV seropositive; HTLV-1 seropositive; malignancy, Castleman s disease, or skin lesions with appearance of Kaposi s sarcoma; or cervical or anal intraepithelial lesion. DESIGN: Blood samples may be collected at the initial visit, and at follow-up visits. Tumor samples may be obtained by fine needle aspirate, by removal of pleural or peritoneal fluid, by skin punch biopsy, or by excisional biopsy, providing the tumor is accessible with minimal risk to the patients. Specific risks will be described in a separate consent to be obtained at the time of the biopsy. Samples will be studied in the HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch, CCR, NCI; laboratories in NCI-Frederick; or those of collaborating investigators.</brief_summary>

At least one of the following: Exposure risk to HIV, KSHV, or HPV; HIV seropositive; KSHV seropositive; EBV seropositive; HTLV1 seropositive; Malignancy, Castleman's disease, or skin lesions with appearance of Kaposi's sarcoma; Cervical or anal intraepithelial lesion; Clinical condition reported or hypothesized to be associated with xenotropic murine leukemia virusrelted virus (XMRV) Patients not requiring biopsy for a medical indication can be included on the study solely for the purpose of obtaining research samples, including blood, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, or biopsy samples providing the biopsy or aspiration procedure is of low risk: such procedure include fine needle aspirates, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, or excisional biopsy. Such biopsies can be completely separate from any other protocol or evaluation process. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Inability to provide informed consent.</criteria>
