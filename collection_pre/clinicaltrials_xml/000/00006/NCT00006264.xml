	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Antiviral drugs such as zidovudine and ganciclovir act against viruses and may be an effective treatment for HIV. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill lymphoma cells. Combining these treatments may be effective in treating AIDS-related primary central nervous system lymphoma. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining zidovudine, ganciclovir, and interleukin-2 in treating patients who have AIDS-related primary central nervous system lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zidovudine Plus Interleukin-2 and Ganciclovir in Treating Patients With AIDS-Related Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and toxicity of zidovudine, interleukin-2, and ganciclovir in patients with AIDS related primary central nervous system lymphoma. - Determine the response rate and overall survival of these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. - Induction therapy: Patients receive zidovudine (AZT) IV and ganciclovir IV over 1 hour every 12 hours on days 1-14. Patients also receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV every 12 hours on days 1-14 and a combination antiretroviral therapy consisting of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (one of which must be AZT), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors. AZT and ganciclovir treatment continues for an additional 7 days if partial response is achieved. - Maintenance therapy: Patients receive IL-2 subcutaneously 3 times a week for 6 months. Patients also receive oral ganciclovir 3 times a day and combination antiretroviral therapy (AZT allowed, but not required). Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
