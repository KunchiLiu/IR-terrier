	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving monoclonal antibodies in different ways may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of indium In 111 monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 (In 111 MOAB Hu3S193) given intraperitoneally OR intravenously in patients with ovarian carcinoma. II. Compare the localization of In 111 MOAB Hu3S193 in ovarian cancer tissue after intraperitoneal vs intravenous injection. III. Compare the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of this drug when administered intraperitoneally vs intravenously in these patients. IV. Determine the antibody response in these patients to this drug. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms on a first come sequential basis. Arm I: Patients receive indium In 111 monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 (In 111 MOAB Hu3S193) intraperitoneally over 30 minutes. Arm II: Patients receive In 111 MOAB Hu3S193 IV over 30 minutes. Patients undergo surgical debulking 3-7 days following In 111 MOAB Hu3S193 administration, and biopsy samples are obtained to assess radioactive uptake. Immunohistochemistry is also performed. Blood samples are obtained to assess serum radioactivity. Whole body imaging is performed 3 hours after infusion of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody, on the day of surgery, and at one time point in between. Patients are followed for 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients (5 per arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
