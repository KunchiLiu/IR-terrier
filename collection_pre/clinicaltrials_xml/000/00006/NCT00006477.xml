	<brief_title>Mistletoe Lectin in Treating Patients With Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of mistletoe lectin (recombinant viscumin) in patients with advanced solid tumors who have failed standard therapy. - Determine the optimal biologically active dose of mistletoe lectin based on analysis of specific biological surrogate markers, including plasma cytokine levels and peripheral counts of activated immune cells and immunological stimulation at the RNA level of the immune cells. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. - Determine whether induction of antibodies against mistletoe lectin occurs in these patients. - Determine whether modification of endothelial parameters occurs in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the objective response rates in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive mistletoe lectin (recombinant viscumin) subcutaneously twice weekly. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of mistletoe lectin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at the highest dose level immediately preceding the MTD. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression or initiation of another therapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
