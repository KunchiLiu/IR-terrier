	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: SU5416 may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by stopping blood flow to the cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of SU5416 in treating patients who have refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SU5416 in Treating Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and response duration of patients with refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma treated with SU5416. II. Determine the toxicity of SU5416 in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
