	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients who have chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia that has not responded to previous treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide in Treating Patients With Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia That Has Not Responded to Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the rate of complete or major cytogenetic response to arsenic trioxide as demonstrated by a decrease in the percentage of Philadelphia chromosome positive (or breakpoint cluster region bcr positive) cells in the bone marrow in patients with interferon alfa refractory or intolerant chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. II. Determine the rate and duration of complete hematological response to this treatment in these patients. III. Determine the duration of complete and major cytogenetic response to this treatment in these patients. IV. Determine the pattern of clinical adverse experience and improvement in symptomatic parameters with this treatment in these patients. V. Determine the time to accelerated disease or blast crisis and overall survival in these patients after receiving this treatment. VI. Determine the effects of this treatment on cytokines, apoptosis, and angiogenesis in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide intravenous (IV) over 2 hours either daily for 15 consecutive days or 5 days on, 2 days off for a total of 15 doses. Treatment repeats every 2-5 weeks after the previous course for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete remission are followed every month for 3 months, every 2 months for 6 months, every 3-4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter. All other patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-53 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.</detailed_description>
