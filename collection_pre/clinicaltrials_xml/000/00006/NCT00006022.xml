	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Combining bryostatin 1 with interleukin-2 may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 plus bryostatin 1 in treating patients who have melanoma or kidney cancer that cannot be removed during surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 Plus Bryostatin 1 in Treating Patients With Melanoma or Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the dose of bryostatin 1 that, when administered in conjunction with low-dose interleukin-2, maximizes in vitro interleukin-2- stimulated peripheral blood stem cell proliferation in patients with melanoma or renal cell carcinoma. - Assess other intermediate markers of immune response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine tumor responses, response durations, progression-free intervals, and survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are randomized to one of three bryostatin 1 dose levels. Patients receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously daily on days 1-5 and bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on day 1 weekly for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
