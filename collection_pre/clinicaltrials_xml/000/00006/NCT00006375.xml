	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of LY293111 in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LY293111 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of LY293111 in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral LY293111 twice daily. Treatment continues for a maximum of 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of LY293111 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed at 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
