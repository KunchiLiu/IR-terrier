	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus radiation therapy in treating patients who have limited-stage small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0004: Combination Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Limited-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of tirapazamine, cisplatin, and etoposide concurrently with radiotherapy in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer. - Determine the toxicities of this treatment regimen in these patients. - Determine the response rate in these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to one of two induction therapy arms. - Arm I: Patients receive induction chemotherapy consisting of low-dose tirapazamine IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 29-33. Patients also undergo radiotherapy concurrently with chemotherapy 5 consecutive days a week for 7 weeks beginning on day 1. - Arm II: Patients receive induction chemotherapy consisting of high-dose tirapazamine, cisplatin, etoposide, and radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients with stable or responding disease then receive consolidation therapy consisting of tirapazamine IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 of weeks 11 and 14 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 of weeks 11 and 14. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
