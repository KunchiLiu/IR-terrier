	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has relapsed or has not responded to treatment with fludarabine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide in Treating Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the clinical efficacy and safety of arsenic trioxide in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that is refractory to fludarabine or in relapse. II. Determine the pattern of clinical adverse experience in these patients when treated with this regimen. III. Evaluate the effects of this drug on cytokines, apoptosis, and angiogenesis in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 2 hours on days 1-15 OR on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19. Courses repeat with 2 to 5 week intervals between courses for 10-12 courses (about 1 year) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for the second year, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
