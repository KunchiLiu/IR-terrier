	<brief_summary>This is a clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of the drug thalidomide in combination with a procedure called chemoembolization in patients with inoperable liver cancer. Chemoembolization is the process by which chemotherapy is instilled directly into the blood vessels feeding the tumor, so that the blood vessels feeding the tumor may be blocked. Chemoembolization consists of two separate procedures. It will be done by infusing chemotherapy with the drug doxorubicin through the hepatic artery into the liver and then by infusing collagen to cut off the blood supply to the tumor. A catheter will be inserted at various times to allow for these infusions. The objectives are to investigate the feasibility and potential activity of chronic administration of thalidomide in patients with unresectable hepatocellular cancer who receive chemoembolization to predominant tumor masses. The toxicity of thalidomide in these patients will be evaluated. Overall safety will also be assessed. Serum levels of angiogenic cytokines such as VEGF, bFGF, and TNF-a, that are believed to have a role in hepatocellular carcinoma, will be collected.</brief_summary>
