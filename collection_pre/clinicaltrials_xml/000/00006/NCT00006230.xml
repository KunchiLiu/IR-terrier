	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin in treating patients who have advanced ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitrocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective response rate and duration of response in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with nitrocamptothecin. - Determine the probability of objective response as expressed by the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease status (sensitive vs refractory). Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily for 5 consecutive days each week for 3 weeks. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve stable disease (SD) receive up to 4 additional courses past SD. Patients who achieve partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) receive a minimum of 2 additional courses past PR or CR. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression or the initiation of another antitumor therapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-50 patients (14-25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
