	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill melanoma cells. It is not yet known whether interferon alfa is more effective with or without combination chemotherapy and interleukin-2 for melanoma. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of interferon alfa with or without combination chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, plus interleukin-2, in treating patients who have melanoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with high-risk melanoma treated with interferon alfa vs cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine plus interferon alfa and interleukin-2. - Compare the toxic effects of these treatment regimens in these patients. - Determine the relationship between minimal residual disease (MRD) status at 12 weeks and 52 weeks and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the effects of these treatment regimens on the MRD status of these patients. - Determine the relationship between clinical characteristics (number of involved lymph nodes, ulcerated primary, and extracapsular extension) and MRD in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to nodal status (N1 or N2 vs N3), degree of lymph node involvement (micrometastases only vs any macrometastases, including satellite/in-transit metastases), and ulceration of the primary tumor (yes vs no vs unknown primary). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive interferon alfa IV on days 1-5 of weeks 1-4 followed by interferon alfa subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 3, and 5 of weeks 5-52 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30 minutes followed by vinblastine IV on days 1-4. Patients also receive dacarbazine IV over 1 hour on day 1, interleukin-2 IV over 96 hours on days 1-4, and interferon alfa SC on days 1-5, 8, 10, and 12. In addition, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SC on days 6-15. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 410 patients (205 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
