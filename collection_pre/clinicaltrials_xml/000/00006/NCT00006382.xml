	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: New imaging procedures such as spiral CT may improve the ability to detect lung cancer in patients who are at high risk for the disease. PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of a spiral CT scan with that of a chest x-ray in detecting lung cancer in patients who are at high risk for the disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lung Screening Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of screening spiral CT scan and screening chest x-ray in detecting lung cancer in current or former smokers at high risk for lung cancer. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study of lung cancer screening. Patients are randomized to one of two screening arms. Arm I: Patients undergo one spiral CT scan. Arm II: Patients undergo one chest x-ray. Patients and their primary care physicians are notified of test results within 3 weeks of the exam. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,000 participants (1,500 per screening arm) will be accrued for this study at six screening centers (500 per center) by October 31, 2000.</detailed_description>
