	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide for Induction Therapy of Adult Patients With Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the rate of clinical and hematologic response in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive recurrent or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia or previously untreated or recurrent or refractory blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia when treated with arsenic trioxide. - Determine the duration of hematologic response and overall survival of these patients when treated with this regimen. - Determine the pattern of clinical adverse experience in these patients when treated with this regimen. - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 2-3 hours daily for 28 days. Patients who respond may receive a second course of therapy beginning 28 days from the last dose of the first course. Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 2 months for 6 months, and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-49 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.</detailed_description>
