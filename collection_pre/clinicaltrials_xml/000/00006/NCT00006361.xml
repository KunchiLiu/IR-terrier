	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: SU5416 may stop the growth of cancer cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of SU5416 in treating patients who have advanced or recurrent cancer of the head and neck.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SU5416 in Treating Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Cancer of the Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effect of SU5416 on survival and tumor response in patients with advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. - Determine the safety and toxicity of SU5416 in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.4 years.</detailed_description>
