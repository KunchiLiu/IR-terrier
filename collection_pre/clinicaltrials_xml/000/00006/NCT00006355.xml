	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of pyrazoloacridine followed by radiation therapy in treating adults who have newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pyrazoloacridine Followed by Radiation Therapy in Treating Adults With Newly Diagnosed Supratentorial Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of pyrazoloacridine in adults with newly diagnosed, supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme treated with pyrazoloacridine followed by radiotherapy. - Determine the response rate, duration of disease free survival, and survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to type of anticonvulsant (hepatic metabolic enzyme inducers vs hepatic metabolic enzyme moderate inducers or noninducers). Patients receive pyrazoloacridine (PZA) IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Following completion of PZA treatment, patients undergo cranial irradiation 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of PZA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Additional patients receive PZA at the MTD. Patients are followed monthly for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 3 patients will be accrued for phase I and a total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study.</detailed_description>
