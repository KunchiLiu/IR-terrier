	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of hydroxyurea in treating patients who have recurrent and/or unresectable meningioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydroxyurea in Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Unresectable Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine complete, partial, or stable response to hydroxyurea in patients with recurrent and/or nonresectable meningioma. - Determine response at 2 years to this regimen in these patients. - Determine overall and disease free survival of these patients after this regimen. - Determine quality of life of these patients. - Determine the toxicities of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to grade of disease (I vs II or III). Patients receive oral hydroxyurea daily for 2 years. Quality of life is assessed before treatment, then every 3 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
