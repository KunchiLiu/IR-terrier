	<brief_summary>This study is intended to help doctors learn about the relationships between specific genetic makeup (gene markers) and the development of chronic rejection. This study is being done to see if there is a relationship between genetic patterns and the development of Chronic Allograft Nephropathy (CAN). Medical scientists also hope to learn more about how genetic differences between people determine their response to a drug or a disease by storing a small blood sample in a special "bank". This sample may be tested at some point in the future in an attempt to better understand the factors that may influence rejection, transplantation outcomes and transplant success rates.</brief_summary>
