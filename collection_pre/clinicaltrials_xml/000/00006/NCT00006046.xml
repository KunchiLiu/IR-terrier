	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have advanced colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, and pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma. - Determine the immune response in these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 (MAB Hu3S193) IV over 30 minutes to 4 hours weekly for 8 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest. Patients with stable or responding disease at week 10 receive maintenance MAB Hu3S193 weekly. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MAB Hu3S193 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
