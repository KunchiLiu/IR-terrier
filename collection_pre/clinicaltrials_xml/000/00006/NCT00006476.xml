	<brief_title>Suramin in Treating Patients With Recurrent Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of suramin in patients with recurrent superficial bladder cancer. - Confirm that there is no significant systemic absorption of this drug when administered intravesically in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. At approximately 14-18 days after surgical resection of bladder tumor(s), patients receive intravesicular suramin via urethral catheter installation into the bladder over 2 hours weekly for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of suramin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients develop dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 2-4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-15 patients will be accrued for this study over 1 year.</detailed_description>
