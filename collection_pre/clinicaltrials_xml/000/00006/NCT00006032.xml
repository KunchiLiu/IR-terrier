	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Followed by Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of high dose topotecan with ifosfamide and etoposide followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell rescue in women with metastatic breast cancer. II. Evaluate the response rates, progression free survival, engraftment, and nonrelapse related mortality in women treated with this regimen. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of high dose topotecan with respect to the efficacy and toxicity of ifosfamide and etoposide in these women. OUTLINE: Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested from the patient and stored. Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 2 hours and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days -8 to -6, and etoposide IV daily over 24 hours on days -5 to -3. Autologous PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.</detailed_description>
