	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage II or Stage III Oropharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess target coverage and major salivary gland sparing in patients with stage II or III oropharyngeal cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. - Determine the nature and prevalence of acute and late side effects of this treatment in these patients. - Determine the rate and pattern of locoregional tumor recurrence in these patients after this treatment. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive 3-D conformal radiotherapy and/or intensity-modulated radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks, in an effort to spare major salivary glands. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 57-64 patients will be accrued for this study over 27 months.</detailed_description>
