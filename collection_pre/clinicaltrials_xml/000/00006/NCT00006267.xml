	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin in treating patients who have recurrent or metastatic ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitrocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Ovarian Epithelial or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of nitrocamptothecin in patients with recurrent or metastatic ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin on days 1-5. Treatment continues every 7 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 weeks, then every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 22 months.</detailed_description>
