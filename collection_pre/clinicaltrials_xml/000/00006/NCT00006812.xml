	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of capecitabine in treating patients who have recurrent ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cavity cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial or Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of capecitabine in patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cavity cancer. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily for 14 days. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12 months.</detailed_description>
