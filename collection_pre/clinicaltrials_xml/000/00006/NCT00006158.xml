	<brief_summary>The study is a 6 month, placebo-controlled study of transdermal testosterone for women with HIV-associated weight loss. Women with AIDS wasting have been found to have low testosterone levels. This study is designed to test the efficacy of physiologic testosterone dosing to improve weight, muscle mass and quality of life indices, including energy level, appetite and libido, in androgen deficient women with AIDS wasting. After 6 months, all women receive open label transdermal testosterone for an additional 6 months.</brief_summary>
