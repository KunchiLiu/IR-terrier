	<brief_summary>The Decompression Intervention of Variceal Rebleeding Trial (DIVERT) is a multi-center prospective randomized clinical trial comparing the radiologic procedure of transjugular intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt (TIPS) with the surgical procedure of distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS) for variceal bleeding in patients with Child's Class A and B cirrhosis. This is recognized nationally and internationally as the study that will answer the question as to which of these is the best treatment for decompression of varices in patients who have failed endoscopic and pharmacologic therapy.</brief_summary>
