	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients who have ovarian stromal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Ovarian Stromal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the probability of clinical response and toxicity of paclitaxel as second-line chemotherapy in measurable disease patients with malignant tumors of the ovarian stroma. II. To evaluate the value of inhibin for predicting response. OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for three years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
