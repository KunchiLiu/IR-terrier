	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known if radiation therapy is more effective with or without combination chemotherapy for endometrial cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy with or without combination chemotherapy following surgery in treating patients who have stage I or stage II endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Radiation Therapy With or Without Combination Chemotherapy Following Surgery in Treating Patients With Stage I or Stage II Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the relapse-free survival in patients with stage I or II endometrial cancer treated with adjuvant radiotherapy with or without cisplatin and paclitaxel after total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. - Compare the patterns of recurrence and the acute and late toxicity profiles associated with these treatment regimens in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage (IC-IIA vs IIB). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Within 8 weeks after surgery, patients receive radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. - Arm II: Within 8 weeks after surgery, patients receive radiotherapy as in arm I concurrently with cisplatin IV over 2-4 hours on days 1 and 28. After completion of radiotherapy, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by cisplatin IV over 2-4 hours on days 56, 84, 112, and 140. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 436 patients (218 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
