	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining SCH 66336 and gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of SCH 66336 plus gemcitabine in treating patients who have advanced cancer of the urinary tract.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SCH 66336 Plus Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer of the Urinary Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility and toxicity of SCH 66336 and gemcitabine in patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary tract. - Determine the time to progression and objective response rate of this treatment regimen in these patients. - Assess the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral SCH 66336 twice a day (starting on day 2 of the first course, and starting on day 1 of all subsequent courses). Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 7-31 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
