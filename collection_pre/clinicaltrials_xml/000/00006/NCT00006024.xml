	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide plus lomustine followed by radiation therapy in treating patients who have high-grade malignant glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide Plus Lomustine Followed by Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With High-Grade Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of temozolomide when administered with lomustine in patients with high-grade malignant gliomas. - Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Evaluate the feasibility of radiotherapy after this treatment regimen in this patient population. - Evaluate the radiographic responses in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of temozolomide. Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5 and oral lomustine on day 1. Treatment continues every 28 days, if blood counts have recovered, for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo radiotherapy on days 1-5 weekly for 6 weeks. Patients continue the same chemotherapy regimen for up to 6 more courses beginning 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
