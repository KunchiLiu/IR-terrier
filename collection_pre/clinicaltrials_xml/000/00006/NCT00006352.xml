	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. BCG may activate the immune system to kill tumor cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with BCG may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known if monoclonal antibody therapy plus BCG is an effective treatment for limited-stage small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy plus BCG in treating patients who have limited-stage small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the impact of vaccination with adjuvant BCG and monoclonal antibody BEC2 on the survival of patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer. - Determine the progression free survival in these patients after receiving this treatment regimen. - Determine the safety of this treatment regimen in these patients. - Assess the quality of life in these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, Karnofsky performance status (60-70% vs 80-100%), and response to first line combined modality treatment (complete remission vs partial remission). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive vaccination with BCG and monoclonal antibody BEC2 intradermally on day 1 of weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 10 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive no further therapy. Quality of life is assessed at baseline; at weeks 6, 12, and 24; and every 6 months thereafter until disease progression. Patients are followed at 6 months, and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 570 patients (285 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
