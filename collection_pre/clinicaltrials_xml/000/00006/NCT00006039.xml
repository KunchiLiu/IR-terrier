	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of the cancer cells and slow the growth of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interferon alfa-2b in treating patients who have advanced low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interferon Alfa-2b in Treating Patients With Advanced Low-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response in patients with minimally treated or previously untreated advanced low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with pegylated interferon alfa-2b. II. Determine the effects of this treatment regimen on the immune system by measuring T-cell subsets and NK cells in this patient population. III. Determine event-free and progression-free survival in this patient population treated with this regimen. IV. Evaluate the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive pegylated interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously once weekly for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon completion of treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for at least 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be initially accrued for this study. Additional patients will be accrued if acceptable responses are seen in the first cohort.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed lowgrade lymphoma including any of the following: REAL classification Follicular lymphoma (grade I or II) Lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma Small lymphocytic lymphoma Marginal Bcell lymphoma MALT lymphoma International Working Formulation Follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma Follicular mixed small and large cell lymphoma Small lymphocytic lymphoma No intermediate or highgrade nonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) histology No evidence of histologic transformation If previously untreated, large tumor burden including any of the following: Nodal or extranodal mass greater than 7 cm in diameter Involvement of at least 3 nodal sites (each greater than 3 cm in diameter) Systemic symptoms Splenomegaly Ureteral compression Intraabdominal stage II, stage III, or stage IV disease Measurable disease No prior systemic therapy OR No more than 1 prior therapy ( e.g., chemotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy with immunotherapy, or chemotherapy with regional radiotherapy) A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
