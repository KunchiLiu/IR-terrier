	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal vincristine in treating patients who have refractory or relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liposomal Vincristine in Treating Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the complete and partial tumor responses in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is refractory to or relapsed after second-line combination chemotherapy treated with vincristine sulfate liposomes injection. - Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients. - Determine the duration of response, time to progression, and survival in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive vincristine sulfate liposomes IV over 1 hour. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
