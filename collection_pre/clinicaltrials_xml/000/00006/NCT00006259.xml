	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to deliver x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of stereotactic radiation therapy in treating patients who have brain metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery without whole brain radiotherapy in elderly patients or patients with poor performance status who have brain metastases. II. Determine the neurologic function in these patients after receiving this treatment regimen. III. Determine the quality of life in these patients with this treatment regimen. OUTLINE: Patients undergo stereotactic head frame placement, followed by stereotactic radiosurgery using Gamma Knife, on day 1. Quality of life is assessed one week prior to and one week after treatment, and then at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months. Patients are followed at one week, at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months, every 4 months for one year, and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 52 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
