	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have metastatic or recurrent head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0007 - Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the overall survival of patients with metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with paclitaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil. - Determine response (unconfirmed, confirmed, complete, and partial) and time to treatment failure in patients with measurable disease treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1-4. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 3 additional courses beyond CR. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.</detailed_description>
