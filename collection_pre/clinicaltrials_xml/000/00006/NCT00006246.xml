	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the safety of delivering intrathecal busulfan in children and adolescents who have refractory CNS cancer and to estimate the maximum tolerated dose of this treatment regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Busulfan in Treating Children and Adolescents With Refractory CNS Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of intrathecally administered busulfan in children and adolescents with refractory CNS malignancies. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this treatment regimen in these patients. - Determine the cerebrospinal fluid and serum pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in these patients. - Determine the efficacy of this treatment regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive intrathecal busulfan twice a week, at least 3 days apart, for 2 weeks. Patients with complete or partial response or stable disease may continue therapy once a week for 2 weeks, once a week every other week for 2 treatments, and then once a month thereafter in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of busulfan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study over 18-38 months.</detailed_description>
