	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining cisplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine in treating patients who have progressive unresectable regional or metastatic bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin, Paclitaxel, and Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Progressive Unresectable Regional or Metastatic Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine in patients with progressive unresectable regional or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. - Determine the progression free survival of these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and cisplatin IV over 1 hour and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
