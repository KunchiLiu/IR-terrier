	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin in treating patients who have metastatic cancer of the urinary tract.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitrocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Cancer of the Urinary Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response to nitrocamptothecin in patients with metastatic urothelial tract tumors. II. Determine the response rate in these patients when treated with this regimen. III. Determine the duration of objective response in these patients when treated with this regimen. IV. Characterize the toxicities of this treatment in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues weekly every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
