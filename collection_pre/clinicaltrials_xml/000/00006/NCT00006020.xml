	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 506U78 in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0010 506U78 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the complete remission rate in patients with recurrent or refractory non-T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia when treated with 506U78. - Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment continues every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every month for 6 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 3.5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
