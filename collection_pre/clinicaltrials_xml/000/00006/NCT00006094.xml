	<brief_summary>Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery may be a more effective treatment for cancer of the rectum. Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and external-beam radiation therapy followed by surgery in treating patients who have locally advanced cancer of the rectum</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin, Fluorouracil, and External-Beam Radiation Therapy Followed by Surgery in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Cancer of the Rectum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin when combined with fluorouracil and external beam radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum. (Phase I closed to accrual effective 03/27/2003). II. Determine the pathological response rate in patients treated with this preoperative regimen and surgical resection. III.Determine the late toxicity of this preoperative regimen in these patients. IV. Determine, in a preliminary manner, the progression-free survival, local control, and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study of oxaliplatin. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-7, and radiotherapy on days 1-5. Treatment repeats weekly for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are treated at that dose level in the phase II portion of the study. (Phase I closed to accrual effective 03/27/2003). Patients may undergo radical resection of rectal tumor within 4-6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study (phase I closed to accrual effective 03/27/2003) and a total of 19 patients will be accrued for phase II of the study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
