	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine in treating children who have relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myelogenous leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine in Treating Children With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia or Acute Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in children with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myelogenous leukemia treated with gemcitabine. - Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease histology (acute lymphoblastic leukemia vs acute myelogenous leukemia). Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 6 hours weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a maximum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 10-20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
