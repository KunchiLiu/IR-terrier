	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development of cancer. It is not yet known which regimen of selenium and/or vitamin E may be more effective in preventing prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of selenium and vitamin E, either alone or together, in preventing prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0000 Selenium and Vitamin E in Preventing Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the effect of selenium and vitamin E administered alone vs in combination on the clinical incidence of prostate cancer. - Compare the effect of these prevention regimens on the incidence of lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and all cancers combined in participants on this study. - Compare the effect of these prevention regimens on prostate cancer-free survival, lung cancer-free survival, colorectal cancer-free survival, cancer-free survival, overall survival, and serious cardiovascular events in these participants.</detailed_description>
