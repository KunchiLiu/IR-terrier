	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses high-frequency electric current to heat and kill tumor cells. Magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiofrequency ablation may an effective treatment for primary kidney cancer, liver metastases, or other solid tumors. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of magnetic-resonance-guided radiofrequency ablation in treating patients who have primary kidney cancer, liver metastases, or other solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Thermal Radiofrequencey Ablation of Primary Renal Cell Carcinoma, Hepatic Metastasis, and Other Sites of Solid Organ Tumor and Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether magnetic resonance image monitoring during radiofrequency interstitial thermal ablation can accurately predict complete destruction of focal tumor along with an adequate margin of normal tissue, as demonstrated by absence of growth on subsequent imaging studies for a 1-year period, in patients with primary renal cell carcinoma, hepatic metastases, or other solid tumors. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (localized hepatic metastases vs primary renal neoplasms vs solid tumors in other sites). Patients undergo thermal ablation by radiofrequency energy under magnetic resonance guidance. Thermal ablation continues until the entire tumor is treated. Treatment ceases when the entire lesion has undergone necrosis or the zone of necrosis or significant heat deposition approaches vital neurovascular structures. Patients are followed at 2 weeks and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 22-36 months.</detailed_description>
