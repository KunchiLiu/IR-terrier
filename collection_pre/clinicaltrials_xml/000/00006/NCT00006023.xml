	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of capecitabine in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of capecitabine in terms of PSA response, PSA response duration, and time to PSA progression in patients with metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer. II. Evaluate the toxicity of this treatment in these patients. III. Evaluate the correlation between PSA response and quality of life in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment continues every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed on days 1 and 8 of the first course of treatment, on day 1 of each course thereafter, and at treatment failure. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
