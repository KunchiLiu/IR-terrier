	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as beta alethine use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of beta alethine in treating patients who have myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Beta Alethine in Treating Patients With Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor effects of low-dose beta alethine in patients with myeloma or progressive monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. - Determine the effects of this regimen on anemia, performance status, pain, and delayed-type hypersensitivity (immune response) in these patients. - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive beta alethine subcutaneously every 2 weeks for 6 doses. At day 85, patients may receive an additional 12-week course of therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with an apparent complete response receive additional courses. Patients are followed for 2 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-37 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
