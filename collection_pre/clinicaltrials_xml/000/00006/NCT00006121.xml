	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating women who have advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin in Treating Women With Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer That Has Not Responded to Previous Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the therapeutic activity of oxaliplatin in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer following failure of anthracycline/taxane based chemotherapy. - Determine objective response, duration of response, and time to progression in these patients when treated with this regimen. - Determine the acute side effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression and then every 3 months for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
