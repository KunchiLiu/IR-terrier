	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiosurgery delivers x-rays directly to the tumor and may cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating patients who have liver metastases, lung metastases, or other advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Treating Patients With Liver Metastases, Lung Metastases, or Other Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of fractionated stereotactic body radiosurgery in patients with advanced extracranial tumors. - Assess the toxicities of this treatment regimen in these patients. - Determine tumor response and cause of death in these patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive fractionated stereotactic body radiosurgery over 30 minutes for 5-10 days for a total of 3 treatments. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-25 patients will be accrued within 2-3 years.</detailed_description>
