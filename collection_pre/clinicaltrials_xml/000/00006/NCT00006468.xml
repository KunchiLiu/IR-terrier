	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which regimen of combination chemotherapy is more effective for metastatic colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two combination chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Two Combination Chemotherapy Regimens in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the efficacy of intermittent high-dose oxaliplatin in combination with a simplified bimonthly regimen of leucovorin calcium (LV) and fluorouracil (5-FU) vs standard dose oxaliplatin in combination with the standard bimonthly regimen of LV and 5-FU in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. - Determine the time to treatment failure, tolerance, response rate, and overall survival in patients treated with these 2 regimens. - Compare quality of life of these patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to treatment center, performance status (0-1 vs 2), and number of metastatic sites (1 vs more than 1). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1, and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours followed by fluorouracil (5-FU) IV over 22 hours on days 1 and 2. - Arm II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours followed by 5-FU IV over 46 hours beginning on day 1 for courses 1-6 and 19-24. For courses 7-18, patients receive leucovorin calcium IV followed by 5-FU IV as above beginning on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in both arms in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after courses 4 and 6, and every 6 courses thereafter. Patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 460 patients (230 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 18 months.</detailed_description>
