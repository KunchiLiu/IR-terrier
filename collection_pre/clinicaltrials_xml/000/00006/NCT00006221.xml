	<brief_summary>Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-247550 in treating patients who have malignant solid tumors or lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-247550 in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of BMS-247550 in patients with advanced malignancies. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the antitumor effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to prior therapy (heavily pretreated vs minimally pretreated). Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour once weekly on weeks 1-4. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-247550 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are treated at that dose level. Patients treated at the MTD receive treatment once weekly on weeks 1-3 of each 4-week course. Patients are followed within 1 month.</detailed_description>
