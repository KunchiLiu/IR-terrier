	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and irinotecan, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients who have locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the time to progression, local control, and survival of patients with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer treated with induction gemcitabine and irinotecan followed by gemcitabine and concurrent radiotherapy. OUTLINE: Patients receive induction gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 2 weeks of completing induction chemotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, 29, and 32. Patients undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 6 months and then every 3 months for 1.5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60-120 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.</detailed_description>
