	<brief_summary>Several complications have become prevalent in people living with HIV/AIDS, including increased blood sugar, increased blood fats and cholesterol, and fat tissue redistribution. The causes of these complications are not well understood and effective treatments have not been identified. We propose to test the efficacy and safety of 2 treatments for these complications in people living with HIV/AIDS: aerobic, weight lifting exercise training, and a new insulin-sensitizing agent called rosiglitazone (Avandia). Exercise and rosiglitazone have been effective and moderately safe when used in HIV-seronegative people with diabetes, but a specific trial is needed to test efficacy and safety in people living with HIV/AIDS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rosiglitazone and Exercise Training: Effects on HIV-Infected People With Insulin Resistance, Hypertriglyceridemia, and Adipose Tissue Maldistribution</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose a 12wk controlled, randomized trial that compares the effects of rosiglitazone therapy, exercise training and combined rosiglitazone and exercise training. We hypothesize that rosiglitazone will lower blood sugar, insulin, blood fats, muscle and liver lipid content and composition in HIV-infected people. Exercise training will induce the same benefits, but will also reduce abdominal fat mass. We hypothesize that combining exercise training with rosiglitazone therapy will be most effective at reducing blood sugar, insulin, lipids, muscle and liver lipid contents, and restoring body fat distribution than either intervention alone. At baseline and after 12 wk of treatment we will measure: the ability of insulin to promote the clearance of sugar from the blood, the clearance rate of blood sugar, the rate of glucose production by the liver, blood fat and cholesterol concentrations, body fat content and fat distribution in the arms, legs, trunk regions, muscle and liver lipid content and composition.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The research volunteers will consist of HIVinfected men and women treated with PIbased HAART who have developed insulin resistance of impaired glucose homeostasis: fasting (8h) plasma glucose 110126 mg/dL (6.17.1 mM) OR plasma glucose &gt;140 (7.8 mM) 2 hours after a 75goral glucose load. Although not required for enrollment, many of these volunteers will also have developed trunk adipose tissue redistribution (defined as): trunk/appendicular adipose ratio using wholebody DEXA &gt;1.1 (men), &gt;0.9 (women), or visceral adipose/total abdominal adipose tissue (VAT/TAT) &gt;0.40 using 1HMRI imaging at the level of the umbilicus (~L3L4 intervertebral space). Many will also have developed fasting hypertriglyceridemia (&gt;300mg/dL, &gt;3.4 mM). Plasma viremia (Roche Amplicor assay) &lt;5000 copies/ml OR a CD4 Tcell county &gt;= 200 cells/ul for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. Stable on a PIcontaining HAART regimen for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. 1865 years of age Body mass index &lt;= 34kg/m*2, total body fat &lt;=35% of weight</criteria>
