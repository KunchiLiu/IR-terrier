	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer and Liver Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of imatinib mesylate in patients with advanced malignancies and varying degrees of liver dysfunction. II. Determine the effects of hepatic dysfunction on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the non-dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the response rate of these patients treated with this drug. V. Correlate the Childs-Pugh classification of hepatic dysfunction with observed toxic effects, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to liver dysfunction (normal vs mild vs moderate vs severe). Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients within each stratum (except normal stratum) receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
