	<brief_title>S0029 Docetaxel in Treating Older Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of treating elderly women with metastatic breast cancer with docetaxel. - Determine the overall survival, 2-year survival, and response (confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial) in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this drug in these patients. - Determine the feasibility of using standardized self-report measures of comorbidity, depression, and functional status in elderly cancer patients. - Determine the parameters of clinical pharmacology of this drug in elderly patients and in patients under 60 years of age. - Determine, preliminarily, the genetic polymorphisms and gene expression levels of enzymes involved in drug metabolism and resistance in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age (70 and over vs under 60). Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 80 patients (60 patients age 70 and over and 20 patients under age 60) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
