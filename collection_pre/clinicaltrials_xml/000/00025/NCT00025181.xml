	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining monoclonal antibody therapy and vaccine therapy in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma that has been removed during surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody and Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma That Has Been Removed During Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and adverse event profile of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody combined with tyrosinase:368-376, gp100:209-217, and MART-1:26-35 peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 in patients with resected stage III or IV melanoma. - Determine if this regimen causes antigen-specific T-cell activation in these patients. - Determine the clearance profile of this regimen in these patients. - Assess the development of host immune response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody (MDX-CTLA4). Patients receive tyrosinase:368-376, gp100:209-217, and MART-1:26-35 peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously followed by MDX-CTLA4 IV over 90 minutes at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 11 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of at least 6 patients receive escalating doses of MDX-CTLA4 until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
