	<brief_summary>PS-341 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of PS-341 in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PS-341 in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of PS-341, in terms of response rate, in women with metastatic breast cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the clinical activity of this drug, in terms of progression-free survival, in these women. II. Determine the toxicity profile and tolerability of this drug in these women. III. Determine the pharmacodynamics of this drug in these women. OUTLINE: Patients receive PS-341 IV over 3-5 seconds twice weekly on weeks 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-12 months.</detailed_description>
