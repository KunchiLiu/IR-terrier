	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining carboplatin and gemcitabine in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin and Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the observed responses in these patients receiving this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine. Patients are stratified according to prior therapy (no prior chemotherapy and/or prior radiotherapy to less than 20% of bone marrow vs prior chemotherapy and/or prior radiotherapy to at least 20% of bone marrow). Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-3 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18 patients (9 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
