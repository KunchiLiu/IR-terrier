	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel and estramustine in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel and Estramustine in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, time to treatment failure, and overall survival of patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with paclitaxel and estramustine. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral estramustine 2-3 times daily on days 1-3 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2 on weeks 1-6. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for at least 1 course in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete or partial response continue therapy for at least 3 courses or for 1 course after achieving maximum response. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory intermediate, highgrade, or transformed nonHodgkin's lymphoma Received 13 prior treatment regimens (cytoreductive chemotherapy followed by highdose therapy with stem cell support considered 1 regimen) Measurable disease A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
