	<brief_title>Bortezomib in Treating Children With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors. II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and other toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Preliminarily determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. If dose-limiting toxicity in the form of myelosuppression occurs in stratum I, dose escalation continues with patients meeting the qualifications for stratum II. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
