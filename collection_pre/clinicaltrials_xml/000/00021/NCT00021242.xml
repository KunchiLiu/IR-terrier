	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel in treating children who have relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic or acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel in Treating Children With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic or Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic or acute myeloid leukemia treated with docetaxel. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
