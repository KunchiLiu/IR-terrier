	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ZD0473 in treating patients who have progressive or relapsed non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ZD0473 in Treating Patients With Progressive or Relapsed Non-Small Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the anti-tumor effect of ZD0473 in patients with progressive or relapsed non-small cell lung cancer who have failed first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. II. Assess the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the efficacy of this drug, in terms of time to death, time to disease progression, disease control, and duration of response, in these patients. V. Assess the therapy outcome index, in terms of disease-related symptom relief, of these patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to time to relapse or progression after completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (12 weeks or less vs more than 12 weeks). Patients receive ZD0473 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the beginning of each course, and then every 6 weeks for 1 year after completion of study. Patients are followed at 30 days after study completion and every 6 weeks for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-73 patients (23-56 per stratum 1 and 9-17 per stratum 2) will be accrued for this study within approximately 9 months.</detailed_description>
