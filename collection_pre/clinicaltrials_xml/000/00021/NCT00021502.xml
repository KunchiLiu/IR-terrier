	<brief_summary>To determine the safety and effectiveness of pyridoxylated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene conjugate (PHP) administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) patients with shock. PHP is a human-derived chemically modified hemoglobin preparation. PHP selectively scavenges excess nitric oxide (NO) and does so in a catalytic, concentration-dependent reaction that results in the formation of the non-toxic NO metabolite, nitrate. PHP is postulated to reduce excess, toxic levels of NO while allowing critical beneficial levels of the molecule to persist.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of PHP in the Treatment of Shock Associated With Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3, randomized, placebo controlled, multi-center study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of continuous IV infusion of PHP plus conventional vasopressor treatment, as compared to continuous IV infusion of Plasma-Lyte A plus conventional vasopressor, as a treatment for restoring hemodynamic stability in SIRS patients with shock. Conventional vasopressors include dopamine &gt; 5 mcg/kg/min; or norepinephrine, phenylephrine or epinephrine at any dose. The study consists of a Screening period, a Pre-Treatment period, and a 28-day Treatment period. Efficacy will be determined by evaluating objective clinical measures of mortality and organ function over the 28-day treatment period. The safety and tolerability of PHP will be evaluated over the continuous 28 days using a number of measures including an evaluation of: - all cause mortality, - median patient survival time and - adverse event rates and duration.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Determination of study eligibility will be made by the Investigator on the basis of the inclusion criteria listed below: SIRS Inclusion Criteria Patients with SIRS as characterized by two or more of the following conditions (worst values in a 24 hour period): Either respiratory rate &gt;/= 20 breaths/minute, partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) &lt;/= 32 torr, or mechanical ventilation, Heart rate &gt;/= 90 beats/minute, Either hyperthermia &gt;/= 38 degrees C, or hypothermia &lt;/= 36 degrees C or Either white blood cell (WBC) &gt;/= 12,000 cells/mm3, &lt;/= 4,000 cells/mm3, or &gt;/= 10% immature (band) forms Shock Inclusion Criteria Patients with adequate fluid resuscitation (PCWP &gt;/= 12mmHg) and with one or more conventional vasopressors (continuing up to the time of randomization) being used to treat hypotension (MBP &lt; 60 mmHg or SBP &lt; 90 mmHg). Patients cannot be entered if they have been in shock for more than 24 hours.</criteria>
