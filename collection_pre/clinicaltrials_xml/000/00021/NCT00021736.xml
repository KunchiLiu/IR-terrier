	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether the anti-VEGF drug is effective at stabilizing and/or improving vision in patients with the wet form of AMD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II/III Study of Anti-VEGF in Neovascular AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a randomized, double-masked, controlled, dose-ranging, multi-center comparative trial, in parallel groups. Patients will be stratified by clinical center, by percentage of classic CNV vessels: [predominantly classic (&gt;50%) vs. minimally classic (1-49%) vs. purely occult (0%)], and according to whether, or not, they have received prior PDT with Visudyne (no more than once). All patients will be re-randomized after 54 weeks of treatment to either, continue or discontinue therapy for further 48 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients of either gender, aged 50 years or above, diagnosed with subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD and with best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 to 20/320 in the absence of subfoveal atrophy or scarring in the study eye, and better or equal to 20/800 in the fellow eye, may be enrolled. Clinically significant concomitant diseases will be excluded.</criteria>
