	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of tocladesine in treating patients who have recurrent or progressive metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tocladesine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of tocladesine in patients with recurrent or progressive metastatic colorectal cancer. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Assess any therapeutic activity in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive tocladesine IV continuously on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tocladesine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, up to 14 additional patients are treated at this dose level. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-38 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
