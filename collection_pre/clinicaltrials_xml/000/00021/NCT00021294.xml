	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. Eflornithine with or without triamcinolone may be effective in preventing nonmelanoma skin cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of eflornithine with or without triamcinolone in preventing nonmelanoma skin cancer in patients who have actinic keratosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eflornithine With or Without Triamcinolone in Preventing Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer in Patients With Actinic Keratosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the safety and efficacy of eflornithine (DFMO) vs placebo as chemoprevention of non-melanoma skin cancer in patients with moderate to heavy actinic keratosis (AK). II. Determine whether this drug reverses AK in these patients. III. Determine whether triamcinolone reduces DFMO-induced skin irritation in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive eflornithine (DFMO) topically and triamcinolone topically to forearms once daily. Arm II: Patients receive DFMO and placebo topically as in arm I. Arm III: Patients receive placebo and triamcinolone topically as in arm I. Arm IV: Patients receive 2 placebos topically as in arm I. Treatment continues for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
