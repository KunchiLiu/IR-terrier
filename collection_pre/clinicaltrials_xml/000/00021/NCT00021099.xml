	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ixabepilone in treating patients who have progressive or metastatic urinary tract cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixabepilone in Treating Patients With Advanced Urinary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of patients with advanced carcinoma of the urothelium treated with ixabepilone. II. Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment with taxanes (yes vs no). Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
