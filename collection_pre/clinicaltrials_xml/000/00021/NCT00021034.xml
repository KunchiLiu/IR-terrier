	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of taurolidine in treating patients who have recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Taurolidine in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of taurolidine after positive second-look surgery in patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and safety of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive taurolidine intraperitoneally weekly on weeks 1-3 and 7-9 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of taurolidine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 weeks for 9 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.</detailed_description>
