	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining epirubicin, carboplatin, and capecitabine in treating patients who have unresectable locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent solid tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epirubicin, Carboplatin, and Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced, Metastatic, or Recurrent Solid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose of capecitabine administered with epirubicin and carboplatin in patients with unresectable locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent solid tumors. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of capecitabine and correlate these PK parameters with clinical toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Correlate end-of-infusion levels of epirubicin and its metabolites with epirubicin dose and clinical toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the possible correlation between polymorphisms in the promoter region of the thymidylate synthase gene with clinical toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of capecitabine. Patients receive epirubicin IV over 2 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 2-5, 8-12, and 15-19. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 24 additional patients are treated at the recommended phase II dose. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-45 patients (24 patients for phase II) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
