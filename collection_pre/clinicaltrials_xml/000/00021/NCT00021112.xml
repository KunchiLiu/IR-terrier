	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery in treating patients who have stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy Followed by Surgery in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the incidence of radically resected disease in patients with stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer treated with induction cisplatin, etoposide, and radiotherapy followed by surgical resection. - Determine the toxicity (morbidity and mortality) of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the clinical response rate and pathological response rate in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising cisplatin IV on day 1 and etoposide IV on days 1-3. Chemotherapy repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses. Beginning on day 2 of the second course of chemotherapy, patients undergo induction radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5-7 weeks. Chemoradiotherapy continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At 3-6 weeks after completion of the last dose of induction radiotherapy, patients undergo lobectomy or pneumonectomy. Patients are followed at 30 days and 4 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-62 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
