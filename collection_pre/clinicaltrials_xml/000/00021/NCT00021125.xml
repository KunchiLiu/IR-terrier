	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known which regimen of radiation therapy is more effective for head and neck cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of different regimens of radiation therapy in treating patients who have head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare adjuvant continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy vs conventional radiotherapy, in terms of preventing disease recurrence, in patients with head and neck cancer. - Compare the early and late toxic effects of these treatments in this patient population. - Compare disease-free and overall survival of patients receiving these treatments. - Assess quality of life in patients receiving these treatments. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy 3 times daily, with an interval of at least 6 hours between any 2 treatments, 5 days a week, for just over 2 weeks, for a total of 13-14 treatment days. - Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, for 6-6.5 weeks. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then annually for 5 years. Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 460 patients (230 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years.</detailed_description>
