	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of sarCNU in treating patients who have recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SarCNU in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of SarCNU in patients with recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the time to progression and survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral SarCNU on days 1, 5, and 9. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond documentation of CR. Patients who achieve partial response (PR) receive 4 additional courses beyond documentation of PR. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-8 months.</detailed_description>
