	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known if combination chemotherapy plus filgrastim is more effective with or without rituximab in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus filgrastim with or without rituximab in treating older patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Filgrastim With or Without Rituximab in Treating Older Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the efficacy of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP), and filgrastim (G-CSF) with or without rituximab on event-free survival of elderly patients with intermediate or high-risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Compare the complete remission rate, overall survival, and disease-free survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, WHO classification, and International Prognostic Index score. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin IV, and vincristine IV on day 1; oral prednisone on days 1-5; and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and G-CSF as in arm I. Patients also receive rituximab IV on day 3 of courses 1-2 and on day 1 of courses 3-6 for a total of 6 doses. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients (200 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 5 years.</detailed_description>
