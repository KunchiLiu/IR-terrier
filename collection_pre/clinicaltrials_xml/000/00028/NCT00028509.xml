	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Assessing the effects of methotrexate on brain function in children may improve the ability to plan treatment and decrease side effects. PURPOSE: Clinical trial to compare brain function of children who have been previously treated with methotrexate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Function in Children Previously Treated on Clinical Trials POG-9605 and POG-9201</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the incidence of neuropsychological abnormalities and leukoencephalopathy in children previously treated with methotrexate on protocols POG-9605 versus POG-9201. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. More than 3 years after completion of therapy, patients undergo 9 different tests to assess intelligence, memory, learning, attention, concentration, processing of information, functioning, and visual-motor integration. Patients also undergo MRI of the head. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-54 patients previously treated on protocol POG-9201 will be accrued for this study. A total of 60-108 patients previously treated on protocol POG-9605 will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
