	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Fibrin sealant may decrease lymphedema following surgery to remove lymph nodes in the groin by helping to seal the lymphatic vessels. It is not yet known if fibrin sealant is effective in decreasing lymphedema following surgery to remove lymph nodes. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of fibrin sealant in reducing lymphedema following surgical removal of lymph nodes in patients who have cancer of the vulva.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fibrin Sealant in Decreasing Lymphedema Following Surgery to Remove Lymph Nodes in Patients With Cancer of the Vulva</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the incidence of lymphedema of the lower extremity after lymph node dissection in patients with vulvar malignancies treated with fibrin sealant vs standard care. - Compare the frequency of surgical complications in patients treated with fibrin sealant vs standard care. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: After radical vulvectomy or hemivulvectomy and lymphadenectomy, patients receive fibrin sealant to surgical site. - Arm II: After surgery, patients receive standard care for closure of surgical site. Lymphedema is assessed at time of drain removal, at week 6, and then at months 3 and 6. Patients are followed at week 6 and at months 3 and 6. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120-130 patients (60-65 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
