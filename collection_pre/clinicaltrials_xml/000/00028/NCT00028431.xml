	<brief_summary>This is a study to determine the efficacy of a melanoma vaccine chemotherapy cocktail composed of CTLA-4 antibody; tyrosinase, gp100, and MART-1 peptides; and incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) with or without interleukin-12 in patients with resected stage III or IV melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Adjuvants for Peptide-Based Melanoma Vaccines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the Phase I/II trial, patients with resected stages III and IV melanoma who have been rendered free of disease, but are at high risk of relapse, are treated with peptides/IFA at a dose of 0.5 mg each peptide plus CTLA-4 antibody given intravenously, 3 mg/kg, after each vaccination. In the Phase II randomized study, patients are treated with the melanoma peptide vaccine alone, with CTLA-4 antibody, or with CTLA-4 antibody combined with IL-12 at 30 ng/kg with alum. The peptides are tyrosinase 368-376 (370D); gp100 209-217 (210M); and MART-1 26-35 (27L) which are emulsified with IFA. The dosing schedule for both trials are at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months; then at 9 and 12 for a total of 8 vaccinations.</detailed_description>
