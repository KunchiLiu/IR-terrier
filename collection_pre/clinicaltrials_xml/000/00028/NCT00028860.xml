	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy following surgery in treating patients who have urinary tract cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Following Surgery in Treating Patients With Urinary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the time to treatment failure and disease-free survival in patients with high-risk transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium treated with adjuvant paclitaxel, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and gemcitabine. - Determine the tolerability and feasibility of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease stage. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 2 courses. Beginning 3 weeks after the completion of the second course of chemotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also receive G-CSF SC once daily on days 2-6 and again beginning on day 9 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
