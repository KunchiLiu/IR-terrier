	<brief_title>XK469 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicity, and recommended phase II dose of XK469 in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine, preliminarily, any anti-tumor activity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the drug metabolism, drug interaction potential, molecular and cellular predictors of efficacy and toxicity, and clinical confirmation of molecular responses in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive XK469 IV over 20 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of XK469 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of the first 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, up to 15 patients are treated at that dose. Patients in the expanded MTD cohort also receive oral NovaSoyÂ® soybean extract twice daily for the study duration. Patients are followed every 4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-15 months.</detailed_description>
