	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of BMS-247550 when given together with carboplatin in treating patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-247550 Plus Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of BMS-247550 when given in combination with carboplatin in patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine, preliminarily, any antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. V. Correlate the protein expression of survivin with the expression of other apoptotic regulators, the apoptotic index, and response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BMS-247550. Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 followed by carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after achieving CR or up to a total of 6 courses. The first two cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of BMS-247550 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).The third and fourth cohorts of 10 patients each receive escalating doses of BMS-247550 until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 3 of 10 patients experience DLT. Once the MTD is determined for the third and fourth cohorts, 15 additional patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed for 30 days.</detailed_description>
