	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining docetaxel and monoclonal antibody therapy in treating women who have metastatic or recurrent breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy and Docetaxel in Treating Women With Metastatic or Recurrent Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity and safety profile of doxorubicin-monoclonal antibody BR96 immunoconjugate (SGN-15) and docetaxel in women with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer. - Determine the clinical response rate and duration of response of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin-monoclonal antibody BR96 immunoconjugate (SGN-15) IV over 2 hours and docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1-6. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.</detailed_description>
