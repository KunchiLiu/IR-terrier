	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs such as goserelin, leuprolide, flutamide, or bicalutamide may stop the adrenal glands from producing androgens. Combining chemotherapy with hormone therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus hormone therapy in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0032, Combination Chemotherapy Plus Hormone Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the progression-free and overall survival in patients with high-risk metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with early estramustine, etoposide, and paclitaxel with combined androgen-blockade therapy. - Determine the type, frequency, and severity of toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. - Androgen-blockade therapy: Patients receive a standard regimen of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy comprising either goserelin subcutaneously once monthly or once every 3 months or leuprolide intramuscularly once monthly, once every 3 months, or once every 4 months. Patients also receive a standard regimen of antiandrogen therapy comprising oral bicalutamide, oral flutamide, or oral nilutamide once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Chemotherapy: Beginning 14-30 days after initiation of androgen-blockade therapy, patients receive oral estramustine three times daily and oral etoposide once daily on days 1-14 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
