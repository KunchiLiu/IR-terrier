	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: PS-341 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of PS-341 in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PS-341 in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective tumor response in women with metastatic breast cancer treated with bortezomib. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the progression-free survival in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds twice weekly for 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-24 months.</detailed_description>
