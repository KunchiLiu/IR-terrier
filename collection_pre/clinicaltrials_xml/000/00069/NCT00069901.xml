	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CT-2103 (poly(L)glutamate-paclitaxel) in combination with carboplatin for the treatment of patients with Stage III or IV ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II CT-2103/Carboplatin in Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CT-2103 is a pharmaceutical that links paclitaxel, the active ingredient in Taxol(R), to a biodegradable polyglutamate polymer. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the toxicity, estimate the response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed stage III or IV ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma treated with CT-2103 in combination with carboplatin.</detailed_description>

ECOG performance score of 0, 1, or 2. absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at least 1,500/µL. platelet at least 100,000/µL. hemoglobin at least 10 g/dL. creatinine no greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). bilirubin no greater than 1.5 x ULN (if liver metastases are not present, SGOT and SGPT no greater than 2.5 x ULN, if liver metastases are present, SGOT and SGPT may be no greater than 5 x ULN. Alkaline phosphatase no greater than 2.5 x ULN. Exclusion: Current diagnosis of epithelial ovarian tumor of low malignant potential (borderline carcinomas) Germ cell tumors, sex cordstromal tumors, carcinosarcomas, mixed mullerian tumors or carcinosarcomas, metastatic carcinomas from sites other than the ovary, and low malignant potential tumors including so called micropapillary serous carcinomas. Synchronous primary endometrial cancer or history of primary endometrial cancer. Evidence of any other invasive malignancies present within the 3 years before this study, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer and other specific malignancies as noted above. Any prior treatment, other than initial debulking surgery, for the cancer being treated in this study. Patients may have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy for localized breast cancer, if the therapy was completed at least 3 years before registration in this study and if the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease. Prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis. Prior radiation for localized cancer of the breast, head and neck, or skin is permitted, if it was completed at least 3 years before registration in this study and if the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease. Administration of other investigational drugs within 26 weeks before the first treatment in this study. Toxic manifestations of previous treatments (except alopecia) must have been stable for 4 weeks. Presence of active hepatitis, either acute or chronic. Presence of active infection requiring antibiotic or antiviral therapy. Pregnant women or nursing mothers.</criteria>
