	<brief_title>Enhancing the Outcome of Skills Training for People With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People with schizophrenia have a large number of social and symptom management training programs available to them. Studies suggest that these training programs are effective, but their generalizability and effectiveness in outpatient settings has not been thoroughly examined. This study will examine the treatment outcomes of a skills training approach in schizophrenic individuals taking antipsychotic medication. Participants taking stable doses of risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine will be randomly assigned to receive either intensive symptom management and social skills training or group therapy for 12 months. A verbal memory test will be used to stratify the randomization procedure and to control for neurocognitive functioning.</detailed_description>
