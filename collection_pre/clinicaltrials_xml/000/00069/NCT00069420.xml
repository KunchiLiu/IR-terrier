	<brief_title>Cognitive Motivational Behavior Therapy for Gamblers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pathological gambling is developing into a serious public health problem. The rise in gambling problems has stimulated treatment studies, but little progress has been made. A particular concern is the high dropout rates from treatment studies; gamblers often seek treatment, but fail to complete it and relapse. This study will test the effectiveness of CMBT in helping to increase retention rates in gambling treatment studies. The first step in this study is designed to enhance gamblers' readiness for change. When participants are committed to change, CMBT will then address specific cognitive biases regarding the notion of randomness, which is thought to lie at the heart of gambling problems. Behavioral components will also be used to enhance gamblers' coping skills. The participants in this study will be randomly assigned to either CMBT or a Gambler's Anonymous control group. Participants will be assessed prior to and after treatment and at 3- and 6-month follow-up visits. Interviews and questionnaires will be used to assess participants.</detailed_description>
