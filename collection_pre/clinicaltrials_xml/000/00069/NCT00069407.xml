	<brief_title>Comparison of Three Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) Techniques for the Treatment of Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ECT is an important treatment for severely depressed people who do not respond adequately to, or are intolerant of, antidepressant medication. Traditionally, ECT has been administered with one of two standard techniques: bilateral and right unilateral electrode placement. However, these techniques are limited by either low efficacy or high cognitive impairment. Recently, an additional technique for ECT administration has shown promise in preliminary studies: bifrontal ECT. This study will compare this technique to the two traditional ECT techniques in treating people with depressive symptoms. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive standard bilateral ECT, high-dose right unilateral ECT, or bifrontal ECT in their index course. Depression symptoms, neuropsychological status, and quality of life will be measured throughout the course of the ECT treatment, one week after, and at a 2-month follow-up visit. This study will run for 4 years.</detailed_description>
