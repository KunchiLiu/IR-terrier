	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Combining vaccine therapy with sargramostim may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy when given together with sargramostim in treating patients with advanced sarcoma or brain tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy and Sargramostim in Treating Patients With Sarcoma or Brain Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of treatment with telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine and sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with sarcoma or brain tumor. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the frequency of T-cell specific vaccine antigens during and after administration of this regimen in these patients. - Determine, preliminarily, the clinical response, if any, of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 3 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-4 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 19, and 23. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients (20 adult and 15 pediatric) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
