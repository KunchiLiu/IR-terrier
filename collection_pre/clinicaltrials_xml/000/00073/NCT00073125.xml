	<criteria>A subject will be eligible for study participation if all of the following criteria are met: The subject is at least 18 years of age. The subject has advanced histologically documented renal cell carcinoma. Advanced disease is defined as locally recurrent disease or metastatic disease that is not amendable to curative resection. The subject has not received prior therapy (antitumor radiotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or investigational therapy) for metastatic renal cell carcinoma other than excision of primary tumor where appropriate. Local radiation for supportive reasons will be allowed; however, not within 28 days from Study Day 1. The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Score of 01 The subject is able to selfadminister or has a caregiver who can reliably administer subcutaneous injections. The subject must have adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function as follows: Bone Marrow: White blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 3,000/mm3 (3.0 X 109/L); Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 (100 X 109/L); Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL (1.4 mmol/L) Renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL (0.81 mmol/L) Hepatic function: AST and ALT ≤ 1.5 X ULN unless liver metastases are present, then AST and ALT ≤ 5.0 X ULN; LDH ≤ 1.5 X ULN; bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL (0.026 mmol/L) Corrected calculated calcium ≤ 10 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) Calculation = total calcium 0.707 (albumin 3.4)Albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL (0.45 mmol/L) The subject must not be pregnant or lactating and all subjects (male and female) must use a contraceptive method deemed acceptable by the investigator while in the study and for up to two months following completion of therapy. The subject has voluntarily signed and dated an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approved consent prior to any study specific procedures. A subject will be ineligible for study participation if any of the following criteria are met: The subject has a history of or currently exhibits Central Nervous System (CNS) metastasis. Brain MRI within 28 days of enrollment is required to confirm absence of CNS metastases. The subject is receiving therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. Low dose anticoagulation (e.g., low dose Coumadin) for catheter prophylaxis will be permitted; PT/PTT must be within normal limits. The subject has a history of or currently exhibits clinically significant cancer related events of bleeding (e.g., hemoptysis). The subject has a recent history of (within 4 weeks of Study Day 1) or currently exhibits other clinically significant signs of bleeding. The subject exhibits evidence of clinically significant uncontrolled conditions(s) and/or is considered by the investigator to be unable to tolerate the proposed treatment or procedures. The subject has history of other previous malignancies within 5 years, with the exception of: Adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri or Basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin</criteria>
