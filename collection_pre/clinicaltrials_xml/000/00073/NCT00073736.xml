	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary cancer of the liver. MB07133 is being developed for the treatment of inoperable HCC, using a platform technology known as HepDirectTM, which enables drugs to be targeted specifically to the liver. The objective for this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of MB07133.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Tolerability of I.V. Infusion of MB07133 in Patients With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the maximum tolerated dose of MB07133 when administered as a 7-day continuous i.v. To characterize the safety profile and the pharmacokinetics of MB07133 and metabolites during and after continuous infusion. To determine the effect of MB07133 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor size.</detailed_description>
