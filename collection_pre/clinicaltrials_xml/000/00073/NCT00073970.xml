	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Celecoxib may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in treating patients who have relapsed prostate cancer following radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib in Treating Patients With Relapsed Prostate Cancer Following Radiation Therapy or Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effect of celecoxib on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in patients with prostate cancer in biochemical relapse after prior definitive radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy. - Compare the PSA doubling times in patients treated with this drug vs historical controls. - Compare the PSA doubling times in patients treated with this drug vs pretreatment PSA values. - Determine the time to clinical recurrence in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily. Treatment continues for 5 years in the absence of disease progression. Patients may continue treatment beyond 5 years at the discretion of the treating physician. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
