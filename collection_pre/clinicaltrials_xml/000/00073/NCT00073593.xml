	<criteria>Inclusion: Provide written informed consent before initiation of any study related procedures. Be at least 18 years of age. Be accepted for elective offpump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery without concomitant cardiac surgical procedures. &lt; 4 planned Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts Exclusion: Any prior CardioThoracic Surgical procedures requiring median sternotomy Confirmed pregnancy baseline urine or serum pregnancy test (if woman of childbearing potential). Cerebrovascular accident within 6 months before randomization, or any cerebrovascular accident with residual neurological deficit. Intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm. Dependency on renal dialysis or creatinine clearance &lt;30mL/min. Ongoing treatment with warfarin (or other oral anticoagulants) at the time of randomization. Patients previously treated with warfarin may be enrolled if warfarin therapy can be safely discontinued and baseline INR is &lt;1.3 times control in the absence of heparin therapy. Known allergy to Angiomax or hirudin derived drugs, or known sensitivity to any component of these products. Patients receiving clopidogrel within the previous 5 days of randomization. Patients receiving a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor within 48 hours if abciximab (ReoPro) or within 24 hours if eptifibatide (Integrilin) and tirofiban (Aggrastat) of randomization Patients receiving lepirudin or argatroban within the previous 24 hours of randomization. Patients receiving low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or thrombolytics within the previous 12 hours or unfractionated heparin within 30 minutes of randomization. Patients with active or prior history of heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT)/heparininduced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome (HITTS)*. Participation in other clinical research studies involving the evaluation of other investigational drugs or devices within 30 days of randomization. Refusal to undergo blood transfusion should it become necessary. Any other disease or condition, which, in the judgment of the investigator would place a patient at undue risk by being enrolled in the trial or inability to comply with study requirements.</criteria>
