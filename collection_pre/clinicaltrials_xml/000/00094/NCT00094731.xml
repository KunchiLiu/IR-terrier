	<brief_title>SeniorWISE: Improving Everyday Memory in At-Risk Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volunteer participants will be randomly assigned to experimental (memory training) and comparison (health promotion) groups. Both groups will learn strategies for successful aging. Participants will be in the study for 27 months and will be interviewed on five occasions for 3 hours per interview. The classroom-based intervention is an 8-session, 1 1/2 hour course designed to teach older adults the use of strategies to improve everyday memory. Strategically-placed booster sessions will be provided to subjects within 3 months following the last class session.</detailed_description>
