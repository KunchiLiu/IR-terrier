	<brief_summary>This study is to investigate the safety of NS-9 and to see how well it is tolerated in patients with cancer that has metastasized (spread) to the liver from another primary tumor. NS-9 is a drug developed to go to the liver to cause cell death specifically in tumor cells. This study is also set up to determine the best dose to use.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of NS-9 in Patients With Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study requires subjects to undergo 2 treatment cycles of NS-9. Each cycle consists of once daily, 1-hour I.V. infusions of the drug for 5 days followed by a 23-day rest period. During the rest period, subjects are seen at the clinic once weekly for evaluation. Subjects having favorable or stable results after 2 cycles may continue to receive NS-9 in the extension phase of the study until the disease progresses or until they get a side effect that prevents them from continuing with therapy. After each two cycles, if appropriate, the liver tumor will be measured by radiologic imaging to compare it to its pre-treatment size.</detailed_description>
