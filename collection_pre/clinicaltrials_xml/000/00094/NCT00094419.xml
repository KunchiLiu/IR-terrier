	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify the types of and frequency of use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) strategies among low-income Caucasian and African American adults with persistent asthma. The overall goal is to collect data that will increase understanding of health beliefs and behaviors in people with low-income backgrounds so that studies can be created that may help modify and improve patients' symptoms of asthma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use in Low-Income African American and Caucasian Adults With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rates of asthma-related deaths and disease are disproportionately high among African Americans compared to Caucasians. Surveys indicate that middle- and upper-income Caucasians use more CAM than African Americans, but the therapies utilized are different. This study will determine how well people with persistent asthma adhere to their treatment and whether the type and frequency of use of CAM affects treatment adherence. Participants will begin this study by taking part in an interview about adherence to their current inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) regimen and their personal CAM use. After completing the interview, participant adherence to their ICS regimen will be monitored for 6 weeks. Depending on the type of ICS participants are taking, monitoring will be conducted either by participant self-reporting or electronic monitors that record the time and date of medication inhalation. Participant adherence will also be assessed at study completion.</detailed_description>
