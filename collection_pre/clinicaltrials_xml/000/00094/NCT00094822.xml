	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) in reducing infection when given on the same day versus one day after the completion of chemotherapy (docetaxel and carboplatin) in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study is considered to be "investigational" because previous studies with Neulasta® used next day dosing and not same day dosing.</brief_summary>
