	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is: - To characterize the safety profile of motesanib when used in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel (CP), with panitumumab or with CP and panitumumab in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). - To establish the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of motesanib when it is used in combination with CP, with panitumumab, or with CP and panitumumab. - To compare the paclitaxel and motesanib PK profiles when the medications are administered 30 minutes (min) or approximately 48 hours (hrs) apart. - To characterize the panitumumab and paclitaxel exposure in the combination regimens of motesanib with CP, motesanib with panitumumab, or motesanib with CP and panitumumab. - To describe the objective response rate (ORR) in each dose cohort. - To measure the immunogenicity of panitumumab in patients administered motesanib with panitumumab and motesanib with CP and panitumumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Motesanib With or Without Carboplatin/Paclitaxel or Panitumumab in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a multicenter, open-label, dose-finding clinical trial examining the safety and PK of once or twice daily motesanib administered with CP or with CP and panitumumab in chemotherapy na√Øve patients, and with panitumumab in patients with no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for NSCLC. Participants were enrolled into the Panitumumab + Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Motesanib once a safe and tolerable dose of AMG 706 was established in the other treatment arms.</detailed_description>
