	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining BMS-247550 with gemcitabine in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-247550 and Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicity, and safety of BMS-247550 when combined with gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this regimen in this patient population. - Assess, preliminarily, any antitumor activity of this regimen in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BMS-247550. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours on day 8. The order of chemotherapy drug administration on day 8 is reversed during the second course only. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-247550 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 9 patients total are treated at the MTD. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
