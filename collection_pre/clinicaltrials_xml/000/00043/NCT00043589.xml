	<brief_title>Memory and Mental Health in Aging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug donepezil plus cognitive training may work better than cognitive training alone to improve the memory of nondemented older adults. In this study, participants are assigned randomly to receive either donepezil plus cognitive training or placebo plus cognitive training. Memory and quality of life tests are used to evaluate the effects of the study treatments.</detailed_description>
