	<brief_summary>To determine the effect of denosumab treatment compared with placebo over 12 months on bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine in postmenopausal women with low BMD. The clinical hypothesis is that denosumab subcutaneous injections administered every 3 or 6 months for 12 months will significantly increase lumbar spine bone mineral density and will be well tolerated.</brief_summary>
