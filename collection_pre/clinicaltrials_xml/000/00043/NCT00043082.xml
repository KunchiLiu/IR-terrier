	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known if carboplatin is more effective with or without liposomal doxorubicin in treating recurrent ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of carboplatin with or without liposomal doxorubicin in treating patients who have recurrent ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0200 Carboplatin With or Without Doxil in Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare overall survival of patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer treated with carboplatin with or without pegylated doxorubicin HCl liposome. - Compare progression-free survival, confirmed complete response rates, and time to treatment failure in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease measurability (elevated CA 125 only vs nonmeasurable disease only with or without elevated CA 125 vs measurable disease), number of disease sites (2 or fewer vs 3 or more), and serous tumor histology (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 15 minutes and pegylated doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour on day 1. - Arm II: Patients receive carboplatin IV as in arm I. Treatment in both arms repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 15 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 7 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 900 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.</detailed_description>
