	<brief_title>A Safety and Effectiveness Study of Aroplatin in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer Resistant to Standard Therapies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: - To determine response rate (RR; complete and partial response[CR,PR] and duration after therapy with Aroplatin (Liposomal NDDP, L-NDDP) in subjects with locally recurrent, unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to 5-FU/leucovorin or capecitabine, and irinotecan. Secondary Objective: - To determine safety and tolerability of the Aroplatin therapy. This is a single-arm, open-label phase II study. Subjects refractory to 5-FU/leucovorin or capecitabine, and irinotecan therapies will be enrolled. Dosing will be every four weeks with individual dose escalations and adjustments for toxicity.</detailed_description>
