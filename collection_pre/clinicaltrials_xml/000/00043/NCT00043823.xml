	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: 1. (Phase I) To establish the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities of the combination of OSI-774 (Tarceva™) and rhuMAb VEGF (Avastin™) in patients with advanced Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). 2. (Phase II) To assess response rate and tolerability of the regimen at the dose level established in the phase I portion of this study. Secondary Objectives: 1. (Phase I and II) To evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction between the combination. 2. (Phase I) To establish a phase II regimen of the OSI-774/ rhuMAb VEGF combination, for further study alone or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Avastin and Tarceva for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Squamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be treated with oral Tarceva daily for 21 days each cycle. Patients will receive Avastin by IV on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. If a patient has no grade 3 or 4 toxicities after the 1st cycle, then the patient may continue the same doses of Tarceva and Avastin for another cycle. If the patient has response or stable disease after 6 weeks (2 cycles), the patient may continue on the same doses of Tarceva and Avastin. A patient may receive treatment on this study for up to one year, unless his or her disease progresses or side effects become too severe. The starting dose is 100 mg daily of Tarceva and 7.5 mg/kg every 21 days of Avastin.</detailed_description>

Patient has received radiation therapy within the past 3 weeks. Patient has signs or symptoms of acute infection requiring systemic therapy. Patient exhibits confusion, disorientation, or has a history of major psychiatric illness that may impair patient's understanding of the informed consent. Patient requires total parenteral nutrition with lipids. Patient has a history of uncontrolled heart disease and/or uncontrolled hypertension (&gt; 150/100 mmHg).
