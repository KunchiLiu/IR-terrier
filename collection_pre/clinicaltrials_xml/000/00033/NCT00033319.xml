	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. The use of aspirin and/or folic acid may be effective in preventing recurrent polyps in patients who have had polyps removed previously. PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of aspirin and/or folic acid in preventing the recurrence of colorectal polyps.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether aspirin and/or folic acid prevents recurrence of colorectal adenomas in patients who have had colorectal adenomas removed. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral aspirin and oral folic acid daily. - Arm II: Patients receive oral aspirin and oral placebo daily. - Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo and oral folic acid daily. - Arm IV: Patients receive 2 oral placebos daily. In all arms, treatment continues for 3 years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. After completion of the 3-year intervention, all patients undergo a surveillance colonoscopy. Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,300 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
