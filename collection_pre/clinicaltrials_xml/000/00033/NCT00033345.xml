	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. Indole-3-carbinol may be effective in preventing breast cancer. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of indole-3-carbinol in preventing breast cancer in nonsmoking women who are at high risk for breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Indole-3-Carbinol in Preventing Breast Cancer in Nonsmoking Women Who Are at High Risk For Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and tolerability of indole-3-carbinol for the prevention of breast cancer in non-smoking women at high risk for breast cancer. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these participants. - Determine the effect of this drug on metabolites of estrogen in urine of these participants. - Determine other additional effects of this drug on selected indicators of drug metabolism and reproductive and hormonal function in these participants. - Assess any possible antineoplastic activity of this drug in these participants. - Determine the quality of life of participants receiving this drug. OUTLINE: This is a single-blind study. Participants ingest study compound twice daily on weeks 1-12 or 1-16. Study compound is dispensed on weeks 1, 5, and 9. At times, study compound is oral placebo, and at other times, oral indole-3-carbinol. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 4 weeks during study therapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 participants will be accrued for this study within 9 months.</detailed_description>
