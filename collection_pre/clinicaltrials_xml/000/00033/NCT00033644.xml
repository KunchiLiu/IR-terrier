	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus sargramostim in treating patients who have advanced, persistent, or recurrent cancer of the uterus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Sargramostim in Treating Patients With Cancer of the Uterus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of dacarbazine, mitomycin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin plus sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent leiomyosarcoma of the uterus. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive dacarbazine IV over 2 hours, followed by mitomycin IV over 2-5 minutes, doxorubicin IV over 2-5 minutes, and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once every 12 hours on days -6 to -3 before the first chemotherapy course and then on days 2-15 and 23-26 of all chemotherapy courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease receive a maximum of 4 courses. Patients achieving complete or partial response receive a maximum of 6 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-43 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-28 months.</detailed_description>
