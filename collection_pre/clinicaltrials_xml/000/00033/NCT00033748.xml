	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who have colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Colorectal Cancer Metastatic to the Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the 2-year recurrence-free survival of patients with minimal metastatic colorectal cancer after hepatic resection when treated with adjuvant monoclonal antibody 3H1 anti-idiotype vaccine and monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine. Secondary - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Beginning 6-12 weeks after curative hepatic resection, patients receive monoclonal antibody 3H1 anti-idiotype vaccine and monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine intracutaneously at separate sites on days 1, 15, 29, and 45, then subcutaneously monthly for 4 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 63 patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months.</detailed_description>
