	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: S-3304 may stop or slow the growth of solid tumors by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of S-3304 in treating patients who have solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S-3304 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile of S-3304 in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients. - Estimate the starting dose of this drug for subsequent phase II efficacy studies. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive oral S-3304 twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 6-8 patients receive escalating doses of S-3304 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 or 3 of 8 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-28 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
