	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan when administered in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). - Determine the toxicity of different doses of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the frequency of reversal of bone marrow involvement with NHL in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the antitumor response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan. Patients receive rituximab IV once weekly on weeks 1-4. After 4 doses of rituximab, patients without bone marrow involvement and cellularity greater than 50% expected receive rituximab IV once weekly on weeks 6 and 7 and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes with the final dose of rituximab (day 43). Cohorts of 5-6 patients receive escalating dose of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 4 of 5 or 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 6 and 12 weeks, every 2-3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed lowgrade, follicular, or transformed CD20positive Bcell nonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) Relapsed after prior chemotherapy OR chemotherapyresistant disease Failed at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen CD20positive Bcell population in lymph nodes or bone marrow for International Working Formulation A (small lymphocytic lymphoma) and transformed NHL Bone marrow involvement with lymphoma less than 25% bilaterally No impaired bone marrow reserve defined as at least 1 of the following criteria: Prior myeloablative therapies with bone marrow transplantation or peripheral blood stem cell rescue Platelet count less than 100,000/mm3 Bone marrow cellularity no greater than 15% Marked reduction in bone marrow precursors of one or more cell lines (e.g., granulocytic, megakaryocytic, or erythroid) Failed prior stem cell collection No CNS lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic lymphoma, or HIV or AIDSrelated lymphoma No diffuse small lymphocytic/marginal zone lymphoma with lymphocyte count greater than 5,000/mm^3 No pleural effusion NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
