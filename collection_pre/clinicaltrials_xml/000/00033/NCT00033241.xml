	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Erlotinib may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining erlotinib with gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining erlotinib with gemcitabine in treating patients who have newly diagnosed locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer or other solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Combined With Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer or Other Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine in patients with recently diagnosed, gemcitabine-naive, locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic carcinoma or other potentially responsive solid tumor. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the objective antitumor response rate and response duration in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the time to disease progression and duration of overall survival in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of erlotinib. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1-7 and oral erlotinib once daily beginning on day 3 of week 1 and continuing for 8 weeks (course 1). Patients receive subsequent courses of therapy comprising gemcitabine once weekly for 3 weeks and erlotinib once daily. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 12 additional patients are accrued and treated at the MTD as above. Patients are followed at 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 months.</detailed_description>
