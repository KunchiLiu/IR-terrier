	<brief_summary>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CCI-779 in treating patients who have mantle cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CCI-779 in Treating Patients With Mantle Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective responses in patients with previously treated mantle cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with CCI-779. II. Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine whether this drug inhibits cell proliferation pathways in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease receive a maximum of 6 courses. Patients with partial response receive a maximum of 12 courses. Patients with complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 2 years.</detailed_description>
