	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-247550 in treating patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-247550 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the clinical activity of BMS-247550, as measured by the tumor response rate, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine and irinotecan. - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. - Determine the response duration, time to progression, and survival in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive up to 4 additional courses of treatment beyond CR. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-55 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.</detailed_description>
