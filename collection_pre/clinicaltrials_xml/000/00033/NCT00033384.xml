	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: CI-1040 may stop the growth of tumors by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth and by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CI-1040 in treating patients who have metastatic or unresectable breast, colon, pancreatic, or non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CI-1040 in Treating Patients With Advanced Breast, Colon, Pancreatic, or Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of CI-1040 in patients with non-small cell lung, breast, colon, or pancreatic cancer. - Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. - Assess quality of life (overall and for each tumor type) of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the relationship between study drug concentration and antitumor response in these patients and target suppression and safety of this drug. - Correlate target suppression (pERK) with antitumor effects of this drug in these patients. - Correlate the mRNA expression profile of the tumors with antitumor effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor type (non-small cell lung vs breast vs colon vs pancreas). Patients receive oral CI-1040 twice daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 28 days during the first 6 months of study therapy. Patients are followed every 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52-172 patients (13-43 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
