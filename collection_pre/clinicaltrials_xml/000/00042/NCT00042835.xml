	<brief_summary>Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining erlotinib and radiation therapy with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining erlotinib and radiation therapy with combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib and Radiation Therapy Plus Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Inoperable Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib that can be administered with chest radiotherapy in combination with cisplatin and etoposide or carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of these regimens in these patients. III. Assess the clinical response (complete response, partial response, progressive disease, or stable disease) in patients treated with these regimens. IV. Determine levels of tumor epidermal growth factor expression in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of erlotinib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. GROUP 1: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 8, 29, and 36; etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 29-33; and oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-49. Patients undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7 weeks beginning on day 1. Patients receive consolidation therapy comprising docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 50, 71, and 92. Some patients may also receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 50-112. GROUP 2: Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 21. Patients receive consolidation therapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, 78, and 85 and oral erlotinib once daily on days 43-91. Patients undergo radiotherapy concurrently with consolidation therapy 5 days a week for 7 weeks beginning on day 43. In both groups, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib during concurrent chemoradiotherapy until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 12 patients from each group are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed at 8 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-48 patients (12-24 per treatment group) will be accrued for this study within 6-12 months.</detailed_description>
