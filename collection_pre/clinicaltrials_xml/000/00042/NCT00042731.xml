	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Eating a diet rich in isoflavones, compounds found in soy foods, or lycopene, a substance found in tomatoes, may keep prostate cancer from growing. Giving isoflavones or lycopene before surgery may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of isoflavones with that of lycopene before surgery in treating patients who have stage I or stage II prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Isoflavones &amp; Lycopene in Localized Prostate Ca:Prior to Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the effect of isoflavones vs lycopene prior to radical prostatectomy on intermediate biomarkers (e.g., indices of cell proliferation and apoptosis) in patients with localized prostate cancer. - Compare the effects of these nutritional supplements on increases in plasma levels and tissue levels of these agents in these patients. - Compare the effects of these nutritional supplements on changes in surrogate markers of disease progression (e.g., prostate-specific antigen levels) in these patients. - Compare the effects of these nutritional supplements on changes in serum steroid hormones, estradiol, and free testosterone in these patients. - Compare the magnitude of these changes in patients treated with these nutritional supplements vs patients in the control group. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage (stage I vs stage II) and presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Patients are randomized to 1 of 7 treatment groups. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 87 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
