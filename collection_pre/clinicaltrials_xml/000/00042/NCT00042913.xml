	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as epratuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of epratuzumab in treating patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epratuzumab in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate of patients with diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with epratuzumab. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive low-dose epratuzumab IV over 1 hour once weekly for 4 weeks. - Arm II: Patients receive low-dose epratuzumab IV over 1 hour once weekly for 8 weeks. - Arm III: Patients receive high-dose epratuzumab IV over 1 hour once weekly for 4 weeks. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
