PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying the effectiveness of modafinil in treating fatigue in patients who are receiving chemotherapy for cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modafinil in Treating Fatigue in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the degree to which modafinil can reduce fatigue in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. - Assess the relationship between depression and fatigue in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Beginning on day 5 of the second course of chemotherapy, patients receive oral modafinil once daily. - Arm II: Beginning on day 5 of the second course of chemotherapy, patients receive oral placebo once daily. Treatment in both arms continues until day 7 of course 4 of chemotherapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Fatigue and quality of life are assessed on day 7 of courses 2-4 of chemotherapy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 837 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 2.5 years.</detailed_description>
