	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of FR901228 in treating patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FR901228 in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the pattern of adverse clinical experience in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, or intermediate-grade or follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with FR901228 (depsipeptide). - Determine the disease response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic correlates of this drug, including measurement of serum plasma levels, H3 and H4 acetylation, apoptosis induction, differentiation, and multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype expression in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed monthly. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: One of the following diagnoses: Histologically confirmed refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) Failed anthracyclinebased chemotherapy Ineligible for or refused allogeneic stem cell transplantation Elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML Ineligible for or refused standard chemotherapy Histologically confirmed highrisk myelodysplastic syndromes Eligible subtypes include: Refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) RAEB in transformation Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia Ineligible for or refused allogeneic bone marrow transplantation Histologically confirmed intermediategrade nonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) Relapsed after highdose therapy OR Ineligible for allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation Evaluable lesions by radiologic study or physical examination Histologically confirmed follicular NHL Progressed after anthracyclinebased chemotherapy and rituximab Evaluable lesions by radiologic study or physical examination NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
