	<brief_summary>To study the tolerance and toxicity of the combination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon gamma (IFN-G) or as single agent TNF or IFN-G in HIV infected patients. To selectively monitor the immune system of AIDS related complex (ARC) patients who receive either combination therapy or TNF or IFN-G alone. To obtain information on the effectiveness of combination therapy or TNF or IFN-G alone against HIV in ARC patients. Recombinant TNF and recombinant IFN-G have been shown to be effective against the virus which causes AIDS and ARC in some laboratory studies, but may increase virus replication in other laboratory studies. Previous studies in humans showed no increase in virus cultures and some decrease in measurements of virus. Extensive preclinical data show that TNF and IFN-G are more effective together than separately in laboratory and animal studies. As single agents, both TNF and IFN-G have modest effect against HIV. Studies have demonstrated that TNF and IFN-G, in combination, can not only inhibit HIV infection of previously uninfected cells, but also can selectively induce the destruction of acutely infected target cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recombinant TNF and recombinant IFN-G have been shown to be effective against the virus which causes AIDS and ARC in some laboratory studies, but may increase virus replication in other laboratory studies. Previous studies in humans showed no increase in virus cultures and some decrease in measurements of virus. Extensive preclinical data show that TNF and IFN-G are more effective together than separately in laboratory and animal studies. As single agents, both TNF and IFN-G have modest effect against HIV. Studies have demonstrated that TNF and IFN-G, in combination, can not only inhibit HIV infection of previously uninfected cells, but also can selectively induce the destruction of acutely infected target cells. Patients with ARC who are positive for HIV antibody are randomized to receive one of three treatment arms: (1) TNF alone by intramuscular injection (IM); (2) IFN-G alone by IM; (3) TNF plus IFN-G. Patients receive IM injections 3 times weekly for 4 months (16 weeks). Repeated physical examinations and laboratory tests are used to monitor patients' safety. Serial HIV cultures and core antigen assays are employed to obtain evidence of antiviral activity and serial T cell and skin tests are used to measure immunologic effect.</detailed_description>
