	<brief_summary>To compare the safety and efficacy of two doses of clarithromycin in combination with ethambutol and either rifabutin or clofazimine for the treatment of disseminated Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) disease in AIDS patients. Recommendations have been issued for AIDS patients with disseminated MAC to be treated with at least two antimycobacterial agents and for every regimen to include a macrolide (clarithromycin or azithromycin). However, the optimal treatment for disseminated MAC remains unknown.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Four Different Treatment Approaches for Patients Who Have Mycobacterium Avium Complex Disease (MAC) Plus AIDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recommendations have been issued for AIDS patients with disseminated MAC to be treated with at least two antimycobacterial agents and for every regimen to include a macrolide (clarithromycin or azithromycin). However, the optimal treatment for disseminated MAC remains unknown. Patients are randomized to receive clarithromycin at one of two doses plus ethambutol and either rifabutin or clofazimine. Patients are followed at 1, 2, and 4 months and every 4 months thereafter for a minimum of 1.5 years to a common closing date.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Concurrent Medication: Recommended in patients with CD4 count &lt;= 200 cells/mm3: Antiretroviral therapy. PCP prophylaxis. Allowed in all patients: Isoniazid preventive therapy. Patients must have: HIV infection. Evidence of disseminated MAC infection. NOTE: Pregnant women are permitted to enroll following counseling by their clinician regarding the potential negative side effects of the study medications.

Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded: Known hypersensitivity to the study drugs. Other concurrent mycobacterial disease requiring therapy, i.e., disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infection or active tuberculosis. Concurrent Medication: Excluded: Additional medications with antimycobacterial activity (unless patient is failing or intolerant of assigned study regimen). Drugs with potential additive toxicity or with potential interaction with study drugs (e.g., fluconazole).</criteria>
