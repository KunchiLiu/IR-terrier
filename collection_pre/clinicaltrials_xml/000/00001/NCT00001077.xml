	<brief_title>A Comparison of Two Caloric Supplements in the Prevention of Weight Loss in Patients With AIDS Who Take Daily Multivitamin and Mineral Supplements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized to one of 3 study arms: Arm 1 - Peptamen drinks + multivitamin and mineral supplement, taken in addition to regular diet for 4 months Arm 2 - NuBasics drinks or equivalent amounts of NuBasics soups or bars + multivitamin and mineral supplement, taken in addition to regular diet for 4 months Arm 3 - Multivitamin and mineral supplement, taken in addition to regular diet for 4 months. At months 0, 2, and 4, patients will be assessed for weight, body cell mass, patient-reported physical activity level, and dietary intake (by 24-hour dietary recall). At months 2 and 4, they will also be assessed for compliance with study regimen. Patients who complete their 4 month follow up visit will be provided with a 30 day supply of the caloric supplement of their choice (Peptamen or NuBasics) and a 30 day supply of the study multivitamin supplement.</detailed_description>
