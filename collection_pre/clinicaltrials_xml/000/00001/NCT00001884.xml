	<brief_summary>Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a condition in which the lungs of a patient become scarred and fibrous. It has been known to occur in as many as 40% of patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The cause of the pulmonary fibrosis in patients with RA is unknown. Researchers hope to improve their understanding of the disease process involved in PF and RA by analyzing specimens collected by bronchoscopy, lung biopsy, lung transplantation, or autopsy from patients with these conditions. The purpose of this study is to collect specimens from rheumatoid arthritis patients with and without pulmonary fibrosis as well as patients with pulmonary fibrosis without associated diseases or cause (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Specimen Collection for Individuals With Lung Disease Associated With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The etiology of pulmonary fibrosis in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis is unknown. Analysis of blood and specimens procured by bronchoscopy, lung biopsy, lung transplantation, or post-mortem examination from patients with this disorder will contribute to our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis in rheumatoid arthritis. The purpose of this protocol is to obtain blood and specimens by bronchoscopy, lung biopsy, lung transplantation, or post-mortem examination from rheumatoid arthritis patients with and without pulmonary fibrosis, individuals with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and healthy research volunteers.</detailed_description>
