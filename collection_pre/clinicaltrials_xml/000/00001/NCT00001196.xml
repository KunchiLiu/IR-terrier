	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate patients with complaints of dry mouth to determine the cause and severity of their salivary gland dysfunction and their possible eligibility for other NIDCR protocols. Salivary gland secretions have antibacterial, lubricatory, remineralizing, digestive, buffering and cleansing properties. Impaired function of these glands can cause an increase in tooth decay; a variety of oral hard and soft tissue changes, with painful, burning, or ulcerated oral mucosal; problems chewing, swallowing, and speaking; and diminished taste and smell. Patients with dry mouth complaints suggestive of salivary gland dysfunction may be eligible for this study. In addition, patients with recent onset of arthritis may enroll. Patients with arthritis are at risk for developing a disorder called Sjogren's syndrome, in which the glands that produce saliva may be damaged. Participants will have a complete medical and dental history. Saliva samples will be collected from the major salivary glands, which are located in the cheeks and under the jaw. Several blood samples will also be drawn for tests. Some patients will have a biopsy of the minor salivary glands, usually from the lower lip, to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome and determine the extent of changes in the salivary glands. The ability to taste and smell may also be evaluated, and patients may have an ultrasound examination of their swallowing function.</brief_summary>

Participants with dry mouth complaints suggestive of salivary gland dysfunction may be eligible for this study. Participants will have a complete medical and dental history. Saliva samples will be collected from the major salivary glands, which are located in the cheeks and under the tongue. Several blood samples will also be drawn for tests. Some participants will have a biopsy of the minor salivary glands, usually from inside the lower lip, to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome and to determine the extent of changes in the salivary glands. An eye examination including a standard eye examination and a dry eye assessment is done. The ability to taste and smell may also be evaluated, and participants may have an ultrasound examination of their swallowing function.</detailed_description>
