	<brief_summary>This study is a pilot trial designed to evaluate topical antiflammin-2, a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitor, in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. Antiflammin-2 in an ointment base, or the vehicle alone will each be applied four times per day to a single plaque in a randomized, double-blinded fashion.</brief_summary>
