	<brief_summary>Botulism is a severe form of food poisoning caused by bacteria. This bacteria produces several toxins one of which is botulinum toxin A. This toxin causes the symptoms of food poisoning. Small amounts of botulinum toxin A have been used to treat speech disorders such as stuttering and problems with the muscles of the eyes. The study examines the effectiveness of botulinum toxin as treatment for a variety of movement disorders. The goals of the study are to refine the technique of treatment to provide the best results, to improve the understanding of how botulinum toxin works on movement disorders, and find other conditions that may be treatable with botulinum toxin. In addition, researchers also plan to study the possible use of botulinum toxin F alone and in combination with botulinum toxin A in patients who do not respond to botulinum A toxin treatment.&lt;TAB&gt;</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Botulinum Toxin for the Treatment of Involuntary Movement Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy of botulinum toxin (BTX) has now been demonstrated for a variety of diseases associated with involuntary muscle spasms or movement. The application of botulinum toxin therapy to movement disorders requires treatment tailored to the individual patient and specific techniques of injection. This protocol 1) provides for training of physicians in the use of botulinum toxin and 2) allows us to provide botulinum toxin injections for patients participating in other studies on the physiology of sensorimotor systems and physiological effects of botulinum toxin. Patients can be in the study at any one time either for the teaching value or for participation in other protocols, or both.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients will be eligible for participation if they have a disorder that, in the judgment of the treating physician, might be amenable to treatment with BTX. Applicable disorders include but are not limited to dystonia, hemifacial spasm, blepharospasm, tremor, spasmodic dysphonia, tics, vocal fold tremor, oral lingual dyskinesia, tardive dyskinesia, spasticity, and spasmodic dysphonia. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients will be excluded form participation if: 1. They are pregnant or breastfeeding, for the duration of the condition. 2. They require treatment with an aminoglycoside antibiotic, until treatment is complete. 3. For laryngeal injections, they have a paradoxical vocal fold movement with intermittent stridor due to either gastroesophageal reflux or emotional disorders.</criteria>
