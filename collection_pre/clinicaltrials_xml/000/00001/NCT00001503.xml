	<brief_title>Follow-up Protocol for Patients With Cancer/AIDS/Skin Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: - Patients enrolled on CCR clinical protocols may require long term follow-up to assess outcome (e.g., survival) or the effects of prior therapy. - Keeping the primary treatment protocols open after accrual is complete in order to follow patients for long term outcome is an administrative burden on investigators and the IRB. Objectives: -To provide follow-up for patients who are long term survivors previously enrolled Center for Cancer Research (CCR) trial but who may not currently be enrolled on a research protocol. Eligibility: -Patients who were previously enrolled on a CCR protocol and who are not eligible for an active NCI intramural primary research protocol. Design: - The medical procedures/tests will be based on the patient's diagnosis, treatment and supporting clinical information. This is a follow-up study in which only standard tests and procedures are to be performed. - Clinical information that is relevant to the patients prior protocols will be collected for research purposes. - Procedures that entail more than minimal risk to the patient should not be performed for research purposes on this protocol.</detailed_description>
