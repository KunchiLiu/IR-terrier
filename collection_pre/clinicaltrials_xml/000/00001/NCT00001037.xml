	<brief_summary>To determine the safety and immunogenicity of 200 mcg MN rgp160 vaccine (Immuno-AG) versus placebo, administered on two immunization schedules to healthy volunteers. Per 06/15/94 amendment, to determine the safety and immunogenicity of 800 versus 200 mcg given as a fourth immunization at 9 or 11 months after the third injection (i.e., at month 17). A gp160 vaccine developed from the IIIB strain of HIV-1 has been found to be safe and immunogenic in healthy adults. Since the MN strain of HIV-1 is representative of a larger proportion of HIV-1 isolates in the United States than is the IIIB strain, evaluation of a gp160 vaccine derived from the MN strain is important.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A gp160 vaccine developed from the IIIB strain of HIV-1 has been found to be safe and immunogenic in healthy adults. Since the MN strain of HIV-1 is representative of a larger proportion of HIV-1 isolates in the United States than is the IIIB strain, evaluation of a gp160 vaccine derived from the MN strain is important. Volunteers are randomized to receive 200 mcg MN rgp160 or placebo at months 0, 1, and 6 or at months 0, 2, and 8. For each immunization schedule, ten volunteers receive vaccine and two volunteers receive placebo. Per amendment, volunteers receive a fourth immunization of 800 or 200 mcg (or placebo) at 9 or 11 months after the third injection (i.e., at month 17) and are followed for 6 months afterward.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Subjects must have: Normal history and physical exam. Negative test for HIV by ELISA within 6 weeks prior to immunization. CD4 count &gt;= 400 cells/mm3. Normal urine dipstick with esterase and nitrate. No history of immunodeficiency, chronic illness, autoimmune disease, or use of immunosuppresssive medications. Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Subjects with the following conditions are excluded: Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen. Medical or psychiatric condition or occupational responsibilities that preclude compliance. Active syphilis (NOTE: If serology is documented to be a false positive or due to a remote (&gt; 6 months) infection, subject is eligible). Active tuberculosis (NOTE: Subjects with a positive PPD and normal xray showing no evidence of TB and who do not require INH therapy are eligible). Subjects with the following prior conditions are excluded: History of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines. Prior Medication: Excluded: Prior HIV vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines within the past 60 days. NOTE: Medically indicated subunit or killed vaccines (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal) do not exclude but should be administered at least 2 weeks prior to HIV immunizations. Experimental agents within the past 30 days. Prior Treatment: Excluded: Blood products or immunoglobulin within the past 6 months. Higher risk behavior for HIV infection as determined by screening questionnaire, including: History of injection drug use within 12 months prior to study entry. Higher or intermediate risk sexual behavior.</criteria>
