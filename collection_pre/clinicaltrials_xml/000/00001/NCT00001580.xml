	<brief_summary>Acquisition of fresh tumor and normal tissue samples are necessary for the preparation of cDNA libraries, microarray chips, and tissue specific probes, and proteomics development and validation. This protocol will allow acquisition of samples at the time of tissue sampling for surgery, diagnostic tests, or therapeutic phereses. These samples will be forwarded without patient identifiers, pathology reports, or other labels. Tissue pathology will be verified within the Laboratory of Pathology and samples used strictly for CGAP and Proteomic Initiative indications.</brief_summary>
