	<brief_summary>To determine the safety of stem cell harvesting after administration of filgrastim ( G-CSF ) to mobilize bone marrow stem cells into the peripheral blood in patients at various stages of HIV-1 infection as well as in HIV-negative volunteers. To determine the surface phenotypic and functional characteristics as well as the viral load in the stem cells obtained following this procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Stem Cells and Filgrastim</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients and volunteers receive seven daily subcutaneous injections of G-CSF. On days 5 and 6 of drug administration, patients have peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested by leukapheresis. HIV-positive patients are stratified into three cohorts based on CD4 count and presence of symptoms. If no increase in number of harvested stem cells and no grade 4 bone pain toxicity occur in two of the first three patients in a cohort, then the last three patients in that cohort will receive a dose escalation. Patients are followed for 24 weeks.</detailed_description>
