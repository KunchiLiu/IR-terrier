	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the treatment and natural history of acromegaly. We have a longstanding interest in acromegaly treatment, and a cohort that has been followed for 30 years, or more in some cases. We will continue to follow patients and recruit new patients for treatment and follow-up. Blood and pituitary tumor tissue (when available through clinical care) will be saved for future analyses related to acromegaly.</brief_summary>
