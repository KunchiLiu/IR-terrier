	<brief_summary>This study will determine whether patients who have been infected with the Lyme bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi, and treated with antibiotics still have the bacteria alive inside them and whether it is causing their symptoms. The information from this study may serve as a basis for developing stringent diagnostic criteria for Lyme disease and the establishment of future treatment trials. Individuals in the following categories may be eligible for this study: chronic Lyme disease; chronic Lyme arthritis; seropositive control (are infected with the bacteria that causes Lyme disease but do not have disease symptoms); recovered control (have been sick with Lyme disease but were treated successfully and are currently well); control with multiple sclerosis (patients with multiple sclerosis); and healthy volunteers. Patients in the chronic Lyme disease category must be age 13 and above; all others must be age18 and above. Candidates will be screened with blood and urine tests. Participants will have a physical examination and the following tests: Blood tests Includes HLA-typing, a genetic test of immune system markers; Leukapheresis Collection of large numbers of white blood cells Whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are removed and the rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through the same needle used to draw the blood or through another needle in the other arm. (Alternatively, patients will 100 cc (about 7 tablespoons) of blood drawn.); Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) Collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord). A local anesthetic is administered and a needle is inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back where the cerebrospinal fluid circulates below the spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is collected through the needle; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain Imaging of the brain using a strong magnetic field and radio waves instead of X-rays. During the scan, the patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. He or she can speak with a staff member via an intercom at all times during the procedure; Neuropsychologic testing; Some participants may also have a hearing test and urine collection. Participants whose test results are positive for Borrelia burgdorferi will be followed at NIH at intervals of 3 to 6 months until it is determined whether there is infection. Those who are infected will be offered treatment with the antibiotic ceftriaxone. Following treatment, patients will return to the NIH Clinical Center for follow-up visits 1 week after treatment and again at 3, 6 and 12 months. The lumbar puncture, hearing examination, blood and urine tests will be repeated at these visits to evaluate the response to treatment, and the leukapheresis will be repeated for research purposes. Patients whose MRI was abnormal during therapy will have a repeat MRI at the 3-month, 6-month and 1-year visits. All participants with chronic Lyme disease, chronic Lyme arthritis, seropositive controls and recovered controls may be reevaluated at intervals of 6 to 12 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Lyme Disease: Clinical, Microbiological and Immunological Characteristics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lyme disease has emerged as the leading vector-borne disease in the United States. Despite how much has been learned about Lyme borreliosis in the past decade, there are still many remaining areas of uncertainty. One fundamental question is whether persistent signs and symptoms of disease, despite the administration of what is currently considered to be adequate antibiotic therapy, are due to ongoing active borrelial infection, to a post-infectious syndrome, to irreversible sequelae of earlier tissue injury or due to a condition unrelated to Lyme disease. Reliable objective markers of infection, of clinical status and of host responses to the organism are required to discern the scope and the implications of persistent borrelial infection, the effectiveness of current treatment options, and the development of new therapeutic approaches. The goal of this study is to assemble and follow a well-characterized cohort of patients with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome and relevant controls that will yield a prospective database upon which stringent diagnostic criteria can be established and future therapeutic trials can be designed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Screening: Age greater than or equal to 13 years old. Suspect of suffering from Lyme disease. PostTreatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS): For the purposes of this study, PTLDS is defined as occurring in male or female patients age 13 and above who have been diagnosed with confirmed Lyme disease, have received recommended antibiotic therapy and have persistent or relapsing symptoms and/or signs for at least six months after therapy. They also should have no other documented explanation for their signs and symptoms and have positive serum antibodies to B.burgdorferi confirmed by Western blot according to the CDC criteria (IgG immunoblot is considered positive if five of the following 10 bands are present: 18 kDa, 21 kDa (OspC), 28 kDa, 30 kDa, 39 kDa, 41 kDa (Fla), 45 kDa, 58 kDa (not GroEL), 66 kDa, and 93 kDa). Lyme arthritis controls: For the purposes of this study, Lyme arthritis is defined as occurring in an otherwise healthy male or female aged 18 and above who have intermittent episodes of arthritis involving one or few joint, without any other cause being documented, and have positive serum antibodies to B.burgdorferi confirmed by Western blot according to the CDC criteria. Recovered Controls: For the purposes of this study, a recovered control is defined as an otherwise healthy male or female aged 18 and above who has had Lyme disease, fulfilling the CDC Lyme Disease National Surveillance Case Definition and who had received accepted antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease (at least 3 months since the end of antibiotic therapy before protocol evaluation) and who are currently asymptomatic. Seropositive Controls: For the purposes of this study, a serpositive control is defined as an otherwise healthy male or female aged 18 and above who has positive serum IgG antibody to B.burgdorferi by Western blot according to the CDC criteria and are asymptomatic and who recall no episodes of disease compatible with Lyme infection and have not received antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease. OspA vaccinated control: For the purposes of this study, a OspA vaccinated control is defined as an otherwise healthy male or female aged 18 and above who has received at least two doses of the OspA vaccine for Lyme disease (Lymerix [R]). These controls may have a positive ELISA for B.burgdorferi but a negative (or unreadable) IgG western blot. Multiple sclerosis controls: For the purposes of this study, a multiple sclerosis control is defined as an otherwise healthy male or female aged 18 and above with relapsingremitting or progressive multiple sclerosis as defined by the Clinical Trial Committee of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and no evidence of prior exposure to B.burgdorferi as indicate by negative history for Lyme disease and negative Western blot for B.burgdorferi in the serum by the CDC criteria. Patients should have a Kurtzke or Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) between 1 to 5. Healthy Volunteers: For the purpose of this study, a healthy volunteer is defined as healthy male or female, age 18 and above, with no history compatible with acute or chronic Lyme disease and negative western blot to B.burgdorferi in the serum by the CDC criteria. All study participants must agree to allow their samples to be used for future research.
