	<brief_summary>Our past ultrasound research has indicated a need for baseline normative tongue data against which to compare our disordered speech populations. Subjects with normal speech and hearing who represent different ages and sexes, will be studied with respect to tongue shape and movement patterns. Recently developed parameters such as curve fitting, curve averaging, and polar coordinates will be used to create baseline data categories. In addition, new parameters and improved instruments will be developed as previously to produce a data base which can be used across disciplines.</brief_summary>
