	<brief_summary>This study seeks to evaluate the impact of Starbright World (SBW) on hospitalized children. SBW is a virtual environment designed to link seriously ill children into an interactive online community where they can play games, learn about their condition, or talk with other ill children who are connected to the network. Our outcome evaluation of SBW will include assessments of pain, mood (anxious, depressed and energetic), anger, loneliness, and willingness to return to the NIH for treatment of children who are being treated at NIH. They will be assessed while engaging in "normal" recreational activities (in one of two available playrooms) and while using Starbright World. In addition, we will conduct a process evaluation of the implementation of Starbright World.</brief_summary>
