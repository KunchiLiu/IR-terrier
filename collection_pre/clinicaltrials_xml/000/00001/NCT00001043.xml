	<brief_summary>AMENDED 8/94: To expand the safety and immunogenicity profile of MN rgp160 vaccine (Immuno-AG) by administering a higher dose (800 mcg) at 0, 1, 6, and 12 months and 0, 2, 8 and 14 months (these two schedules were compared in VEU 013A using a dose of 200 mcg). To obtain plasma following the fourth immunization. To evaluate skin test reactivity. ORIGINAL (replaced): To determine in healthy volunteers the safety and immunogenicity of two immunizations of MN rgp160 vaccine (Immuno-AG) in combination with a live recombinant vaccinia virus LAV HIV-1 gp160 vaccine (HIVAC-1e) versus DryVax (the standard smallpox vaccine that was used for many years) control in combination with placebo. ORIGINAL (replaced): A gp160 vaccine derived from the MN strain, the most prevalent strain of HIV-1 in the United States, has been developed. A previous study showed that a combination vaccine strategy, consisting of priming with HIVAC-1e followed by boosting with a gp160 subunit vaccine, resulted in humoral and cellular immune responses of greater and longer duration than either vaccine alone. Thus, a live vector/subunit boost approach using the MN rgp160 vaccine merits investigation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I, Multicenter, Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Vaccinia-Derived MN HIV-1 Recombinant Envelope Glycoprotein (rgp160) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus at Two Different Vaccination Schedules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ORIGINAL (replaced): A gp160 vaccine derived from the MN strain, the most prevalent strain of HIV-1 in the United States, has been developed. A previous study showed that a combination vaccine strategy, consisting of priming with HIVAC-1e followed by boosting with a gp160 subunit vaccine, resulted in humoral and cellular immune responses of greater and longer duration than either vaccine alone. Thus, a live vector/subunit boost approach using the MN rgp160 vaccine merits investigation. AMENDED 8/94: Volunteers are randomized to receive 800 mcg MN rgp160 vaccine (Immuno-AG) or adjuvant control (placebo) on one of two dosing schedules. Sixteen volunteers receive candidate vaccine and four volunteers receive placebo. ORIGINAL (replaced): Volunteers are randomized to receive either HIVAC-1e on days 0 and 56 followed by immunization with MN rgp160 vaccine on days 224 and 364, or DryVax control on days 0 and 56 followed by placebo on days 224 and 364. Ten volunteers are entered on the MN rgp160 vaccine arm and two volunteers on the placebo arm. PER AMENDMENT 7/96: Two additional booster immunizations of 600 mcg of MN rgp 120/HIV-1 vaccine given at study months 22 and 24 to consenting St. Louis University volunteers.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Subjects must have: Normal history and physical exam. Negative test for HIV by ELISA within 6 weeks prior to immunization. Negative test for HIV by Western blot. CD4 count &gt;= 400 cells/mm3. No history of smallpox vaccination. Normal urine dipstick with esterase and nitrate. No history of immunodeficiency, chronic illness, autoimmune disease, or use of immunosuppresssive medications. Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Subjects with the following conditions are excluded: Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen. Medical or psychiatric condition or occupational responsibilities that preclude compliance. Active syphilis (NOTE: If serology is documented to be a false positive or due to a remote (&gt; 6 months) infection, subject is eligible). Active tuberculosis (NOTE: Subjects with a positive PPD and normal xray showing no evidence of TB and who do not require INH therapy are eligible). Eczema. Household contact with persons meeting any of the following criteria: pregnancy, &lt; 12 months of age, eczema, or immunodeficiency disease or use of immunosuppressive medications. Subjects with the following prior conditions are excluded: History of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines. Eczema within the past year. PER 8/94 AMENDMENT: History of cancer unless surgically excised with reasonable assurance of cure. PER 8/94 AMENDMENT: History of serious allergic reaction requiring hospitalization or emergent medical care. Prior Medication: Excluded: Prior HIV vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines within the past 60 days. NOTE: Medically indicated subunit or killed vaccines (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal) do not exclude but should be administered at least 2 weeks prior to HIV immunizations. Experimental agents within the past 30 days. Prior Treatment: Excluded: Blood products or immunoglobulin within the past 6 months. Higher risk behavior for HIV infection as determined by screening questionnaire, including: History of injection drug use within 12 months prior to study entry. Higher or intermediate risk sexual behavior.</criteria>
