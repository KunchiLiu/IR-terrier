	<brief_summary>This project will measure magnetization transfer (MT) parameters on normal subjects using two novel approaches. The first is the investigation of asymmetric MT effects with respect to the zero or on-resonance reference point. The technique measures the difference in MT effect between two symmetrically positioned off-resonance MT pulses in the positive and negative frequency ranges. Prior research with this technique in the kidney show a difference in the macromolecular lineshape that correlates to a specific metabolite. The second approach, utilizing a subset of the acquisitions from the first approach, will test newly developed formulation to calculate the macromolecular fraction, or fraction of proton density that accounts for MT. We foresee these measurements may significantly develop our understanding of MT and introduce diagnostic and quantitative tools to study human tissues.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Normal control between the ages of 18 70 years of age who are capable of giving informed consent. Subjects must not have a condition which would preclude their use for technical development (e.g. paralyzed hemidiaphragm, morbid obesity, claustrophobia, etc.). Subjects must not have a condition which would present unnecessary risks (e.g. pregnancy, surgery of uncertain type, symptoms of pheochromocystoma or insulinoma, etc.). Lactating women and subjects with hemoglobinopathies, asthma, or renal or hepatic disease will be excluded from studies involving the administration of contrast agents. Must not have a contraindication to MR scanning such as surgery that involves metal clips or wires which might be expected to concentrate radiofrequency fields or cause tissue damage from twisting in a magnetic field. Examples include: aneurysm clip; implanted neural stimulator; implanted cardiac pacemaker or autodefibrillator; cochlear implant; ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings); insulin pump.</criteria>
