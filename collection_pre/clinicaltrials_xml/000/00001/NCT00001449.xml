	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical toxicities associated with administering sequential dFdC as a one hour infusion followed by a continuous infusion of FUdR over 24 hours with low dose oral LV weekly for three weeks out of four.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The MTD and biochemically active dose of FUDR as a 24-hour and gemcitabine as a 2-hour infusion will be determined first (Part A); if the biochemically active FUDR dose is less than the MTD, new patients will be entered to determine the maximum tolerated duration of FUDR infusion (Part B).</detailed_description>
