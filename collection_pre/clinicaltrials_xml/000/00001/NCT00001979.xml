	<brief_summary>Kidney diseases related to the immune system include, nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and nephritis associated with connective tissue disorders. This study will allow researchers to admit and follow patients suffering from autoimmune diseases of the kidney. It will attempt to provide information about the causes and specific abnormalities associated with autoimmune kidney disease. Patients with kidney disease as a result of their immune system, and patients with diseases of the immune system who may later develop kidney disease, will be potential subjects for this study. Patients will undergo a history and physical examination, and standard laboratory test to more closely understand the causes, signs, symptoms, and responses to medication of these diseases. Based on these evaluations the patients may qualify as candidates for other experimental studies. At any time these patients may be asked to submit blood or urine samples for further research.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with known or suspected immunologically-mediated kidney diseases, including but not limited to, nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and nephritis associated with other systemic or connective tissue disorders, will be evaluated at the Clinical Center. Patients who have immunologically-mediated diseases with potential for kidney disease will be evaluated as well. Studies will include characterization of the clinical and laboratory features of these disorders, studies of natural history and complications, evaluation of responses to standard treatment, and determination of the patients' eligibility to enter other experimental diagnostic or therapeutic protocols. Patients may be asked to contribute blood and/or urine samples for immunological research studies.</detailed_description>
