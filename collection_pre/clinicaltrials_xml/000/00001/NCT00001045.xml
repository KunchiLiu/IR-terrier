	<brief_summary>To validate that the alteration of codon 215 of reverse transcriptase in plasma virus precedes the increase in viral burden as measured in the peripheral blood and the decline in CD4 count that have been observed in association with clinical failure on zidovudine (AZT). To determine whether alternative regimens of antiretroviral agents alter the course of viral burden as measured in the peripheral blood and CD4 changes in patients with HIV infection. To obtain further data on the safety and immunologic and virologic response to AZT/didanosine/nevirapine. Of the HIV-1 mutations reported to be associated with zidovudine resistance, the mutation at codon 215 of the reverse transcriptase gene is the most commonly occurring and has the greatest impact on susceptibility. When this mutation appears, a change in drugs may prevent further immunologic and virologic deterioration.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Of the HIV-1 mutations reported to be associated with zidovudine resistance, the mutation at codon 215 of the reverse transcriptase gene is the most commonly occurring and has the greatest impact on susceptibility. When this mutation appears, a change in drugs may prevent further immunologic and virologic deterioration. Initially, all patients receive AZT alone. After detection of a 215 mutation in plasma RNA, patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms: AZT alone, AZT plus ddI, or AZT/ddI plus nevirapine. Patients are followed every 8 weeks and receive treatment for up to 4 years. AS PER AMENDMENT 5/9/96: All AZT monotherapy options have been eliminated. Patients will be randomized to either Arm II or Arm III, regardless of their codon 215 status. All patients who were randomized to Arm I following a mutation at codon 215 will be rerandomized to Arm II or Arm III. All patients who were randomized to either Arm II or Arm III following a mutation at codon 215 will remain on their initial randomized assignment.</detailed_description>
