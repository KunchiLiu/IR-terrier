	<brief_summary>To determine in healthy HIV-negative volunteers the safety and immunogenicity of rgp120/HIV-1SF2 (BIOCINE) formulated with each of seven adjuvants. PER AMENDMENT 3/6/96: Purpose of the extension study - To determine the ability of immunization with rgp 120/SF-2 to induce an HIV-1 envelope-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in volunteers who receive rsgp 120/MN skin testing. One approach to improve the immunogenicity of an HIV-1 subunit protein vaccine is to combine the immunogen with an adjuvant. Adjuvants may augment vaccine immunogenicity by several mechanisms, and as a result induce a more favorable antibody response with high titers, which appear earlier in the course of immunization and persist over time.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Clinical Trial to Compare the Safety and Immunogenicity of Recombinant Envelope Protein rgp120/HIV-1SF2 (BIOCINE) Combined With Seven Adjuvants in Healthy HIV-1 Uninfected Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One approach to improve the immunogenicity of an HIV-1 subunit protein vaccine is to combine the immunogen with an adjuvant. Adjuvants may augment vaccine immunogenicity by several mechanisms, and as a result induce a more favorable antibody response with high titers, which appear earlier in the course of immunization and persist over time. Volunteers are randomized to receive 50 mcg rgp120/HIV-1SF2 in combination with one of seven different adjuvants: aluminum hydroxide (alum), monophosphoryl lipid A, liposome-encapsulated monophosphoryl lipid A, MF59, MTP-PE/MF59, Syntex adjuvant formulation (SAF/2), and SAF/2 plus threonyl muramyl dipeptide (threonyl MDP). An additional placebo control arm of volunteers receive alum only. Doses are administered at 0, 2, and 6 months. Volunteers are followed for 1 year after the last immunization. Per 8/5/94 amendment, eligible volunteers except those who received monophosphoryl lipid A for the first three immunizations may receive a fourth dose at month 15. PER AMENDMENT 3/6/96: Extension Study- Protocol 015 has been modified to add a special DTH study. At the end of the study, on day 784, intradermal injections of MN rsgp 120 will be administered to consenting volunteers who have received 4 immunizations as part of protocol 015. Follow up will be extended to 56 days after administration of the intradermal injections.</detailed_description>
