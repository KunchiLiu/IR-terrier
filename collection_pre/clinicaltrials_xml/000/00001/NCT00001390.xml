	<brief_summary>Saliva is critical in maintaining oral health and comfort. Our laboratory has investigated several disorders of salivary glands. The purpose of this protocol is to obtain data from healthy volunteers for comparison with data from patients with salivary dysfunction. We plan to utilize the NIH Clinical Center Clinical Research Volunteer Program to solicit paid participation from healthy adults. Study procedures are accomplished in 2-3 outpatient visits that include an interview, saliva collection, lip biopsy, clinical laboratory studies, dry eye examination, and lip biopsy follow up, as needed. These are routine diagnostic procedures. Biopsy specimens may be used in clinical and laboratory studies, such as in vitro biochemical analysis or in vivo transplantation. Some of the Healthy Volunteers may be asked to participate in an MRI study of the salivary glands.</brief_summary>

Some of the Healthy Volunteers may be asked to participate in an MRI study of the salivary glands. The outcome measurement for this study is to determine those healthy subjects whose data and specimens can be used as control comparison for our patient subjects in our Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome studies (84-D-0056, 99-D-0070, 11-D-0094 and/or 11-D-0172).</detailed_description>
