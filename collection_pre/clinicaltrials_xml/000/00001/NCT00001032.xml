	<brief_summary>PRIMARY: To determine safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of zidovudine (AZT) and zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine; ddC) when given in combination in clinically stable AZT-treated children. SECONDARY: To compare combination therapy with mono drug therapy for antiviral activity and laboratory markers of disease progression, as determined by virologic and immunologic determinations. To evaluate the influence of combination therapy on disease progression as determined by evaluation of clinical criteria. In children currently being treated with AZT, it is unknown whether the addition of another antiretroviral agent such as ddC would help increase efficacy and tolerance. This study will examine the possible advantages of combination AZT/ddC therapy over monotherapy with AZT alone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In children currently being treated with AZT, it is unknown whether the addition of another antiretroviral agent such as ddC would help increase efficacy and tolerance. This study will examine the possible advantages of combination AZT/ddC therapy over monotherapy with AZT alone. Patients are stratified according to duration of ongoing AZT therapy and are randomized to receive AZT either alone or in combination with ddC. Patients receive therapy until the last patient enrolled completes 32 weeks of therapy. The study may be extended for two additional 32-week periods on an optional basis.</detailed_description>
