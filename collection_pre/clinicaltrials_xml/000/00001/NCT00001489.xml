	<brief_summary>This study is designed to test the effects of vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl-GABA) an experimental drug used for the treatment of epilepsy. The study will use positron emission tomography (PET scan) to detect areas of the brain receiving increased blood flow and using increased amounts of glucose. Increases in blood flow and glucose use are good indicators of brain activity. Researchers are interested in determining the effects of Vigabatrin on brain blood flow and glucose use.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This double-blind placebo-controlled parallel design protocol will investigate the effects of gamma-vinyl-GABA (vigabatrin--GVG) an experimental antiepileptic drug, on cerebral glucose metabolism (LCMRglc), blood flow (CBF), and seizure frequency, in patients with uncontrolled complex partial (CPS) and secondary generalized seizures (GTCS). Positron Emission Tomography (PET) will be used to measure CBF and LCMRglc.</detailed_description>
