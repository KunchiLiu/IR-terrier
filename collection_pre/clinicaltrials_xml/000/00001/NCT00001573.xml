	<brief_summary>A dose escalation scale consisting of 5 dosage levels is being used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SU101. A minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 patients will be enrolled at each dose level. MTD is defined as the dose level immediately below that at which 2 or more patients exhibit dose limiting toxicity. Each treatment cycle is 21 days. Patients receive a 96 hour continuous IV infusion of SU101 on days 1-4.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study of SU101 in Pediatric Patients With Refractory Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SU101 is a member of a novel class of antineoplastic agents, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor inhibitors. Preclinical data suggests that SU101 might be an effective agent against neuroglial tumors as well as a variety of sarcomas. A pediatric phase I trial of SU101 in children with these malignancies will be conducted to find the maximum tolerated dose of SU101 and define the toxicity profile of this agent. In addition, we will define the pharmacokinetics of SU101 and its active metabolite SU0020 in pediatric patients and gather preliminary information regarding response.</detailed_description>

OTHER: All patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is under 18 years old) must sign a document of informed consent indicating their understanding of the investigational nature and the risks of this study. For patients with brain tumors who are over 18 years of age, a DPA should be signed. Not pregnant or nursing. Not allergic to etoposide. No acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risks associated with study participation/study drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results.</criteria>
