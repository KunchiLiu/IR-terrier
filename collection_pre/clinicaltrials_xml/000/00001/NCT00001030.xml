	<brief_summary>To compare the efficacy and safety of clarithromycin alone versus rifabutin alone versus the two drugs in combination for the prevention or delay of Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) bacteremia or disseminated MAC disease. To compare other parameters such as survival, toxicity, and quality of life among the three treatment arms. To obtain information on the incidence and clinical grade of targeted gynecologic conditions. Persons with advanced stages of HIV are considered to be at particular risk for developing disseminated MAC disease. The development of an effective regimen for the prevention of disseminated MAC disease may be of substantial benefit in altering the morbidity and possibly the mortality associated with this disease and its treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety and Effectiveness of Clarithromycin and Rifabutin Used Alone or in Combination to Prevent Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC) or Disseminated MAC Disease in HIV-Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persons with advanced stages of HIV are considered to be at particular risk for developing disseminated MAC disease. The development of an effective regimen for the prevention of disseminated MAC disease may be of substantial benefit in altering the morbidity and possibly the mortality associated with this disease and its treatment. Patients are randomized to receive clarithromycin alone, rifabutin alone, or the two drugs in combination daily. Patients are evaluated every 4 weeks for the first 8 weeks and every 8 weeks thereafter for the duration of the study. Patients are followed for 24 months. Per amendment, a pharmacokinetic substudy will be conducted.</detailed_description>
