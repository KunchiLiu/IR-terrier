	<brief_summary>This minimal risk protocol is designed to assess the reproducibility of B-mode ultrasound measurements of carotid intima media thickness (IMT) when the scans are performed in CC Radiology and read using a computerized edge reader. Up to 20 volunteers will have two ultrasounds performed within a 6-month period. IMT thickness is used as a surrogate marker for atherosclerosis and may be of value in clinical trials.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This minimal risk protocol is designed to assess the reproducibility of B-mode ultrasound measurements of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) when the scans are performed in CC Radiology and read using a computerized edge reader. Up to 50 volunteers will have two ultrasounds performed within a 6-month period. IMT thickness is used as a surrogate marker for atherosclerosis and may be of value in clinical trials.</detailed_description>
