	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate individuals with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) to learn more about the genetics of the disease. This study is part of other ongoing studies of individuals with ADHD. The study participants have already undergone neurobiological measurements, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, through other research studies. As a follow-up to these studies, participants will next undergo psychiatric interviews, neuropsychological tests, and another MRI. In addition to the clinical evaluation of the participants, further research will be conducted on the genetics of ADHD. These genetic studies will evaluate people with ADHD as well as their family members and a control group of healthy people.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol allows the continuing prospective longitudinal study of ADHD probands for whom we have neurobiological measures, particularly quantitative brain MRI. The follow-up consists of structured psychiatric interviews, and neuropsychological tests. Repeat MRI scans are obtained through protocol 89-M-0006. The second purpose of this protocol is a study of the genetics of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Subjects who have ADHD, their family members, and controls are studied under this protocol.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION REQUIREMENTSPROBANDS: Current age of index probands: 15.21 plus or minus 3.42; previous participation in the NIMH Child Psychiatry Branch ADHD study. Age adjusted dimensional ratings (Conners Rating ScalesRevised, and Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD and Normal Behavior (SWAN)) of hyperactivity/impulsivity greater than or equal to 95th percentile for index and second sibling. Primary ratings for the index proband will be provided by main teacher. Up to 150 ADHD probands for reassessment. Consent and assent obtained in writing. EXCLUSION CRITERIA PROBANDS: Presence of other known genetic conditions that are likely to be etiologic. Onset of medical conditions that could produce symptoms of ADHD through nongenetic mechanisms (e.g., thyroid disorders, seizure disorders, inborn errors of metabolism, extremely low birth weight (less than 1000 gm), meningitis, intracranial pathology). Presence of other psychiatric disorders that can produce symptoms similar to ADHD (e.g., major depression, bipolar disorder, severe anxiety disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, psychotic disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder). Presence of neuropsychiatric conditions that may confound evaluation of ADHD (e.g., Tourette's syndrome, obsessivecompulsive disorder, or PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus), intelligence quotient less than 80, reading achievement standard scores less than 75 or readingintelligence discrepancy greater than 2 SD). INCLUSION REQUIRMENTSRELATIVES: Subjects must be relatives of probands. Consent and assent obtained in writing. INCLUSION REQUIREMENTS NORMAL VOLUNTEERS: Up to 150 newly accrued normal volunteers unrelated to probands. Same age range as probands. Parent and teacher ratings within one SD of population means on ADHD/hyperactivity factors. Consent and assent obtained in writing. EXCLUSIONS NORMAL VOLUNTEERS: Presence of ADHD. Presence of any other psychiatric disorders on structured psychiatric interview (DICAIV). Presence of known genetic conditions. Onset, presence or history of medical conditions that could produce symptoms of ADHD through nongenetic mechanisms (e.g., thyroid disorders, seizure disorders, inborn errors of metabolism, extremely low birth weight (less than 1000 gm), meningitis, intracranial pathology).</criteria>
