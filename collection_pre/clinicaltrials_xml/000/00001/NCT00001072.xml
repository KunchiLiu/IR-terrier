	<brief_summary>To evaluate, in HIV-negative volunteers, the safety and immunogenicity of ALVAC-HIV MN120TMGNP (vCP300) followed by or combined with boosting using rgp120/HIV-1SF2. To compare ALVAC-HIV vCP300 with ALVAC-RG rabies glycoprotein (vCP65) as a control. To evaluate an accelerated immunization schedule at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months versus 0, 1, 6, and 9 months. The combination of a live recombinant primer followed by a subunit boost has the potential to induce not only cytotoxic T lymphocytes but also neutralizing antibody.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of Live Recombinant Canarypox ALVAC-HIV vCP300 and HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120 in HIV-1 Uninfected Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination of a live recombinant primer followed by a subunit boost has the potential to induce not only cytotoxic T lymphocytes but also neutralizing antibody. Volunteers are randomized to one of seven groups to receive immunizations with either ALVAC-HIV vCP300 or ALVAC-RG vCP65 (control), plus simultaneous or sequential boosting with rgp120/HIV-1SF2 or placebo. Immunizations are given at 0, 1, 6, and 9 months or 0, 1, 3, and 6 months. Volunteers are followed for at least 24 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Volunteers must have: Normal history and physical exam. ELISA and Western blot negative for HIV. CD4 count &gt;= 400 cells/mm3. Normal urine dipstick with esterase and nitrite. Lower risk sexual behavior. Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition: Subjects with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded: Positive hepatitis B surface antigen. Medical or psychiatric condition (such as recent suicidal ideation or present psychosis) that precludes compliance. Active syphilis. NOTE: Subjects with serology documented to be a false positive or due to a remote (&gt; 6 months) treated infection are eligible. Active tuberculosis. NOTE: Subjects with a positive PPD and a normal chest xray showing no evidence of TB and not requiring isoniazid therapy are eligible. Allergy to egg products or neomycin. Subjects with the following prior conditions are excluded: History of immunodeficiency, chronic illness, autoimmune disease, or use of immunosuppressive medications. History of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines. Prior immunization against rabies. History of serious allergic reaction to any substance, requiring hospitalization or emergent medical care (e.g., StevensJohnson syndrome, bronchospasm, or hypotension). Prior psychiatric condition (such as history of suicide attempts or past psychosis) that precludes compliance. History of cancer unless there has been surgical excision that is considered to have achieved cure. Prior Medication: Excluded: Live attenuated vaccines within 60 days prior to study entry. NOTE: Medically indicated killed or subunit vaccines (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal) do not exclude if administered at least 2 weeks from HIV immunizations. Experimental agents within 30 days prior to study entry. Prior HIV vaccines. Prior rabies immunization. Prior Treatment: Excluded: Blood products or immunoglobulin within 6 months prior to study entry. Identifiable highrisk behavior for HIV infection, such as injection drug use within past 12 months. higher or intermediate risk sexual behavior.</criteria>
