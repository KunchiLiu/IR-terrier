	<brief_summary>To investigate the toxicity of interferon alfa-2b ( IFN alfa-2b ) in combination with nucleoside analog therapy in HIV-positive patients with chronic hepatitis C. To determine the efficacy of treatment with IFN alfa-2b for chronic hepatitis C in patients with advanced HIV infections treated with nucleoside analog therapy. IFN alfa-2b has HIV inhibitory properties and has also been approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Studies have shown that IFN alfa-2b is effective in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients with chronic hepatitis C, but the drug's benefit against hepatitis C in patients with advanced HIV infection has not been determined.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IFN alfa-2b has HIV inhibitory properties and has also been approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Studies have shown that IFN alfa-2b is effective in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients with chronic hepatitis C, but the drug's benefit against hepatitis C in patients with advanced HIV infection has not been determined. Patients receive interferon alpha-2b subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 6 months. If no response is seen after 18 weeks of therapy or if an initial response is followed by relapse while on therapy, dose is increased. Patients who require a dose escalation should continue on IFN alfa-2b for an additional 6 months. All patients will also receive available nucleoside analog therapy ( zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine ) at currently accepted doses as clinically appropriate.</detailed_description>
