	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of 2 treatments to prevent invasive fungal infections (IFI), which are infections caused by yeasts and molds that are common in patients with weak immune systems or transplant patients. AmBisome, a new treatment, will be compared to fluconazole, the traditional treatment for fungal infections caused by the yeast Candida. Treatment will only be given to liver transplant patients who are found to be at high risk for IFI. Liver transplant patients who are at low risk for IFI will be monitored but will receive no study medication. IFIs are found mainly in a high risk group of liver transplant patients, and are not common in those with low risk. If IFI preventive therapy is focused on the high risk group, there may be a lesser chance of Candida becoming resistant (able to grow despite the presence of drugs used to kill it). Treating only the high risk group will also save money.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If you are in the high risk group you will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to receive either AmBisome or fluconazole. If you are in the low risk group, you will not receive any treatment. Both groups will be monitored for IFIs. The study will last for 100 days following your liver transplant.</detailed_description>
