	<brief_summary>The drug rhIGF-1 (CEP-151) has been shown to play a key role preclinically in oligodendrocyte differentiation and survival, as well as, myelin integrity and function. Moreover, in an animal model of MS, myelin expression, as well as that of its receptors is upregulated at the time the myelin sheaths regenerate. Finally, administration of exogenous rhIGF-1 to rats with EAE effectively, closes the disrupted BBB, reduces the number and severity of demyelinating lesions, and improves neurological function. Thus it seems reasonable to examine the efficacy and safety, tolerability, and effect of CEP-151 on brain MRI lesions in patients with MS.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must be between 1855 years old; meet the diagnostic criteria for clinical definite or laboratory supported definite MS with either a relapsing remitting or secondary progressive course; Stage I known by history to have a mean enhancing lesion frequency of 0.3 per month or greater; Stage II known by history to have a mean enhancing lesion frequency of 0.5 per month or greater; Ability to comply with protocol requirements; Provide written informed consent; If a female patient, not of child bearing potential (surgically sterilized or postmenopausal) or if of child bearing potential, documented to be nonpregnant by urine pregnancy test and not lactating with adequate contraception and counseling. Male patients should also receive adequate counseling and exercise adequate contraception. No clinically significant abnormalities on the prestudy laboratory evaluations, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest xray, mammogram or ophthalmologic exam. No connective tissue or rheumatic disorder (systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE] ; rheumatoid arthritis [RA]; progressive systemic sclerosis [PSS]; Sjogren's syndrome [SS]). Patient may not be HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), HTLV1 (human T cell leukemia virus), or HB/C Ag (hepatitis B or C surface antigen) positive. No history of insulinproducing tumors or reactive hypoglycemia. No clinically significant medical condition (e.g., within 6 months of screen had myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, untreated hypertension, and/or congestive heart failure [CHF] that, in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the safety of the patient. Ability to tolerate MRI examinations due to claustrophobia, or have contraindications to MRI scanning, such as pacemakers, aneurysm clips, or shrapnel fragments. Welders and metal workers must have radiographic evidence to document lack of foreign bodies in the eyes or they will be excluded, due to the risk of eye injury while in the MRI machine. No history of substance use disorder (DSMIV criteria) within the past two years. No Type I or Type II diabetes treated with hypoglycemic agents (dietcontrolled Type II diabetes may be included.) No history of cancer (with the exception of localized skin cancers with no evidence of metastasis, significant invasion, or recurrence) within three years of screening. No first or second degree relatives with breast cancer. Have not used an investigational drug within 30 days of the screen visit. Have previously received interferonalpha, interferonbeta, copolymer 1, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulin, oral myelin, or other immunosuppressive drugs within 6 months of screen.</criteria>
