	<brief_summary>This is a phase I study of melanoma tumor antigen peptide vaccines. The nine amino acid peptides representing HLA-A2 restricted T cell epitope of the melanoma antigen, gp100 will be administered to patients emulsified in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant, (IFA). The study is designed to evaluate the toxicity, immunologic effects and potential therapeutic role of repeated doses of gp100 peptide vaccines administered subcutaneously. Immune reactivity to the gp100 epitope peptides will be monitored in all patients by analysis of melanoma-specific T cell precursor frequency prior to and after immunization.</brief_summary>
