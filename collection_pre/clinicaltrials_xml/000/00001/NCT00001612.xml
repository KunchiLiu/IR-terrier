	<brief_summary>Patients enrolled in the original Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study at the Clinical Center at Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute will be invited for a follow-up visit at the National Eye Institute. Visual function will be assessed with manifest refraction and standardized visual acuity measurement. The progression of retinopathy will be evaluated by ocular exam and fundus photography. A brief medical history will be obtained. The goal of this study is to evaluate the long-term results of patients whose diabetic retinopathy was treated with different strategies of scatter and/or focal laser photocoagulation.</brief_summary>
