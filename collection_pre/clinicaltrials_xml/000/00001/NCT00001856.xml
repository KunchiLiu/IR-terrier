	<brief_summary>On a yearly basis there are approximately 12,000 kidney transplants in the United States. Presently there are approximately 40,000 patients awaiting a transplant with only 5,000 available donors. Due to the obvious difference between organ supply and demand, live donors have become a standard source of kidneys for transplantation. Research has proven that kidneys from living donors are superior to cadaveric donors (kidneys harvested from a deceased individual). Kidneys from living donors are not exposed to extremely low temperature that could increase post-operative problems. They are less likely to experience rejection and there is a decreased likelihood that a patient will have to undergo post-operative dialysis. The objective of this study is to promote the enrollment of healthy individuals to serve as kidney donors for patients undergoing research kidney transplantation at the NIH. Potential donors will be screened to make sure they are able to survive with a single kidney without significant medical risk. Additional tests will be taken to establish compatibility with the recipient. Compatible donors will be evaluated to determine which kidney is suitable for transplantation. Both the donation and transplantation procedure will be conducted on the same day. Appropriate post-operative care and follow-up will be provided at the Clinical Center.</brief_summary>
