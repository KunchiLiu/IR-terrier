	<brief_summary>To compare the safety and efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (zidovudine plus either didanosine or dideoxycytidine) versus antiretroviral therapy plus intravenous cytarabine (Ara-C) versus antiretroviral therapy plus intrathecal Ara-C in the maintenance or improvement of neurological function over 6 months in HIV-infected individuals who have developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). To compare the effect of these three treatment regimens on Karnofsky score and MRI studies. The effectiveness of Ara-C in the treatment of PML, caused by a human DNA papovavirus (designated JC virus) infection, has not been determined, although the most encouraging results have occurred with intrathecal administration of the drug.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Anti HIV Drugs Used Alone or in Combination With Cytosine Arabinoside to Treat Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) in HIV-Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effectiveness of Ara-C in the treatment of PML, caused by a human DNA papovavirus (designated JC virus) infection, has not been determined, although the most encouraging results have occurred with intrathecal administration of the drug. Patients are randomized to receive antiretroviral therapy alone (AZT plus ddI or ddC), antiretroviral therapy plus intravenous Ara-C, or antiretroviral therapy plus intrathecal Ara-C. All patients receive 24 weeks of antiretroviral therapy. Beginning at week 2, patients on the intravenous Ara-C arm receive daily infusions of Ara-C over 5 days, with cycles repeating every 21 days. Patients on the intrathecal Ara-C arm receive single administrations of Ara-C at weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, and 24. A brain biopsy confirmation or in situ hybridization will be required within 7 days after study entry. Patients are followed every 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
