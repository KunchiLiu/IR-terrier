	<brief_title>Evaluation for NCI Surgery Branch Clinical Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Potential research candidates undergo thorough screening including laboratory tests, scans, x-rays and review of pathology slides to determine initial eligibility for Surgery Branch research protocols. Objectives: To permit evaluation of patients referred to the NCI Surgery Branch in order to identify individuals who will be suitable candidates for Surgery Branch clinical research protocols. To assess frequency of HLA type and expression of neo antigens in malignant tumors across the population of cancer patients undergoing screening for NCI Surgery Branch Protocols. Eligibility: Patient suspected of having, or with biopsy proven malignant disease. Patient, parent or guardian (if a minor), is able to provide informed consent. Design: Patients enrolled on this protocol will be evaluated by NCI Surgery Branch physicians to determine the individual's suitability for participation in a clinical research protocol. An accrual ceiling of 6000 patients has been set to meet the screening needs of the Surgery Branch.</detailed_description>
