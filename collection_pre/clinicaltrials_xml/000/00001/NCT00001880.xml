	<brief_summary>The goal of this research study is to identify other types of cancer (malignant neoplasms) that may be treatable with stem cell transplantation (allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Patients with a variety of different types of cancerous tumors that have spread (metastasized) and whose conditions have not improved with stand therapy, will be eligible to participate. Those patients selected to participate in the study will undergo a procedure known as a "mini-transplant". The mini-transplant is a transplantation of stem-cells collected from a sibling (brother or sister) of the patient. Unlike traditional bone marrow transplants, the mini-transplant does not require intense chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Because of this, patients experience fewer and less severe side effects. This study is open to patients diagnosed with a variety of metastatic solid tumors including esophageal, gastric (stomach), colon, rectal, liver tumors (hepatoma), cancer of the biliary system (cholangiocarcinoma), cancer of the pancreas, lung, breast, prostate, bone (sarcoma), adrenal basal cell, bladder, and adenocarcinomas of unk primary origin....</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective of this study is to identify metastatic neoplasms, which may be susceptible to the GVT effect. We will treat patients with progressive metastatic solid tumors refractory to standard therapy with a non-myeloablative allogeneic PBSC transplant from a family donor. A GVT effect from immunocompetent donor immune cells could extend life expectancy and possibly cure such patients. Eligible patients will be treated with an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant from an HLA identical or single HLA antigen-mismatched family donor, using an intensive immunosuppressive regimen without myeloablation ("mini-transplant") in an attempt to decrease the transplant related toxicities while preserving the anti-malignancy and/or anti-host marrow effect of the graft. The low intensity non-myeloablative conditioning regimen should provide adequate immunosuppression to allow stem cell and lymphocyte engraftment. A T-cell replete, donor-derived, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) will be used to establish hematopoietic and lymphoid reconstitution. We will infuse lymphocytes in patients with &lt;100% donor T-cell chimerism or with evidence of tumor progression in an attempt to prevent graft rejection and enhance a graft-versus-malignancy effect, respectively. This trial is open to several different types of metastatic, treatment-refractory, solid neoplasms, breast, cholangiocarcinoma, small intestine/colon/rectal adenocarcinoma, esophageal/gastric, hepatocellular, pancreatic, prostate, and bony/soft tissue sarcomas. The trial design permits up to 10 patients with a specific tumor type to be enrolled to screen for anti-tumor effects. A single complete response in a specific tumor type is an indication to exclude further patients with that diagnosis from the study. Subsequently, a new protocol which focuses on further defining a GVT effect in that disease category will be instituted.</detailed_description>
