	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the long-term toxicity and obtain preliminary information about long-term efficacy of the combination of antiretroviral therapies and interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine with immunomodulatory properties. Currently 73 patients have been approved to receive IL-2 at a starting dose of 18 MIU/d for 5 days. Multiple courses of IL-2 will be administered, at approximately 2 month intervals. Clinical, laboratory, immunologic, and viral parameters will be closely monitored during this time for evidence of toxicity and preliminary evidence of efficacy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Laboratory values Grade 0 or 1. Hemoglobin greater than 9 g/dl; neutrophil count greater than 1,000 cells/mm(3) permitted for patients with CD4 counts under 200 cells/mm(3). No therapy with corticosteroids, chemotherapy, or experimental therapy other than IL2 in the prior 4 weeks. Willing and able to take AZT. Therapy with dideoxyinosine or dideoxycytidine will not be permitted. Any approved antiretroviral drug can be administered, either alone or in combination. Delavirdine (U90152S), 400 mg tid, permitted as an antiretroviral agent, either alone or in combination with currently approved antiretroviral agents. Patients must not have a malignancy other than Kaposi sarcoma. Patient must not have concurrent opportunistic infection other than oropharyngeal candidiasis or HSV. Patients may have CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm(3) with a concurrent opportunistic infection, but the patient must be responding to at least 2 weeks of therapy or no effective therapy can be available. Patients must not abuse substances. Patients must not have significant cardiac, pulmonary, rheumatologic, autoimmune, or CNS disease. Home patient must be enrolled and in good standing on a current NIAID protocol involving the use of IL2 therapy. The patient must already have undergone at least one year of treatment on the protocol during with IL2 therapy has been given, including at least 2 welltolerated outpatient cycles of scIL2 at a stable dose. Home The patient must have a history of generally tolerable side effects while receiving IL2 that did not require frequent medical interventions, intravenous fluid replacement, and/or IL2 dose reductions. Conditions generally not suitable for home scIL2 administration would include (but are not limited to) an unusually heavy requirement for narcotic usage during a cycle, significant urticaria (hives) or other allergic conditions, and any history of possible airway compromise due to throat swelling. Home Patient must not have experienced any serious (grade 3 or higher) clinical or laboratory abnormalities of medical significance during days 05 of the last 2 outpatient scIL2 cycles. Home The patient must have a strong relationship with a private physician or healthcare provider at home who has demonstrated close involvement in the patient's care to date and who would be willing to help supervise a patient's care during each home scIL2 cycle. Because of the need to identify a single healthcare provider at home who will agree to be available to render care (if needed) during a patient's scIL2 cycle, patients who currently receive their home care from rotating staff members in a general clinic setting may not be eligible for home scIL2 administration. A signed written statement acknowledging willingness to participate in monitoring must be received by the clinic 8 study team from the private physician or healthcare provider prior to the first home scIL2 cycle. In addition, communication must occur between your clinic 8study team and the designated physician or healthcare provider prior to each subsequent cycle to confirm that individual's continued willingness to serve as onsite provider for any serious medical conditions that might develop during a cycle. Home The patient must live at a home address with easy access to a telephone and must have demonstrated reliability in responding to telephone calls from clinic 8 staff members. The patient must also be able to provide the study team with reliable contact information for a close family member or friend who will agree to serve in the capacity of a "caregiver" during each cycle: i.e. someone who will be able to render nonmedical assistance to the patient and be able to check on their condition daily in the event that emergency medical assistance needs to be summoned. It will become the patient's responsibility to ensure that the local "caregiver" communicates their willingness to serve in this capacity by telephoning the clinic 8study team prior to each cycle. Home The patient must have "reasonable" (i.e. rapid and close) access at home to emergency medical services and a nearby medical facility in the event of a medical crisis. The suitability of the athome situation will be assessed on a casebycase basis by the clinic 8study team. Home The patient must have demonstrated reliability and consistency in sterile technique, the reconstitution of IL2 vials, and the administration of scIL2 injections. Home The patient must be receiving outpatient scIL2 cycles at least once every 6 months as part of their normal protocol participation, except at the discretion of the study team. Home The patient must have access to a reliable home weight scale and be able to weigh themselves accurately on a daily basis for the purposes of safety monitoring.</criteria>
