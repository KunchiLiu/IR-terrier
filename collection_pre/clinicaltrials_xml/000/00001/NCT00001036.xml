	<brief_summary>To determine the safety of thymosin alpha 1 given twice weekly in a regimen of daily oral zidovudine (AZT) and biweekly polyethylene glycolated interleukin-2 (PEG IL-2). To determine the effect of thymosin alpha 1 and PEG IL-2 in combination with AZT on immunologic and pharmacokinetic markers. AIDS is characterized by diminished T helper cell number and function. Thymosin alpha 1 appears to both increase IL-2 receptors on lymphocytes in vitro and enhance lymphocyte maturation in vivo; thus, the drug may further enhance the CD4 T cell levels in patients receiving AZT and PEG IL-2.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety and Effectiveness of a Type of Interleukin-2 Plus Zidovudine Plus Thymosin in HIV-Positive Patients With and Without Symptoms of Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIDS is characterized by diminished T helper cell number and function. Thymosin alpha 1 appears to both increase IL-2 receptors on lymphocytes in vitro and enhance lymphocyte maturation in vivo; thus, the drug may further enhance the CD4 T cell levels in patients receiving AZT and PEG IL-2. Patients are stabilized on oral AZT daily for 8 weeks and then begin receiving bolus infusions of PEG IL-2 every other week for at least four doses. Thymosin alpha 1 (given SC) is then added to this regimen twice weekly for 4 weeks. If no significant toxicity occurs, thymosin alpha 1 is increased to and administered along with scheduled doses of PEG IL-2 for an additional 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
