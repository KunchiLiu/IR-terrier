	<brief_summary>To evaluate whether immune globulin and ganciclovir (DHPG) results in faster initial response as compared to DHPG alone. To evaluate whether immune globulin and DHPG gives longer duration of remission than DHPG alone (i.e. 16 weeks). To evaluate the toxicities of the combination of DHPG and immune globulin as compared to those of DHPG alone. To evaluate if there is a difference between the two groups in regard to survival, immune functions, and CMV viremia and viruria.</brief_summary>
