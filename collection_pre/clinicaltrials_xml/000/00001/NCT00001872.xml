	<brief_summary>Blood contains different kinds of cells, white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. In order to treat certain diseases, specific cell types can be removed from blood and transplanted into patients. The process of removing white blood cells for the treatment of leukemia is called apheresis. This study will make available blood cell collections from volunteers genetically matched to various degrees with recipients in order to test and, if necessary, refine the process of removing white blood cell T-lymphocytes.</brief_summary>
