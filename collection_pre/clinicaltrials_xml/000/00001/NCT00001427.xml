	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial of 72-Hour Continuous IV Infusion of 9-Aminocamptothecin With G-CSF Support in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer Previously Treated With Paclitaxel and Cisplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II study of 9-aminocamptothecin (9-AC), administered as an intravenous continuous infusion over 72 hours with G-CSF support for patients with advanced refractory ovarian cancer. The objectives of the present study are to determine the response rate to 9-AC in patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have recurrent disease after paclitaxel- and cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens.</detailed_description>
