	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Celecoxib may stop the growth of thyroid cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in treating patients who have progressive metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib in Treating Patients With Progressive Metastatic Differentiated Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of celecoxib, in terms of progression-free survival, in patients with progressive metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma. - Correlate cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 protein expression in tumor biopsies by immunohistochemistry with clinical response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily beginning on day 1. Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive 3 additional months of therapy beyond documentation of CR. Patients are followed at 4-8 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 6 months.</detailed_description>
