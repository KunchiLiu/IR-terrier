	<criteria>A subject will be eligible for study participation if all of the following criteria are met: The subject is at least 18 years of age. The subject has histologically confirmed nonHodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) (excluding Burkitt's, Burkitt's type or HIV associated lymphoma) or Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL) that is refractory to or has relapsed after standard therapy or for which there is no known effective treatment. The subject must have measurable disease by the CHESON Criteria for Tumor Response. The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Score of 02. The subject is able to selfadminister or has a caregiver who can reliably administer subcutaneous injections. The subject must have adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function as follows: Bone marrow: *White blood cell count (WBC) greater than or equal to 3,000/mm3; *Platelets greater than or equal to 75,000/mm3 unless subject has received a prior transplant or bone marrow involvement with lymphoma has been documented, then platelets of equal to or greater than 50,000 is acceptable. *Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8.5 g/dL; *ANC greater than or equal to 1000/mm3 Renal function: *Serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL Hepatic function: *AST and ALT less than or equal to 3.0 X ULN The subject must not be pregnant or lactating and all subjects (male and female) must use a contraceptive method deemed appropriate by the investigator while in the study and up to two months following completion of therapy. The subject has voluntarily signed and dated an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approved consent prior to any study specific procedures. A subject will be ineligible for study participation if any of the following criteria are met: The subject has a history of or currently exhibits Central Nervous System (CNS) metastasis. Brain MRI within 28 days of enrollment is required to confirm absence of CNS metastases. The subject is receiving therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. Low dose anticoagulation (e.g., low dose Coumadin) for catheter prophylaxis is permitted; PT/PTT must be within normal limits. The subject has a history of or currently exhibits clinically significant cancer related events of bleeding (e.g., hemoptysis). The subject has a recent history of (within 4 weeks of Study Day 1) or currently exhibits other clinically significant events of bleeding. The subject has received any therapy for lymphoma including chemotherapy, antibody therapy, radiotherapy or any investigational therapy within four weeks prior to study drug administration. The subject has been initiated on steroids or there is an increase in current steroid dose within three months prior to study drug administration. The subject exhibits evidence of clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) and/or is considered by the investigator to be unable to tolerate the proposed treatment or procedures. The subject has history of other previous malignancies within 5 years, with the exception of: Adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix; Basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.</criteria>
