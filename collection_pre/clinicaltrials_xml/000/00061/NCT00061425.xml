	<criteria>Inclusion: Histological or cytological diagnosis of Bcell lymphoma, and has failed at least one regimen of standard chemotherapy. (All histological grades of NHL will be eligible for this trial.) Measureable via CT, with at least one lesion &gt; or = 1.5cm in one or both dimensions. (Splenic tumors in absence of other tumors will not qualify.) Radiological studies (ie CT) must be performed within 4 weeks prior to study start. Acceptable tumor burden that will allow adequate followup and evaluation. Less that 25% bone marrow involvement, determined by bone marrow biopsy. Must observe the following washout periods: At least 4 weeks beyond any major surgery. At least 4 weeks beyond any radiation therapy to the index lesion, and has recovered from radiationinduced toxicity. At least 4 weeks beyond chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. At least 2 weeks beyond corticosteriod(s) use and blood counts are with laboratory criteria. Must have Karnofsky score &gt;70% (or equivalent, ECOG 02) with expected survival of at least 6 months. Serum creatinine &lt; or = 1.5mg/dl or creatinine clearance &gt; or = 50ml/min. Serum bilirubin &lt; or = 2mg/dl. Hemoglobin &gt; or = 10 g/dl; WBC &gt; or = 3000/mm3; granulocyte count &gt; or = 150/mm3; platelet count &gt; or = 100,000/mm3 with out transfusions or cytokines for at least 30 days prior to study. Immunomedics ELISA assay of HahLL2 &lt; 100ng/ml for those with prior history of monoclonal antibody infusions. Cognizant informed consent.</criteria>
