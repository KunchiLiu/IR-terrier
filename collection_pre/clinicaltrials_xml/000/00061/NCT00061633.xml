	<brief_summary>Serious infections caused by resistant bacteria are becoming more of a medical problem throughout the world. One of the ways to deal with this problem is to develop new drugs that can control these bacteria. This study will measure how well TD-6424 (Telavancin) can control infections and whether this drug can be safely given to patients.</brief_summary>
