	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposomal doxorubicin, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Microwave thermotherapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above body temperature. Combining liposomal doxorubicin with microwave thermotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of liposomal doxorubicin when given together with microwave thermotherapy in treating patients with prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liposomal Doxorubicin and Thermal Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of doxorubicin HCl liposome released through thermal microwave therapy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. - Determine the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the safety profile and dose-limiting toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 30 minutes. Patients then undergo a 60-minute course of prostate thermotherapy. Treatment may repeat every 28-42 days for up to 6 courses, at the discretion of the physician. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin HCl liposome until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 8, 15, 30, and 90 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
