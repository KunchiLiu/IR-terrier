	<brief_title>Tobacco Cessation in Postmenopausal Women (Part I) - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Female subjects were screened and randomized. Following two weeks of medication monitoring, all participants continued smoking as usual for one week, at which time baseline measurements were taken. For the remaining two weeks (the experimental period), participants were randomized to a continued smoking or smoking abstinence condition. The abstinent group was provided with cessation counseling and monitored for abstinence. For all participants, data were collected during five clinic visits on all dependent measures: MNWS, QSU, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Profile of Mood States, Motor Speed Tasks and Reaction Time Tests. Question of interest was whether hormone replacement therapy would improve these dependent measures as manifested during short-term smoking cessation.</detailed_description>
