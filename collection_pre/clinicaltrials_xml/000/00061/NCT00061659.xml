The subject must not be pregnant or lactating and all subjects (male and female) must use a contraceptive method deemed acceptable by the investigator while in the study and for up to two months following completion of therapy. The subject has voluntarily signed and dated an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approved consent prior to any study specific procedures. Exclusion Criteria A subject will be ineligible for study participation if any of the following criteria are met: The subject has a history of or currently exhibits Central Nervous System (CNS) metastasis. Brain MRI within 28 days of enrollment is required to confirm absence of CNS metastases The subjects is receiving therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. Low dose anticoagulation (e.g. low dose Coumadin) for catheter prophylaxis will be permitted; PT/PTT must be within normal limits. The subject has a history of or currently exhibits clinically significant cancer related events of bleeding (e.g. hemoptysis). The subject has a recent history (within 4 weeks of Study Day 1) or currently exhibits other clinically significant signs of bleeding. The subject has received any therapy for sarcoma including chemotherapy, radiotherapy or any investigational therapy. The subject exhibits evidence of clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) and/or is considered by the investigator to be unable to tolerate the proposed treatment or procedures.
