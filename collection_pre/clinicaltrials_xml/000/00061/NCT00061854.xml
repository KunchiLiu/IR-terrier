	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as soblidotin use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of soblidotin in treating patients who have progressive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Soblidotin in Treating Patients With Progressive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the objective tumor response rate and duration of response in patients with progressive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated with soblidotin as second-line therapy after receiving prior platinum-based chemotherapy. - Determine the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the median survival time and 12-month survival rate of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive soblidotin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Plasma sampling for pharmacokinetics is done on day 1 of course 1. Patients are followed for survival every 3 months after discontinuing study treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
