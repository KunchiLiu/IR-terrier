	<brief_summary>Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a life-threatening bone marrow failure disorder characterized by pancytopenia and a hypocellular bone marrow. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and immunosuppressive treatment with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CsA) have dramatically changed the natural course of this illness, with 5 year survival of 75% in patients undergoing either treatment. Since most patients are not suitable candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) due to advanced age or lack of a histocompatible sibling, efforts at NHLBI have focused on improving immunosuppression treatment in order to improve response rates, survival, and to decrease relapse. In our experience of 122 patients treated at NHLBI with the combination of ATG and cyclosporine, one quarter to one third did not respond; about 50% of responders relapsed; and 5 year survival was correlated with the robustness in blood cell count improvement at 3 months (reticulocyte or platelet count greater than or equal to 50,000 /uL). Why some patients do not respond initially while others relapse is unclear. Autoreactive T cells may be resistant to the effect of ATG/CsA (nonresponders), while in others residual autoreactive T cells expand post-treatment leading to hematopoietic stem cell destruction and recurrent pancytopenia (relapse). Therefore, novel immunosuppressive regimens to increase response rates and hematologic recovery at 3 months and to decrease relapse rates are needed. An ongoing NHLBI trial, which is close to completing accrual, has added mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for a total of 18 months to standard ATG + CsA in an attempt to reduce the relapse rate after cyclosporine is discontinued. Preliminary results have been disappointing, with no marked reduction in relapse among patients who received MMF. Sirolimus (rapamycin, Rapamune , RAPA) is a novel immunosuppressive agent, which acts synergistically with cyclosporine by blocking T cell activation through CsA-resistant pathways. The potentiation of the combination of CsA-RAPA has been established in vitro and in the clinical setting, mainly in islet cell and solid organ transplantation. The significant increase in response rate seen with the addition of CsA to ATG indicated that an inhibitory effect on T lymphocytes is important in blocking autoreactive T cells in aplastic anemia. The combination of CsA-RAPA may further block activated autoreactive T cells and therefore lead to improved response rates (and survival) and decreased relapse rates. This prospective randomized phase II study will investigate two different immunosuppressive regimens in patients with severe aplastic anemia who have not received prior immunosuppressive therapy. One arm will receive ATG + CsA in addition to sirolimus for 6 months, and the second arm will receive standard ATG + CsA for 6 months followed by a slow taper of CsA with a 25% dose reduction every 3 months for the subsequent 18 months. This trial will determine the effectiveness of sirolimus in patients with aplastic anemia as well as the role of a cyclosporine taper in preventing relapses. Primary endpoint will be no longer meeting criteria for severe aplastic anemia while secondary endpoints are relapse, robustness of hematologic recovery at 3 months, survival, clonal evolution to PNH, myelodysplasia and acute leukemia. 10/11/2005. The Sirolimus (Rapamune) arm of the trial was stopped for lack of efficacy. The study will continue as a single arm study to establish if slow taper of CsA prevents relapse rates after initial standard treatment with ATG followed by CsA for six months....</brief_summary>
