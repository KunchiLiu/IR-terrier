	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: BCX-1777 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness BCX-1777 in treating patients who have refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BCX-1777 in Treating Patients With Refractory Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of BCX-1777 in patients with refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. - Determine the efficacy of this drug in these patients. - Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. - Correlate plasma concentration of deoxyguanosine with clinical response and toxicity in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the provisional optimal biological dose of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation, multicenter study. - Phase I: Patients receive BCX-1777 IV over 30 minutes every 12 hours on days 1-5 (a total of 9 doses). Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BCX-1777 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I at the MTD of BCX-1777. Patients (including those who respond to treatment) are followed at 14 and 30 days, monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 6 months, and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-64 patients (3-24 for phase I and 40 for phase II) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
