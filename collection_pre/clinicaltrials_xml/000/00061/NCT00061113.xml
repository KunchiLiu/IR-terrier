	<brief_title>Substance Dependent Teens - Impact of Treating Depression Study 1 - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary study aim is to determine whether fluoxetine + CBT is a more effective treatment than placebo + CBT for substance outcomes, depression, and behavior problems. The current community standard of care often withholds pharmacotherapy for depression in substance abusing adolescents, since it is often assumed that their depressions may remit with SUD treatment alone. However, this is an untested hypothesis in adolescents and one that we propose to test in the current study.</detailed_description>
