	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Genistein may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of genistein in treating patients with localized prostate cancer who are planning to undergo radical prostatectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genistein in Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Who Are Planning to Undergo Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity of genistein in patients with localized prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. - Determine the decrease, if any, of prostate-specific antigen-positive cells in the operative field of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: Patients receive 1 of 2 treatment regimens. - Group A: Patients receive oral genistein once daily for 1-2 months, undergo radical prostatectomy, and then continue oral genistein once daily for 1-2 months afterward (for a total of 3 months of therapy). - Group B: Patients undergo radical prostatectomy. Beginning 1 month after surgery, patients receive genistein as in arm I for 3 months. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 1 and 3 months after surgery. Patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 88 patients (44 patients per treatment group) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
