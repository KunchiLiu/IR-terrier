	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as docetaxel use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic penile cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0224, Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Penile Cancer (TERMINATED)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the confirmed complete and partial response rate in patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermoid carcinoma of the penis treated with docetaxel. - Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-5.8 years.</detailed_description>
