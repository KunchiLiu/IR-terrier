	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Stem cell factor may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of cancer therapy. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining interleukin-2 with stem cell factor in treating patients who have AIDS or AIDS-related cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and toxicity of low-dose interleukin-2 and stem cell factor in patients with AIDS or AIDS-related malignancies. - Determine the immune status of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of stem cell factor. Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously (SC) six days a week and stem cell factor SC three times a week for 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of stem cell factor until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional cohort of 3 patients receives treatment at the MTD. Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 1 month. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
