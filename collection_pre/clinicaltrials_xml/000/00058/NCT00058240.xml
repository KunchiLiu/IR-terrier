	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of flavopiridol in treating patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphocytic lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as flavopiridol work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flavopiridol in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol administered as a 30 minute loading dose followed by a 4-hour infusion once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks every 6 weeks. II. To determine the safety and feasibility of performing dose escalation to 80 mg/m2 (30 mg/m2 30-minute IV bolus followed by 50 mg/m2 4-hour IV infusion) beginning dose 2 in patients who do not experience severe tumor lysis requiring hemodialysis during dose 1. III. To determine the pharmacokinetics and cellular pharmacodynamics of flavopiridol administered in this schedule. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the complete response (CR) and overall response rate (CR + PR) of flavopiridol in patients with previously-treated CLL administered as a 30 minute loading dose followed by a 4 hour infusion once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks every 6 weeks. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive a loading dose of flavopiridol IV over 30 minutes followed by a 4-hour infusion on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. After the MTD is determined, 12 additional patients are accrued and treated as above at the recommended phase II dose. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2 months and then every 3 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
