	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as MDX-010, work in different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with interleukin-2 may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining monoclonal antibody therapy with interleukin-2 in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody (MDX-CTLA4) in combination with high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) in patients with metastatic melanoma. (Phase I is closed to accrual as of 4/13/2004). - Determine the activity of MDX-CTLA4 administered at the MTD with high-dose IL-2 in these patients. - Determine whether the administration of IL-2 alters the pharmacokinetics of MDX-CTLA4 in these patients. - Determine the safety and adverse event profile of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody (MDX-CTLA4). - Phase I: Patients receive MDX-CTLA4 IV on days 0, 21, and 42. Patients also receive high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for up to 15 doses beginning on days 22 and 43. Treatment repeats every 63 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with an ongoing partial response and no greater than grade 1 toxicity may receive additional courses of therapy. Patients who require discontinuation of MDX-CTLA4 due to toxicity may continue receiving IL-2 at the discretion of the investigator. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MDX-CTLA4 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. (Phase I is closed to accrual as of 4/13/2004). - Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I at the MTD of MDX-CTLA4. Patients who achieve a partial or complete response and later develop recurrent or progressive disease may be retreated at the same dose. Patients are followed at 3 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-51 patients (3-18 for phase I and 19-33 for phase II) will be accrued for this study within 1 year. (Phase I is closed to accrual as of 4/13/2004).</detailed_description>
