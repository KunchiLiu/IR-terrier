	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. The use of celecoxib may be an effective way to prevent the recurrence of stage I or stage II head and neck cancer or stage I non-small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying celecoxib to see how well it works compared to that of a placebo in preventing disease recurrence in patients with stage I or stage II head and neck cancer or stage I non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib in Treating Patients With Early-Stage Head and Neck Cancer or Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the rate of new malignancies (recurrences and second primary tumors) in patients with early-stage head and neck cancer or non-small cell lung cancer treated with celecoxib vs placebo. - Compare the event-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug vs placebo. - Determine the toxic effects associated with long-term use of celecoxib in these patients. - Correlate cyclooxygenase-2 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta expression and CYP2C9 and TGF-beta genotypes with the rate of new malignancies and survival of patients treated with this drug vs placebo. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to smoking history (active smokers [including those who quit within 1 year of diagnosis] vs former smokers vs non-smokers), tumor type (lung cancer vs head and neck cancer), and stage (I vs II for head and neck cancer or T1 vs T2 for lung cancer). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms, treatment continues for 24 months in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years or until disease recurrence. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 121 patients (approximately 60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
