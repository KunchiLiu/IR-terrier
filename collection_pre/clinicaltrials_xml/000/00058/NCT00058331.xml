	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Epoetin alfa may stimulate red blood cell production and treat anemia in patients with solid tumors. It is not yet known whether epoetin alfa given once a week is more effective than epoetin alfa given once every 3 weeks in treating anemia. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of epoetin alfa in treating anemia in patients who have solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epoetin Alfa in Treating Anemia in Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the effects of 2 different schedules of epoetin alfa on decreasing transfusion requirements in anemic patients with nonmyeloid cancer. - Compare the effects of these regimens on increasing hemoglobin levels in these patients. - Compare the effects of these regimens on overall quality of life (QOL) and anemia-specific components of QOL in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent chemotherapy or radiotherapy (yes vs no), concurrent platinum-based (cisplatin or carboplatin) chemotherapy (yes vs no), degree of anemia (mild [hemoglobin at least 9.0 g/dL] vs severe [hemoglobin less than 9.0 g/dL]), age (60 and under vs over 60), and type of neoplasm (plasma cell disorder [including multiple myeloma] or lymphoproliferative disorder [including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia] vs all other neoplasms). All patients receive epoetin alfa (EPO) subcutaneously (SC) once weekly for 3 weeks. Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.</detailed_description>
