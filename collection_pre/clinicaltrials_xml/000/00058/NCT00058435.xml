	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from monoclonal antibodies combined with tumor cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who have ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety of varying routes and doses of monoclonal antibody ACA125 anti-idiotype vaccine in patients with ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer. - Determine an optimal dose and route of this vaccine for a phase II study. - Determine the immune response induced by this vaccination in these patients. - Determine the time to development of objective tumor response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive lower-dose monoclonal antibody ACA125 anti-idiotype vaccine (MOAB ACA125) intramuscularly (IM) on weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 14 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive higher-dose MOAB ACA125 IM as in arm I. - Arm III: Patients receive lower-dose MOAB ACA125 subcutaneously (SC) on weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 14 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm IV: Patients receive higher-dose MOAB ACA125 SC as in arm III. Patients are followed every 6-12 weeks for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (10 patients per cohort) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
