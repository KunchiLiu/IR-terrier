	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine a recommended phase II dose of IDEC-152 monoclonal antibody in patients with relapsed or recurrent chronic lymphocytic leukemia. - Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the efficacy of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients receive IDEC-152 monoclonal antibody IV over at least 2 hours on days 1, 2, 8, 15, and 22. Cohorts of 3-10 patients receive escalating doses of IDEC-152 monoclonal antibody until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3, 2 of 6, or 3 of 10 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.</detailed_description>
