	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver radioactive cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining rituximab and combination chemotherapy with yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining rituximab and combination chemotherapy with yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in treating older patients who have B-cell lymphoma that has not been previously treated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab and Combination Chemotherapy Combined With Yttrium Y 90 Ibritumomab Tiuxetan in Treating Older Patients With Previously Untreated B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients age 60 and over with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) combined with yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan. - Determine the incidence of adverse experiences, hematologic toxicity (WBC, hemoglobin, and platelet nadirs; and transfusion requirements), cardiac toxicity (incidence of left ventricular dysfunction and cardiomyopathy by echocardiography), and the development of human antimouse antibody/human anti-chimeric antibody in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the predictive value of detecting minimal residual disease by molecular techniques for future relapse/recurrence in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the response rate of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the red blood cell transfusion requirements, change in hemoglobin from baseline, and incidence of anemia with prophylactic darbepoetin alfa support in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the conversion rate to complete remission in patients treated with ibritumomab tiuxetan who achieve a partial remission post-R-CHOP. - Determine the effect of darbepoetin alfa on the quality of life of these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study. - Chemotherapy: Patients receive rituximab IV over 2-5 hours, cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin IV, and vincristine IV on day 1; oral prednisone on days 1-5 or 2-6; and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 7-15. Patients also receive darbepoetin alfa SC on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Radioimmunotherapy: Patients receive rituximab IV over 3-5 hours and indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan (IDEC-In2B8) IV over 10 minutes on day 0. Patients undergo gamma camera imaging at 2-24 hours and 48-72 hours after the injection of IDEC-In2B8 to observe the flow of ibritumomab tiuxetan. If the flow is deemed safe, then patients receive yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes on day 7. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before course 5 of chemotherapy, before radioimmunotherapy, and at 3 months. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
