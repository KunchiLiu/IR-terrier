	<brief_summary>Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate safety and efficacy of multiple subcutaneous doses of DiaPep277 in patients with Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA). Study medication will be administered at time 0, 1 and 3 months, and then every 3 months for a total of 8 administrations. The total duration of the trial is 24 months (treatment for 18 months and follow-up for an additional 6 months). Patients will be male or female between the ages of 30 and 65 years, inclusive, within 2 to 60 months of the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Subjects must be positive for glutamic acid decarboxylate (GAD) autoantibodies. At the Screen Visit (Visit 2), all subjects will be asked to discontinue their use of all oral antidiabetic medications with the exception of metformin. The subjects will be placed on a stable regimen of insulin and diet (plus metformin if needed). Prior to the Baseline Visit (Visit 3), diabetic control must be achieved by diet and insulin (plus metformin if needed).</brief_summary>
