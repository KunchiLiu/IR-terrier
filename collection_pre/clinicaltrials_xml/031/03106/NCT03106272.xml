	<brief_title>Evaluating the AMH Levels During Natural Cycle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The potential benefit would be using an automated assay for AMH, the dynamics of serum levels during the natural cycle and to check the inter-cycle variations. Because of the many clinical decisions that are based on AMH levels alone the results of this study could bring reassurance to the continuous use of AMH in daily practice. More importantly, no studies to date have been performed on the newer automated assays evaluating variability of AMH levels.</detailed_description>
