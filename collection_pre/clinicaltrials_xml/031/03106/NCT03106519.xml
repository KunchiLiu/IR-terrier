	<brief_summary>Treatment of Dupuytren's contracture requires multiple injections into the palm of the hand to weaken the cords, followed by rupture of the strands 2 days later. Anesthesia is required for both phases of treatment. It is hypothesized that extended-release liposome bupivacaine prolongs nerve blockade of the wrist allowing patients to undergo this 2-part regimen with less pain.</brief_summary>
