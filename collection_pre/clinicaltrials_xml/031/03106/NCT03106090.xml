	<brief_summary>The study will focus on survivorship care for head and neck cancer patients cared for within Duke Cancer Center clinics. Standardized survivorship care plans (sSCP) are being implemented based on the American Society for Clinical Oncology's criteria. These documents provide a summary of treatment received, and list side effects and follow-up information after cancer treatment. Taking advantage of this transition, the investigator will study three groups of patients: (a) early survivors treated before the sSCP was implemented, (b) early survivors treated after the sSCP was implemented, and (c) current patients who will receive an individualized enhanced SCP (eSCP), which will include additional information tailored to patient preferences. The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving enhanced survivorship care plans will increase their knowledge regarding their health care plan and wellness trajectory; increase their ability to identify the symptoms they most likely can expect as a result of their cancer treatment; and be more likely to engage in conversations with their PCP about healthy behaviors and screening guidelines.</brief_summary>
