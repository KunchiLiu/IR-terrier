	<brief_summary>Two groups will be recruited. The first group are pregnant ladies that have unequivocal rupture of fetal membranes that is diagnosed by seeing the amniotic fluid leakage in the vagina. The second group are normal pregnant ladies without rupture of membranes. both groups will be tested by taking vaginal washing fluid. Quantitative and qualitative pregnancy tests will be measured in this fluid.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin assay will be measured in the vaginal washing in two groups. The first group are pregnant women in the second or third trimester. These women have definite rupture of membranes diagnosed by visual leaking of the amniotic fluid from the cervix during speculum examination. The second group are pregnant women with intact membranes. Assessment of both the qualitative and quantitative beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin will be done</detailed_description>
