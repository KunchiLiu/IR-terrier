	<brief_summary>Vasoplegic syndrome is a common complication after cardiac surgery. Low dose vasopressin can up-regulate blood pressure and improve clinical outcomes compared with norepinephrine (mainly acute kidney injury Anesthesiology 2017; 126:85-93). Pituitrin is used as a substitute for vasopressin in our center, which contains both vasopressin and oxytocin. Oxytocin may alleviate inflammatory processe-associated kidney injury (Peptides 2006;27:2249-57). Therefore, the investigators hypothesize Pituitrin may be preferable to norepinephrine in the renal protection of patients with vasoplegic syndrome after cardiac surgery. Moreover, the serum levels of vesopressin, catecholamine, corticosteroid and corticotropin-releasing hormone will be measured.</brief_summary>
