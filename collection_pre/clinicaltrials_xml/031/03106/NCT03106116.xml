	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP) therapy on ventricular function in patients with coronary heart disease</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Enhanced External Counterpulsation on Ventricular Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with coronary heart disease will be randomized into two groups: standard medical treatment and standard medical treatment plus EECP intervention. Ventricular structure and function will be measured and compared.</detailed_description>
