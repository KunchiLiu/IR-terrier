	<brief_summary>A total of approximately 500 patients with active psoriatic arthritis in an estimated 80 to 100 trial centers are to be enrolled. Selection of centers will be made by the sponsor's medical section. To increase the quality of the data and to reduce distribution of the data collected, centers to be included will be those which can enroll at least 5 patients. Care will be taken to ensure a balanced regional distribution. The proposed observation period for the trial is approx. 52 weeks per patient. Estimated patient enrolment is also 52 weeks. Proposed duration from first patient in (FPI) to last patient out (LPO) is thus 24 months.</brief_summary>
