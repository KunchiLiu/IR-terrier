	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if mirvetuximab soravtansine can help to control either newly diagnosed or metastatic (has spread) triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Mirvetuximab soravtansine is designed to stop cell growth by blocking certain proteins in the cancer cells related to the mineral folate. This is believed to cause the cancer cells to die.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mirvetuximab Soravtansine in Localized Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are 2 cohorts in this study. If you have metastatic TNBC, you will be in Cohort A. If you have newly diagnosed TNBC, you will be in Cohort B. Study Drug Administration: On Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, you will receive mirvetuximab soravtansine by vein over about 2-3 hours. If you cannot tolerate the study drug, your dose may be lowered or stopped. Length of Study: If you are in Cohort A, you may receive mirvetuximab soravtansine for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest. If you are in Cohort B, you may receive mirvetuximab soravtansine for up to 4 cycles. After 4 cycles, you will have surgery as part of your standard care. You will no longer be able to receive the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Study Visits: On Day 1 of each cycle: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - If you can become pregnant, part of the above routine blood sample or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. You will come back to the clinic on Day 2 of Cycles 1-3. At these visits, your vital signs will be collected and the study doctor or study staff will check on your health. On Days 8 and 15 of Cycles 1-3, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. During even-numbered cycles (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on): - You will have imaging scans. The study doctor will tell you what type of scans you will have. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an eye exam. End-of-Treatment Visit: As soon as possible after your last cycle of study drug: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an eye exam. - You will have imaging scans. - If you are in Cohort B, you will have a core tumor biopsy to check the status of the disease. If you are in Cohort B, you will have surgery as part of your standard treatment. Follow-Up: Within 30 days after your last dose of study drug: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - If you did not have them performed at the end-of-treatment visit, you will have imaging scans. - If you can become pregnant, part of the above routine blood sample or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. You will continue to have imaging scans every 12 weeks for up to 1 year after your first dose of study drug. If the disease gets worse or you start a new anti-cancer therapy, these scans will stop. This is an investigational study. Mirvetuximab soravtansine is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain more and answer questions for how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 57 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

(For Cohort A) Archived tissue available at prescreening to confirm FR alpha+ breast cancer. 5. (For Cohort A) Archived tissue available prescreening to confirm FR alpha+ breast cancer. (For Cohort B) Confirmed FRalpha+ breast cancer defined as high FRalpha expression: =/&gt;75% of cells having =/&gt;1+ expression, or moderate FRalpha expression: 25%74% of cells with =/&gt;1+ expression. 6. (For Cohort A) Measurable disease per RECIST. (For cohort B) Clinical or radiologic primary tumor size of at least 1.5cm prior to enrollment onto protocol 20140185 (ARTEMIS). Primary tumor of at least 1.0 cm or evidence of continued lymphnode involvement by imaging (ultrasound or MRI) after Adriamycinbased neoadjuvant therapy. 7. (For cohort B): primary tumor sample collected before NACT started (on ARTEMIS) and underwent molecular testing for integral biomarkers including immunohistochemical assessment of FRalpha. 8. (For cohort A): no more than two prior therapies for metastatic disease. (Relapse of disease within 6 months of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is considered 1 line of therapy for metastatic disease). (For cohort B): received at least one dose of an anthracyclinebased NACT. Patients are eligible if therapy was discontinued due to disease progression or therapy intolerance. Patients with disease progression on anthracyclinebased therapy should be evaluated by the surgical team. If the patient is deemed inoperable at the time of evaluation, the patient may continue to undergo protocol therapy with a goal of reduction in tumor size to become operable. If the patient is deemed at high risk of becoming inoperable by the surgical team based upon tumor size or location, the patient will be considered ineligible for study and will be recommended to go to surgery. 9. (For cohort B): Primary tumor size of at least 1.0 cm by imaging (ultrasound or MRI) or evidence of continued lymph node involvement by imaging (ultrasound or MRI) after Adriamycinbased neoadjuvant therapy. 10. (For cohort B): baseline MUGA or echocardiogram showing LVEF =/&gt; 50% within 6 weeks prior to initiation of NACT. 11.
