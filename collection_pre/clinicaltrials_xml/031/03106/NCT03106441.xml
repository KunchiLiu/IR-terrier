	<brief_summary>Oro-tracheal intubation in operating room in obese patients with BMI &gt; 35kg/m2 remains a critical event. The aim of this study is to determine whether Nasal High Flow Therapy by nasal cannula Optiflow® is more efficient than the BIPAP preoxygenation before orotracheal intubation after crash induction in obese patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoxygenation Optimisation in Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be designed as followed : Patients will be randomized in 2 groups : - Preoxygenation during 4 minutes with High Flow Nasal Cannula (60l/min FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) = 1) before orotracheal intubation after crash induction. The device will be maintained in place throughout the intubation procedure in order to achieve apnoeic oxygenation. - Or Preoxygenation during 4 minutes with Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) with Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP) + 10 cm H2O and Inspiratory Airway Positive Airway Pressure (IPAP) + 25, meaning a 15cm H2O pressure support. The facial mask with be removed after before crash induction enabling laryngoscopic vision.</detailed_description>
