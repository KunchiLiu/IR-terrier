	<brief_summary>Alcohol and cannabis are the two most widely used substances of abuse in the world and are the psychoactive substances most often found in seriously and fatally injured drivers. In a recent study, we observed that individuals who reported both driving under the influence of alcohol (DUIA) and the influence of cannabis (DUIC) experienced collision risk that was nearly 4 times that of individuals who reported driving after using only one of these drugs. Recent research in the United States and Canada indicates that the prevalence of DUIC among young drivers of high school and university age, and young adults is similar to, or higher than, the prevalence of DUIA. This is a serious public health issue, since motor vehicle collisions are the leading cause of death in this age group. Given the frequency with which alcohol and cannabis are consumed together, it is important to understand their combined effects on driver behaviour. The residual or 'hangover' effects of these substances on road safety are also not well understood, but may be substantial. To date, the residual effects of combined use have not been examined. The current study will examine the acute and residual effects of a moderate dose of cannabis (12.5% THC) combined with an intoxicating amount of alcohol (BAC=0.08) on driving simulator performance of young drivers. Following an eligibility screening and practice session, a total of 70 participants aged 19 to 25 years will each complete 8 experimental sessions (2 sessions/week). During the first session of each week, subjects will drink alcohol or placebo alcohol and smoke an active or placebo cannabis cigarette. The effects of alcohol and cannabis on the performance of driving-related skills will be assessed using a high-fidelity driving simulator. Cognitive, psychomotor, and mood effects will also be assessed. Twenty-four hours after alcohol/drug exposure, subjects will attend the second session of the week where driving-related, cognitive, psychomotor, and mood effects will be assessed again.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed study will pursue the following primary aims: Aim 1: Examine the residual effects of a moderate dose of cannabis (12.5% THC) combined with an intoxicating amount of alcohol (BAC=0.08) on driving simulator performance of young drivers. Simulated driving performance, tests of cognition, verbal memory, and mood will be measured concurrently with levels of cannabinoids and alcohol metabolites in biological fluids at approximately 24 hours following acute drug exposure in male and female drivers aged 19 to 25. We will test the hypothesis that performance on a high-fidelity driving simulator task will be significantly impaired 24 hours following a dose of cannabis and a dose of alcohol in comparison to a placebo condition. Aim 2: Examine the acute effects of a moderate dose of cannabis (12.5% THC) combined with an intoxicating amount of alcohol (BAC=0.08) on driving simulator performance of young drivers. Simulated driving performance, tests of cognition, verbal memory, and mood will be measured concurrently with BAC and levels of cannabinoids in biological fluids before and after acute drug exposure in male and female drivers aged 19 to 25. BAC and biological fluids will be measured up to 5 hours following drug exposure. We will examine the relationship of BAC and cannabinoid levels to performance measures in this time frame. Aim 3: Explore the effects of driving history, driving attitudes, and individual difference measures (e.g., demographics, drug and alcohol use, etc.) on the acute and residual effects of alcohol and cannabis on driving simulator performance of young drivers. Exploratory analyses will be undertaken to determine if the acute and residual effects of cannabis plus alcohol on the driving simulator task are influenced by these measures. Study Design and Duration This study will be a within-subjects, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, randomized clinical trial assessing the impact of alcohol and cannabis combined on driver behaviour. Although a placebo condition is part of the study, this is not a treatment study. Initial contact with potential subjects will be made via telephone, and study personnel will conduct a telephone screen for eligibility. Upon eligibility confirmation by telephone, participants will be asked to attend CAMH for an eligibility assessment. Subjects will attend CAMH for a total of 10 study sessions (an eligibility assessment, a practice day, and 8 testing days). Participants will come to the lab for four testing weeks (Sessions 1-8) comprising two sessions each week. Each week participants will undergo one of these alcohol and cannabis exposure conditions: 1) placebo alcohol and placebo cannabis; 2) intoxicating dose of alcohol and placebo cannabis; 3) placebo alcohol and active cannabis, and; 4) intoxicating dose of alcohol and active cannabis. The order of these conditions will be randomly assigned. Each week the first session will be a session where participants will complete an alcohol manipulation followed by a cannabis manipulation (Sessions 1, 3, 5 and 7). Each week a second session will be completed approximately 24 hours after the alcohol and cannabis exposure session to measure residual effects (Sessions 2, 4, 6 and 8). The alcohol and cannabis exposure sessions will be separated by 7-15 days. Participants will be asked not to use cannabis for 72 hours and alcohol for 48 hours prior to attending CAMH. In certain instances, the Qualified Investigator may ask a participant to return for re-screening, e.g. repeat of urine test or other assessments performed for eligibility assessment. Also, in case of unforeseen delays in scheduling study participation, the Qualified Investigator will determine if there is a need to ask a participant to repeat some assessments, e.g., physical examination.</detailed_description>
