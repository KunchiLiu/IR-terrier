	<brief_title>Misoprostol With And Without Transcervical Balloon Catheter In Second Trimester Termination Of Pregnancy: RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted at AinShams Maternity Hospital. An open-label, parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial between two groups; each consisting of 54 women, undergoing termination of pregnancy during the second trimester for various medical reasons. The first group will receive the standard misoprostol protocol for termination of second trimester pregnancy currently practiced at AinShams Maternity Hospital; 400 micrograms of misoprostol administered vaginally for the first dose, followed after 6 hours by 400 micrograms administered orally, repeated every 6 hours till complete expulsion of the uterine contents or surgical interference is decided. The second group will receive the exact same regimen, but will have in addition a transcervical balloon (Foleys') catheter that will be inflated with 30 ml. of fluid; and will have weighted traction applied to the catheter through using a 1000 ml fluid-filled bag in order to apply continuous pressure to the cervix. The target sample size was calculated to be 108 cases; randomization will be in a ratio of 1:1 using a computer-generated random sequence. Allocation will be concealed using sealed, opaque consecutively-numbered envelopes. Women are counseled about the procedure, consenting women will thus be randomly assigned to one of the groups.</detailed_description>
