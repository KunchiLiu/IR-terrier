	<brief_summary>This study represents an extension of a previous study (NCT02641431) on the acute and long-term benefit of epicardial ablation on elimination of both BrS-ECG pattern and VT/VF inducibility in 200 consecutive BrS patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epicardial Ablation in Brugada Syndrome. An Extension Study of 200 BrS.Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to previous protocol (NCT02641431), additional consecutive selected patients having an ICD implantation will be enrolled up to a total of 200 BrS patients. Three-dimensional color-coded voltage, activation and duration electroanatomical maps before and after ajmaline (1mg/kg in 5 minutes) wiil determine the site and the size of the arrhythmogenic substrate as characterized by abnormally prolonged fragmented ventricular potentials. Primary endpoint will be identification and elimination of this electrophysiological substrate by RF applications leading to ECG pattern normalization and VT/VF non-inducibility before and after ajmaline. Patients will be followed up to 48 months after ablation by sequential 12-lead ECG and Holter recording, ICD interrogation, VT/VF inducibility before and after ajmaline test.</detailed_description>
