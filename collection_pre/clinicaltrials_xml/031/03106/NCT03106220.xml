	<brief_summary>Skeletal muscle abnormalities (sarcopenia) and frailty are common complications seen in patients with end-stage liver disease. The presence of these complications portends poor prognosis. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of a formal home based video strengthening program (REST) on sarcopenia and frailty. We also want to assess the impact of this exercise program on complication rates, hospitalization, on quality of life (QOL) and on survival.</brief_summary>
