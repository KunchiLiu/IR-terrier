	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Provide written informed consent prior to the initiation of study procedures Are &gt; 18 years of age Women consented to undergo standard of care minimally invasive pelvic surgery (traditional laparoscopy and robotic surgery) Women who are expected to be admitted to the hospital following surgery for at least 24 hours Are unwilling or unable to provide informed consent. Are unwilling or unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol. History of prior urologic surgery. History of prior pelvic surgery. History of known retroperitoneal fibrosis. Have any of the following screening laboratory values: Hemoglobin ≤ 8.0 g/dL; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤ 1500/μL; Platelet count ≤ 100,000/μL; Serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) creatinine; Serum bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x IULN; Aspartate transaminase (AST or serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, SGOT) ≥ 2x IULN;• Alanine transaminase (ALT or serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, SGPT) ≥ 2 x IULN. Females who are pregnant, lactating, or breastfeeding; Any other condition that, in the Investigator's judgment, would potentially compromise the study compliance or the ability to evaluate safety or efficacy.</criteria>
