	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the impact of hypoxic and hyperoxic breathing on measures of brain redox balance and metabolism in healthy individuals. All participants will undergo an MRI scan during administration of air mixtures with different oxygen concentrations to collect the brain measures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Studies of Acute Hypoxic and Hyperoxic Breathing in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Molecular oxygen (O2) constitutes 21% of the air people breathe at sea level. But humans can safely be exposed to somewhat lower and higher concentrations of oxygen. The varying amounts of oxygen entering the body modulate the oxygen available in tissue, ultimately leading to change in redox balance and metabolism. The investigators recently developed non-invasive MRI-based techniques to quantify redox balance and ATP generation in the brain. These processes are thought to be abnormal in people with psychiatric disorders. In this study, the investigators aim to manipulate the concentration of oxygen in the breathed air in 2 separate MRI scans on consecutive days (16% and 26%). The investigators anticipate that healthy individuals will demonstrate changes in brain redox balance and metabolism in response to these modulations.</detailed_description>
