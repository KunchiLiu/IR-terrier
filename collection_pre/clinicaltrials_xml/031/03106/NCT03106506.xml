	<brief_summary>The objective of this randomized controlled clinical study was to evaluate the increase in the volume of peri-implant gingival tissue in implants installed in the aesthetic areas with the use of subepithelial-conjunctive tissue graft, and a sample of 40 individuals with implants Aesthetics where the test group (n = 20) will receive tec graft. (N = 20) will receive only the dental implant without the placement of a tec graft. Epithelial-conjunctival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Connective Tissue Graft Around Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osseointegrated implants have been used since the mid-1950s, and countless studies have ensured the reliability of their use, so the implant has become a common practice among dental surgeons, as the use of implants has increased its complications as well. Accompany the same development, especially when they are installed in aesthetic areas, where deficiency of periimplant gingival tissue is insufficient. The objective of this randomized controlled clinical study was to evaluate the increase in the volume of periimplant gingival tissue in implants installed in the aesthetic areas with the use of subepithelial conjunctive tissue graft, and a sample of 40 individuals with implants aesthetics where the test group (n = 20) will receive tec graft. (N = 20) will receive only the dental implant without the placement of a tec graft epithelial conjunctival. In order to analyze the increase of gingival periimplant tissue, pre, trans and postoperative clinical measurements, aesthetic evaluation, patient satisfaction assessment and improvement of the quality of life will be performed and the radiographic measurements will be performed to evaluate the periimplant bone structures and their influence on the results. These measurements will be performed in the pre-operative (baseline), 6 months postoperatively and 6 months after installation of the definitive crown on the implant, the study will have a power of 80% (p = 0.05).</detailed_description>
