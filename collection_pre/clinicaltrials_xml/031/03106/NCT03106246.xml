	<brief_summary>Beta-cells release extracellular vesicles (EV) and exosomes under normal and pathophysiologic conditions. These EV contain beta-cell specific autoantigens which may trigger the immune response at the initiation of type 1 diabetes. In this study, beta-cell derived EV will be detected and characterized in human blood samples.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adult subjects will be recruited with: new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as well as islet transplant candidates. Blood samples will be collected at defined intervals to determine beta-cell specific EV and determine the utility of this biomarker as a measure of beta-cell stress or injury.</detailed_description>
