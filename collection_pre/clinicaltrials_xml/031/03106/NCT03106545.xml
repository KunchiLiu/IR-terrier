	<brief_summary>Postoperative analgesia for hallux valgus surgery (bunionectomy) is inconsistent and may even result in rebound pain when the (ankle) blocks wear off. It is hypothesized that the mixture of bupivacaine and liposome bupivacaine increases the extent and duration of postoperative analgesia and decreases opioid consumption as compared to bupivacaine alone or to general anesthesia.</brief_summary>

Currently pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the study or within 1 month after study drug administration Planned concurrent surgical procedure (e.g., bilateral hallux valgus repair) Concurrent painful physical condition that may require analgesic treatment (such as an NSAID or opioid) in the postsurgical period for pain that is not strictly related to hallux valgus and which may confound the postsurgical assessments (e.g., significant pain from other joints including chronic neuropathic pain, concurrent or prior contralateral knee or foot surgery) Previous hallux valgus on the foot being considered for surgery History of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to amidetype local anesthetics Contraindication to bupivacaine, oxycodone, morphine, or hydromorphone Chronic daily use of longacting opioid medication or NSAIDs (except for lowdose aspirin used for cardioprotection) within 24 hours Initiation of treatment with any of the following medications within 1 month of study drug administration or if the medication(s) are being given to control pain: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentin, pregabalin (Lyrica®), or duloxetine (Cymbalta®). If a subject is taking one of these medications for a reason other than pain control, he or she must be on a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to study drug administration. Current use of systemic glucocorticosteroids within 1 month of study enrollment Use of dexmedetomidine HCl (Precedex®) within 3 days of study drug administration History of impaired kidney function, chronic respiratory disease, rheumatoid arthritis, coagulopathy, or loss of sensation in the extremities Impaired kidney function (e.g., serum creatinine level &gt;2 mg/dL [176.8 µmol/L] or blood urea nitrogen level &gt;50 mg/dL [17.9 mmol/L]) or impaired liver function (e.g., serum aspartate aminotransferase [AST] level &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT] level &gt;3 times the ULN Uncontrolled anxiety, psychiatric, or neurological disorder that might interfere with study assessments Any chronic neuromuscular deficit affecting the peripheral nerves or muscles of the surgical extremity Any chronic condition or disease that would compromise neurological or vascular assessments Suspected or known history of drug or alcohol abuse within the previous year Body weight &lt;40 kg (88 pounds) or a body mass index &gt;44 kg/m2 Previous participation in an EXPAREL study Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 elimination halflives of such investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration, or planned administration of another investigational product or procedure during the subject's participation in this study</criteria>
