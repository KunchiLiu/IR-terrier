	<criteria>Must have given written informed consent and be able to comply with all study requirements Healthy males or females aged 1860 inclusive and weighing ≥ 50 kg at the time of Informed Consent Females must be nonpregnant and nonlactating, and either surgically sterile or post menopausal Males must be surgically sterile, abstinent or using an acceptable contraceptive method BMI ≤ 35 kg/m Agree to conduct at home blood pressure monitoring (in triplicate using study provided device) every morning and every evening throughout study participation For hypertensive patients enrolled into the trial: At Screening, the subject must have been on a stable regimen of antihypertensive medication(s) for at least 1 month prior to Screening, in 1 of the following categories: a Single angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or b. A single ARB or c. Either an ACEi or an ARB, and a single other antihypertensive medication (for example a beta blocker, a calcium channel blocker or diuretic medication) or d. Antihypertensive treatment naïve subject may be eligible following approval by the Sponsor Medical Monitor At Screening, the office seated blood pressure (confirmed in triplicate) must be within the following ranges with up to 2 additional tests allowed in order to qualify 1. Subject is controlled on antihypertensive medication and the office seated blood pressure must be ≥ 130 ≤ 150 mmHg systolic and ≥ 60 ≤ 90 mmHg diastolic OR 2. Antihypertensive medication treatment naïve subject must be ≥140 ≤160 mmHg systolic and ≥ 80 ≤ 100 mmHg diastolic Subject must have been diagnosed with essential hypertension for a minimum of 6 months prior to screening. Subject with documented stable hypertension for a shorter period than 6 months may be eligible following approval by the Sponsor Medical Monitor Subject must not be using a centrally acting medication for the treatment of hypertension (e.g., clonidine, guanfacine, guanabenz, alphamethyldopa) Subject must not be using a vasodilator for the treatment of hypertension (e.g., hydralazine, minoxidil, sodium nitroprusside, diazoxide) Treatment with another Study Drug, biological agent, or device within onemonth of Screening Subject with orthostatic hypotension defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg when they assume a standing position (within 3 minutes of standing up) Use of nicotinecontaining products or illicit drugs Considered unsuitable for inclusion by the Principal Investigator History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy Use of oral or parenteral anticoagulants For hypertensive patients enrolled into the trial: Unwilling to 1) discontinue antihypertensive mediations during washout and treatment period of study or 2) conduct runin period for treatment naïve hypertensive patients Subject has secondary hypertension Displays evidence of volume depletion (i.e., symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, low urine output or increased thirst) during screening or prior to dosing on Study Day 1 Subject anticipates using sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), or vardenafil (Levitra) during the investigational treatment period or for 4 weeks after the last dose Subject uses or anticipates using organic nitrate preparations (e.g., nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate or pentaerythritol) during the course of the study</criteria>
