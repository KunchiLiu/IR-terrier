	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center early phase II study. This proof of concept study will investigate whether the combined use of local tumor ablation/radiation plus immunomodulating drugs may induce a significant immune response in patient with incurable liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) (+/- limited extrahepatic disease) being stable or in partial remission after completion of 4-6 months first line systemic therapy. The primary objective of the study is to show an overall response rate of lesions not treated by ablation/radiotherapy including the extrahepatic lesions (according to iRECIST criteria) higher than 10%. With the continuation of first line systemic treatment, no further responses are expected. Secondary objectives are: - To establish the feasibility and safety of the combined treatment modalities; - To study the impact of the local technique (RFA/Radiotherapy) on the results; - To investigate biomarkers to predict response to the combined treatment</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed CRC Patients with CRC liver metastases, with or without extrahepatic disease, in which curative treatment is not possible by resection and or local ablation/radiotherapy. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age at time of study entry WHO performance status 0 to 1, at registration as well as before start of first line systemic treatment Body weight &gt;30kg Available baseline imaging, before start of first line treatment, measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 Stable disease or partial remission by RECIST criteria after 46 months of first line therapy for CRC (at least doublet of a fluoropyrimidine/irinotecan or fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin combination with or without a VEGFinhibitor or an antiEGFR agent). Complete responders or partial responders with a 80% or more decrease in the sum of measures (longest diameter for tumour lesions and short axis measure for nodes) of target lesions following first line therapy, taking as reference the sum of diameters from baseline scan prior to initiation of first line therapy are excluded as well as patients with almost complete cystic degeneration of liver metastases. Liver metastases amenable to ablation or stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) at completion of 46 months of first line therapy: For SBRT: allowing a total ablated volume of at least 25 cm3 and a maximum of 40 cm3 with a maximum of two lesions treated with SBRT For RFA: allowing a total ablated volume of at least 25 cm3 and a maximum advised volume of 120 cm3 After local tumour ablation/SBRT, at least two measurable liver metastases or at least 1 measurable liver metastasis and 1 measurable extrahepatic lesion should remain unaffected by ablation or SBRT to allow response monitoring according to RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST. Limited extra hepatic disease is allowed, including up to 2 extra hepatic metastatic sites, either lung, abdominal, pelvis, bone, or localized lymph node metastases. Each will be accounted separately as one site. So, two abdominal lesions will be accounted as 1 extrahepatic site, one lung and one abdominal lesion will be accounted two sites. Individual extrahepatic lesions should be ≤ 5 cm. Availability of tumour sample for biomarkers testing (MSI, PDL1, etc) (archival tissue from primary tumour ) Adequate normal organ and marrow function before initial first line systemic treatment as well as at baseline as defined below: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L (&gt; 1500 per mm3) Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L (&gt;100,000 per mm3) Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN). This will not apply to subjects with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of hemolysis or hepatic pathology), who will be allowed only in consultation with their physician. AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 5 x institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN or measured or calculated creatinine clearance &gt;40 mL/min by the CockcroftGault formula Haemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL at baseline Evidence of postmenopausal status or for female premenopausal patients negative urinary or serum pregnancy test. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following agespecific requirements apply: Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and folliclestimulating hormone levels in the postmenopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy). Women ≥50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiationinduced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, had chemotherapyinduced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy). Patients of childbearing / reproductive potential should use adequate birth control measures, as defined by the investigator, during the study treatment period and for from screening to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy or 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as those which result in low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Female subjects who are breast feeding should discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of study treatment and from screening to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy or 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy. Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up. Before patient registration/randomization, written informed consent must be given according to ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations Patients with with known brain metastases or history of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis History of radiation therapy of the liver, upper abdomen or lower thorax History of radioembolization of the liver Hilar liver lesions close to central bile ducts to be treated by RFA Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the first dose of IP. Note: Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable. Any unresolved toxicity NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2 from previous anticancer therapy with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion criteria Patients with Grade ≥2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a casebycase basis after consultation with the Study Physician. Patients with irreversible toxicity not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by treatment with durvalumab or tremelimumab may be included only after consultation with the Study Physician. Any previous treatment with a PD1 or PDL1 inhibitor, including durvalumab, a CTLA4 including tremelimumab or other checkpoint inhibitors or other immune therapy during the last 12 months Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid, or steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (eg, CT scan premedication) Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 30 days prior to study entry or within 30 days of receiving durvalumab Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including inflammatory bowel disease [eg, colitis or Crohn's disease], diverticulitis [with the exception of diverticulosis], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sarcoidosis syndrome, or Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc]).
