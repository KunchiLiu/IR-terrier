	<brief_summary>Diffuse Parenchymal Lung Disease(DPLD) is a chronic progressive fibrosis lung disease that with a highly variable clinical process.Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) is a high-molecular-weight glycoprotein, classified as human MUC1 mucin, that is produced mainly by regenerating type II pneumocytes.Serum levels of KL-6 have been shown to be elevated in patients with DPLD and could predict progress, but unaware of the differential threshold. The objective of this study was to perspectively and sequentially monitor serum KL-6 levels in patients with different DPLD,then analyze its clinical value and find the differential threshold.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Clinical Value of Serum KL-6 Changes on Evaluating Disease Development in Different Diffuse Parenchymal Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects and Method: Recruiting different DPLD patients in our hospital between 2013 February and 2016 October, including polymyositis/dermatomyositis related interstitial lung disease (PM/DM-ILD), rheumatoid arthritis related interstitial lung disease (RA - ILD), interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features(IPAF) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis(IPF), following up for enery 3 to 6 months. Once condition deteriorated, patient could return at any time if necessary according to our clinical physician judgment. Tumor markersï¼Œpulmonary function test(PFT); chest thin-section CT examination and CT scores; serum KL-6 levels were acquired in all patients at baseline and follow-ups. Serum KL-6 was measured on LUMIPULSE G System(FUJIREBIO, JAPAN) by chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay. All follow-up patients will be respectively divided into improved,stable and deteriotated group according to the official ATS/ERS statement. Inclusion criteria: (1)patient with PM/DM-ILD, RA-ILD, IPAF, IPF.The diagnosis of patient were according to the official ATS/ERS statement and the American College of Rheumatology/European League standard;(2)18 to 80 years old. Exclusion criteria: (1)conbination with pulmonary tubenculersis,pulmonary infection,tumor;(2)no serum KL-6 or pulmonary function test or chest thin-section CT examintion ;(3)patient with severe hepatic and renal dysfunction,heart disease or receiving hemodialysis treatment;(4)pregnant or plan to be pregnant</detailed_description>
