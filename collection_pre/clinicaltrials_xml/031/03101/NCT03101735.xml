	<brief_summary>This is a non interventional, multicenter clinical trial, in adult patients receiving Tecfidera per approved SmPC and routine clinical practice. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the total societal costs to the healthcare system related to the use of Tecfidera in RRMS patients. The study will capture data in a simple matter that can be easily interpreted providing an advantage in a country where efforts in the market access arena are in their infancy. For the aforementioned reasons, the proposed study may prove quite valuable in supporting DMF as a cost‐effective therapy, valuable not only for patients but for the public health care system as well, providing all the necessary information for the evaluation that need to be examined regarding the positive reimbursement list and future decisions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess Resource Utilization and Quality of Life of Patients With RRMS Treated With Tecfidera in Greece</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will take place in Greece. Investigators will participate from a broad geographical distribution in order to ensure a proper representation from all areas of Greece.

	<mesh_term>Dimethyl Fumarate</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Persons aged 1865 years. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of RRMS. Patients for whom the decision to prescribe therapy with Tecfidera®, according to the locally approved product's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) has already been taken prior to their enrolment in the study.

Patients must have signed an informed consent document. Patients must be able to read, understand and complete the study specific questionnaire. Patients having other forms of MS, like Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) or progressive forms. Patients who have initiated treatment with Tecfidera® more than 7 days before study enrolment or have received DMF at any different time prior to this period. Patients that meet any of the contraindications to the administration of the study drug according to the approved SmPC. Receipt of any investigational agent within 30 days or 5 halflives of the investigational agent (whichever is longer) before the commencement of therapy with Tecfidera®.</criteria>
