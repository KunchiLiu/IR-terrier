	<brief_summary>Panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA) is associated with considerable personal distress, functional disability and societal costs. A large number of studies have shown that Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is a highly effective treatment for PDA. However, the CBT-protocols proven to be most effective involves repeated exposure to the particular environments the agoraphobic patient fears such as trains, tunnels, lifts and shops. This cause great practical problems for health care services as such therapeutic efforts involves spending considerable time outside the clinic. For primary care services this is particularly challenging due to the large number of patients expected to be seen. Normally clinicians meet up to 7 patients daily which makes it almost practically impossible to offer 2-hour sessions, which is necessary to carry out the relevant exposure tasks. Hence, the treatment proven to be most effective, which our primary care services are commissioned to deliver, is too comprehensive and time consuming to be applied in real practice. This is a problem. We believe that a possible solution to the above problem is to provide evidence-based CBT but with the exposure components carried out through Virtual Reality (VR) rather than in vivo. Some research has already been done with virtual reality and exposure therapy for anxiety disorders with promising results. The aim of this pilot study is to treat patients with agoraphobia with or with a history of panic disorder with a standardized CBT-protocol albeit all exposure therapy will be done through VR. The virtual environments that are used for the study are live sequences filmed in 360Â°. We hypothesize that CBT with VR will be effective and lead to improvements on measures of panic disorder and agoraphobia.</brief_summary>
