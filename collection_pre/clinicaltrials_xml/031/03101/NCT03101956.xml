	<brief_summary>The aim of this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial is to investigate the immediate effects of spinal manipulation on hip and knee muscle strength and pain-free deep squat range of motion in order to answer several conceptual and practical research questions</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lumbar Manipulation for Hip and Muscle Stregth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective, double-blind, randomized control trial clinical will use a multigroup pretest-posttest control design with 1 treatment arm and 1 control arm. Interpreted within the biopsychosocial model and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework, this research will measure the outcomes between patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), the health condition, and contextual factors, particularly personal factors. It will address personal factors such as gender and age but will not address environmental factors. This research includes tests and measures of two of the three levels of human functioning, or domains, impairments to body functions and structures and activity limitations. Muscle strength testing is an impairment-level measure and pain-free deep squat range of morion (ROM) is an activity limitation-level measure.</detailed_description>
