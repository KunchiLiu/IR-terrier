	<brief_title>Retroperitoneal Ligation of Uterine Artery in Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy for Enlarged Uterus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic hysterectomy is one of the most common gynecologic surgeries worldwide. Generally, in total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH), uterine arteries are coagulated or transected close to the uterus, alongside the cervix, like surgical technique of a conventional total abdominal hysterectomy. Recently, several studies showed that ligation of uterine artery where it originates from the internal iliac artery during TLH (so-called "retroperitoneal TLH") is effective for reducing blood loss. However, the application of this technique to clinical practice have not been well investigated in terms of its efficacy and safety. Moreover, most of the previous studies on retroperitoneal TLH were small case series or retrospective comparative studies with conventional TLH. Therefore, the investigators conducted this randomized trial to investigate the role of retroperitoneal TLH in enlarge uterus.</detailed_description>
