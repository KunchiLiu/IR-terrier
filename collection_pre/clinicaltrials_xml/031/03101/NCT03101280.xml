	<brief_summary>This is a Phase Ib, open-label, non-randomized study in participants with advanced gynecological cancers (Part 1) and platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (Part 2) to investigate the dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of rucaparib in combination with atezolizumab. The study is conducted in 2 parts: a Dose-Finding Phase (Part 1) and a Dose-Expansion Phase (Part 2).</brief_summary>
