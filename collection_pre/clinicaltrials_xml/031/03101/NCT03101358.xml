	<brief_summary>This study evaluates a topical nanoparticle paclitaxel ointment (SOR007) for the treatment of cutaneous metastases from non-melanoma cancer in adults. Three concentrations of SOR007 will be evaluated in dose-rising cohorts of three. An expanded cohort will treat additional subjects at the maximum tolerated dose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Topical SOR007 Ointment for Cutaneous Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2a, open-label, dose-rising study evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of three concentrations of SOR007 (Uncoated Nanoparticle Paclitaxel) Ointment (0.15%, 1.0%, and 2.0%) applied to non-ulcerated, non-melanoma cutaneous metastases. A treatment area of 50 cm2 will be selected by the Investigator. Using a gloved hand, subjects will apply one Finger Tip Unit (FTU) of SOR007 to the 50 cm2 treatment area twice daily at approximately the same time each day for 28 days. At each visit (Days 1, 8, 16, 28, and 42), at least two color photographs of the treatment area will be taken (with a ruler for scale). All eligible lesions within the treatment area will be measured using ImageJ and the photographs taken at each visit. Eligible lesions will be determined at baseline by the RECIST definition of measurable tumors (≥ 10mm in its longest diameter). The study will include a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. In the dose escalation phase, formal safety reviews will be conducted after the last subject in each cohort of three subjects completes 15 days of treatment. The next dose level will enroll upon a finding of safety and tolerability. The top dose or the maximum tolerated dose (if DLT occurs) will be taken into the dose expansion phase and additional subjects will be enrolled to reach a maximum of 12 subjects at that dose.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Signed informed consent; 2. Patients ≥ 18 years of age; 3. Cutaneous metastases of nonmelanoma origin; 4. Biopsy confirmed cutaneous metastases; the biopsy must have removed ≤ 25% of the largest lesion within the treatment area and there must be at least 2 weeks but no more than 4 weeks between the date of biopsy and initiation of topical treatment with SOR007; 5. ECOG Grade 0 1, with minimum life expectancy of at least 3 months; 6. At least one baseline eligible lesion on the trunk or extremities. Per RECIST criteria, an eligible lesion at baseline is considered measurable when ≥ 10mm diameter in the longest diameter; 7. Willing to refrain from using other lotions, creams, etc. during the treatment period; 8. Subjects with adequate organ and bone marrow function as defined below: ANC ≥ 1,500/µl Hemoglobin ≥ 9.5 grams/dL Platelets ≥ 75,000/µl Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x institutional ULN AST/ ALT ≤ 2.5x institutional ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5x institutional ULN 9. Appropriate contraception throughout study period to avoid the potential for pregnancy for subjects and subjects' partners of childbearing potential include but are not limited to: A female is of childbearing potential unless she has had a hysterectomy, is at least one year postmenopausal or has undergone tubal ligation. For the purposes of this study, adequate birth control includes at least one medically approved and highly effective method of birth control, defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e. &lt; 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectable and oral contraceptives combined with the use of a condom. 10. Abstinence from all manner of physical contact near the treatment area during and up to 2 weeks after the treatment phase. 1. Open or ulcerated wounds at the site of cutaneous metastasis; 2. Treatment with the following within the 4 weeks prior to the screening visit: radiotherapy, intralesional therapy; laser therapy surgery (other than biopsy) to the target area, local hyperthermia, levulinic acid, 5fluorouracil, high potency corticosteroids (including systemic steroids), retinoids, diclofenac, hyaluronic acid, imiquimod; 3. Systemic chemotherapy, topical or direct lesional therapy, laser, hyperthermia or steroids scheduled for the study period; 4. Active disease or positive virus for HIV/AIDS; 5. Elective surgery for treatment of the cutaneous metastases during the study and up to 4 weeks after the treatment period. Cutaneous metastases are required to remain insitu and measurable for up to 2 weeks after last treatment to achieve study objectives; 6. Known allergic reactions, irritations or sensitivity to the active ingredients or other components of SOR007; 7. Symptoms of a clinically significant illness that may place the subject at risk by trial participation or influence the outcome of the trial in the four weeks before first treatment and during the trial; 8. Participation in the treatment phase of another clinical trial within the four weeks prior to treatment in this clinical trial; 9. Investigator's opinion of subject's probable noncompliance or inability to understand the trial and/or give adequate informed consent; 10. Evidence of current chronic alcohol or drug abuse; 11. Pregnancy and/or lactating.</criteria>
