	<brief_summary>Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) complications following catheter use in surgical patients remains high. Using an aseptic protocol has been shown to drastically reduce UTI incidence by 50%. Reducing UTIs will prevent extended hospital stays, readmission, and antibiotic use associated with this complication and improve cost-effectiveness of care. The investigators hypothesize that they can reduce the incidence of UTIs after catheter placement with the implementation of a Quality Improvement (QI) protocol to prevent excess exposure to the environment exposure of the catheter before, during and after insertion.</brief_summary>
