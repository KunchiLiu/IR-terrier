	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of TAK-831 Tablet Formulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-831. TAK-831 is being tested in healthy participants in order to determine the effect of food on the PK of single oral dose of TAK-831 tablet formulation. The study will enroll approximately 16 participants. Participants will be randomly and equally assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to 1 of the 2 treatment sequences following as: - TAK-831 400 mg Fasted + TAK-831 400 mg Fed - TAK-831 400 mg Fed + TAK-831 400 mg Fasted All participants will be asked to take single oral dose of TAK-831 tablet at the same time on Day 1 of each Intervention Period. This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is 23 days. Participants will visit the clinic on Day -1 and remained confined until Day 3 of Intervention Period 1 and 2. A washout period of minimum 7 days will be maintained between the doses in each Intervention Period. Participants will make 3 visits to the clinic on Days 4, 6 and 8 on each Intervention Period and will be contacted by telephone 14 days after the last dose of study drug (Day 23) for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
