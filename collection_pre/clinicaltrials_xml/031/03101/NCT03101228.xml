	<brief_summary>The most important objective of this randomized controlled trial in subjects with increased cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors is to investigate whether only reduced daily sitting improves human cardiovascular and metabolic health during a six-month intervention. It is hypothesized and expected that only reduced sitting, without formal physical activity or exercise training, affects favorably cardiovascular and metabolic health.</brief_summary>
