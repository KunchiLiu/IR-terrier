	<brief_summary>This study compares the biological activity of cabazitaxel (6 cycles) to that of docetaxel (6 cycles) in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with docetaxel resistant mCPRC defined as ≥ 5CTCs/7.5ml after 2 cycles of docetaxel. Patients with docetaxel resistant metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) based on circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration (patients with ≥ 5CTCs/7.5ml before docetaxel chemotherapy and after 2 cycles of docetaxel) will receive either 6 additional cycles of docetaxel or 6 additional cycles of cabazitaxel after randomisation. A cohort of patients with docetaxel sensitive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) based on circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration (patients ≥ 5CTCs/7.5ml before docetaxel chemotherapy and &lt; 5CTCs/7.5ml after 2 cycles of docetaxel) will receive 6 additional cycles of docetaxel</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Written informed consent signed prior any studyrelated procedures 2. Adult men ≥ 18 years 3. Histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma 4. Metastatic disease as evidenced by imaging (bone scan, CT scan, MRI and/or PETcholine). 5. Documented progressive disease while receiving continuous hormonal treatment with LHRH agonist or antagonist or after surgical castration (at least one visceral or soft tissue metastatic lesion, including a new lesion). Patient with nonmeasurable disease must have documented rising PSA levels or appearance of new lesion 6. Effective castration assessed by testosterone levels ≤ 50 ng/dl 7. Patients with a performance status ECOG ≤ 2 (Appendix 1) 8. Patients affiliated to social security scheme 1. Prior chemotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer except estramustine &lt; 1 year from the end of adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for localized disease &lt; 1 year from the end of chemotherapy for de novo metastatic prostate cancer 2. Prior isotope therapy, whole pelvic radiotherapy or radiotherapy to &gt; 30% of bone marrow, 3. Less than 1 month elapsed from prior treatment with radiotherapy, surgery and less than 2 weeks from any previous hormonal treatment except for LHRH agonists/antagonists (which are to be continued). Patients may be treated with bisphosphonates prior to study entry which should be pursued, 4. History of brain metastases, uncontrolled spinal cord compression, carcinomatous meningitis or new evidence of brain or leptomeningeal disease, 5. Patient with any of the following abnormal laboratory tests: hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl, absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 x 109/L, platelets &lt; 100 x 109/L, AST/SGOT and/or ALT/SGPT &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin &gt; 1.0 ULN, creatinine clearance &lt; 40 ml/mn (MDRD), 6. History of hypersensitivity to polysorbate 80 or docetaxel, 7. Contraindication to the use of corticosteroids, 8. Peripheral neuropathy grade ≥ 2 according to NCI CTCAE v. 4.0, 9. Ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50% (echography or scintigraphy), 10. Any of the following within 6 months prior to study entry: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina pectoris, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, NYHA class III or IV congestive heart failure, stroke or transient ischemic attack, 11. Any of the following within 3 months prior to study entry: treatment resistant peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis or gastritis, inflammatory bowel disease, pulmonary embolism or other uncontrolled thromboembolic event, 12. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormally that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator, excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study, 13. Planned vaccination with a live or liveattenuated vaccines, 14. Participation in another clinical trial and any treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to randomization, 15. Any illness or problem including geographic, psychiatric or psychological which is incompatible with being monitored during the trial 16. Patients with reproductive potential who do not agree to use effective method of contraception during the treatment, 17. Person deprived of their liberty or under protective custody or guardianship.</criteria>
