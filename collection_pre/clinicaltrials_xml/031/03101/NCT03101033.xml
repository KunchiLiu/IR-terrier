	<brief_title>Epidural Neuroplasty for the Treatment of Herniated Lumbar Disk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred patients diagnosed as herniated lumbar disc will be recruited and divided into two groups. One group will be treated with Transforaminal steroid injection, the other with epidural neuroplasty. The VAS and ODI scores obtained at one month, three months and six months post-treatment will be analysed statistically.</detailed_description>
