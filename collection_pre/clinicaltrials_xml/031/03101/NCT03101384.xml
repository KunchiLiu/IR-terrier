	<brief_summary>Diagnostic errors have been reported frequently in patient with pulmonary embolism since symptoms are not specific. However, there is only scarce evidence that the delay associated with diagnostic errors may impact patient prognosis. The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of diagnostic errors and if they are associated with more severe pulmonary embolism in term of initial presentation and complications.</brief_summary>
