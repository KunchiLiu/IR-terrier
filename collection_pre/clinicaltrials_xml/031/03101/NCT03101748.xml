	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding neratinib to either taxol (paclitaxel) or to the combination of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can help to control metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer when given before other standard chemotherapy (doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide) and surgery. Researchers also want to find the highest tolerable dose of neratinib that can be used in these study drug combinations. The safety of these drug combinations will also be studied.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be assigned to 1 of 3 study groups based on participant's screening results: - If participant is in Group A or B, participant will receive neratinib, paclitaxel, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab. The difference between these 2 groups is that the dose of neratinib and paclitaxel may be different for participants in Group A, but all participants in Group B will receive the same dose. - If participant is in Group A, participant will be assigned to a dose level of neratinib based on when participant joins this study. Up to 4 dose levels of neratinib will be tested. Up to 20 total participants will be enrolled in Group A. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of neratinib is found. - If participant is in Group B, participant will receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide after receiving 4 cycles of the drugs listed above. - If participant is in Group C, participant will receive neratinib and paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Study Drug Administration: All participants will take neratinib 1 time a day by mouth for the first week as a 1-week "pre-cycle". After that, all study cycles will be 21 days long and participant's drug administration schedule will depend on what group participant is in. If participant is in Group A: - Participant will take neratinib tablets 1 time a day by mouth with food at the same time each day (in the morning, if possible) during Cycles 1 - 4. The study doctor will tell participant how many tablets participant needs to take every day. - Participant will receive paclitaxel by vein over about 1-3 hours on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1 - 4. - Participant will receive pertuzumab by vein over about 1 hour on Day 1 of Cycles 1 - 4 - Participant will receive trastuzumab by vein over about 1-2 hours on Day 1 of Cycles 1 - 4. - After Cycle 4, participant's doctor will decide what kind of treatment participant will receive next. The study doctor will tell participant more about what participant will take and how to take it. If participant is in Group B: - Participant will take neratinib tablets 1 time a day by mouth with food at the same time each day (in the morning, if possible) during Cycles 1 - 4. The study doctor will tell participant how many tablets participant needs to take every day. - Participant will receive paclitaxel by vein over about 1-3 hours on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1-4. - Participant will receive pertuzumab by vein over about 1 hour on Day 1 of Cycles 1 - 4 - Participant will receive trastuzumab by vein over about 1 - 2 hours on Day 1 of Cycles 1 - 4. - Participant will receive standard-of-care doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide by vein over about 90 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 5 - 8. If participant is in Group C: - Participant will take neratinib tablets 1 time a day by mouth with food at the same time each day (in the morning, if possible) during Cycles 1 - 4. The study doctor will tell participant how many tablets participant needs to take every day. - Participant will receive paclitaxel by vein over about 1 - 3 hours on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1 - 4. - Participant will receive standard-of-care doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide by vein over about 90 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 5 - 8. If participant is in Group B or C, participant will have standard-of-care surgery after participant finishes receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Participant will receive a separate consent form for the surgery that describes the procedure and its risks. Length of Study: Participant will receive up to 8 cycles of study drugs. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions. Participation on the study will be over after the follow-up period. Study Visits: If participant is in Group A: - Before Day 1 of Cycle 1, participant will have a breast core biopsy to collect tissue for biomarker testing. - Before Day 1 of Cycles 1 - 4, and then before participant begins the next treatment, participant will have a physical exam including a breast and lymph node exam. - Before Day 1 of Cycle 1 and then before participant begins the next treatment after Cycle 4, the study doctor will take pictures of both of participant's breasts. - On Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1 - 4 and before participant begins the next treatment after Cycle 4, blood (about 1-3 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. - Before Day 1 of Cycle 1, and then before participant begins the next treatment after Cycle 4, participant will have a mammogram of the involved breast and an ultrasound of the involved breast and lymph nodes. Participant may have a breast MRI if the doctor thinks it is needed. If participant is in Group B or C: - Before Day 1 of Cycle 1, participant will have a breast core biopsy to collect tissue for biomarker testing. - Before Day 1 of Cycles 1 - 5, after the last dose of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, and before surgery, participant will have a physical exam including a breast and lymph node exam. - Before Cycle 1 and Cycle 5, and then before surgery, the study doctor will take pictures of both of participant's breasts. - On Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1 - 5 and then before surgery, blood (about 1-3 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. - Before Day 1 of Cycle 1, before participant begins receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, and then before surgery, participant will have a mammogram of the involved breast and an ultrasound of the involved breast and lymph nodes. Participant may have a breast MRI if the doctor thinks it is needed. - During surgery, breast tissue samples will be collected to identify tumors for routine testing and for biomarker testing. No additional breast tissue will be removed in addition to what would already be removed during surgery. Follow-Up: About 1 month after surgery, participant will be asked about participant's health and any side effects participant may have had. Participant may be asked during a routine clinic visit or participant may be called by a member of the study staff. If participant is called, each call should last about 2 minutes. This is an investigational study. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide are FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of breast cancer. Neratinib is not FDA approved or commercially available. The drug combinations are investigational and are currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can describe how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 99 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

Subject of Childbearing potential should is willing to use effective methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity during study and at least 4 months after the last dose of study drug. Subject of childbearing potential is defined as has not been surgically sterilized or free from menses for &gt; 1 year. 9. Subject of childbearing potential is willing to use effective methods of birth control include: 1) Use of hormonal birth control methods: pills, shots/injections, implants (placed under the skin by a health care provider), or patches (placed on the skin); 2) Intrauterine devices (IUDs); 3) Using 2 barrier methods (each partner must use 1 barrier method) with a spermicide. Males must use the male condom (latex or other synthetic material) with spermicide. Females must choose either a Diaphragm with spermicide, or Cervical cap with spermicide, or a sponge (spermicide is already in the contraceptive sponge). Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test no more than 21 days prior to starting study drug; 4) For male participant, they must agree and commit to use a barrier method of contraception while on treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of investigational product. 10. Cohort 1: Phase 1b: Subject must have HER2 + (regardless of hormonal receptor status) primary metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer (IBC or NonIBC). HER2 positive status is defined as strongly positive (3+) staining score by IHC, or gene amplification using FISH, if performed. If IHC is equivocal (2+), assays using FISH require gene amplification based on recent ASCOCAP guideline: dualprobe HER2/CEP17 ratio is &gt;/=2.0 and/or an average HER2 copy number &gt;/= 6.0 signals/cell. IBC is determined by using international consensus criteria: Onset: Rapid onset of breast erythema, edema and/or peau d'orange, and/or warm breast, with/without an underlying breast mass. Duration: History of such findings no more than 6 months. Extent erythema occupying at least 1/3 of whole breast. Pathology: Pathologic confirmation of invasive carcinoma 11. Cohort 1: Phase II: Patient must have HER2+ (regardless of hormonal receptor status) stage III IBC. 12. Cohort 2 Patient must have HER2/ER+ stage III IBC. HER2 negative status, which determined by assays using IHC require negative (0 or 1+) staining score. If IHC is equivocal (2+) staining score, assays using FISH require the absence of gene amplification: dualprobe HER2/CEP17 ratio is &lt; 2.0 and an average HER2 copy number &lt;4.0 signals/cell. If HER2 testing result is confirmed at MDACC, it does not require centralized repeat testing. Hormone receptor (HR) positivity is determined by ER &gt;10% and /or PR &gt;10% by IHC staining. 1.
