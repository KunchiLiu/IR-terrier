	<brief_title>The Safety and Efficacy of CART-19 Cells in Relapse and Refractory Patients With CD19+ B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study for the patients with B cell lymphoma. Subjects will be staged and the suitability of their T cells for CART-19 manufacturing will be determined at entry phase. Subjects will be collected their T cells and modify them, the modification is a genetic change, that CD19:4-1BB:CD3 modified T cells, in order to tells the T cells to recognize their target tumor cells and potentially kill them, but not other normal cells in the subject's body. The CART cells will then be expanded in vitro and then administered to subjects. The purpose of this study is to assess ssess the safety and feasibility of CART-19 cells in the patients with relapsed and refractory CD19+ B cell lymphoma.</detailed_description>
