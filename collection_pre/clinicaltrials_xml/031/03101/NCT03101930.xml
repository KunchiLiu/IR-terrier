	<brief_summary>This project tests the principle hypothesis that stable glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues have specific GLP1R-dependent beneficial effects on vascular endothelial function, fibrinolysis and inflammation in obesity that exceed the benefits of weight loss, and that genetic or other individual factors that modulate GLP1R sensitivity can modify the effect of these analogues on cardiovascular risk.</brief_summary>
