	<brief_summary>The present study aims to examine the feasibility of a computerized treatment for social anxiety disorder. To evaluate the efficacy of the IBM protocol the investigators have developed in reducing evaluation and social threat biases, they will conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial. Individuals with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (N = 50) will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) IBM or 2) progressive muscle relaxation. Each condition will consist of eight 25 minute treatment sessions. Participants will complete two sessions per week for four weeks and will be administered assessments at pre-treatment, one week post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up. It is hypothesized that: 1) IBM will lead to greater reductions in social anxiety symptoms than the PMR condition; 2) IBM will lead to greater reductions in depression and anxiety than the PMR condition; 3) IBM will lead to greater reductions in threat interpretations and greater increases in benign interpretations than the PMR condition; 4) The effects of condition on social anxiety symptoms will be mediated by changes in social anxiety-related interpretation bias; and 5) The effects of condition will be maintained at the 3-month follow-up assessment.</brief_summary>
