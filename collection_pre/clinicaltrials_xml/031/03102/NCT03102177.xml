	<detailed_description>Setting The study was conducted on the clinical research unit of an academic medical center. Participants Adults of any age being treated with levothyroxine for hypothyroidism were studied. Interventions A single dose of 13C- LT4 was administered to hypothyroid subjects taking levothyroxine replacement. Main Outcomes and Measures Eighteen serial plasma samples were collected. One sample was obtained before the 13C- LT4 dose and the remainder over the 312-hour period post-dosing. 13C- LT4 concentration was quantified using validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods. Pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using linear log trapezoidal non-compartmental analysis using Phoenix 6.4.</detailed_description>
