	<brief_title>Atezolizumab Immunotherapy in Patients With Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II pilot trial will combine neoadjuvant immunotherapy with Atezolizumab q 21 days for 12 weeks with standard chemoradiotherapy with curative intent for good PS patients with unresectable stage IIIA/B NSCLC. Because of the consequences of progression in this curative-intent population, restaging CT scans will be carried out after the first 2 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy. Non progressing patients will complete a total of one year of anti-PDL1 therapy with an interruption during chemoradiotherapy. Patients with evidence of progression at the first restaging evaluation will proceed immediately to chemoradiotherapy if still eligible for curative intent therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Newly diagnosed stage IIIA/B NSCLC, PS 01 No active autoimmune disease or uncontrolled infection, normal bone marrow, renal, hepatic function, FEV1 &gt; 1.2L, no significant underlying heart or lung disease Pathologically proven diagnosis of NSCLC Measurable Stage IIIA or IIIB disease Tissue available for PDL1 testing and for correlative science testing Patients must be considered unresectable or inoperable. Patients with nodal recurrence after surgery for earlystage NSCLC are eligible if the following criteria are met: No prior chemotherapy or radiation for this lung cancer. Prior curativeintent surgery at least 3 months prior to the nodal recurrence. Stage III A or B disease with minimum diagnostic evaluation within 6 weeks to include: History/physical examination Contrast enhanced CT of the chest and upper abdomen MRI of the brain with contrast (or CT with contrast if MRI is medically contraindicated) PET/CT If pleural fluid is visible on CT scan thoracentesis to exclude malignancy should be obtained. Patients with effusions that are too small to tap are eligible. Patients must be at least 4 weeks from major surgery and must be fully recovered Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Representative formalinfixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) tumor specimens in paraffin blocks or at least 4 unstained slides, with an associated pathology report, for central testing of tumor PDL1 expression. If an archived tumor block exists, then either the block or at least 4 unstained slides from the block should be submitted. Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content, i.e. at least 50 viable tumor cells and intact tissue architecture. Fine needle aspiration, brushing,and lavage samples are not acceptable. If the block is tissue from a coreneedle biopsy, then the block should contain tissue from at least three cores to be sufficient for evaluation. Patients who do not have existing (archived) tissue specimens meeting eligibility requirements may undergo a biopsy during the screening period. Acceptable samples include core needle biopsies for deep tumor tissue (minimum of three cores) or excisional, or forceps biopsies for endobronchial or nodal lesions. The tissue should be fixed in formalin and embedded on site and sent as a block.

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1 INR and aPTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN • This applies only to patients who do not receive therapeutic anticoagulation; patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (such as lowmolecularweight heparin or warfarin) should be on a stable dose.
