	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to use a brain stimulation tool called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to investigate the analgesic (reducing sensitivity to pain) effects of lidocaine cream and the hyperalgesic (increasing sensitivity to pain) effects of capsaicin cream using a neutral cream as a control. tDCS stimulation has been shown to temporarily influence the way the stimulated part of the brain functions. With this method, the involvement of specific parts of the brain can be investigated in the working of the brain as a whole.</brief_summary>
