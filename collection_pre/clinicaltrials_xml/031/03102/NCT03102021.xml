	<brief_title>The Effect of Human Recombinant Erythropoietin in Acute Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury is associated with increased morbidity. The most common injury to the kidney occurs during hospitalization with either ischemic or nephrotoxic insult to the kidney. This can prolong hospitalization and depending on the severity of the insult result in permanent decreased kidney function. Recent studies in animals have suggested benefits of using erythropoietin in high doses at time of kidney injury with eividence for less injury in the kidney tissue of those animals who received treatment compared to those animals that received only saline. Limited human data also suggests that use of high dose erythropoietin at the time of stroke can decrease the extent of brain injury. In addition cardiac cell culture studies also have shown decrease in cell injury with use of erythropoietin. These studies have prompted us to evaluate if admininstering erythropoietin to those with onset of acute kidney injury during their hospitalization may benefit from this intervention. This pilot study then evaluates that use of high dose erythropoietin administed daily over 3 days in patients with acute kidney injury on whether the days spent in renal failure are less than those who will receive no study medication. Those patients with kidney failure from either ischemic or nephrotoxic insult and no other contraindication to erythropoietin use will be considered for the study. Informed consent is obtained from the patient or next of kin</detailed_description>
