	<brief_title>Plinabulin vs. Pegfilgrastim in Patients With Solid Tumors Receiving Docetaxel Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study with a phase 2 portion and a phase 3 portion. Approximately 190 patients will be enrolled in this study. All patients will receive docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2. In Phase 2, patients only with advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failing platinum based therapy will be enrolled. In Phase 3, patients with one of the following will be enrolled: advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who have failed ≥ 1 but &lt; 5 prior lines of chemotherapy; advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failing platinum based therapy; or hormone refractory (androgen independent) metastatic prostate cancer. The eligibility of all patients will be determined during a 28-day screening period. Phase 2: Approximately 40 patients with advanced and metastatic NSCLC will be enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned, with 10 patients enrolled in each arm, with the arm designation and planned intervention as follows: Arm 1: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg) + placebo matching plinabulin Arm 2: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (20 mg/m2) + placebo matching pegfilgrastim Arm 3: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (10 mg/m2) + placebo matching pegfilgrastim Arm 4: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (5 mg/m2) + placebo matching pegfilgrastim The study will be temporarily closed to enrollment when 40 patients have been enrolled and completed at least 1 treatment cycle in each arm in phase 2. The Sponsor will notify the study sites when this occurs. Once the study is temporarily closed to enrollment in phase 2, a PK/PD analysis will be performed to determine the RP3D. The PK/PD analysis will be done by an independent party at the time 40 patients in Phase 2 have completed at least Cycle 1. This analysis will be blinded to the study team. Phase 3: Phase 3 will not begin until RP3D has been determined based on the phase 2 PK/PD analysis as mentioned above; the RP3D will be the only plinabulin dose administered in Phase 3. Approximately 150 patients are planned to be enrolled in the Phase 3 with one of the following diagnosis: advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who have failed ≥ 1 but &lt; 5 prior lines of chemotherapy; advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failing platinum based therapy; or hormone refractory (androgen independent) metastatic prostate cancer. Each eligible patient will be stratified according to his or her diagnosis (advanced or metastatic breast cancer, NSCLC, or HRPC). Patients will be randomly assigned with equal probability (1:1 ratio) or 75:75, with the arm designation and planned intervention as follows: Arm 1: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg) + placebo matching plinabulin Arm 2: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (RP3D) + placebo matching pegfilgrastim Data from all patients receiving the RP3D plinabulin dose in Phase 2 and Phase 3 will not be pooled for assessing the primary and secondary study endpoints, but analyzed separately.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. At least ≥ 18 years of age (male or female) at the time of signing the informed consent form. 2. ECOG performance status of 0 to 1. 3. Patients with: Phase 2 only: Advanced or metastatic NSCLC failing platinum based therapy Phase 3 only: Advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who have failed &lt;/= 1 but &lt; 5 prior lines of chemotherapy Advanced or metastatic NSCLC failing platinum based therapy Hormone refractory (androgen independent) metastatic prostate cancer (HRPC). 4. Pathology confirmation of cancer is required. 5. Patients with ≥ 1 of the following risk factors, at the initiation of docetaxel chemotherapy, that would require neutropenia prophylaxis per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (version 2, 2016) Myeloid Growth Factors (refer to Appendix C): Prior chemotherapy or radiation treatment Bone marrow involvement by tumor Surgery and/or open wounds within 4 weeks of first administration of study drug Age &gt; 65 years of age and receiving full chemotherapy dose intensity 6. Life expectancy of 3 months or more. 7. The following laboratory results provided by the central laboratory within 14 days prior to study drug administration: Hemoglobin &gt;/= 9 g/dL independent of transfusion or growth factor support Absolute neutrophil count &gt;/= 1.5 x 10**9/L independent of growth factor support Serum total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 times the upper limit normal (ULN), unless the patient has a diagnosis of Gilbert's disease in which case direct bilirubin &lt; t 1.5 times ULN of the direct bilirubin. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN (&lt;/= 1.5 x ULN if alkaline phosphatase is &gt; 2.5 x ULN) Serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN 8. Prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 1.5 × ULN, based on central laboratory results. 9. Female subjects of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test at screening. Females of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women without prior hysterectomy or who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months. However, women who have been amenorrhoeic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, or ovarian suppression. Women of childbearing potential (i.e., menstruating women) must have a negative urine pregnancy test (positive urine tests are to be confirmed by serum test) documented within the 24hour period prior to the first dose of study drug. Sexually active women of childbearing potential enrolled in the study must agree to use two forms of accepted methods of contraception during the course of the study and for 3 months after their last dose of study drug. Effective birth control includes (a) intrauterine device (IUD) plus one barrier method; (b) on stable doses of hormonal contraception for at least 3 months (e.g., oral, injectable, implant, transdermal) plus one barrier method; (c) 2 barrier methods. Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm); or (d) a vasectomized partner. For male patients who are sexually active and who are partners of premenopausal women: agreement to use two forms of contraception during the treatment period and for at least 3 months after the last dose of study drug. 1. History of myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or concomitant sickle cell disease. 2. Received chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. 3. Received prior docetaxel treatment, except if docetaxel received as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer &gt; 1 year before the first dose of study drug. 4. Received no prior chemotherapy or &gt;/= 5 lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic breast cancer (adjuvant chemotherapy will count as one line of chemotherapy, and any hormonal or biological, non conjugate therapy [e.g., trastuzumab] will not count as a line of therapy). 5. Current use of strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors, within 3 days of the first administration of study drug, and 7 days after treatment with taxanes OR requires use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (refer to Section 11.6.2) 6.

Prior radiation therapy within the 4 weeks before the first dose of study drug. 11. Prior use of pegfilgrastim or filgrastim within 4 weeks before the first dose of study drug. 12. Presence of any serious or uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to: uncontrolled diabetes, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled arterial thrombosis, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, or psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with study requirements, or any other conditions that would preclude the patient from study treatment as per the discretion of the Investigator. 13. Significant cardiovascular history: History of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease within 1 year before first study drug administration; Uncontrolled arrhythmia; History of congenital QT prolongation; Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings consistent with active ischemic heart disease; New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease; Uncontrolled hypertension: blood pressure consistently &gt;150 mm Hg systolic and &gt; 100 mm Hg diastolic in spite of antihypertensive medication. 14.
