	<brief_summary>This study is a Phase I, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of aging on safety, tolerability and PK of multiple oral doses of GLPG1205 in healthy male subjects. The study will comprise of 2 parts, a first part to investigate the effect of aging and a second part to investigate the effect of a loading dose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>This is a Study to Evaluate the Effect of Aging of Multiple Doses of GLPG1205 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Part 1, a total of 24 healthy male subjects matched for weight will be divided into 3 age groups: - Cohort A: 8 subjects aged 65 to 74 years, inclusive - Cohort B: 8 subjects aged ≥ 75 years (1:1 weight matched with subjects of Cohort A [±5 kg]) - Cohort C: 8 subjects aged between 18-50 years, inclusive (1:1 weight matched with subjects of Cohort A [±5 kg]) Each cohort will be randomized 3:1 to active (6 subjects) and placebo (2 subjects) treatment respectively. Weight matched subjects in Cohorts B and C will be assigned to active treatment and placebo accordingly. Cohorts A and C will be dosed with 50 mg q.d. GLPG1205 for 14 days. In the open-label Part 2, an additional cohort of 8 subjects aged 65-74 years (Cohort D) will be included to characterize the PK profile after a loading dose followed by multiple doses of GLPG1205 q.d. for 13 days. A 250 mg loading dose will be administered on Day 1 followed by 50 mg q.d. from Day 2 to Day 14.</detailed_description>
