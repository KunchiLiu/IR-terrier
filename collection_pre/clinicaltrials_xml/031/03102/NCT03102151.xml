	<brief_title>Reducing the Duration of Untreated Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study examines whether a community campaign can reduce over time the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) among persons with first episode psychosis (FEP). The DUP of mental health patients with FEP who sought services at a public outpatient or an inpatient facility was assessed for a 15 month period prior to the campaign launch. This serves as the baseline or historical control. The DUP will continue to be assessed for another 3 years. The hypothesis being tested is that there will be a significant decrease in DUP between baseline, one-year, two-year and three-year follow-ups. This study is being carried out with Latinos in Los Angeles County because as a group, particularly among Spanish-speaking immigrants, Latinos are at high risk for prolonged DUP.</detailed_description>
