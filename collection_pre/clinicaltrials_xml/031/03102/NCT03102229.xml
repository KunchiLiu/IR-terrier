	<brief_summary>This study will aim to demonstrate that implementation of a rapid, multidisciplinary supportive care program for patients receiving chemoradiotherapy who are deemed to be at high risk for hospitalization based on real-time pedometer data will reduce the rate of hospitalization during chemoradiotherapy or within four weeks of radiotherapy completion.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective - To demonstrate that implementation of a rapid, multidisciplinary supportive care program for patients receiving chemoradiotherapy who are deemed to be at high risk for hospitalization based on real-time pedometer data will reduce the rate of hospitalization during chemoradiotherapy or within four weeks of radiotherapy completion. Secondary Objectives - To demonstrate the feasibility of a program of rapid, multidisciplinary supportive care triggered by real-time pedometer data. - To characterize the interventions enacted by our multidisciplinary supportive care team. - To explore if interventions enacted by our multidisciplinary team for patients with low recent step counts lead to increased step counts in subsequent weeks compared to historical controls. - To collect biospecimens for future correlative studies examining associations between blood/urine biomarkers and patient activity levels.</detailed_description>
