	<detailed_description>The "Radner Reading Charts" have been developed on the basis of the concept of "sentence optotypes" for the standardized examination of reading acuity and reading speed. Print sizes are logarithmically scaled (LogRAD) to permit statistical analysis, and the results obtained can be compared to other logarithmically scaled vision systems (e.g., LogMAR). To guarantee accurate, reproducible and standardized measurements of reading acuity and reading speed at every viewing distance, "sentence optotypes" have been created to minimize the variations between the test items and to keep the geometric proportions as constant as possible at all distances. Through interdisciplinary cooperation, a series of test sentences were developed that are highly comparable in terms of the number of words (14 words), as well as the word length, number of syllables, position of words, lexical difficulty and syntactical complexity. The most similar sentences were statistically selected for the Radner Reading Charts.</detailed_description>
