	<brief_title>Evaluating the Infectivity, Safety, and Immunogenicity of a Single Dose of a Recombinant Live-Attenuated Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine (D46/NS2/N/ΔM2-2-HindIII) in RSV-Seronegative Infants 6 to 24 Months of Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower respiratory illness (LRI) in infants and children under 5 years of age worldwide. This study will evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a single dose of RSV D46/NS2/N/ΔM2-2-HindIII, a recombinant live-attenuated RSV vaccine, in RSV-seronegative infants and children 6 to 24 months of age. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the D46/NS2/N/ΔM2-2-HindIII vaccine or placebo at study entry (Day 0). Participants will be enrolled in the study between April 1 and October 14 (outside of RSV season) and will remain on study until they complete the post-RSV season visit between April 1 and April 30 in the calendar year following enrollment. Participants' total study duration will be between 6 and 13 months, depending on when they enroll in the study. Participants will attend several study visits throughout the study, which may include physical examinations, blood collection, and nasal washes. Participants' parents or guardians will be contacted by study staff at various times during the study to monitor participants' health.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Greater than or equal to 6 months (defined as greater than or equal to 180 days) of age at the time of screening and less than 25 months (defined as less than 750 days) of age at the time of enrollment The participant is in good health based on review of the medical record, history, and physical examination, without evidence of chronic disease. Parents/guardians are willing and able to provide written informed consent as described in the protocol. Seronegative for RSV antibody, defined as a serum RSVneutralizing antibody titer less than 1:40 at screening from a sample collected no more than 42 days prior to inoculation. Note: results from specimens collected during screening for any study of an RSV vaccine developed by the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases (LID) (NIAID, NIH) are acceptable as long as within the 42day window. Is growing at a normal velocity for age (as demonstrated on a standard growth chart) AND If less than 1 year of age: has a current height and weight above the 5th percentile If 1 year of age or older: has a current height and weight above the 3rd percentile for age. Participant has received routine immunizations appropriate for age (as per national Center for Disease Control Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]). Note: if rotavirus immunization was delayed, "catchup" rotavirus immunization is indicated only if the participant is ageeligible per ACIP. Participant is expected to be available for the duration of the study. If born to an HIVinfected woman, participant must not have been breastfed and must have documentation of 2 negative HIV nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) test results from samples collected on different dates with both collected when greater than or equal to 4 weeks of age and at least one collected when greater than or equal to 16 weeks of age, and no positive HIV nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) test; or 2 negative HIV antibody tests, both from samples collected at greater than or equal to 24 weeks of age. Known or suspected HIV infection or impairment of immunological functions. Receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, including any systemic, including either nasal or inhaled, corticosteroids within 28 days of enrollment. Note: Cutaneous (topical) steroid treatment is not an exclusion. Bone marrow/solid organ transplant recipient. Major congenital malformations (such as congenital cleft palate) or cytogenetic abnormalities. Previous receipt of a licensed or investigational RSV vaccine (or placebo in any IMPAACT RSV study) or previous receipt of or planned administration of any antiRSV product (such as ribavirin or RSV immunoglobulin [IG] or RSV monoclonal antibody [mAb]). Previous anaphylactic reaction. Previous vaccineassociated adverse reaction that was Grade 3 or above. Known hypersensitivity to any study product component. Heart disease. Note: Participants with cardiac abnormalities documented to be clinically insignificant and requiring no treatment may be enrolled. Lung disease, including any history of reactive airway disease or medically diagnosed wheezing. Member of a household that contains, or will contain, an infant who is less than 6 months of age at the enrollment date through Day 28. Member of a household that contains another child who is, or is scheduled to be, enrolled in IMPAACT 2011, 2012 or 2013 or another study evaluating an intranasal liveattenuated RSV vaccine, AND there has been or will be an overlap in residency during that other child's participation in the study's Acute Phase (Days 0 to 28). Member of a household that contains an immunocompromised individual, including, but not limited to: a person who is greater than or equal to 6 years of age with HIVrelated immunodeficiency, defined as having a most recent CD4 T lymphocyte cell count less than 300 cells/mm^3. CD4 T lymphocyte count must have been measured within 6 months prior to enrollment, or a person age 1 year up to less than 6 years with HIVrelated immunodeficiency, defined as having a most recent CD4 T lymphocyte cell percentage less than 25 or CD4 T lymphocyte count less than 750 cells/mm^3 (if both values are available, use the lower of the two). CD4 T lymphocyte parameter must have been measured within the 6 months prior to enrollment; or a person age less than 1 year with HIVrelated immunodeficiency, defined as having a most recent CD4 T lymphocyte cell percentage less than 30 or CD4 T lymphocyte count less than 1000 cells/mm^3 (if both values are available, use the lower of the two). CD4 T lymphocyte parameter must have been measured within the 6 months prior to enrollment; or a person who has received chemotherapy within the 12 months prior to enrollment; or a person receiving immunosuppressant agents; or a person living with a solid organ or bone marrow transplant. Verbal report of CD4 T cell lymphocyte is sufficient documentation if the parent/guardian is confident of history. Attends a daycare facility and shares a room with infants less than 6 months of age, and parent/guardian is unable or unwilling to suspend daycare for 28 days following inoculation. Any of the following events at the time of enrollment: fever (rectal temperature of greater than or equal to 100.4°F (38°C)), or upper respiratory signs or symptoms (rhinorrhea, cough, or pharyngitis) or nasal congestion significant enough to interfere with successful inoculation, or otitis media.
