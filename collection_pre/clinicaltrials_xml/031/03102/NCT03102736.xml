	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effects of the medication ketamine and the medication called nitroprusside in patients with major depression. Ketamine has both good and bad effects. Some studies have shown that ketamine improves depression. However, studies have also shown that it causes strange and sometimes unpleasant sensations referred to "psychotic" or "dissociative" symptoms. An example of a psychotic symptom would be hearing or seeing something that in reality is not there. The study team would like to see if nitroprusside can prevent the reported bad effects of ketamine without blocking the reported good effects. This might make ketamine a better treatment for depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ketamine and Nitroprusside for Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ketamine is an effective fast-acting therapeutic intervention for patients with treatment refractory depression that is known to have the unwanted effect of inducing temporary psychotomimetic symptoms (i.e., delusions, hallucinations and thought disorganization) in some patients. The precise mechanisms of these psychotropic effects remain to be elucidated, but for several decades the NMDA-type glutamate receptor has been hypothesized to be of central importance. In this vain, recent studies of the antihypertensive agent nitroprusside - which increases the availability of the molecular nitric oxide, a known by-product of NMDA activity - have found evidence for antipsychotic properties both in humans with psychotic illness and healthy subjects given ketamine. Here, the clinical team proposes a study that will build on this work by evaluate the effects of nitroprusside on both the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of ketamine given to patients to treat refractory depression. In addition, as an exploratory aim, by collecting serial blood samples from the subjects, as the subjects are administered ketamine and nitroprusside, the clinical team will seek to determine functional markers of therapeutic effect and the mechanisms by which ketamine modulates both mood and psychotic states Research Question: The clinical team will test whether the effects of ketamine (KET) on mood and psychotic states is modified by co-administration with sodium nitroprusside (NP) in patients with depression. Furthermore, the clinical team will evaluate the extent to which the underlying biology of disease states and drug mechanisms can be inferred through analysis of brain-derived molecular material isolated from the peripheral circulation. Specific Aims: Aim I. To test whether co-administration with NP has any impact on the efficacy of KET as an antidepressant. Aim II: To test the ability of NP to prevent the psychotomimetic effects of KET in patients with depression. Research Hypotheses: Research Hypothesis I. Patients pre-treated with NP will experience attenuated antidepressant effects (measured by MADRS score) following KET compared to pre-treatment with placebo. Research Hypothesis II: Patients pre-treated with NP will experience attenuated psychotomimetic effects (e.g., CADSS score) immediately following KET compared to pre-treatment with placebo.</detailed_description>
