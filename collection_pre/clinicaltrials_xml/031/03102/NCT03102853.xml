	<brief_summary>This project will examine whether long-term consumption of healthy Nordic foods can maintain a healthy weight also after weight loss, and decrease abdominal fat accumulation and cardiometabolic risk. The study will be performed with the aim to achieve a substantial body weight loss in the first phase by prescribing a standardized low caloric dietary formula. The follow-up phase will be a body weight-maintenance period and the subjects will be randomised to a healthy Nordic diet group and a control diet group. During the study body weight will be monitored and other measurements will include insulin sensitivity, blood lipids and inflammation markers.</brief_summary>
