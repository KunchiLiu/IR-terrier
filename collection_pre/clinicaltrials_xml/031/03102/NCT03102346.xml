	<brief_summary>Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after revascularization results in better clinical outcomes，and have been strongly recommended for patients with coronary artery disease. In China, as compared to the exponential increase of PCI volume, only a very small amount of hospitals are able to develop CR programs. There is no large-scale study to explore the feasible CR pattern either. Home-based CR might be more favorable and practical for so many Chinese revasularized CHD patients due to its feasibility and flexibility as well as low medical cost. This trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of CR program at home for Chinese patients who underwent PCI procedure. This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled and observational study. The efficacy and safety of HBCR in revascularized patients will be evaluated through observation of its clinical characteristics and safety indicators. The study will involve 14 sites nationwide, with an expected sample size of 2,000 followed up for 12 months. The primary endpoints is the incidence of composite major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, stroke).Secondary endpoints are defined as decrease of hospitalization due to refractory angina pectoris，the improvements of cardiorespiratory fitness,life quality,as well as angina pectoris. The subjects will be randomized into 2 different groups, HBCR group and control group. After comprehensive evaluation, the orders from CR staff will be given. Besides the routine health education in both groups, the subjects in HBCR group will be further introduced the instructions of exercise training. CR management software system integrating internet and mobile telecommunication techniques, and heart rate monitors will also be used for the interaction between medical staff and patients. The effect of HBCR on cardiorespiratory fitness, improvement of angina, cardiac function, quality of life, levels of anxiety and depression, as well as risk factor profile will also be evaluated. The investigators also aim to explore the factors which influence the adherence of subjects to our HBCR program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>efficAcy and Safety of Home-baSed Cardiac rehabIlitation in ChineSe Revascularized patienTs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous studies have revealed that cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after myocardial infarction and/or myocardial revascularization results in better clinical outcomes, including a 20% to 56% decrease in all-cause mortality, lower cardiac-specific mortality, re-hospitalization, revascularization, and better quality of life. International guidelines have been endorsed which strongly recommend CR, especially exercise training (ET) for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Unfortunately, even with this strong evidence, rates of participation in cardiac rehabilitation after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are historically low in the worldwide. A variety of factors including lackness of centre-based supervised programs, low referral rate and poor compliance of patients turned to be the main impediments. In China, the morbidity and mortality of CAD is increasing, accompanied by a rapid increase in PCI volume, and medical cost. By 2015, totally 567,583 PCI procedures are performed, which was estimated to exceed 1,100,000 by 2020. As compared to the exponential increase of PCI volume, only a few hospitals have been able to develop CR programs, suggesting a severe mismatch between the need for and supply of CR programs. It has been estimated that the participation rate in CR programs in China is less than 1%. Therefore, it is important to explore and understand the patterns for use of CR associated with the large population of CAD patients and limited medical resources in China. Owing to the above consideration, home-based ET might be more favorable and practical for the large population of Chinese patients undergoing PCI compared with hospital-based ET due to its feasibility and flexibility as well as low medical cost. Because home-based CR programs could offer an important opportunity to widen patient access and improve their adherence, they have been introduced to patients with myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure or who had undergone revascularization and shown to be effective in improving their clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes. However, doubt about the safety and efficiency of home-based CR programs by cardiologists and patients has restricted their application in China. Further, there are no data published investigating whether home-based CR programs are as effective to improve the prognosis of Chinese CAD patients as western countries. Therefore, this trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of CR program at home for Chinese patients who underwent PCI procedure. This is a randomized, multicenter, controlled, prospective and observational study. The efficacy and safety of HBCR in revascularized patients will be evaluated through observation of its clinical characteristics and safety indicators. The study is expected to involve 14 sites nationwide, and will last for about 21 months from initiation in April 2017 to completion in December 2018, including 9 months of recruitment period, and 12 months of follow-up visits, with an expected sample size of 2,000.The primary endpoints is the incidence of composite major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE,death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, stroke).Secondary endpoints are defined as decrease of hospitalization due to refractory angina pectoris，the improvements of cardiorespiratory fitness,life quality,as well as angina pectoris. The CAD patients who had undergone PCI will be enrolled into the trial and be randomized into 2 different groups, HBCR group and control group. To identify the risk factors of CAD, all the subjects will supply their demographic information and medical histories (cardiovascular history,comorbidity,etc). Afterwards, they will receive physical examination and evaluation of psychological state, nutritional state, exercise habit, as well as smoking state. Cardiopulmonary exercise test as well as 6 minutes walking test will also be performed to evaluate their cardiorespiratory fitness. Then they will receive the optimal drug therapy and the routine health education to tell them how to change their lifestyle. Besides these interventions, the subjects in HBCR group will be further introduced the instructions of exercise training at home. Seven visits are planned for this study, respectively at month 0, month 1,month 2,month 3,month 6,month 9, as well as month 12. An exercise regimen will be decided according to the 9th edition of ACSM's guidelines for exercise testing and prescription following the target HR/HRAT principle. The target heart rate is determined mainly by reserve heart rate, sometimes combined with heart rate at AT. Reserve heart rate equals resting heart rate plus 60-80 percent of the difference between maximal heart rate and resting heart rate. If the reserve heart rate is higher than heart rate at AT, HRAT is taken as the final target in the exercise training. The exercise training starts with a warm up for 10 minutes, and followed by 30-40 minutes of aerobatic exercise (fast walking or cycling) to meet the target heart rate according to the exercise regimen, and ends by a cool down for 10 minutes. Besides the aerobatic exercise, resistance, stretching and balance training were also recommended. The aerobatic exercise and stretching exercise was planned for 5-6 times per week, while resistance and balance training twice to thrice a week. All kind of exercise should maintain the intensity that was between "relatively easy and slightly tiring" measured at the Borg Index 11 to 13. The investigators will employ a set of CR management system based on the internet and mobile telecommunication techniques to interact between medical staff and patients. All the information will be recorded also in the system and open to both CR staffs and patients. The orders about the medication, nutritional guide, smoke cessation advice, anti-anxiety or anti-depression advice as well exercise training plan will be sent by mobile phone to the patients periodically to remind the subjects to implement the orders. After the orders were implemented, the subjects are needed to confirm via mobile phone. Some health educational materials will also be sent to the subjects by message and wechat app. The investigators will also equip the subjects with the heart rate bands connected with the CR management system. The heart rate data will transmit to the CR data center which will reflect partially subjectively whether the orders from CR staff were implemented or not. The effect of HBCR on cardiorespiratory fitness, improvement of angina, cardiac function, qualityof life, levels of anxiety and depression, as well as risk factor profile will also be evaluated. The safety and tolerability of HBCR will also be asscessed. The investigators also try to investigate the impact of cardiorespirotary fitness on patient's clinical symptoms, cardiac function, quality of life, total mortality, cardiovascular death and re-hospitalization due to angina exacerbation in patients who were revascularized. The investigators also aim to explore the factors which influence the adherence of subjects within the HBCR program. Safety assessment includes all the adverse events(AE), monitoring and records (via subject follow-up, patient's diary card and telephone follow-up) of suspected adverse reactions, laboratory test results, vital signs, physical examinations and 12-lead ECG etc.The subjects will provide AE-related information to the investigator during follow-up visits. All AEs will be encoded with the latest version of MedDRA. This study will be conducted in accordance with the principles advocated by the 18th WMA General Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and all the subsequent amendments, and approved by the ethics committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital.</detailed_description>
