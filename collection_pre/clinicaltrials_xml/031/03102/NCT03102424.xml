	<brief_summary>The primary study objective is to demonstrate the use of "Dragon Waves Resonant Home Care" Electronic Nerve Stimulator (DW1330) is associated with improvement of blood glucose control, as measured by change of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The second study objectives are to demonstrate that DW1330 is associated with the mechanism of glycemic control and inflammation pathways. The study is also aimed to investigate the safety of DW1330.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator to Improve Blood Glucose Control in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, prospective, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator (DW1330) to improve blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Subjects with type 2 diabetes who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to either of the 2 groups below: 1. DW1330 2. Placebo (sham TENS delivering ineffective pulse wave) After enrollment, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of the study treatments in a double-blind fashion. All patients enrolled should perform 1 treatment within 1 hour after dinner 5 days a week. The end of a 20 week treatment period, subjects will be followed for an additional 2 weeks for safety follow-up. The time frame includes 2 weeks of screening, 20 weeks of treatment, and 2 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. Study visits will occur every 2 or 4 weeks depending on the study phase. At randomization visit study device will be dispensed at the site, during the treatment period visits, all Adverse Events (AEs) as well as follow-up for all AEs that have not been resolved will be recorded, changes to concomitant medications will be noted, vital signs will be taken, and efficacy evaluations will be performed as well. Investigators, site staff, subjects, and the study team will be blinded to the device assigned. The study includes collection of blood and urine samples. The end-of-treatment visit and the last estimation of glycemic control will occur at week 20 (visit 8) for all subjects. In addition, 2-week follow up will occur in order to collect safety data after the device is returned. The final visit will be at week 22 (visit 9). Subjects will be encouraged to complete all planned visits regardless of their adherence to study device administration.</detailed_description>
