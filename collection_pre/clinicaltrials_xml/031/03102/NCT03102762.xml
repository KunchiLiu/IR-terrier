The participants will be subjected for full history taking, general and genital examination. Penile duplex will be performed to assess a vascular etiology before the treatment and 2 weeks later. The patients will be randomized into a treatment group (12 patients) and a control group (12 patients). All patients will sign an informed consent. The treatment group will be injected IC with a trimix solution (20 ug alprostadil + 1 mg phentolamine + 30 mg papaverine) for color Doppler assessment, followed, next day by 50 units of BTX-A. The control group, 12 patients, will be injected with the trimix solution during penile color Doppler assessment followed next day with a normal saline injection. The erection hardness score (EHS) will be assessed during the Doppler exam. Procedure: At least 1 day after the penile color Doppler test, the patient is placed in the supine position flaccid and stretched penile length and girth would be measured from tip of the penis to the pubic bone will be done. A rubber band will be applied to the base of the penis. The skin will be prepped with alcohol swabs followed by the IC injection of 100 units of BTX-A. Direct pressure will be applied for 2 minutes. The rubber band will be removed after 15 minutes.
