	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training in Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>32 patients with CTEPH (confirmed by right cardiac catheterization and imaging) will perform: 1) pulmonary function tests; 2) measurement of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and endurance; 3) evaluation of peripheral muscle strength by isokinetic dynamometry; 4) six-minute walk test and 5) incremental and constant load cardiopulmonary exercise test (~ 75% of maximal work-rate) with non-invasive evaluation of central hemodynamics and peripheral muscle oxygenation. Inspiratory muscle training will consist of twice daily sessions of 30 breaths (~ 50% PiMAX, 4-5 minutes per session) for 8 weeks. The SHAM group will perform sessions of 30 breaths with no inspiratory load.</detailed_description>
