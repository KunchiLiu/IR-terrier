	<brief_summary>Patients affected by Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) need a safe and effective long-term treatment regimen. Unfortunately, there are still no disease-specific treatment for ADPKD approved in the US. A rational step towards identifying such agents is to test therapies that have a proven safety profile with mechanisms of action that can counter the disease progression. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether drinking increased amounts of water (water loading) might slow down polycystic kidney growth or kidney function decline. Water loading can cause the suppression of a pathway that causes fluid buildup and cyst growth. High water intake has been safely used in the clinical setting, such as in the case of kidney stone therapy. New York State tap water is widely available and safe, making it highly cost-effective as well.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial of Water Therapy for Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will involve 11 visits to the study site over 19 months. Participants will need to follow specific dietary and fluid recommendations. There will be physical examinations and medical history assessments at each visit. Testing will include undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), blood and urine tests. Study participants will be compensated for their time. Detailed study procedures will be reviewed upon contact with the study team.</detailed_description>
