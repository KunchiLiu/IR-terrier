	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in approximately one-third of patients undergoing cardiac surgery (CS), and represents one of the most significant negative predictors of patient outcome in this population. In the healthy adult, a high protein meal is known to enhance glomerular filtration rate and is mediated by an increase in renal blood flow. The investigators hypothesized that preoperative oral protein load may precondition the kidneys for upcoming insults.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in approximately one-third of patients undergoing cardiac surgery (CS), and represents one of the most significant negative predictors of patient outcome in this population. To date, there is no therapy to prevent AKI. In the healthy adult, a high protein meal is known to enhance glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and is mediated by an increase in renal blood flow. The investigators hypothesized that preoperative oral protein load may induce an adaptive response of the kidneys, and precondition the kidneys for upcoming insults. In the present study, the investigators aimed to compare the prevalence and severity of AKI in patients undergoing oral high protein load to age- and gender-matched "controls" who did not receive protein load before cardiac surgery within the same period (October 2014-November 2015) at San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.</detailed_description>
