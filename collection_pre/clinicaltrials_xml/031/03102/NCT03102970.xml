	<brief_summary>The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is between 8 and 12% of the adult population. This prevalence is expected to increase over the coming decades due to the aging of the population and the continued exposure to risk factors for the disease. The evolution of COPD is marked by the occurrence of exacerbations of varying severity and patients are frequently admitted to the emergency department for evaluation, treatment and / or hospitalization. Admission in emergency department for COPD exacerbation represents approximately 1% of emergency admission. Chronic pain is common in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The pain intensity may increase during acute episodes of exacerbations. This study is aimed to compare pain intensity during exacerbation and stable phase of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic pain is common in patients with Chronic Obstructive pulmonary Disease (COPD). The pain intensity may increase during acute episodes of exacerbation. Fifty (50) patients in acute exacerbation of COPD will be included in the emergency department of CHU Grenoble Alpes and Hôpital du Sacré Coeur de Montréal. The intensity and characteristics of pain will be evaluated from the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Assessment of respiratory status, anxiety and depression, and clinical and biological data, defining the severity of exacerbation, will also be collected. A 30-day follow-up visit, after a return to the stable state of COPD, allowed the realization of Respiratory Functional Exploration and the same questionnaires.</detailed_description>
