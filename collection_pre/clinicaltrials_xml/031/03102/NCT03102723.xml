	<brief_summary>There remains a clinical need to improve health outcomes in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) the leading cause of death and disability in Singapore and worldwide. One neglected therapeutic target is 'myocardial reperfusion injury' in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). This results in microvascular obstruction (MVO) and cardiomyocyte death and contributes upto 50% of the final myocardial infarct (MI) size. Cangrelor, a potent intravenous platelet P2Y12 inhibitor with rapid onset and offset of action, has been demonstrated in experimental animal studies to reduce MI size when administered prior to reperfusion. Whether Cangrelor given together with Ticagrelor would be more effective at reducing MI size in STEMI patients treated by PPCI is not known and is investigated in the Platelet Inhibition to Target Reperfusion Injury (PITRI) trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet Inhibition to Target Reperfusion Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PITRI proof-of-concept clinical trial will randomise 210 STEMI patients to receive either Cangrelor (single intravenous bolus followed by a 120-minute infusion) or matching normal/saline placebo, initiated prior to PPCI on top of conventional oral dual antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin + Ticagrelor). The primary endpoint will be acute MI size by cardiac MRI at day 3. Secondary endpoints will include incidence and extent of MVO by cardiac MRI; and chronic MI size, left ventricular size and ejection fraction by cardiac MRI at 6 months.</detailed_description>
