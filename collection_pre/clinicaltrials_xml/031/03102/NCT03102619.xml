	<brief_summary>Postoperative observation of patients is based on the Early Warning Score (EWS). By using continuous wireless monitoring of vital parameters it may be possible to predict the risk of complications after abdominal cancer surgery. The object of this pilot study is to test the equipment and methods for the next phases. Patients will be monitored for 4 days postoperatively and data is analyzed retrospectively. Vital parameters are monitored with ECG, blood pressure monitor and pulseoximetry. In the analysis the investigators will compare the results from the continuous monitoring to the measurements made by the nurses and registered in the EWS. The primary outcomes for the pilot study are the frequency of measurements resulting in a single parameter score of 3 according to the EWS algorithm.</brief_summary>
