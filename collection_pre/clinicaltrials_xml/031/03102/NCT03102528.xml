	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in approximately one-third of patients undergoing cardiac surgery (CS), and represents one of the most significant negative predictors of patient outcome in this population. The investigators sought to examine the prevalence of AKI, renal recovery and development of de-novo chronic kidney disease in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery at San Bortolo Hospital, Italy 2014-2015.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in approximately one-third of patients undergoing cardiac surgery (CS), and represents one of the most significant negative predictors of patient outcome in this population. The investigators sought to examine the prevalence of AKI, renal recovery and development of de-novo chronic kidney disease in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery (elective/emergent) at San Bortolo Hospital, Italy during November 2014 - October 2015.</detailed_description>
