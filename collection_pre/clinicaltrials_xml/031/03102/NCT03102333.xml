	<brief_title>Comparison: Constant-rate Infusion Plus Demanding Dosing VS Variable-rate Feedback Infusion Plus Demanding Dosing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the case of the existing iv-pca, the analgesic drug was injected into the patient at a constant rate (ex. 1 ml / hr) and additional pain was controlled through the bolus dose (1 ml). As a result, the analgesic effect was insufficient, or the effect was excessive, causing side effects (nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness). Especially In spinal surgery, the degree of pain sharply decreases from day 1 to day 2. Classic iv-pca with constant infusion rate can not reflect this result. But in the case of the newlys developed PCA, the infusion rate is increased according to the patient's need for bolus button, so that the pain can be controlled more efficiently. If the bolus button is not pressed for a certain period of time, it is expected that the injection rate will be reduced and the side effect caused by the analgesic agent will be decreased.</detailed_description>
