	<brief_summary>The key purpose of the main part of the study is to assess efficacy and safety of anetumab ravtansine as monotherapy or combination therapy for mesothelin expressing advanced solid tumors. The main purpose of the safety lead-in (dose-finding) part of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of anetumab ravtansine in combination with cisplatin and in combination with gemcitabine, and to determine the MTD of anetumab ravtansine in combination with cisplatin for mesothelin expressing advanced cholangiocarcinoma and in combination with gemcitabine for mesothelin expressing advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Patients will receive anetumab ravtansine every three weeks in monotherapy for most indications. In cholangiocarcinoma and adenocarinoma of the pancreas, 3-weekly anetumab ravtansine is administered in combination with cisplatin or gemcitabine respectively (both administered in a 2 week on / 1 week off schedule). Treatment will continue until disease progression or until another criterion for withdrawal is met. .Efficacy will be measured by evaluating the tumor's objective response rate. Radiological tumor assessments will be performed at defined time points until the patient's disease progresses. Blood samples will be collected for safety, pharmacokinetic and biomarker analysis. Archival or fresh biopsy tissue may also be collected for review and biomarkers.</brief_summary>
