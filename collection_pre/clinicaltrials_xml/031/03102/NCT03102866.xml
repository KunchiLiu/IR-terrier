	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot phase I/II trial studies how well aerobic and strength training exercise works in improving fitness and arm health during and after radiation therapy in patients with stage II-III breast cancer. Aerobic and strength training exercise training during and after radiation therapy may reduce treatment related toxicities and improve adherence to exercise long term in patients with breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aerobic and Strength Training Exercise in Improving Fitness and Arm Health During and After Radiation Therapy in Patients With Stage II-III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of conducting an exercise program during and after radiation therapy and to determine what percent of patients will complete the exercise program. (Pilot) II. To determine the percent increase in fitness as measured by the 6 minute walk test in women receiving radiation therapy for breast cancer randomized to an exercise program at 1 year. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Percent adherence to exercise at 1 year as measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and exercise logs. II. Subjective arm health at 1 year as measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Questionnaire for Breast Cancer version 4 (FACT-B+4). III. Arm lymphedema at 1 year as measured by arm circumference. IV. Arm range of motion at 1 year as measured by goniometry. V. Quality of life at 1 year as measured by FACT-B+4. VI. Percent increase in arm strength as measured by one repetition maximum at 1 year. VII. Change in weight and body mass index (BMI) 1 year after completion of radiation. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive usual care for 6 weeks during radiation therapy and for 12 weeks after completion of radiation therapy. ARM II: Patients undergo a supervised aerobic and strength training exercise session over 40-60 minutes 3 times weekly for 6 weeks during radiation therapy and for 12 weeks after completion of radiation therapy. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 and 6 months, and 1 year.</detailed_description>
