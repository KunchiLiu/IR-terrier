	<brief_summary>We aim to determine Epidiolex's promise as a pharmacotherapy for cannabis use disorder. We hypothesize that Epidiolex, when added to medical management, will result in greater reductions in marijuana use compared to placebo as measured by our 2 primary outcome measures: 1) quantitative THC levels and 2) self-report by Timeline Follow Back. Secondary outcome measures will include treatment retention, patient satisfaction, cannabis withdrawal, cannabis craving, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, , compliance, and cigarette use.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will conduct a Stage 1 pilot feasibility study at McLean Hospital to begin to evaluate Epidiolex as a pharmacotherapy for adults with cannabis use disorder. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, cannabis-dependent subjects ages 18-65 will receive medical management over a 6-week period, with half receiving Epidiolex treatment and half receiving placebo. Participants will receive either up to 800 mg Epidiolex or placebo over a 6-week treatment period. Following treatment completion, participants will have a follow-up visits at 10 and 14 weeks. Primary outcomes will include self-report of cannabis smoking and results of quantitative urine drug screens for cannabis. Secondary outcome measures will include treatment retention, patient satisfaction, cannabis withdrawal, cannabis craving, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, compliance, and cigarette use.</detailed_description>
