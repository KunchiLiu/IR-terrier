	<brief_title>Switching to Low Oxidant Content Cigarettes in Adult Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers at Penn State Hershey are seeking healthy adult cigarette smokers between the ages of 21-65 who smoke at least 10 cigarettes a day for at least one year. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of reduced oxidative/ nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) cigarettes compared to high ROS/RNS cigarettes. Study participation lasts 14 weeks, with 8 study visits at the Medical Center. All eligible participants will be given Spectrum research cigarettes, provided free of charge, and will be asked to only smoke those cigarettes for the first four weeks of the study. Following that four-week period of time they will be randomly assigned to two different groups: Group 1 low ROS content cigarette (American Spirit or Pall Mall Red); Group 2 high ROS content cigarette (Spectrum Research Cigarette). Whichever group you are randomly assigned to you will be asked to smoke only these cigarettes for the next seven weeks of the study, these cigarettes will also be provided to you free of charge. You will then be asked to smoke your usual brand of cigarettes for the last three weeks of the study.</detailed_description>
