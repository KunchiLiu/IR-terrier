	<brief_title>Encapsulated Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Dental Pulp Regeneration.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the survival of mature permanent teeth with apical lesion treated with regenerative endodontic procedure (REP) based on encapsulated Mesenchymal Stem Cells in a biological scaffold. The REP will be compared to the conventional endodontic therapy. The REP is based on the use of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells encapsulated in a plasma-derived biomaterial . The study group will use the disinfection protocol, indicated in the clinical considerations for regenerative procedures as recommended by the American Association of Endodontics, using a paste of calcium hydroxide prepared with double-distilled water as intracanal medication, and will be operated with REP using allogeneic stem cells in a scaffold, while the control group will be operated with conventional endodontic therapy alone. This clinical trial pretends to determine the dental survival of the tooth with mature apex and apical lesion, over a period of 2 years.</detailed_description>
