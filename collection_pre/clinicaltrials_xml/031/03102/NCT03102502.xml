	<brief_summary>The present study aimed to investigated the effect of Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP) on vascular hemodynamics and atherosclerosis, and the underlying shear stress related mechanisms</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Enhanced External Counterpulsation on Vascular Hemodynamics and Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with coronary heart disease will be randomized into two groups: standard medical treatment and standard medical treatment plus EECP intervention. Hymodynamic parameters, vascular status and function will be measured.</detailed_description>
