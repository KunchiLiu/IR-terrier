	<brief_summary>Exosomes are part of extracellular vesicles(EVs), and can be secreted into the environment by many types of cells. It has been demonstrated that the content and function of exosomes depends on the originating cell and the conditions under which they are produced.Exosomes contain proteins,RNAs and lipid,which may transfer biological information and activities from donor cells to receptor cells. Non-coding RNAs are involved in many biological activities including tumor growth and metastasis. In this prospective translational study, preclinical and clinical phases have been designed. On the first step, the main goal is to characterize the ncRNAs of cholangiocarcinoma derived exosomes. This exosome biomarker may provide a useful diagnostic tool. As a second step, the study will evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of cholangiocarcinoma exosomes levels in plasma in a prospectively recruited cohort of cholangiocarcinoma patients before and after surgical resection.</brief_summary>
