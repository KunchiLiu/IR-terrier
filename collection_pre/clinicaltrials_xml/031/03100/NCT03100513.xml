	<brief_summary>The current standard of care for patients with HE includes non-absorbable disaccharides(lactulose);The chemical name for lactulose is 4-O-Î²-D-galactopyranosyl-D-fructofuranose.The exact mode of action by lactulose is thought to be the conversion to lactic acid and acetic acid by colonic bacteria resulting in acidification of the gut lumen. This favors conversion of ammonia (NH3) to ammonium (NH4+), which is relatively membrane impermeable; therefore, less ammonia is absorbed by the colon. Gut acidification inhibits ammoniagenic coliform bacteria, leading to increased levels of nonammoniagenic lactobacilli. Nonabsorbable disaccharides also work as a cathartic, clearing the gut of ammonia before it can be absorbed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution (PEG) is a laxative solution that increases the amount of water in the intestinal tract to stimulate bowel movements. It is used safely to clean the bowel before colonoscopy.</detailed_description>
