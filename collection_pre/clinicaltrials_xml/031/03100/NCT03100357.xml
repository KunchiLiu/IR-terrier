	<brief_summary>The pronounced effect of goiter on the esophagus needs further exploration, as the mechanisms by which goiter leads to swallowing difficulties are unknown. By investigating esophageal motility using high resolution esophageal manometry before and after thyroidectomy we seek to examine the impact of the goiter mass on the esophagus and swallowing with six months follow-up.</brief_summary>
