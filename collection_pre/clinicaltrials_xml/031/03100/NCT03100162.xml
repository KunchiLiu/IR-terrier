	<brief_summary>Effect of oral supplementation with probiotics on cardiometabolic risk factors, microflora and intestinal epithelial permeability, mineral content and lifestyle in obese women with postmenopausal metabolic syndrome: double-blind, randomized clinical trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Oral Supplementation With Probiotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to determine whether oral probiotic supplementation affects cardiometabolic risk, intestinal epithelial permeability, metabolic activity and intestinal flora composition, mineral content, and lifestyle in obese women with metabolic syndrome. Probiotics are a group of non-pathogenic microbes that bring health benefits to the host. Their use enables the variety and proper functioning of intestinal microflora. The use of probiotics increases the amount of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, what directly affects the reduction of endotoxemia by sealing the intestinal wall, as well as the improvement of fat, carbohydrate and insulin metabolism. The project is due to evaluate the effect of supplementation with selected probiotics in patients with metabolic syndrome on: - lipid metabolism- total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, - blood glucose concentration, - blood pressure values, - anthropometric parameters, - quality of life, - the contentl of minerals,</detailed_description>
