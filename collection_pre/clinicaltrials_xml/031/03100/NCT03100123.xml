	<brief_summary>The APPLE pilot trial is a feasibility study that is a multicentre, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Pregnant women with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and a history of late (â‰¥10 weeks gestation) or recurrent early (2 &lt;10 weeks) pregnancy loss will be recruited. Eligible and consenting subjects will be assigned to one of two study arms: open-label low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis until 37 weeks gestation AND low-dose aspirin (ASA) daily until delivery, or open-label low-dose aspirin daily from randomization until delivery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AntiPhospholipid Syndrome Low-molecular-weight Heparin Pregnancy Loss Evaluation: The Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this pilot trial is to determine the feasibility of conducting a multicenter randomized full trial evaluating antepartum prophylaxis with ASA versus LMWH/ASA in women with confirmed APS and a history of late or recurrent early pregnancy loss. Given the large sample size needed to adequately power a large multicenter trial that assesses the efficacy of ASA alone versus LMWH/ASA, the investigators first need to determine if it is possible to meet minimum recruitment rates needed for a full multicenter trial. If the pilot feasibility trial is successful, then the secondary outcomes collected will be used in the analysis of the full multicenter trial.</detailed_description>
