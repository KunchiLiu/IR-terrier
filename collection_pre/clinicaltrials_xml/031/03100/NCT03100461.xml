	<brief_title>Adaptive Intervention to Maximize Colorectal Screening in Safety Net Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal Cancer is preventable and curable but is still the second most common cause of cancer death in the U.S. Minorities and those with low income have more CRC than middle and high income Whites.. They also get fewer CRC screening tests. Low knowledge of CRC screening may, in part, drive this lower test use. We need new ways to improve CRC screening in primary care clinics where many minority and uninsured patients receive health care.</detailed_description>
