	<brief_summary>Constipation of different etiology might respond differently to probiotic intervention. Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) is a well-studied probiotic which effectively alleviate constipation. Constipation subjects were recruited according to ROME Ⅲ criteria. According to Bristol Stool Form Scale (BS), subjects were divided into 3 groups: hard stool (HS, BS&lt;3), normal stool (NS, 3≤BS≤4) and soft stool (SS, 4&lt;BS&lt;5). Subjects consumed 100mL per day of a probiotic beverage containing 1.0 × 108 CFU/mL of LcS for 28 days. The change in stool consistency was measured as primary outcome. The stool short chain fatty acid and gut microbiota were also assessed.</brief_summary>
