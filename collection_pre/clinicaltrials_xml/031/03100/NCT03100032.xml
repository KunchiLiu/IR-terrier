	<brief_title>Safety and Preliminary Effectiveness of NVD-001 for the Treatment of Low Grade Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective multi-centre, randomised, controlled study to evaluate the safety and preliminary effectiveness of NVD-001 for the treatment of low grade degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis by interbody fusion of one vertebral segment (L1-S1). The study consists of a 12-month active follow-up period post-surgery and a subsequent 12-month passive long term follow-up. NVD-001 is an autologous cellular medicinal product obtained by culture of adipose tissue (liposuction) leading to osteogenic cells after ex vivo isolation, expansion and differentiation of pluripotent adipose-tissue stem cells (ASC), and combination with an allogeneic fully demineralised bone matrix into a 3D bone implant. Patients diagnosed with symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis grade I or II with an indication for spinal fusion of one vertebral segment (L1-S1) who sign informed consent and are eligible will be randomised either to the experimental group (surgical intervention for spinal lumbar interbody fusion with NVD-001) or to the control group (commonly used surgical intervention for spinal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF, PLIF, minimally invasive or open approach) with one or two PEEK cage(s) filled and surrounded by locally harvested autologous cancellous bone (laminectomy).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Any subject meeting all of the following inclusion criteria and verified by the Investigator during the screening period: Subject has understood and accepted to participate in the study according to all study procedures by signing the approved informed consent. Male or female subjects aged &gt;18 and is skeletally mature (epiphyses closed). Subject has clinically important pain or neurological symptoms with or without claudication due to symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis grade I or II (Meyerding Classification). Conservative treatment of disease has failed for at least 3 months since diagnosis. (ISASS 2011) Subject has a preoperative ODI score &gt;30. Subject has an indication for spinal fusion of one vertebral segment (L1S1) due to symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis grade I or II diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or dynamic radiography. Subject is suitable for surgical operation and incorporation of the PEEK cage(s) by transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) or posterior lumbar intervertebral fusion (PLIF) by minimally invasive or open approach in one mobile segment (L1 S1) with bilateral rigid fixation. No posterolateral lumbar fusion (PLF) technique is allowed. Subject is, in the Investigator's opinion, psychosocially, mentally and physically able to fully comply with this protocol, including the postoperative regimen and followup visits. Safety laboratory test results and presurgery serology are clinically acceptable to undergo surgery as applicable Serology panel for HIV, HBV, HCV, HTLV I/II and syphilis must be negative. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) including perimenopausal women who have had a menstrual period within 1 year prior to surgery have to have a negative pregnancy test. Results have to be available and negative for the patient to be entered in the study. WOCBP have to use an effective method of birth control 2 months prior to study entry or to surgical intervention date and throughout the study duration. Any subject meeting any of the following exclusion criteria verified by the Investigator during the screening period will be excluded from enrolment into the study. Subject has known history of hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction to PEEK. Due to medical or other reasons spine fusion cannot be delayed for up to 6 months. Indications for spinal fusion other than symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis grade I and II (Meyerding Classification). Subject displays drug or alcohol dependence, serious current illness, mental illness or extenuating circumstance or any other factors which, in the opinion of the Investigator, will interfere with study conduct or interpretation of the results. Subject has documented metabolic disease such as but not limited to severe osteoporosis, osteogenesis imperfect, or osteomalacia. Subject with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus as assessed by glycohaemoglobin (HbA1c) &gt; 8% (at least 2 values per year for last 2 years) Subject is underweight, i.e. body mass index (BMI) ≤18.5 or has a BMI of ≥40, or ≥35 and experiencing obesityrelated health conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes. Overt or active local or systemic infection, including latent infection around (area of) the future surgical implant site. Subject has a history of previously attempted spinal fusion at the same level, or spine level immediately adjacent to the level to be operated on in this study. Decompressive surgery alone (laminectomy) is not an exclusion criterion. Subject is on a transplant list or having received a solid organ transplant at any point in the past. Pregnant or breastfeeding woman. Involved in or planning to engage in litigation related health problems. Subject is a prisoner. Subject had an acute fracture of the spine within 6 months prior enrolment in the study. Subject is known to require additional surgery to the lumbar spinal region within the next 2 years after enrolment in the study. Subject is currently taking chronically any medications that might affect bone metabolism or the quality of bone formation such as but not limited to bisphosphonates, steroids, methotrexate, anticoagulant therapies, immunosuppressants or immunotherapy. Subject is currently using an electrical bone growth stimulator Subject is positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 or 2, hepatitis B or C, human Tcell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) 1 or 2, or syphilis at screening. Subject was exposed to any experimental therapy with another investigational drug within 60 days prior to screening or enrolment in any concurrent study that may confound the results of this study. Subject previously received a cellular therapy (at any point in time). Subject was exposed to therapy for a malignancy or premalignant entity, and not confirmed diseasefree for 5 years or more. Any clinically relevant chronic disease associated with renal or hepatic insufficiency or any chronic disease of such severity that surgery could be detrimental to the survival of the patient. Any other illness which might reduce life expectancy to less than 2 years from screening. Subject is on chronic immunosuppressive therapy (immunosuppressants/immunotherapy) due to inflammatory or systemic disease. Subject has a history of any autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Addison's disease, active Crohn's disease, or rheumatoid arthritis.</criteria>
