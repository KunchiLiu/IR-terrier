	<brief_summary>In this work the importance of the potentiation and recovery of the balance with a physiotherapeutic intervention that begins in the early preoperative phase is compared with the conventional postoperative rehabilitation. The objective is to evaluate the influence of a muscle enhancement protocol in which a specific work of balance is included, with the physical benefits that this entails for the evolution of the patient. It also seeks to verify if the teaching and recommendation of exercises at home as preparation and conditioning for the intervention of ATR is effective, and to what extent, compared to a guided training in the hospital.</brief_summary>
