	<brief_summary>In this study, patients with upper arm fracture will receive an additive robotic-assisted training using the Armeo®Spring robot for three weeks on the injured arm in addition to conventional physio- and occupational therapy. The supportive treatment and execution of specific exercises on the Armeo®Spring should lead to improved recovery of function and mobility of the upper arm compared to conservatively treated patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Robotic-assisted Training After Upper Arm Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 Patients aged between 35 and 66 years with proximal humeral fracture and surgical treatment will be recruited in three different clinics in Germany and randomised into an intervention and a control group. Participants will be assessed before randomisation and followed up after completing an intervention period of 3 weeks and additionally after 3, 6 and 12 months. Baseline assessment will assess cognition (SOMC), level of pain in the affected arm, ability to work, gait speed (10m walk), disability of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH), as well as the range of motion of the affected arm (goniometer measurement), visual acuity and motor function of orthopaedic patients (WMFT-O). Clinical follow up directly after intervention will assess disability of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH), the range of motion and motor function (WMFT-O). Primary outcome parameter will be the DASH and secondary outcome parameter will be the WMFT-O. The long-term results will be assessed prospectively by a postal follow-up. All patients will receive conventional occupational- and physiotherapy. The intervention group will receive an additive robotic-assisted training using the Armeo®Spring robot for three weeks.</detailed_description>
