	<brief_summary>This open label study investigates a novel non-surgical approach to the treatment of HPV-associated anal intraepithelial neoplasia, using Artesunate suppositories.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra-Anally Administered Artesunate in Patients With High-Grade Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia (AIN 2/3)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diagnosed with AIN 2/3 will be enrolled sequentially in treatment cohorts receiving different doses of Artesunate suppositories administered trans-anally. Doses of escalation will be 200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg. Treatment cohorts will consist of 2 or 3 cycles at each dose level. Suppositories will be administered daily for 5 days. Five days constitutes 1 cycle. Up to 3 cycles will be administered at Weeks 0, 2, and 4.</detailed_description>
