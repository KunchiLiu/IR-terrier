	<brief_title>Post-operative Analgesia Efficacy Using Ultrasound-guided Transmuscular Quadratus Lumborum Block Versus Ultrasound-guided Quadratus Lumborum Type II Block.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Quadratus Lumborum (QL) Block is an ultrasound-guided technique described by Rafael Blanco in 2007. The nerves to the lower abdominal wall can be anesthetized by injecting local anesthetics between the quadratus lumborum muscle and latissimus dorsi muscle, which is called quadratus lumborum type II block. 〝 Transmuscular quadratus lumborum block demonstrates that injectate spreads over the posterior abdominal wall to the psoas major muscle and includes the upper branches of the lumbar plexus.〞described by Adhikary in 2016. However there are no published reports comparing the 2 techniques. In our study, compared of ultrasound-guided QL2-blocks with transmuscular quadratus lumborum block to investigate analgesic consumption, pain level, opioid related side effects and mobilization.</detailed_description>
