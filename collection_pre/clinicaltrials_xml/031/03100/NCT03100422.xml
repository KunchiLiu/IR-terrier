	<brief_summary>Neurological patients (e.g., after stroke) need long-term neurorehabilitation therapy of the arm with often limited, unsatisfactory outcome. Robots became a promising supplement or even alternative for neurorehabilitation training.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Strategies of Therapy With the Exoskeleton Robot ARMin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The exoskeleton robot ARMin was further developed and software components adapted accordingly to offer a unique intensified and patient-tailored robot-aided training of the arm. The goal is to enhance treatment efficacy to an extent that the improvement in motor function is meaningful for the individual patient. The study objective is to compare ARMin therapy and a form of conventional occupational therapy that involves both arms regarding change in motor function.</detailed_description>
