	<mesh_term>Asthma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed. Male and female adult patient ≥ 18 years old. Patients with a diagnosis of persistent asthma (GINA 2016) for a period of at least 1 year prior to Visit 1. Patients who have used medium or high dose ICS plus at least 1 controller for asthma for at least 6 months and at stable dose and regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Patients must have ACQ7 score ≥ 1.5 at Visits 2 and qualify for treatment with high dose ICS/LABA Prebronchodilator FEV1 of ≥ 50% and ≤ 85% of the predicted normal value for the patient after withholding bronchodilators at Visit 2. Patients must demonstrate reversibility defined as an increase in FEV1 of ≥ 12% and 200 mL within 30 minutes after administration of 400 μg of salbutamol at Visit 2. Patients who have had an asthma attack/exacerbation requiring systemic steroids or hospitalization or emergency room visit within 6 weeks of Visit 1. Patients who have ever required intubation for a severe asthma attack/exacerbation. Patients who have a clinical condition which is likely to be worsened by ICS administration (e.g. glaucoma, cataract and fragility fractures) who are according to investigator's medical judgment at risk participating in the study. Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening as determined by investigator within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 or between Visit 1 and Visit 99. Patients may be rescreened 4 weeks after recovery from their respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening. Patients with a history of chronic lung diseases other than asthma, including (but not limited to) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, clinically significant bronchiectasis and active tuberculosis. Patients with severe narcolepsy and/or insomnia. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women Women of childbearing potential unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 30 days after stopping of investigational medication</criteria>
