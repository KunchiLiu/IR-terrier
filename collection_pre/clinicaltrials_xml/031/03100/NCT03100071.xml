	<brief_title>Central Venous Catheter (CVC) Associated Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer patients who have developed blood clot in the arm that has the central venous catheter will be treated with standard of care blood thinning injection of low molecular weight heparin for 1 week and then for apixaban 5 mg twice daily for the rest of 11 weeks. Data will be collected to see if the central venous catheter "survived" or remained in place and did not have to be taken out because of the clot.</detailed_description>
