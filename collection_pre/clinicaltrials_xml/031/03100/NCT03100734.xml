	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of Benepali in participants with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including participants with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axSpA, following their transition from treatment with Enbrel. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate safety during and following the transition from Enbrel to Benepali and to evaluate patient-reported outcomes during and following the transition from Enbrel to Benepali.</brief_summary>
