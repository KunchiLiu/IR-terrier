	<brief_title>Study of Food Aversion in Patients With Anorexia Nervosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anorexia nervosa is a brain-based disorder that often leads to serious health consequences including death. The EPHX2 gene has been identified as a susceptibility gene for anorexia nervosa. With the application of complementary research approaches, this study aims to develop a multi-omics biomarker system for anorexia nervosa through a food-challenge protocol. The data will allow us to understand how disease susceptibility gene(s) contribute to food aversion, psychopathology, and outcome in patients with anorexia nervosa.</detailed_description>
