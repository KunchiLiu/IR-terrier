	<mesh_term>Asthma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed. Male and female adult patient ≥ 18 years old. Patients with a diagnosis of persistent asthma (GINA 2016) for a period of at least 1 year prior to Visit 1. Patients who have used medium or high dose ICS/LABA combinations for asthma for at least 6 months and at stable dose and regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. An ACQ7 score ≥ 1.5 at Visits 2. Prebronchodilator FEV1 of ≥ 40% and ≤ 85% of the predicted normal value for the patient after withholding bronchodilators at Visit 2. Patients must demonstrate reversibility defined as an increase in FEV1 of ≥ 12% and 200 mL within 30 minutes after administration of 400 µg of salbutamol at Visit 2. Patients who have had an asthma attack/exacerbation requiring systemic steroids or hospitalization or emergency room visit within 6weeks of Visit 1. Patients who have ever required intubation for a severe asthma attack/exacerbation. Patients who have a clinical condition which is likely to be worsened by ICS administration (e.g. glaucoma, cataract and fragility fractures) who are according to investigator's medical judgment at risk participating in the study. Patients with narrowangle glaucoma, symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or bladderneck obstruction or severe renal impairment or urinary retention. BPH patients who are stable on treatment can be considered. Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening as determined by investigator within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 or between Visit 1 and Visit 99. Patients may be rescreened 4 weeks after recovery from their respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening. Patients with a history of chronic lung diseases other than asthma, including (but not limited to) COPD, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, clinically significant bronchiectasis and active tuberculosis. Patients with severe narcolepsy and/or insomnia Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women Women of childbearing potential unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 30 days after stopping of investigational medication</criteria>
