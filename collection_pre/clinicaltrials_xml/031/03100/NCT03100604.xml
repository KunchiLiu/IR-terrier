	<brief_title>The Effect of General Anesthesia on the Middle Ear Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies reported that inhalation agents are more likely to have impacts on the middle ear pressure compared to intravenous anesthetic agents. Despite numerous studies comparing the effects of inhalation agents on the middle ear pressure, this is the first clinical trial in which end tidal carbon dioxide and effects of sevoflurane and desflurane, along with other anesthetic analgesic agents used, on the middle ear pressure were compared. Our purpose in this study was to investigate the effect of sevoflurane and desflurane, inhalation agents used in patients who do not have any ear pathology and undergo non-ear surgery under general anesthesia, on the middle ear pressure.</detailed_description>
