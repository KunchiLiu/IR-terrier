	<brief_title>Influence of Medical Nutrition Therapy and Eating Behavior on Gestational Weight Gain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women in puerperium with known T2DM or GDM diagnosed at the hospital were invited to participate in the study. Gestational diabetes was diagnosed with a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Weight (kg) and height (m) were measured using a mechanical column scale (SECA). The specific dimensions of eating behavior were measured through the 18-item Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-18 (TFEQ-18). The Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) was offered every 2-4 weeks. This therapy consists of providing a food plan with the following recommendations: limiting carbohydrate intake to 35-45% of total calories calculated as 30 kcal/kg based on pregestational BMI for an ideal weight . We evaluated the effect of MNT on GWG using a multiple linear regression model</detailed_description>
