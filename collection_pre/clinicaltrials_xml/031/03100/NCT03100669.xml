	<brief_summary>MIRP (Minimally Invasive Repair of Pectus) as surgical correction of pectus excavatum or carinatum is performed to achieve physiological, cosmetic, and psychological benefits for the patient. Surgery is often associated with severe postoperative pain. In this study the researchers want to registrate pain, sleep, nausea/vomiting, and daily activities in short and long term follow up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Implementing a Postoperative MIRP (Minimally Invasive Repair of Pectus) Program Via Tele-monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to provide pain patients with an individualized approach to their pain problem after MIRP we developed an electronic medical record coupled to a set of telemetric medical-grade devices. Appi@Home (Antwerp Personalized Pain Initiative) supports an innovative approach to (sub)acute conditions by offering a platform for continuous follow-up. Patients are provided with a toolbox and an app that continuously collects objective outcome data (i.e. pain intensity, sleep quality, physical activity). The integrated system allows the care givers to respond very quickly to changing clinical conditions of the patient, making a very adaptive and individualized follow-up possible for these patients. In addition, the patient becomes an active participant in the global therapeutic approach. Patients receive the toolbox two week prior to surgery with access to the internet platform for questionnaires fill-in procedure. Up to ten week after surgery pain intensity, sleep quality and physical activity will be monitored subjectively by a scoring table (0-10, 0 no pain-bad sleeping quality-no activity, 10 maximum of pain-excellent sleeping quality- a lot of activity) and objectively by blood pressure device, oxygen saturation monitoring, activity tracker and sleep registration tool.</detailed_description>
