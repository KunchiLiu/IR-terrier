	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of BI 655130 following subcutaneous administration (Test, T) compared to BI 655130 following intravenous infusion (Reference, R). The secondary objective is the evaluation and comparison of several pharmacokinetic parameters between all tested treatments.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Healthy male or female subjects according to the investigator's assessment, based on a complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP (Blood Pressure), PR (Pulse Rate)), 12lead ECG (Electrocardiogram), and clinical laboratory tests Age of 18 to 50 years (incl.) BMI (Body Mass Index) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.) Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with GCP (Good Clinical Practice) and local legislation Male subjects, or female subjects who meet any of the following criteria starting from at least 30 days before the first administration of trial medication and until 30 days after trial completion: Use of adequate contraception, e.g. any of the following methods plus condom: implants, injectables, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives, intrauterine device Sexually abstinent A vasectomised sexual partner (vasectomy at least 1 year prior to enrolment) Surgically sterilised (including hysterectomy) Postmenopausal, defined as at least 1 year of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous levels of FSH above 40 U/L and estradiol below 30 ng/L is confirmatory) Any finding in the medical examination (including BP (Blood Pressure), PR (Pulse Rate)), or ECG (Electrocardiogram),) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant by the investigator Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the range of 50 to 90 bpm Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be of clinical relevance Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the investigator Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts Chronic or relevant acute infections History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial medication or its excipients) Use of drugs within 30 days prior to administration of trial medication if that might reasonably influence the results of the trial (incl. QT/QTc interval prolongation) Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication, or current participation in another trial involving administration of investigational drug Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day) Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 20 g per day for females and 30 g per day for males) Drug abuse or positive drug screening Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial medication or intended donation during the trial Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to administration of trial medication or during the trial Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are repeatedly greater than 450 ms in males or repeatedly greater than 470 ms in females) or any other relevant ECG finding at screening A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure, hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome) Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance, because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study Female subjects will not be allowed to participate if any of the following applies: Positive pregnancy test, pregnancy or plans to become pregnant within 30 days after study completion Lactation</criteria>
