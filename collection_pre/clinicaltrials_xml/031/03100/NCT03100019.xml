	<brief_summary>Objectives: Resveratrol, a non-flavonoid polyphenol, has been found to consistently modulate cerebral blood flow (CBF) following oral supplementation. Although, this has not resulted in subsequent predicted benefits to cognitive performance in young healthy populations. However, it is argued that those who suffer a reduction in CBF and cognition, such as aging populations, may benefit more from resveratrol administration. Hypothesis: The current investigation aimed to employ a mild hypoxia as an experimental model of aging in a young healthy population, to assess if resveratrol can attenuate the deficits elicited by the reduction in oxygen supply. It was hypothesized resveratrol would module CBF, to provide a more efficient supply of oxygen to overcome any associated decreases to performance caused by the hypoxic model. Design: This repeated measures, double blind, placebo controlled, balanced design assessed the cognitive and CBF effects of resveratrol in hypoxia (equivalent to ~2000m above sea level) and normoxia (sea level). Methods: 24 participants arrived fully fasted (except water) for 12 hrs before completing a baseline measure of a cognitive task battery, and taking the treatment for the day. Following a 45 min absorption period, participants completed 3 full repetitions of the cognitive test battery and, if appropriate, the oxygen level was altered. Changes in CBF were measured by near-infrared spectroscopy throughout the full testing session.</brief_summary>
