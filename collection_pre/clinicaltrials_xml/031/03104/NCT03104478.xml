	<brief_summary>The trial will enroll 194 previously untreated DLBCL patients over 20 months, with the objective to send to the local investigator an extensive molecular tumor characterization by D38 in at least 80% of enrolled patients. The feasibility and efficiency will be demonstrated by deploying and operating a nation-wide network of dedicated multidisciplinary platforms.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>DLBCL patients that will be eligible in frontline treatment for a combination of anthracyclinebased chemotherapy plus antiCD20 monoclonal antibody,Rituximab: RCHOP 14, RCHOP 21, R miniCHOP, RACVBP, RCOPADEM. Patients treated with RCHOP associated with an experimental drug ((polatuzumab, tazemetostat, venetoclax, entospletinib, lenalidomide, ibrutinib, anti PD1/anti PDL1 ….) A short corticotherapy (prednisone, maximum 7 days) given during prephase therapy is allowed. Eligible histological subtypes: in particular DLBCL NOS, PMBL, high grade Bcell lymphoma (HGBCL) withMYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements, HGBCL NOSFL grade 3B and untreated transformed low grade NHL. ≥ 18 years old, IPI = 05 With available tumor Biopsy (FFPE) that can be sent to RT3 platform at the time of inclusion (or the say after inclusion at the latest). Patient that underwent needle core biopsy samples are not excluded if sufficient material is available for molecular and histopathological explorations No available FFPE biopsy material or insufficient quality/quantity tumor samples according to prerequisite No signed informed consent</criteria>
