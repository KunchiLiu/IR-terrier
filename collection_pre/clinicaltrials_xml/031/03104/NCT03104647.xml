	<detailed_description>The study will take place at Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC). The study will include a single visit. Each subject will put on the VR headset and perform a series of neck movements guided by graphic instructions appearing in the VR environment. The session will be recorded with a video camera which will subsequently be viewed and evaluated by clinicians. The clinicians will identify each movement seen on the video from a predefined list and determine if such a movement is recommended as part of a rehabilitation training program.</detailed_description>
