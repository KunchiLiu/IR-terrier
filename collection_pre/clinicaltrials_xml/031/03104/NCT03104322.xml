	<brief_summary>Pilot-scale, open-label, randomised, two-period crossover study in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) over 16 weeks. Patients will use an electronic health journal (patientMpower platform) to record treatment compliance, forced vital capacity (FVC; daily), impact of IPF on daily life (weekly) and other symptoms. Objectives are to characterise acceptability of patientMpower platform from patient &amp; healthcare professional perspective, impact of active engagement and self-monitoring using patientMpower platform on Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) in IPF, impact of patientMpower platform on medication compliance and correlation between patient-reported PROMs &amp; FVC and clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
