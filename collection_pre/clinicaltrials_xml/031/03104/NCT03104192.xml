	<brief_title>Mobile Health Obesity Wellness Intervention in Rural Older Adults - Research Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The national epidemic of obesity is also affecting older adults, and is associated with an increased risk of disability, nursing home placement and early mortality. Conventional weight loss programs have the potential to reduce body fat, but are difficult to access for older obese adults due to transportation and mobility challenges. The overarching goal of this study is to conduct a program of pilot research aimed at developing and evaluating a technology assisted wellness intervention for older adults with obesity. Study Timeline: September 2017 to June 2018: Goal: Conduct a pilot study of improving weight and physical function in older adults with obesity. An mHealth Obesity Wellness Intervention (MOWI) will integrate Amulet with a weekly individual dietician-led nutritional session, along with twice weekly physical therapist led group exercise session.
