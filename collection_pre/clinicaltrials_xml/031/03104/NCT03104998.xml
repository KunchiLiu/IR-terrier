	<detailed_description>Decreased serum CoQ10 concentrations as well as a decrease in the CoQ10H2 to-ubiquinone ratio have been demonstrated in diseases associated with OS. A strong correlation among sperm count, motility and ubiquinol-10 levels in seminal fluid has also been reported. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether the effects of the exogenous administration of ubiquinol in the improvement of semen parameters in Pakistani men population. Patients who full filled the inclusion criteria and gave informed written consent will be included in the trial. Patient will start to take coenzyme q10 and will take it for 26 weeks. All men undergo a thorough physical examination, a detail history, serum biochemical and hematological laboratory tests and measurement of serum sex and thyroid hormone levels. Randomization codes will provided by the first investigator using a computer generated random number table. The randomization codes will centrally assign by the coordination with the eligibility criteria. A questionnaire will be used to collect information on demographic characteristics. Two semen samples 1and 2 month apart will be obtained after 3 to 5 days of sexual abstinence and process within 1 hour of ejaculation. The mean of the two will be used for statistical analysis.
