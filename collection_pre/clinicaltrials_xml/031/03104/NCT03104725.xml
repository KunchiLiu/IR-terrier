	<brief_summary>Objective: This study is to test whether N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibits the spontaneous oxidation of central neural dopamine as indicated by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of 5-S-cysteinyl-dopamine (Cys-DA) in patients with Parkinson s disease (PD). Study population: The study population comprises up to 35 patients with early ( 5 years from diagnosis), mild, levodopa-untreated PD. The patients will be on an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) that is prescribed for their disease. Design: The study has a one group, pretest-posttest design. Each patient undergoes a lumbar puncture (LP) as an inpatient at the NIH Clinical Center to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for assays of Cys-DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and related biochemicals. The second LP is done after the patient has taken at least 5 doses of NAC (2 grams orally twice per day). The LP takes place about 2 hours after the last NAC dose. Outcome measures: The main outcome measure is the CSF concentration of Cys-DA. Other outcome measures are levels of other catecholamine-related neurochemicals or of indices of oxidative stress. Depending on the results, an exploratory study may be done involving NAC at 1 gram orally twice per day.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: PD diagnosed within the past 5 years Taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor Able to provide consent At least18 years old EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Taking levodopa in any form Known allergy to NAC Already taking an antioxidant dietary supplement (e.g., Olive Leaf Extract, MitoQ) A condition that would increase risk from a lumbar puncture (e.g., symptomatic spinal stenosis or myoclonus) History of a postspinal headache that required treatment with a blood patch On a prescribed anticoagulant (e.g., Coumadin, Plavix) Pregnant or breastfeeding History of alcohol or drug abuse Any medical condition thatcould put subjects at increased risk. Potential participants are excluded who have evidence of bone marrow, liver, or kidney failure based on abnormal screening lab results. On a medication that could interfere with the scientific results. An example of an exclusionary drug is the catecholOmethyltransferase inhibitor entacapone. Tricyclic antidepressants are another type of exclusionary drug</criteria>
