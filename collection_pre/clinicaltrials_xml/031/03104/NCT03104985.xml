	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to evaluate comparatively the efficiency of traditional treatment methods in patients with chronic venous diseases of C6 class, and a new combined low level laser therapy (LLLT) by LASMIK device. The results of outpatient examination and treatment of patients with venous trophic ulcers, observed in the City Polyclinic of "Tula Municipal Clinical Hospital №2" were analyzed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LLLT of Trophic Ulcers of Lower Extremities and Chronic Venous Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During a longitudinal study, a group of patients was followed up in the period of complete or partial recovery. International classification of lower extremity chronic venous disorders СЕАР was used as a clinical classification of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Depending on the applied treatment method, patients were divided into 2 groups: 1. (n=34) Conventional treatment 2. (n=34) Conventional treatment + combined LLLT, including external exposure with 635nm wavelength + intravenous laser blood illumination (ILBI) with 365-405nm (UV-spectrum) and 520-525nm (green spectrum) wavelength alternately, according to the special scheme</detailed_description>
