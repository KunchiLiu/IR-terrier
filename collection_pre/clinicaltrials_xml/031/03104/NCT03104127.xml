	<brief_summary>This study will investigate if a lower limb robotic device can be used in a community setting to increase the amount of physical activity that individuals undertake following stroke and consequently improve biomechanical, physiological and health outcomes, in patients with stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Using a Lower Limb Robotic Device for Patients With Chronic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent advances in technology have helped to develop robotic devices to aid gait training in order to develop more normal movement patterns, strengthen the quadriceps and improve quality of gait. Lower limb robotic devices have been shown to increase functional mobility, walking speed, step length, balance and endurance within a clinical setting. The purpose of this study is to see if a lower limb robotic device leg can be used in a community setting to improve biomechanical (gait, balance, lower-limb strength), physiological (vascular health) and performance outcomes (aerobic fitness, strength) in patients with chronic stroke</detailed_description>
