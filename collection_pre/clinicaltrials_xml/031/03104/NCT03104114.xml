	<brief_summary>Boston Medical Center provides care to cancer patients on oral cancer medications through the use of Boston Medical Center Specialty Pharmacy (BMC SP). The use of oral medications in cancer treatments is relatively new and unfortunately, very little is known about adherence in cancer patients. This study will evaluate the influence of a pharmacist-driven medication management program on adherence and persistence rates. Boston Medical Center's Specialty Pharmacy Adherence Program (B-SPAP), will utilize a high-touch counseling model involving clinical pharmacist that will focus on educating patients about their oral cancer treatments. The program will require face-to-face counseling with a pharmacist, through the use of a proven patient teaching tool, prior to initiating treatment with oral oncolytic treatments and, periodically thereafter, based on protocol. This study will help improve our understanding of the role of the pharmacist in cancer patients. In addition, the study will help identify independent factors that may contribute or impact adherence. The outcomes of this program will be compared to a historical control group of patients that have already received treatment for their cancer through the BMC Specialty Pharmacy.</brief_summary>
