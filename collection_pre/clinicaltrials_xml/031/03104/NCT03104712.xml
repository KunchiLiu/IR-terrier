	<brief_title>A Trial on the GI of Spaghetti Versus Rice as Mixed Meals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Pasta and rice are two of the most commonly consumed grains worldwide, where the former has a low GI (e.g. spaghetti) and the latter, usually (as it depends on the type) has a higher GI (e.g. white rice). Low GI foods have been demonstrated to improve glycemic control, insulin sensitivity and diabetes management (Thomas and Elliott. 2009, Ajala et al. 2013), and have been associated with reduced risk of chronic disease (Barclay et al. 2008), including coronary heart disease (Mirrahimi et al. 2012). Therefore, GI is of importance as a potential dietary strategy to reduce postprandial glycemia and improve glycemic control, particularly with the increasing rates of diabetes. Several studies have demonstrated how the addition of fat to a meal can reduce the glycemic response, some of which have suggested in a dose response manner (Moghaddam, et al. 2006). The mechanism by which increasing fat reduces the glycemic response may be through the effects on gastric emptying. Fat may modulate the gut hormones cholecystokinin (CCK) and peptide YY, which delay gastric emptying (Pironi et al. 1993, Moran et al. 2004), which is known to be a major determinant of postprandial glycemia where small changes can have a substantial effect (Horowitz et al. 1993, Rayner et al. 2001). Low GI foods result in lower glycemic excursions compared to higher GI foods, which, in addition to gastric emptying, may exert this effect through various pathways (Vinoy et al. Chap 13. GI Book 2016). Thus, there is importance of exploring the potential additional benefit beyond reducing the glycemic response with the addition of fat. The most typical ways in which pasta and rice are consumed are with the addition of oil or tomato sauce, and are recommended to be consumed in this way in the Mediterranean diet (Estruch et al. NEJM 2013). Among many benefits, the Mediterranean diet has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (Estruch et al. 2013), improved glycemic control (Esposito et al. 2015) and is encouraged in many clinical guidelines globally for both cardiovascular risk reduction (Anderson et al. Canadian Cardiovascular Society, 2016) and for diabetes (CDA 2013, Evert et al. 2013, ADA 2015). Some studies have explored the differences in glycemic response of different carbohydrate foods consumed with the addition of fat demonstrating that the glycemic response is indeed reduced.However, the GI may remain of importance even when other means to reduce glycemic response are introduced. We therefore designed a randomized controlled crossover study to explore whether the addition of fat in the form of commonly consumed sauces which are recommended as part of a Mediterranean diet, affects the difference in glycemic response between a commonly consumed low GI and a higher GI carbohydrate food. Objective: To assess whether the addition of fat to a low GI and higher GI carbohydrate food lowers the glycemic response equivalently, thus whether the difference between the low and higher GI food is preserved. Scope: The principal scope of the study is to evaluate the impact of two carbohydrate-containing foods varying in glycemic index, spaghetti and rice, on postprandial glucose. To confirm that the two foods vary in GI, the GI of the rice will first be tested in Part A, since the GI of spaghetti has already been determined in our lab. In Part B of the study, following the consumption of the test foods by healthy volunteers (see Study Design), we will evaluate the differences in postprandial glucose, as well as insulin and c-peptide. Implications: These results will determine whether there is an independent effect of the GI of a carbohydrate containing food when fat is added to a meal in the context of how is it commonly and recommended to be consumed. These results may be useful to encourage the use of low GI foods for greater improvements in glycemic and insulinemic control, which is an important public health concern in today's global society.</detailed_description>
