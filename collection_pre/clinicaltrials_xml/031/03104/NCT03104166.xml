	<brief_summary>50 patients will be randomized and treated with MCO or highflux dialysis for six months (24 weeks) after a run-in phase of 4 weeks Highflux treatment. Serum samples will be drawn at baseline, after 4, 8 and 24 weeks. Later, calcifiying vascular smooth muscle cells will be incubated with these serum samples and calcification will be assessed with Alkaline phosphatase and Alizarin staining. Primary endpoint: In vitro Calcification of coronary vascular smooth muscle cells (Alkaline Phosphatase/ WST8) after six months Calcifiying vascular smooth muscle cells will be incubated with serum samples obtained after six months of MCO/HF dialysis and calcification will be assessed with Alkaline phosphatase and WST8. Secondary Endpoints: Aortic Pulse wave velocity after 6 months Calcification propensity after 6 months Physical activity level after 6 months Cell culture: Incubation of VSMC with serum samples obtained after 6 months - Alizarin staining/WST-8 - Measurement of calcification inhibitors Osteopontin and Matrix Gla Protein in Supernatants - Apoptosis The treatment regimen of the patients will not be altered, hence blood flow, dialysate flow as well as dialysis time will remain constant.</brief_summary>
