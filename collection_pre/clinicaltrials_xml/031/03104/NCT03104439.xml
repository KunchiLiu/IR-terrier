	<brief_title>Nivolumab and Ipilimumab and Radiation Therapy in MSS and MSI High Colorectal and Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved nivolumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ipilimumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. Researchers hope to study the effects of the combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab. Many cancers use specific pathways (such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) to evade the body's immune system. Nivolumab and ipilimumab work by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways and thus releasing the brakes on the immune system so it can stop or slow cancer. Ipilimumab and Nivolumab are both antibodies. An antibody is a cell that attaches to other cells to fight off infection. The antibodies in ipilimumab work by not allowing cancer cell growth. The antibodies in nivolumab work by causing programmed cell death of the cancer cells. Radiation therapy is believed to increase the likelihood of response of immunotherapy (the prevention/treatment of a disease through an immune response). In this research study, the investigators are studying the combination of nivolumab, ipilimumab and radiation therapy on participants with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, or MSI high colorectal cancer. The combination of these study drugs have been tested and optimized for safety and is currently being tested in multiple disease types. The study drugs have not been tested and optimized in combination with radiation therapy. The investigators believe that through the combination of the study drugs and radiation therapy the body may produce an immune response to stop the cancer cells from growing.</detailed_description>

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1 Life expectancy of greater than 3 months Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined in Table 1, all screening labs should be performed within 14 days of protocol registration.

Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five halflives) after the last dose of investigational drug. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) Women must not be breastfeeding Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential, ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Stable dose of dexamethasone 2 mg or less for 7 days prior to initiation of treatment One previously unirradiated lesion amenable to radiotherapy 8 Gy x 3 and can meet dose constraints, and another unirradiated measurable lesion &gt; 1 cm in size outside the radiation field that can be used as measurable disease Colorectal patients must have documentation of microsatellite status. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is acceptable. Colorectal patients must have received prior Fluorouracil (5FU), Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin (any combination) or have a contraindication to receiving these agents. Pancreas patients must have progressed on at least 1 prior line of chemotherapy Participants who have had chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy or study therapy within 14 days of protocol treatment, or those who have not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier. Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy. Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents. Patients are excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune disease other than those listed below. Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger Patients are excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Subjects are permitted to use topical, ocular, intraarticular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of nonautoimmune conditions (eg, delayedtype hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted. Colorectal patients are excluded if they have had prior systemic treatment with an antiCTLA4, antiPD1 (Programmed cell death protein 1) or PDL1 (Programmed deathligand 1) antibody.
