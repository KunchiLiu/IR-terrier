	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to define 25(OH)D3 catabolism in CF patients using gold standard pharmacokinetics studies. Specifically, the investigators will evaluate the metabolic clearance of 25(OH)D3 among participants with CF and matched control subjects. The goal of this work is to provide the first comprehensive characterization of vitamin D metabolism in CF patients and promote novel hypotheses for subsequent studies.</brief_summary>
