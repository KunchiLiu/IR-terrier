	<brief_title>Helping Moms Who Smoke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 90% of women who smoked before pregnancy will be smokers within one year of delivery . This occurs even though half who smoke quit during the course of pregnancy. This is an observational, cohort study of pregnant women who smoked in the six months before becoming pregnant. Women will be followed from the first trimester to one year after the birth of their babies. The results of this study will help us to describe women's' views on the quality of tobacco counseling they receive from their doctors; understand patterns of smoking and quitting throughout pregnancy and after childbirth; and provide information needed to develop an intervention to help women quit.</detailed_description>
