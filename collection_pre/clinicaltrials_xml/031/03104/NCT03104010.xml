	<criteria>Before the treatment, the subject should be diagnosed as AGHD based on medical history, clinical symptoms, vital signs, insulin tolerance test and imagological examinations. The subject is diagnosed as GHD during childhood and remains as GHD in adulthood, and the linear growth has completed: bone age (BA) ≥18 years old; or the AGHD patient who experiences paroxysm after 18 years old: such as patients who have experienced pituitary surgeries (2 years after pituitary adenoma surgery, 5 years after craniopharyngioma surgery and 12 months after other pituitary surgeries), traumatic brain injury (TBI), Sheehan syndrome, and etc.. The plasma GH concentration peak is &lt;5ng/ml in insulin tolerance test (ITT) (it's unnecessary to conduct ITT in the following conditions: anterior pituitary dysfunction, pituitary hormone deficiency (more than 3 hormones) and serum IGF1 level below lower limit of normal value: i.e. 2 SD). Age: 1860 years old. Patients with no history of GH treatment for more than one year. Body mass index (BMI): 18.5 kg/m2≤BMI≤30kg/m2. When there is other hormones deficiency (such as glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones and sex steroids), the subject should have received other hormone replacement therapies and the therapeutic dose shall be stable within 3 months before the enrolment. The subject agrees to cooperate and complete the concerted trial procedures such as followups, treatment plan and laboratory examinations, and sign the written informed consent. Patients with serious heart diseases, including NYHA III or above, serious arrhythmia, unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction within the latest 6 months. Patients with a history of ischemic cerebrovascular disease, febrile convulsion and epilepsy seizures. Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. Patients with poor hypertension control (systolic pressure&gt;140mmHg or diastolic pressure &gt;90mmHg under treatment). Patients with previous or present history of malignant tumor: two or more direct relatives within three generations have previous or present history of tumor. Patients undergoing antidepressive therapy, immunosuppressive therapy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy (or with a history of radiotherapy). Patients who have ever taken antiobesity drug within the latest 3 months. Patients with serious infection. Patients with consciousness disorders and mental diseases. Subjects with impaired glucose regulation (IGR) (impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) ) or diabetes; patients with a family history of diabetes (direct relatives). Subjects with abnormal liver and kidney functions (ALT &gt; 2 times of upper limit of normal value; eGFR calculated by MDRD formula &lt;60). Subjects positive for antiHBc, HBsAg or HBeAg in Hepatitis B virus tests. Subjects with highly allergic constitution or allergy to proteins or investigational productorits excipient in this study. Subjects who took part in other clinical trials within 3 months. Patients with other mental or physical deficiencies that influence the evaluation of investigational product. Pregnant or lactating women; females planning to get pregnant within one year. Subjects whose tumor markers exceed the upper limit of normal range and the reexamination result is still high. Other conditions which is unsuitable for the study in the opinion of the investigator.</criteria>
