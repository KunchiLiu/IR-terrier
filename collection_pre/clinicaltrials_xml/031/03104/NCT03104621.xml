	<brief_summary>The aim of this work is to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of preservative containing 0.0015% tafluprost and preservative-free 0.0015% tafluprost. Both preservative containing and preservative-free 0.0015% tafluprost will reduce intraocular pressure significantly. In addition, preservative-free 0.0015% tafluprost might improve tolerability of glaucoma patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Primary open angle glaucoma and normotensive glaucoma patients who came to the outpatient clinic for regular glaucoma checkups were enrolled. 2. Glaucoma was defined as the patients who had open angle confirmed by gonioscopy, optic nerve cupping (a vertical cupdisc ratio of &gt;0.6) and or notching of the neuroretinal rim and or retinal nerve fiber defects characteristics of glaucoma, and visual field defect(i.e., a glaucoma hemifiled test result outside normal limits, a pattern standard deviation probability of &lt;5%, or a cluster of three or more nonedge points in location typical of glaucoma, all of which were depressed on a pattern deviation plot at a P level of &lt;5%, and at least one of which was depressed at a P level of &lt;1% on two consecutive visual field tests). 3. Normal tension glaucoma included criteria: repeated measurements of untreated IOP values of &lt; 21mmHg. Primary open angle glaucoma included criteria: repeated measurements of untreated IOP values of â‰¥ 22mmHg. 1. Phakic and pseudophakic eyes. 2. eyes that had been taken vitrectomy, trabeculectomy, or surgery influenced IOP</criteria>
