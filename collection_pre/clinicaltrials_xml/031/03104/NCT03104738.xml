	<brief_summary>Many patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) are currently being managed with Basal Insulin (BI). However, there is little evidence to support guidelines on dosing adjustments in the preoperative period. The Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia does not advise a reduction in the dose of BI preoperatively, unless there is a specific history of hypoglycemia. The Endocrine Society suggests a 50% reduction in BI dose the evening before surgery. The authors hypothesized that a 25% reduction in BI dose the evening before surgery will result in better perioperative blood glucose control compared with our institutional 50% decrease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Basal Insulin Strategies Before Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 40 subjects diagnosed with T2DM taking once-daily evening BI, scheduled to undergo elective surgery under general anesthesia will be consented and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to received either 50% or 25% reduction of their regular evening BI dose on the evening before surgery. Blood glucose levels (BGL) will be recorded perioperatively according to institutional guidelines.</detailed_description>
