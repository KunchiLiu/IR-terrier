	<brief_title>Mobile Health Obesity Wellness Intervention in Rural Older Adults - Home-Based Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The national epidemic of obesity is also affecting older adults, and is associated with an increased risk of disability, nursing home placement and early mortality. Conventional weight loss programs have the potential to reduce body fat, but are difficult to access for older obese adults due to transportation and mobility challenges. The overarching goal of this study is to conduct a program of pilot research aimed at developing and evaluating a technology assisted wellness intervention for older adults with obesity. Study Timeline: July 2018 to April 2020: Goal: Conduct a study of improving weight and physical function in older adults with obesity at home using video-conferencing. An mHealth obesity wellness intervention (MOWI) will integrate Amulet with a weekly individual dietician-led nutritional session, along with twice weekly physical therapist led group exercise session performed in a person's home. Participation Duration: Three times weekly for 6 months</detailed_description>
