	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, single-site, randomized, then open-label study designed to develop a detailed transcriptional and epigenetic profile of the immune response to pneumococcal vaccination with conjugated and non-conjugated polysaccharide vaccines in the senescent immune system of older adults. In this study, 40 healthy adults ages 65 and older that have never received pneumococcal vaccination, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Prevnar-13 (Pfizer), a conjugated 13-valent vaccine or Pneumovax 23 (Merck), a non-conjugated 23-valent vaccine. Following randomized assignment of vaccine, the study will be open-label. Six (6) study visits will occur over about 70 days, with an optional 7th visit for participants to receive a second vaccination with the other pneumococcal vaccine one to two years after randomization. Participants will provide blood samples for transcriptional, epigenetic and biological analyses pre- and post-vaccination.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective, single-site, randomized, then open-label study is designed to develop a detailed transcriptional and epigenetic profile of the immune response to pneumococcal vaccination with conjugated and non-conjugated polysaccharide vaccines in the senescent immune system of older adults. This knowledge may lead to development of more effective vaccines through increased understanding of the effects of immunosenescence on mechanisms of immune response to pneumococcal vaccination in the elderly. Forty (40) healthy adults ages 65 and older that have never received pneumococcal vaccination, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Prevnar-13 (Pfizer), a conjugated 13-valent vaccine or Pneumovax 23 (Merck), a non-conjugated 23-valent vaccine. Following randomized assignment of vaccine, the study will be open-label.The study sample will be drawn from the population of healthy elderly in the catchment area of UConn Health in Farmington, CT. The first six (6) study visits are planned to occur over 67 days at Days -7, 0, 1, 10, 28 (±3 d) and 60 (± 5d). Participants will provide blood samples for transcriptional, epigenetic and biological analyses pre- and post-vaccination. One to two years after receiving the randomly-assigned vaccination, participants may opt to receive administration of a second pneumococcal vaccine with the vaccine that they did not receive by random assignment at Visit 2 (Day 0). This second vaccine will be provided at no charge to the participant. Administration of this vaccine will occur at an optional Visit 7 for participants who choose to receive the second vaccine and will be scheduled at the participant's convenience one-two years after receiving the first pneumococcal vaccine. If the participant opts to receive the second vaccine within the study and attends optional Visit 7, blood samples for genomic and biologic analysis will be collected at the visit.</detailed_description>
