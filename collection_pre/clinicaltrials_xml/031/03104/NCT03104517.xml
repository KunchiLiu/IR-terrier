	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of two treatments of Autologous Muscle Derived Cells for Urinary Sphincter Repair (AMDC-USR) compared to a placebo in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in adult female patients. Two-thirds of the participants will receive AMDC-USR (injections with cells) and the other one-third will receive placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Two Treatments of Autologous Muscle Derived Cells for Female Urinary Sphincter Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the accidental loss of urine due to physical activity, such as laughing, coughing, or sneezing. Autologous Muscle Derived Cells for Urinary Sphincter Repair (AMDC-USR) involves a medical procedure in which a participant's own muscle cells are collected, processed, and then injected into the tissues of the urinary passage. This is a double-blind randomized study, which means neither the participant, nor the study doctor will know which treatment group the participant will be in. Participants who are randomly chosen to receive injection with placebo will have the option to receive an injection with their cells after completion of the blinded portion of their study participation (12 months).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult female patient who has primary and moderatetosevere symptoms of SUI for at least 6 months, as confirmed by patient medical history and clinical symptoms, including a focused incontinence evaluation. Must be willing and able to comply with the study procedures, be mentally competent and able to understand all study requirements, and must agree to read and sign the informed consent form prior to any studyrelated procedures. Must have completed at least 80% of the screening 3day diary. Patient has symptoms of only urge incontinence as confirmed by basic evaluation of etiology from a patient medical history, including a focused incontinence history. Patient has symptoms of mixed urinary incontinence where urge incontinence is the predominant factor. Patient has had stress urinary incontinence symptoms less than 6 months prior to signing the informed consent. Patient has not previously attempted conservative treatment prior to signing the informed consent. (Examples of conservative treatment include behavior modifications, bladder exercises, biofeedback, pelvic floor muscle therapy, etc.) Patient BMI â‰¥ 35. Patient routinely has more than 2 episodes of awakening to void during normal sleeping hours. Patient cannot be maintained on a stable dose and/or frequency of medication (including diuretics) known to affect lower urinary tract function, including but not limited to, anticholinergics, beta 3 adrenergic receptor agonists, tricyclic antidepressants, serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, diuretics, or alphaadrenergic blockers, for at least 2 weeks prior to screening or is likely to change during the course of the study. History of cancer in pelvic organs, ureters, or kidneys. Patient is pregnant, lactating, or plans to become pregnant during the course of the study.</criteria>
