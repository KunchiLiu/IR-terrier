	<brief_summary>The MitraClip-procedure offers an interventional treatment for high risk patients with severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation. The number of new cerebral ischemic lesions without clinical manifestations is high. The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of cerebral embolisms and cerebral lesions during the MitraClip-procedure using transcranial doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mitral regurgitation is the second most common manifestation of valvular heart disease in adults. Surgical reconstruction is considered treatment of choice. For some patients the surgical risk is to high an operation is refused. For those Patients the MitraClip system (Abbott Vascular, Menlo Park, CA, USA) offers a much less invasive treatment option. Occurrence of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is one of the potential complications during this procedure. 1% of all patients have an acute stroke. The number of new ischemic lesions without clinical manifestations is much higher (up to 85%). The impact of these lesions on the global cognitive function is unclear. The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of cerebral embolisms related to predefined procedural intervals and postprocedural cerebral lesions using Transcranial Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore we want to study the correlation between cerebral embolisms seen as high intensity signals in transcranial duplex ultrasound and cerebral lesions seen in the cMRT. The results should build a basis for further studies that want to reduce the amount of cerebral lesions.</detailed_description>
