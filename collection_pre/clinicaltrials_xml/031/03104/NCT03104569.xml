	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of normal temperature and 37℃ non-ionic contrast agent acting on ERCP-related cholangeitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in the treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of 37℃ Non-ionic Contrast Agent During ERCP Procedure in Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present, the common used contrast agent in ERCP is composed of ionic and non-ionic type, and the latter's advantages lie in its slighter toxic-and-side effect and favorable security. When heated to 37℃, the 20 ℃ contrast agents would be diluted to 50% consistency, then a shorter time period of its intravascular and other intracavitary stay would add to less cell damage. And the applications of heated non-ionic contrast agents could be found in computed tomography angiography(CTA), hysterosalpingography (HSG) and cystourethrography, and consequently the patients with the intervention of heated non-ionic contrast agents felt more comfortable and fewer adverse reactions could be observed. Nevertheless, heated contrast agent was rarely reported to act in ERCP. It's theoretically possible that its heat-reduced lower mucosity could help the contrast agent itself to drainage, so that the incidence of cholangeitis could be under control.</detailed_description>
