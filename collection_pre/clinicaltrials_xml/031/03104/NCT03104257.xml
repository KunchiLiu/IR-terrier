	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to determine the temporal course of recovery of CB1R availability and neural oscillations, in cannabis-dependent individuals at baseline, following 48 hour confirmed inpatient abstinence and after four weeks confirmed outpatient abstinence (confirmed by tracking creatinine adjusted urine THC-COOH levels). This research will also examine associations between CB1R availability, neural oscillations and cognitive function using [11-C]OMAR PET imaging and electroencephalography.</detailed_description>
