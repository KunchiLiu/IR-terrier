	<brief_summary>The study aims to investigate whether combined treatment of MGD massage and artificial tears will improve signs and symptoms of dry eye compared to artificial tears alone. The meibomian glands secrete meibum which is the oily component of the tear film layer. The meibum plays a pivotal role in preventing tear evaporation and smoothening the tears film . Meibomian gland dysfunction is a common condition that affects 39%-50% of the population. It is part of inflammatory disease of the eyelids called blepharitis. Associated syndromes are rosacea and dry eye syndrome . Sign and symptoms are: irritation, hyperemia, burning sensation, photophobia, epiphora and blur. Spectrometry analysis shows change it the fatty acids conformation such as increase in levels of branched-chain fatty acids and decrease in saturated fatty acids . Subsequently the clotted meibum results in glands blockage that can be graded in 0-4 grade scale: grade 2- meibum secretion thick and oily, grade 3- meibum secretion granular-toothpaste like. Although MGD is not often accompanied with inflammatory signs it is a common cause for evaporative dry eye.</brief_summary>
