	<brief_summary>The investigators have recently shown in incomplete SCI patients that long-term paired associative stimulation is capable of restoring voluntary control over some paralyzed muscles and enhancing motor output in the weak muscles (1). In this study, the investigators will administer long-term paired associative stimulation to patients with incomplete SCI of non-traumatic origin.</brief_summary>
