	<brief_summary>This study was done to verify whether the combination of transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (TPTNS) with low dose trospium chloride in the treatment of females with overactive bladder (OAB) would be more effective than TPTNS alone after failure of behavioral therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcutaneous Posterior Tibial Nerve Electrostimulation With Low Dose Trospium Chloride in OAB in Females</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators randomized 30 women with OAB, in two groups: G I (15 patients) received 30 minutes TPTNS, three times a week; GII (15 patients) received TPTNS plus Low dose trospium chloride (20 mg once daily); all for 8 weeks. Patients were evaluated using Overactive Bladder Symptom Score questionnaire (OABSS), Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-short form 7 (IIQ-7), 3 day voiding diary and urodynamics at weeks 0 and 8.</detailed_description>
