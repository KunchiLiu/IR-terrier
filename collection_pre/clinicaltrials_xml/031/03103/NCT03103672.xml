	<detailed_description>Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is a disturbing procedure for patients. Especially pain at the time of dilation can be a serious problem. These situations may be required local anesthetics, intravenous narcotics and sedatives or general anesthesia (1). TIVA with short-acting anesthetics such as propofol and remifentanil is characterized by hemodynamic stability and better compilation profile (2). The purpose of this study; To compare total intravenous anesthesia with inhalation anesthesia in patients undergoing percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography under general anesthesia and Determine their advantages and disadvantages. 1.
