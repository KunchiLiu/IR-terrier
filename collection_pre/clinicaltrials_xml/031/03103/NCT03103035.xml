	<brief_title>Enhancing Knowledge Translation in Nutrition Through a Healthy Eating Blog</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants randomised to the experimental group are exposed to one blog post each week for a period of 6 months. Blog posts focus on the improvement of fruits and vegetables consumption targeting four main determinants of the behavior: (1) knowledge; (2) attitude; (3) self-efficacy; and (4) motivation/goals. Each post included a step-by-step recipe developed by the research team and featuring fruits and vegetables. Recipes were described textually and also using pictures and/or video. Twenty-six posts were created over the six-month intervention. Participants randomised to the control group are not exposed to the healthy eating blog. Feasibility (compliance, dropout and participation rates) and acceptability (satisfaction) of the study were assessed.</detailed_description>
