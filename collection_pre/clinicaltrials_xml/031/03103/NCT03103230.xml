	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to study, among the aphasic person, if motor function ( studied by Motor Evoked Potentials) performed within the first 14 days after a stroke can predict a good recovery from aphasia 6 months of the initial episode.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electro-physiological Signs to Prognostic Aphasia Recovery After a Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>â€¢ Background : Stroke affects approximately 130,000 people per year and communication disorders occur in 35% of cases, resulting in left brain damages. Aphasia is the main cause of these disorders. It is a sign of poor prognosis in the functional recovery after stroke. Recent studies have attempted to establish early clinical prognostic criteria to establish a predictive model of aphasia recovery. The issue of the possibility of prediction is important and can influence the rehabilitation treatment decided in the early days after stroke, with adequate guidance in rehabilitation structures. There are close links between motor system and language, either at production or comprehension, and more particularly concerning the motricity of the hand or lips. The cortical excitability of motor areas of the right upper limb is thus modified by the language in healthy subjects, but also in the aphasic person. - Purpose : The main: to study, among the aphasic person, if Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP) performed within the first 14 days after a stroke can predict a good recovery from aphasia 6 months of the initial episode. - Detailed description: All aphasic stroke patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic damages will be proposed for inclusion. All patients will benefit in the acute phase of an aphasia evaluation, and a clinical evaluation. All patients will have a study of motor evoked potentials (abductor pollicis brevis and orbicularis oris) less than 14 days from stroke. The investigators will evaluate the aphasia 3 and 6 months after stroke, to determinate if MEP can predict a good recovery of aphasia.</detailed_description>
