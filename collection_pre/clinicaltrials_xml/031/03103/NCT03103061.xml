	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, safety, and image quality of low-radiation, dynamic perfusion CT of the heart in patients with suspected ischemic chest pain and a moderate or severe stenosis seen on coronary CTA. Secondary aims include the assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of CT perfusion imaging compared to either SPECT or invasive angiography.</brief_summary>
