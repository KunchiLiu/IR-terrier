	<brief_summary>It has been suggested that activity immediately following concussion is detrimental to recovery and may lead to long term impairments. The animal model has shown that exercise too soon can lead to neurometabolic energy imbalances within the brain. However, there is also evidence to suggest that prolonged inactivity has negative consequences that may contribute to prolongation of symptoms. Determining the ideal timeframe in which to initiate an active rehabilitation protocol for patients who are slow to recovery is an important factor in concussion management.</brief_summary>
