	<brief_summary>KL-6 may be a useful biomarker in patients with interstitial lung disease, but there is limited information in non-Asian populations. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out studies in other populations to confirm the diagnostic values of the biomarker and its prognostic implication. Hypothesis KL-6 may be a useful biomarker in the management of interstitial lung diseases. But it is necessary to know more about its utility in the European population. Study Objectives: - To determine the concentration of KL-6 in serum of patients with pulmonary fibrosis at the time of diagnosis compared to patients without pulmonary fibrosis - Diagnostic yield of KL-6 in patients with pulmonary fibrosis. - Correlation of KL-6 values with functional and radiological parameters of disease severity at diagnosis. - Correlation of serum KL-6 values with the evolution of the disease.</brief_summary>
