	<brief_summary>This is pilot study aimed to investigate the application of proteosome inhibitor, Bortezomib in treatment of patients with neutralizing autoantibody to IFN-γ. The investigators hypothesis is that bortezomib will reduce the antibody level and restore interferon-gamma function, resulting in clinical improvement and should be well-tolerated and safe for use in patients with autoantibody to IFN-γ.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Adult-Onset Immunodeficiency With Bortezomib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients with autoantibody to IFN-γ and past or current history of proven opportunistic infection will receive 2 treatment cycles of bortezomib subcutaneously (4 injections of 1.3 mg Bortezomib /m2 body surface per cycle), followed by low dose oral cyclophosphamide for 4 month after completion treatment with bortezomib.</detailed_description>
