	<brief_summary>The study is a clinical trial, prospective and randomized of 60 patients of both genders, aged between 18 and 80 years, underwent major abdominal surgery. This study aims to compare plasma lactate levels in patients underwent major abdominal surgery (colectomy, gastrectomy, esophagectomy, pancreatectomy, Wertheim Meigs, liver and spleen surgeries) monitored by echocardiography or by conventional techniques (mean arterial pressure , Central venous pressure).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study is a clinical trial, prospective and randomized of 60 patients of both genders, aged between 18 and 80 years, underwent major abdominal surgery. This study aims to compare plasma lactate levels in patients underwent major abdominal surgery (colectomy, gastrectomy, esophagectomy, pancreatectomy, Wertheim Meigs, liver and spleen surgeries) monitored by echocardiography or by conventional techniques (mean arterial pressure , Central venous pressure). The investigators expect to observe a decrease in plasma lactate levels in patients submitted to echocardiographic monitoring when compared to patients submitted to conventional monitoring. In this way, to demonstrate that the routine use of transthoracic echocardiography in patients submitted to large surgery improves the clinical outcomes of these patients and presents a lower hospital cost. The surgical indication will obey the criteria of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora surgery service, after clinical examination and routine preoperative laboratory tests (complete blood count, complete coagulogram, plasma sodium, potassium Plasma urea and plasma creatinine, blood glucose and liver function test), resting electrocardiogram and chest X-ray. All patients who agree to participate in the study will sign an Informed Consent Term in the preanesthetic evaluation (Appendix 1). Patients will be computer randomly form by the GraphPad PrismaÂ® program into two groups with 30 patients: Conventional Group, Transthoracic Echocardiogram Group, All survey data will be noted in the Protocol Data Sheet (Appendix 2). Patients will be anesthetized by the researcher Dr. Marcello Fonseca Salgado Filho, who will also be responsible for performing the intraoperative TTE examination.</detailed_description>
