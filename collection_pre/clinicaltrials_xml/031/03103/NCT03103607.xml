	<brief_summary>There is a general belief among physicians involved with Graves' orbitopathy (GO) that this syndrome is somehow "chronic", namely that the patient's eyes do not return the way they were before GO appeared. The general impression that comes from the available studies is that the eyes of GO patients do not return to normal even after a very long time since the disease appearance under the physician's point of view, although a discrete proportion of patients feel so. However, no studies are available in which the issue was examined with both objective criteria and self-assessment. The present study design was to investigated the disappearance of GO, regardless to treatment, in all consecutive patients with a history of GO of at least 10 years who came for a follow-up visit to our GO clinic over a period of 5 years.</brief_summary>
