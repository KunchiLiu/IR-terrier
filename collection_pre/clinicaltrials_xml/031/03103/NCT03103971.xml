	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects of autologous anti-CD19chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-4-1BB-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocytes (huJCAR014) in treating patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. huJCAR014 CAR-T cells are made in the laboratory by genetically modifying a patient's T cells and may specifically kill cancer cells that have a molecule CD19 on their surfaces.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>huJCAR014 CAR-T Cells in Treating Adult Patients With Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate preliminary safety of huJCAR014 in adult patients with CD19+ relapsed or refractory (R/R) aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of huJCAR014 in CD19+ R/R aggressive B-cell NHL and ALL. II. To assess the antitumor activity of huJCAR014 in CD19+ R/R aggressive NHL and ALL. III. To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with CD19+ R/R aggressive NHL and ALL treated with huJCAR014. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the cellular and humoral immune responses to huJCAR014. II. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of huJCAR014. III. To assess the effect of huJCAR014 product attributes on safety, PK, and antitumor activity. IV. To assess the effect of tumor and tumor microenvironment on huJCAR014 PK and biomarkers. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of huJCAR014. Patients undergo leukapheresis. Beginning 14-16 days after leukapheresis, patients undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprising either cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) daily for 1 day and fludarabine IV daily for 3 days or cyclophosphamide and fludarabine IV daily for 3 days. Within 36-96 hours after completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, patients receive huJCAR014 IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for the first 3 months, every 3 months for up to 12 months, and then yearly for 15 years.</detailed_description>
