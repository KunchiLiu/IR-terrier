	<detailed_description>Treatment of coronary artery disease is re-open the occluded artery by many ways such as removed clot and coronary stenting. Which needed two antiplatelet after the procedure at least a month to a year. Some patient must have life long period to prevent the stent occlude and stenosis. But dental problem is commonly found in real life practice. Many people suffered from toothache and have to wait until a year, just to prevent bleeding. Physicians often be consulted with this dilemma. To continue there are some risk to bleed but discontinue antipletlet can cause recurrent myocardial ischemia. Which the highest risk factor of stent thrombosis is early stop anti platelet. Since there is no clinical practice guideline in Thailand, this study is to compare rate of dental bleeding between patient who continue two antoplatelet and who stop only P2Y12 inhibitor. The study include immediate bleeding, 24 hour and a week after procedure, follow up for major cardiovascular event such as myocardial ischemia, stroke and death. In order to create further clinical practice for this specific group.</detailed_description>
