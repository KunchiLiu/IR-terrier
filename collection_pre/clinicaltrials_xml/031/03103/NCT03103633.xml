	<brief_summary>Anesthesia-related factors have been linked to poor perioperative outcomes. Our observational study suggested that the cumulative duration of a triple-low state (intraoperative low MAP, low BIS, and low Ce) was associated with poorer 30-day mortality.This randomized, prospective study based on individualized Oxygen dynamics is designed to confirm this association.</brief_summary>
