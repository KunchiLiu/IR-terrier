	<brief_summary>Obesity and gum diseases are highly prevalent in all parts of the world. Obesity can negatively influence severity and progression rates of gum diseases. Presence of fat in the body determines a general systemic state of inflammation. On the other hand, when gum diseases are successfully treated systemic and local inflammation decrease. In addition reductions in glycemic blood levels are also observed after treatment. Periodontitis is one type of gum disease that is associated with bone loss. It could be treated within 24 hours by using a protocol, which combines dental debridement and mouthwash. This treatment protocol, named "one-stage full-mouth disinfection" works well in individuals of normal weight. However, there is no information whether it is effective in obese individuals or not. Also, it should be clarified if obesity influences response to periodontal treatment. This study hypothesized that obesity impair response to periodontal treatment. Therefore, the effects of the protocol "one-stage full-mouth disinfection" will be evaluated in obese individuals and normal weight controls. This evaluation will be based on the monitoring of several clinical, microbiological and biochemical parameters throughout 9 months. Participants will answer validated questionnaires to evaluate if treatment of gum disease would be able to improve individual's quality of life. Study population will be composed of 90 to 100 obese individuals (males or females; &gt; 18 years of age; smokers or non smokers; &gt; 12 natural teeth). Participants will be classified into 5 groups according to their body mass index in normal weight (n = 15 to 20); overweight (n = 15 to 20); obesity I (n = 15 to 20); obesity II (n = 15 to 20); obesity III (n = 15 to 20). Examinations will be performed before treatment and also 3, 6 and 9 months after treatment. This study will contribute to the knowledge on how obese individuals respond to this specific treatment protocol. Also, having normal weight individuals as controls the present study will contribute to a better understanding about obesity, in its different severities, influence on periodontal treatment.</brief_summary>
