	<brief_summary>This observational study evaluates peri-procedural results of the Niobe™ Remote Magnetic Navigation (RMN) ES system using the contact detection system (CDS) in patients undergoing standard of care radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation. The objective of this observational study is to confirm system performance of the CDS and that it does not alter pacing, electrocardiograms, or mapping during RF ablation procedures.</brief_summary>
