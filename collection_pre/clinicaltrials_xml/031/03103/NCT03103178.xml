	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present study is to advance in the knowledge of quality of life in patients with ILD by translating a ILD quality of life questionnaire. There are no specific tools validated in Spanish to evaluate the quality of life in patients with ILD, although these measures are useful for an comprensive evaluation of these patients. Patients with ILD have a significant impact on their health. If we improve our Knowledge of the different domains affected by the disease, and not only in the pathophysiological ones, we will be able to develop tools to improve their management.</brief_summary>
