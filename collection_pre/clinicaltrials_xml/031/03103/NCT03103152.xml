	<brief_summary>To demonstrate the acceptability and feasibility of recruitment to a randomised chemoprevention study of standard (300mg) or low dose (100mg) aspirin vs. placebo and/or Vitamin D3 vs. placebo in patients enrolled on an Active Surveillance programme for prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Examine the Effectiveness of Aspirin and/or Vitamin D3 to Prevent Prostate Cancer Progression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PROVENT study is a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled feasibility study to examine the clinical effectiveness of aspirin and/or Vitamin D3 to prevent disease progression in men on Active Surveillance for prostate cancer The main outcome measure of the trial is the rate of patient recruitment to a randomised chemoprevention study in men enrolled on an Active Surveillance programme for prostate cancer Secondary outcomes include the response to treatment as determined by serial multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate, biochemical disease progression and histological disease progression after 12 months of therapy and finally toxicity and/or allergy to both aspirin and Vitamin D3.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male subjects aged 16 years or over with an estimated life expectancy of more than three years 2. Willing and able to provide written informed consent 3. Corrected serum calcium &lt;2.65mmol/l 4. No previous treatment for prostate cancer (including surgery, hormone therapy, radiotherapy, cryotherapy) 5. All subjects must have had Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the prostate with targeted biopsy of any lesions identified 6. Histologically confirmed prostate cancer* following prostate biopsy (including at least 10 cores of prostate tissue) in men opting for Active Surveillance as their primary cancer therapy. *PROVENT Prostate Cancer Criteria for Inclusion: Gleason score 6 or 7 Clinical and radiological stage &lt;T3 Serum PSA ≤15.0 ng/ml Less than 10mm of cancer in a single core Patients must have undergone a multiparametric MRI deemed assessable by the local radiologist, and any lesions seen must have undergone targeted biopsy (transrectal or transperineal) within 12 months of study enrolment. 1. Previously treated prostate cancer (including radiotherapy, hormone therapy, brachytherapy or surgery) 2. Current enrolment in an investigational drug, device or other clinical research study or participation in such a study within 30 days of randomisation 3. Current daily use of aspirin or NSAIDs; or daily dietary supplements/medication containing more than 400 IU (10 micrograms per day) Vitamin D3; or chronic use (defined as &gt; 6 months continuous daily use) of either aspirin or replacement Vitamin D3 within two years of study enrolment 4. Current or previous use of 5α reductase inhibitors such as finasteride or dutasteride 5. Not willing to comply with the procedural requirements of this protocol including repeat prostate biopsies 6. Known allergy/sensitivity to or intolerance of aspirin, other salicylates or NSAIDs e.g. ibuprofen/ naproxen 7. Prior history of gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration, severe dyspepsia or inflammatory bowel disease 8. Haemophilia or other bleeding diatheses 9. Prior history of renal stone disease 10. Chronic renal disease (≥stage 4) 11. Known hypercalcaemia (corrected serum calcium &gt;2.65 mmol/l) or untreated hyperparathyroidism 12. Any bowel condition that would make repeat transrectal biopsy hazardous or difficult to perform e.g. rectourethral fistula, or prior bowel surgery such as abdominoperineal resection. 13. Any malignancy (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer) that has not been in complete remission for five years 14. Any serious coexistent medical condition that would make repeat prostate biopsy hazardous e.g. anticoagulation requiring continuous administration 15. Severe Asthma 16. G6PD deficiency 17. Preexisting macular degeneration 18. All contraindications to aspirin and Vitamin D3, including concomitant therapy with any medication that may interact with aspirin or Vitamin D3 (see section 4.10) 19. Regular consumption of alcohol units greater than the recommended daily limit of 34 units per day (men)</criteria>
