	<criteria>Participants must have a body mass index (BMI; weight in [Kilogram] kg divided by the square of height in meters) between 18.0 and 30.0 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2, extremes included, and a body weight not less than 50.0 kg, inclusive, at screening Participant must be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in the protocol Participant must have a blood pressure (after the participant is supine for 5 minutes) between 90 and 140 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) systolic, extremes included, and no higher than 90 mmHg diastolic. If blood pressure is out of range, 1 repeated assessment is permitted after an additional 5 minutes of rest Participants must have normal values for alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (less than or equal to [&lt;=]1.0 × upper limit of normal [ULN]) A female participant, except if postmenopausal, must have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (BetahCG) pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1 and Day 21 Participant has a history of current clinically significant medical illness including cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease (example: glucose6phosphatedehydrogenase deficiency), coagulation disorders, lipid abnormalities, significant pulmonary disease, including bronchospastic respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal insufficiency, thyroid disease, neurologic or psychiatric disease, infection, or any other illness, that in the investigator's and/or sponsor's medical monitor opinion should exclude the participant or that could interfere with the interpretation of the study results Participants with 1 or more of the following laboratory abnormalities at screening as defined by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) Adult Toxicity Table: [1] Serum creatinine grade 1 or greater (&gt;1.0 × [Upper Limit of Normal] ULN) [2] Hemoglobin grade 1 or greater (&lt;=10.5 grams per deciliter [g/dL]) [3] Platelet count grade 1 or greater (&lt;=99,999/ cubic millimeter [mm^3]) [4] Reticulocyte count (absolute) below the lower limit of laboratory normal range [5] Absolute neutrophil count grade 1 or greater (&lt;=1,500/mm^3) [6] Total bilirubin grade 1 or greater (&gt;1.0 × ULN) [7] Any other toxicity grade 2 or above, except for grade 2 elevations of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and/or cholesterol Participants with a history of uric acid kidney stones, conditions associated with elevated urinary uric acid excretion, participants with peptic ulcer disease or a history of peptic ulcer disease, or other contraindications for the use of probenecid Participants has any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (eg, compromise the wellbeing) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocolspecified assessments Participants with a history of clinically significant drug allergy such as, but not limited to, sulfonamides and penicillins, or drug allergy diagnosed in previous studies with experimental drugs</criteria>
