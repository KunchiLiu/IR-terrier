	<brief_summary>Self-efficacy refers to the perceived belief to cope effectively, by personal efforts, with challenging situations and problems (Bandura, 1977). Basic research has shown that increases in perceived self-efficacy can enhance the extinction of fear (Zlomuzica et al., 2015). This study is aimed at translating these findings into a useful clinical application to augment exposure-based treatment outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-efficacy Enhancement and Exposure Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the effects of self-efficacy enhancement on treatment outcome in patients with height phobia will be investigated. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following conditions: i) virtual reality exposure + self-efficacy enhancement; ii) virtual reality exposure + control intervention; iii) virtual reality exposure only. The amount of exposure is identical across groups (i.e. maximum of 1 hour of exposure). The self-efficacy and the control intervention involve the retrieval of the exposure session with or without a focus on personal mastery experiences/achievements, respectively. Treatment-induced changes as well as the effects of self-efficacy enhancement will be measured on the subjective level (i.e. in-vivo Behavioral Approach Tests, BATs; church tower), physiological level (heart rate during the BATs), and subjective level (subjective fear during the BATs as well as height-phobia related questionnaires) at each of the three assessments (i.e. pretreatment, after which the exposure will conducted on the same day, i.e. day 1; posttreatment, which is scheduled approximately 2-3 days after exposure, and follow-up assessment, which will take place 1-month after exposure).</detailed_description>
