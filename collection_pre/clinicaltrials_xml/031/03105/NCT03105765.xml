	<brief_summary>Chronic Pain, especially neuropathic pain, are adverse events after posterolateral thoracotomy for lung resection. The continuous application of ketamine may have a prophylactic effect and helps to prevent chronic pain. The investigators record the incidence and severity of acute pain and neuropathic pain during a seven day period after thoracotomy as well as the incidence of chronic pain and neuropathic pain after one and three month period. Parallel Group design, comparing one Group with a continuous application (24 hours) of ketamine against a Placebo Group.</brief_summary>
