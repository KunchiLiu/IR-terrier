	<brief_summary>This study will enroll approximately 50 adult subjects who have relapsed or refractory (r/r) iNHL to be infused with the study treatment, axicabtagene ciloleucel, to see if their disease responds to this experimental product and if this product is safe. Axicabtagene ciloleucel is made from the subjects own white blood cells which are genetically modified and grown to fight cancer. An objective response rate of 70% is targeted.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Multicenter Study of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (iNHL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will enroll approximately 50 adult subjects who have relapsed or refractory (r/r) iNHL to be infused with the study treatment, axicabtagene ciloleucel, to see if their disease responds to this experimental product and if this product is safe. Axicabtagene ciloleucel is made from the subjects own white blood cells which are genetically modified and grown to fight cancer. An objective response rate of 70% is targeted. All enrolled subjects will be screened for eligibility then will undergo leukapheresis to collect white blood cells for manufacturing. In preparation for the infusion with axicabtagene ciloleucel, subjects will undergo conditioning chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine for 3 days to help the study treatment be effective. After the product is manufactured and conditioning chemotherapy period is complete, subjects will be infused with axicabtagene ciloleucel and then monitored in a hospital for a minimum of 7 days. Subjects will be followed by their study doctor for continued monitoring of the safety and effectiveness of the study treatment for approximately 3 months after receiving treatment and then will be followed for safety for up to an additional 3 Â½ years.</detailed_description>
