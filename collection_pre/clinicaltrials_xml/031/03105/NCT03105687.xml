	<brief_summary>By conducting the SPPA trial we try to find out, whether personalized Short Message Service (SMS) reminders of blood pressure-lowering medication can effectively increase patients' adherence to blood pressure-lowering medication. Additionally, we also evaluate their effect on patients' systolic blood pressure control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of SMS Reminders of Blood Pressure-lowering Drugs Intake</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension belongs to the main risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, which are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world and in the Slovak Republic. Despite the availability of effective antihypertensive treatment, blood pressure control remains a serious problem. Poor adherence to blood pressure-lowering medication is considered to be the key factor for uncontrolled blood pressure. Studies estimate the overall adherence to medication in patients with chronic diseases at around 50%. Slovak studies report even significantly lower adherence rates (15-19%), which underlines the urgency to address this health problem in the Slovak Republic. The majority of interventions aimed at increasing patients' adherence are associated with substantial costs and health care professionals capacity, both lacking in the current Slovak health care system. Several studies have shown the efficiency of SMS reminders to improve patients' adherence and health outcomes at very low cost. Since mobile phones are frequently used among Slovak inhabitants and SMS messages are a popular mean of communication, this approach could be feasible also in Slovakia. Pharmacists are highly trained drug experts who have the knowledge, skills and time to address patients' nonadherence using a simple SMS reminder system. Thus, our research question is as follows: Do personalized daily SMS reminders of blood pressure-lowering medication intake provided by pharmacists in addition to standard Pharmaceutical Care reduce the proportion of nonadherence to blood pressure-lowering medication among older ambulatory patients with hypertension in Slovakia? And we hypothesize that personalized daily SMS reminders of blood pressure-lowering medication intake provided by pharmacists in addition to standard Pharmaceutical Care increase the proportion of adherence to blood pressure-lowering medication among older ambulatory patients with hypertension in Slovakia from 30% to 49% in the intervention group compared to the control group.</detailed_description>
