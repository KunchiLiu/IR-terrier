	<brief_summary>Intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine during procedure was known to be associated prolonged duration of spinal anesthesia. In patients receiving dexmedetomidine infusion during procedure, it has been not evaluated whether use of adjuvant intrathecal fentanyl had additional prolonging effect on duration of spinal anesthesia or not. Therefore, we planned this trial to compare clinical outcomes in patients receiving spinal anesthesia with heavy bupivacaine only and heavy bupivacaine plus fentanyl adjuvant.</brief_summary>
