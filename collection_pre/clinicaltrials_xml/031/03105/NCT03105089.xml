	<brief_title>Effect of Cardiac Preconditioning Upon the Inotrope Score</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preconditioning (PC) of the heart occurs when brief exposure to a stimulus protects the heart from subsequent ischemia. PC stimulus may be ( ischemic ;pharmacologic or Physical) Pharmacological pc may be induced by variable agents e.g. (Sevoflurane ;isoflorane, opioids etc ) Ischemic pc includes local ;remote and the idea is temporary interruption of blood supply to the organ so that liberation of protective mediators occurs The liberated mediators have favorable effects not only upon the myocardium But ;it extend to protect other organs against inflammatory activation ;ischemia reperfusion injury Inotropic score IS is already an evident predictor of postoperative cardiac mobidity and mortality</detailed_description>
