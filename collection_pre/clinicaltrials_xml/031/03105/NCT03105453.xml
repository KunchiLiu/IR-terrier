	<brief_title>The Microbiome in Subfertility and Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of this study is to learn more about which microbial spectra are negatively or positively impacting IVF pregnancy outcome. This information is needed before proceeding to the next step in which an adaptation of the microbiome can be attempted to improve IVF outcome. The study is expected to shed light over the possible influence of the microbiome on causes for subfertility, endometrial receptivity and obstetrical complications. A diagnostic link may be found with entities that are often unexplained today, e.g. (recurrent) miscarriage and repeated implantation failure.</detailed_description>
