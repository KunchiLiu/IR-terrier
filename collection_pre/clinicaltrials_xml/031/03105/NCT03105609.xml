	<brief_title>Enhancing the Lucentis (Ranibizumab) Management of Choroidal Neovascular Membranes With Hyperspectral Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observational trial of patients with choroidal neovascular membranes treated with Lucentis. Exploration and validation of a new form of retinal imaging called hyperspectral imaging. Inclusion: Patients meet eligibility criteria other than FFA diagnosis and who are diagnosed with suspected exudative CNV on the OCT. (n=100 eyes) Procedure: Monthly doses of Lucentis. OCT scans will be taken prior to each injection. HSI image taken at baseline and at the 9-month time point. Time frame: 6 months recruitment + 12 months follow-up + 6 months analysis. All recruited patients will receive monthly doses of Lucentis as per the CMBS-approved protocol to allow comparison with other published studies. Lucentis will be administered in accordance with published standards of practice. OCT scans will be taken prior to each injection. HSI image will be taken at baseline, three months and 9-month time points</detailed_description>
