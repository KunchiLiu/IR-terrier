	<brief_summary>This study will examine how anaesthetic technique affects ECT outcomes. Specifically, the investigators will examine how: 1) the time interval between anaesthetic and ECT stimulus, and 2) the ventilation rate before ECT stimulus, impacts on the quality of the EEG (this is a recording of brain activity during ECT and is used to judge the quality of a seizure and to guide individual patient dosing).</brief_summary>
