	<brief_summary>This study aims to describe hallucinations prevalence in a sample of patients affected by Parkinson's disease and consulting in an outpatient facility. An unique one hour interview will be offered to volunteers patients. Patients participating to the study will be asked to answer a semi-structured questionnaire searching for hallucinations of all modalities, minor psychotic symptoms and delusions. Psychometric scales will be assessed to search for depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment and specific personality characteristics. The study hypothesis is that hallucinations prevalence in Parkinson's disease is underestimated and is higher than usually described in the scientific literature when all hallucinations modalities and minor hallucinatory phenomenons are searched for.</brief_summary>
