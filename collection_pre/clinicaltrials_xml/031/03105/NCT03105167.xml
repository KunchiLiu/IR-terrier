	<brief_summary>Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) had been favorable for effectively decrease pain and disability in specific spinal disorders; however, there has been concern regarding pedicle screw placement during TLIF surgery. Recently, several biomechanical studies had demonstrated that CBT technique achieves screw purchase and strength equivalent to or greater than the traditional method. Furthermore, Only 1 report examined the surgical outcomes of TLIF with CBT screws fixation compared with TLIF using traditional pedicle screws fixation. TLIF with CBT screws fixation may be effective for specific spinal disorders, but the evidence supporting this possibility is still limited.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods and analysis: Blinded Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) will be conducted. A total of 108 participants will be randomly allocated to either a CBT-TLIF group or a PS-TLIF group at a ratio of 1:1. The primary clinical outcome measures are: change in back and lower limb pain with Visual analogue scale (VAS) and change in quality adjusted life years (QALY) will be assessed by EQ-5D-5L. Measurements will be carried out at five fixed time points (pre-operatively and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months). Ethics and dissemination: The study had been reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the Second affiliated hospital of the Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China(batch:2017-03). The results will be presented in peer-reviewed journals and related website within 2 years after the last operation.</detailed_description>
