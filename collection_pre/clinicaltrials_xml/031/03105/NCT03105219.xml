	<brief_title>IvaBradinE to Treat MicroalbumiNuria in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, investigator-initiated study with a parallel design. Patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease who are microalbuminuric [urinary albumin excretion (UAE): 30-500 mg/day], will be randomized after informed consent, in a 1:1 ratio to the following treatment groups: Group Α: Ivabradine 5mg twice a day (on day 0), heart rate evaluated at day 14 and 28 repeatedly, and the targeted value of heart rate 50-60bpm, the largest dosage 7.5mg twice a day. Group Β: Placebo. Urinary albumin excretion (UAE) assessment will be performed before randomization (Day 0), 28-day after randomization (Day 28), and 90-day after randomization (Day 28).</detailed_description>
