	<brief_summary>To balance the oncological safety and cosmetic outcome is the basic principle of modern breast surgery. To preserve the nipple-areolar complex shows attractive cosmetic advantage but concerns regarding local recurrence make the oncological safety of nipple sparing mastectomy a controversial issue. Since the involvement of areolar pigmented skin by cancer is rare compared to that of nipple, we designed the current study to investigate the oncological safety and cosmetic outcome of Areola Sparing Mastectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Oncological Safety and Cosmetic Outcome of Areola Sparing Mastectomy : a Single Arm, Prospective, Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary breast cancer originated from areolae is rare. We hypothesized that nipple and areola are two separate anatomy tissue and have different oncological impact on the treatment of breast cancer. Areola Sparing Mastectomy (ASM) is a innovative procedure that involves of removal of nipple and preservation of areola the pigmented skin of which would improve the cosmetic outcome of mastectomy and lead to a illusion of congenital crater nipple in some patients.</detailed_description>
