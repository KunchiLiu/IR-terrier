	<brief_title>Groin Wound Infection Rate Using Prevena Compared to Standard Dressing in Vascular Surgery Patients With High Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients submitted to bilateral femoral endarterectomy will have one groin dressed with PrevenaTM and the contralateral one dressed with conventional bandage immediately after suture. Both PrevenaTM and the conventional bandage at the contralateral side will be removed before the patient discharge. Groin wound complications such as deep space infection, cutaneous cellulitis, dehiscence or re-interventions for wound-related complications will be observed in a 30-day evaluation window. This observation will be performed during the patient admission and in the post-operative standard of care visits among the first 30 days.</detailed_description>
