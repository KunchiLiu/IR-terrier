	<brief_summary>The anatomy of the acetabulum is well described in the past literature, yet the understanding of the clinical importance of the anatomical morphology of the AIIS has grown in recent years. Hetsroni et al. (2013) proposed a morphological classification of AIIS. In this classification, three types AIIS are identified based on the relationship between the distal extension of the acetabular rim and the AIIS. Unfortunately classifying the morphology of the AIIS using standard AP pelvis examination is misleading and requires additional imagery, a specific radiographic projection - false profile pelvis or 3d imaging techniques such as CT or MRI. The objective of this study is to evaluate AIIS morphology using ultrasound as compared to golden standard (MRI)</brief_summary>
