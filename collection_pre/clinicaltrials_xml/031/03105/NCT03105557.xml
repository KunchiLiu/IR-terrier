We hypothesise that the urine collecting device as presented in this protocol is less invasive and has good functional abilities to collect urine in these newborns Objective of the study: Clinical feasibility of the urine collection device, indicated by staff and parents. Study design: The study will be an open label, clinical feasibility study, of the urine collection device. During a period of 6 months, 30 feasibility tests will be performed.
