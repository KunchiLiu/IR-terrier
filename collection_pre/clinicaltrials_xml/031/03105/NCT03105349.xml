	<criteria>Adults with chronic HCV genotype 1, 4 infection with or without HIV infection aged 18 years or above HCV RNA plasma concentration of at least 1000 IU / mL Subjects previously treated with NS5Abased regimens for at least 8 weeks. Patients with HCV relapse after receiving a complete treatment with NS5Abased AAD regimen for at least 8 weeks and becoming undetectable at the end of treatment. Relapse is defined as a confirmed HCV RNA detectable upon completion of therapy of A5 based on NS5A against HCV. Subjects with compensated hepatic cirrhosis (Child A) could be included. For patients with HIV coinfection: Be infected with HIV1, documented by any rapid HIV test with the corresponding license and confirmed by a Western blot or second antibody test using a method other than the initial rapid HIV and / or I / CIA method or by HIV1 p24 antigen or viral load of HIV1 RNA plasma. Be on stable HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least 4 weeks prior to entry into the study using a dual ITN backbone of tenofovir or abacavir and emtricitabine or lamivudine PLUS raltegravir or dolutegravir or rilpivirine (with CD4 + T cell count&gt; 100 cells / mm 3 and undetectable HIV1 RNA at baseline. Results from prior analysis will be accepted within 24 weeks prior to study entry). Subjects with hepatitis other than C or steatosis. Subjects previously treated less than 8 weeks with regimens based on NS5A. Evidence of previous hepatocellular carcinoma although it has criteria of cure Subjects with past or current decompensated liver disease; Only decompensated patients who have received a liver transplant and have not decompensated after transplantation will be included. Subjects suspected of clinical or genotypic reinfection of HCV. Subject with HCV response regrowth while receiving NS5Abased ADA therapy against HCV. Said regrowth is defined as a confirmation of detectable HCV RNA after achieving undetectable HCV RNA during NS5Abased AADs against HCV. Recent history of drug or alcohol abuse. Important comorbidities. Pregnant, lactating or nonlactating women Contraceptives, if they are women of childbearing age. Women of childbearing age are defined as those women who have not undergone permanent infertility procedures or who have been amenorrheic for less than 12 months. Subjects with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 ml / min.</criteria>
