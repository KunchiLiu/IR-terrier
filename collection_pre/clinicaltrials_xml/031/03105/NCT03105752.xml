	<brief_summary>Prior to the completion of biomedical research, any person undergoing it must receive a readable and intelligible information about this research, in order to give free and informed consent. The willingness to inform patients of all risks and constraints related to research may be in contradiction with the need to write informative and concise documents that are understandable to research participants. As a result, consent forms are long, contain a lot of information and are complicated to understand. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the readability of the information and consent forms on the understanding of the information received by participants in clinical trials.</brief_summary>
