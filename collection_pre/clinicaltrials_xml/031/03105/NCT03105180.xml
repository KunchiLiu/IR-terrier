	<brief_summary>Irrigating fluid absorbed during the endoscopic surgery may alter whole blood coagulation. However, little is known about the dose-response relationships of hemodilution. The investigators have therefore performed the present study to measure the effect of a mixture of 2.7% sorbitol-0.54% mannitol solution on the coagulation pathway according to the hemodilution level using a rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEMÂ®) tests.</brief_summary>
