	<brief_summary>Patients with panel reactive antibodies have many difficulties to find a crossmatch-negative kidney for transplantation and are at the risk of post transplantation rejection more than other transplanted patients. We evaluated the effect of simvastatin on PRA and post transplant outcome of these sensitized patients. We also performed a descriptive study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Simvastatin on Desensitization of Panel-Positive Kidney Transplant Candidates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The presence of panel reactive antibodies (PRAs) in the sera of renal transplant candidates is associated with hyperacute or delayed humoral immune responses against the graft after transplantation . In addition, these sensitized patients wait for a long time to find a cross-match negative kidney for renal transplantation . As a result, some modalities have been used for desensitization including plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in combination with immunosuppressive drugs . However, recently, the use of statins such as simvastatin, pravastatin and etc. has been proposed to be safer and more effective for desensitization .</detailed_description>
