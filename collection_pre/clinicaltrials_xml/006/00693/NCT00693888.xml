	<brief_summary>The Geriatric Center Ulm scientifically supported a three-year pilot study (ProjektDEMENZ Ulm), in which numerous findings on the system of care regarding people suffering from dementia and their relatives were determined. One of the most important conclusions is the significant lack of information on the well-functioning network of the care system in Ulm. The full potential of the network is not being exploited. The situation in the Alb-Donau-Kreis - the area surrounding Ulm - is very similar. The investigators' aim is to improve the utilization of the system of care for those suffering from dementia in Ulm/Alb-Donau-Kreis by using a newly designed advisory approach (Lighthouse Project on Dementia, Ulm, ULTDEM study). The purpose of the study is to prove the effectiveness of this procedure by using a prospective, open, randomized, controlled, interventional study. After the randomization, the interventional group is given comprehensive, individual advice about available treatment possibilities for people suffering from dementia. In addition, they have the opportunity to re-evaluate their present diagnostic procedure. The participants of the control group receive the standard treatment. Inclusion criterion is the application of a care level ( level 0 or 1). Recruitment will take one year. A final assessment will be taken every six months.</brief_summary>
