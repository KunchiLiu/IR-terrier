	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To show an improvement in HbA1c control after 4 months of treatment with insulin glargine + Oral Anti Diabetic (OAD) in patients previously uncontrolled on premixed insulin (with OAD) Secondary objective: Improvement of Fasting blood glucose (FPG) after 4 months treatment (% of patients treated to target HbA1c ≤7.0% and/or FBG≤6.0mmol/L). Frequency of hypoglycemic episodes, quality of life with basal+ OAD regimen.</brief_summary>
