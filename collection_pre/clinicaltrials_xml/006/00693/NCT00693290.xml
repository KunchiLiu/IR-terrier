	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis The overall aim of this study is to compare two bowel preparations that are used prior to a colonoscopy procedure. The principal research questions are: 1. Does the use of a low residue diet increase patient concordance to the bowel preparation instructions? 2. Does the use of a low residue diet decrease the adequacy of assessment of the mucosa? 3. Does the use of a low residue diet increase the willingness of patients to undertake repeated examination as is required for disease followâˆ’up? 4. Does body weight affect perceived tolerability of either group?</brief_summary>
