	<brief_summary>Adequate platelet inhibition before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) reduces peri-procedural and long-term ischemic complications. Documented reduced response to clopidogrel has been associated with subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events. Strategies to optimize platelet inhibition pre-PCI are under investigation. This study sought to evaluate the effect on platelet aggregation of four different dosing regimens of clopidogrel given before elective PCI.</brief_summary>
