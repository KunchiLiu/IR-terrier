	<brief_summary>The goals of this study are to describe the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of MEDI-517 with and without adjuvant in HPV-naïve humans. Long-term immune data is collected. This study was originally performed by MedImmune. However, GSK is now responsible for the clinical development of the HPV vaccine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity Study of MEDI-517 (GSK 580299) With or Without Adjuvant in Healthy Adult Females</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II, double-blind, randomized, comparative trial of three formulations of MEDI-517 given at 0, 30, and 180 days by intramuscular injection. The volunteers in this study will be healthy females 18 through 30 years of age. The study collects safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity data of MEDI-517 with and without adjuvant. Extended follow-up will provide long-term immune response data.</detailed_description>

Other abnormal laboratory values in the screening panel which in the opinion of the principal investigator are judged to be clinically significant Receipt of immunoglobulin or blood products within 90 days prior to study entry History of abnormal Pap smear (other than a single prior report of ASCUS or indeterminate Pap smear with a subsequent normal report) Genital herpes disease involving the cervix or with disease characterized on examination or by history by extensive external lesions. Volunteers with a history of recurrent genital herpes disease characterized by limited external lesions are eligible to participate in the study. Positive tests for hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or HIV1 antibody Any prior receipt of any vaccine (experimental or otherwise) for treatment or prophylaxis of genital warts or other papillomavirus related condition. Any treatment of genital warts or other papillomavirus related condition within 6 months of randomization (local therapy for common skin and/or plantar warts is allowed) Previous administration of any components of the investigational vaccine Receipt of any experimental vaccine within 90 days prior to entry into this study Receipt of any experimental drug therapy within 30 days or five halflives of the experimental drug (if the halflife is known), whichever is longer</criteria>
