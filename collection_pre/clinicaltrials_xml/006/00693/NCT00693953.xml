	<brief_summary>Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder will have abnormal DESAÂ® results. Our objective is to use neuroelectrical measures to determine the degree of processing abnormalities in individuals with Autism. The study will survey processing patterns and will locate and evaluate the degree(s) of abnormalities for further study. The abnormal results of comprehensive neuroelectrical evaluations of individuals with Autism when compared to the normative database will provide objective, verifiable, neurophysiological information with which to form novel approaches to the disorder.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research method will be: gathering, analyzing and utilizing data. We will observe research subjects through neuroelectrical instrumentation, then, compare results to retrospective information collected from research subjects and a normative database. A qualified neurologist thoroughly familiar with electrophysiology will interpret the data, and analyze it to explore the abnormalities. The hypothesis will be evaluated. We will, then, utilize the results to find data-based forms of treatment for those with the disorder.</detailed_description>
