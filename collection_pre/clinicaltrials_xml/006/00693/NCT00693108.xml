	<brief_summary>it has been shown that androgens in non human primates may favour follicular growth in the ovaries when animals are treated with gonadotropins which are the hormones used in patients receiving treatment with in vitro fertilization. Therefore, this study investigates the potential usefulness of testosterone treatment preceding gonadotropin administration in in vitro fertilization patients having a previous poor response to gonadotropins alone.</brief_summary>
