	<brief_summary>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus suffer from accelerated coronary artery disease. We will assess the effects of exercise training on coronary endothelial function, vascular structure, and inflammation both in serum and skeletal muscle biopsies, as well as expression of diabetes candidate genes.</brief_summary>
