	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase II study is to provide data regarding the safety and immunogenicity for a range of dose levels of MEDI-517 in women who are HPV-16/18 seronegative and negative for high-risk HPV DNA. The study is designed to evaluate safety and immunogenicity data for MEDI-517 when formulated with either AS04 or aluminum hydroxide. Extended follow-up will provide long-term immune response data. This study was originally performed by MedImmune. However, GSK is now responsible for the clinical development of the HPV vaccine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Comparison Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of MEDI-517 (GSK 580299) in Healthy Adult Females</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II double-blind, randomized, dose-comparison, multicenter study in the United States of three different dose levels of MEDI-517 (HPV-16/18 VLP AS04 vaccine) and one dose of MEDI-517 formulated with aluminum hydroxide, with doses administered at 0, 30 and 180 days. Healthy female volunteers 18 through 30 years of age will be entered into 4 treatment arms. The objectives of study are to evaluate reactogenicity, safety and immunogenicity.</detailed_description>
