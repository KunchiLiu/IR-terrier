	<brief_summary>Prospective randomized study of allogeneic minitransplantation from HLA-identical family or unrelated donors comparing unmanipulated or CD8-depleted PBSC. The conditioning regimen will be 2 Gy TBI alone (related donor with low-risk of transplant rejection) or 2 Gy TBI and 3 x 30 mg/m2 fludarabine (unrelated donor or high risk of transplant rejection). Patients will receive a short but intensive immunosuppressive treatment (cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil) to ensure both graft-versus-host and host-versus-graft tolerance. The rationale for using PBSC instead of marrow transplant is to avoid general anesthesia of the donor and to minimize the risk of rejection. The rationale for CD8+ depletion is to diminish the risk of GVHD after PBSC transplantation or DLI.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients 1.1. Diseases Malignant diseases confirmed histologically and not rapidly progressing: Hematologic malignancies AML; ALL; CML and other myeloproliferative disorders; MDS; Multiple myeloma; CLL; NonHodgkin's lymphoma; Hodgkin's disease. Nonhematologic malignancies Renal cell carcinoma (metastatic). 1.2. Inclusion criteria Male or female; female patients must use a reliable contraception method; Age lower than 70 yrs (family donor) or lower than 65 yrs (unrelated donor); HIV negative; No terminal organ failure; No uncontrolled infection, arrhythmia or hypertension; Family donor (HLAidentical) or unrelated donor (matched for AB by low resolution typing and for DRB1DQB1 by high resolution typing); No previous radiation therapy precluding the use of 2 Gy TBI Informed consent given by patient or his/her guardian if of minor age. 1.3. Clinical situations Theoretical disease indication for a standard allotransplant, but not feasible because: Age &gt; 55 yrs; Unacceptable end organ performance; Patient's refusal. Indication for a standard autotransplant: perform miniallotransplantation 26 months after standard autotransplant. Not an indication for intensification but a potential candidate for cellular immunotherapy. 2. Donors 2.1. Inclusion criteria Related to the recipient (sibling, parent or child) or unrelated; Male or female; Weight &gt; 15 Kg (because of leukapheresis); HIV negative; No major contraindication for allogeneic PBSC donation by generally accepted criteria; Informed consent given by donor or his/her guardian if of minor age. 2.2. Exclusion criteria Any condition not fulfilling inclusion criteria; Unable to undergo leukapheresis because of poor vein access or other reasons.</criteria>
