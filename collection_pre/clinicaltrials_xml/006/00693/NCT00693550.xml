	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Gathering information about allergies to metals may help doctors learn whether having an allergy to metal used in dental work increases the risk of developing oral cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying contact allergies to dental metal as a possible risk factor for oral cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Contact Allergies to Dental Metal as a Possible Risk Factor for Oral Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Identify the relationship between intraoral metal contact allergy and epithelial carcinogenesis in patients with newly or previously diagnosed intraoral squamous cell carcinoma. - Compare the prevalence of metal contact allergy in these patients with control data from other existing study populations. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. - Participants undergo metal patch testing using 27 metals* commonly used in dental repairs that are part of the Mayo metal series. Metal patches are applied to the patient's back for 3 days and the back is read on days 3 and 5. Relevant patient data obtained from their medical and dental history, physical exam, laboratory values and treatment are documented. NOTE: *Healthy volunteers (control) undergo metal patch testing using 8 metals most commonly positive for contact allergens.</detailed_description>
