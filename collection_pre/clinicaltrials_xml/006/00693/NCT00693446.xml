	<brief_summary>Experience with tacrolimus in pancreas transplantation has become a standard for immunosuppression in almost all pancreas centers over the world. Several centers have shown very good results in simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant recipients receiving antithymocyte globulin induction and maintenance immunosuppression consisting of calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolate mofetil with or without corticosteroids. The use of sirolimus in SPK transplant patients has for the moment only been studied, with good results, in association with tacrolimus or cyclospsorine (CsA). In renal transplantation, there is also evidence that sirolimus (Rapamune) is a potent immunosuppressant that significantly reduces the incidence of acute rejection when given with CsA, effective as base therapy in the post-induction period. Because of Rapamune's effectiveness and different safety profile, it might be advantageous in terms of reduced nephrotoxicity to avoid completely calcineurin inhibitors without increased incidence of acute rejection. To explore this further, the following study is designed to assess the use of SRL versus TAC, both treatment groups including rATG plus MMF and a 3-month course of steroids in de novo simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant recipients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study To Compare Sirolimus Versus Tacrolimus In De Novo Simultaneous Pancreas- Kidney Allograft Recipients Receiving An Induction Therapy With Antithymocyte Globulin Plus Mycophenolate Mofetil Plus Corticosteroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective is to compare renal and pancreas graft survivals at 12 months after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation in patients receiving either a regimen combining sirolimus (SRL) plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) following an antibody induction (rATG) or a regimen combining tacrolimus (TAC) plus mycophenolate mofetil following an antibody induction (rATG). In both regimens corticosteroids (CS) will be withdrawn three months after transplantation. In addition, the two treatment groups will be compared for acute rejection, renal and pancreas functions and patient survival after transplantation at 12 months and for a total period of 5 years of follow-up.</detailed_description>
