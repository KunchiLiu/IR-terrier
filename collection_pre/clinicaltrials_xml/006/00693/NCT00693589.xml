	<brief_summary>Endothelial dysfunction is an early marker of atherosclerosis and is found in patients (pts) with coronary (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Statin-therapy has been shown to improve endothelial function in pts with CAD or PAD by reducing LDL-cholesterol and inflammatory markers. B-group vitamin-supplements have variable been reported to have positive or neutral effects on endothelial function. Therefore, we want to compare the effect of rosuvastatin and B-group vitamin supplementation on endothelial function of the forearm resistance vessels in pts with cardiovascular disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Homocysteine-Lowering Therapy With Folic Acid, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin B6 on Endothelium-Dependent Vasodilatation of Forearm Resistance Vessels in Patients With Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design: 36 pts with CAD or PAD are randomly assigned to either rosuvastatin 10mg/d or vitamin supplementation with folic acid 1mg, vitamin B12 0.4mg and B6 10mg/d for 6 weeks in a double-blinded design. After 6 weeks all pts receive rosuvastatin and vitamin supplementation in combination for additional 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
