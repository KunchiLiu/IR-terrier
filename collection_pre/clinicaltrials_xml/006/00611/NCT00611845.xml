	<brief_summary>This is a special access protocol that will allow physicians access to aprotinin during the temporary marketing suspension. The program will provide aprotinin for treatment of surgical patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) who are at increased risk of bleeding and transfusion when, in the opinion of the treating physician, the patients require it, there is no acceptable alternative therapy, and when there is a clearly favorable benefit-risk for the drug in that individual patient.</brief_summary>
