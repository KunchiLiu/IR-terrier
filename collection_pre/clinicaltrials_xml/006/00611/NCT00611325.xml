	<brief_summary>Primary Objective To estimate 6-month progression free survival probability of patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme treated with bortezomib plus Avastin. This efficacy assessment will be made separately among patients on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs and non enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs. Secondary Objectives To evaluate safety &amp; tolerability of bortezomib plus Avastin among patients with recurrent malignant glioma. To evaluate radiographic response, progression free survival &amp; overall survival of patients with recurrent malignant glioma treated with bortezomib plus Avastin</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Avastin + Bortezomib for Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, 2-arm Phase II study assessing safety &amp; efficacy of bortezomib in combination with Avastin for patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (gbm). 56 total patients with recurrent WHO grade IV malignant gliomas have been enrolled on study. Avastin was administered intravenously at a dose of 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Bortezomib was administered on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, &amp; 32 of a 42-day cycle. The dose of bortezomib was 1.7 mg/m2 for non-EIAED patients &amp; 2.5 mg/m2 for EIAED patients. Treatment continued until either evidence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance with study follow-up / withdrawal of consent. Brain MRIs were obtained after every cycle. Bortezomib administration is associated with mild toxicity in most patients, such as fatigue, diarrhea &amp; nausea, constipation &amp; peripheral neuropathy. Less common, bortezomib administration leads to more significant hematologic toxicities &amp; peripheral neuropathies. Most significant toxicities associated with Avastin in recently completed phase II clinical trial at Duke were thrombotic complications &amp; grade 2 proteinuria. "Unacceptable" toxicities rates of 15 percent or less were considered desirable, while rates of 40 percent or greater were considered undesirable. The statistical hypothesis that needed testing differentiated between 15% &amp; 40% rate of unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
