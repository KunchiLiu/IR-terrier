	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a post-approval, prospective, non-randomized, longitudinal, unmasked, multi-center, clinical trial designed to evaluate the longer-term safety and effectiveness of the BHR system. The data collected will permit clinical evaluation for the device performance in improving hip pain, function and range of motion through ten years. The study will permit radiographic evaluation of proper component fixation and alignment maintenance through 10 years post-operative. The incidence of revision is an especially important measure in this study. Data collected will allow analysis of the implant survivorship.</detailed_description>
