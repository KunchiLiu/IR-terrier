	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Drug-eluting and Bare Metal Stents in Bypass Graft Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large number of studies showed that drug-eluting stents significantly reduce in-stent restenosis and the subsequent need for target vessel revascularisation compared with bare metal stents. Although this applies to the vast majority of patients, intimal hyperplasia and in-stent restenosis have not been completely eliminated and remain to occur in certain high risk subgroups. While there is a plenty of data about the efficacy of DES in complex lesions or diabetics, no randomized data exist about the efficacy of DES in coronary artery bypass graft lesions.</detailed_description>
