	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to examine whether four different spices (ginger, black pepper, horseradish and mustard) are able to increase energy metabolism. Since chili and other spices have been shown to increase energy expenditure compared to placebo, we expect that some or all of the four spices may actually increase energy expenditure - although not to a large degree.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examination of the Effects of Four Different Spices on Energy Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several pungent food ingredients, such as chili,and also other bioactive food ingredients, e.g. green tea, have been shown to be able to increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation during the hours following a meal containing the bioactive ingredient. Furthermore, we will also look at the subjects own feelings of appetite and thereby examine whether the appetite is affected by the spicy food. We expect to see some small effects on these parameters.</detailed_description>
