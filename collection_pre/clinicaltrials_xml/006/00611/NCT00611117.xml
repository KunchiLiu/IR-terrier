	<brief_title>Mechanisms of the Effect of Physical Activity on the Adaptation to a High-Fat Diet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A high fat diet is linked to weight gain and obesity. An adjustment to the acute exposure to high fat diet is not abrupt and takes time. In a previous study from our laboratory, it has been shown that high level of physical activity can accelerate the adaptation to a high fat diet by increasing fat oxidation. In this study we will determine the mechanism involved in this adjustment. Our hypotheses are: 1. High fat diets decrease skeletal muscle glucose metabolism and decrease mitochondrial biogenesis through the upregulation of PDK4 and downregulation of PGC1Î±; increased physical activity will prevent these deleterious effects. 2. A high fat diet will increase hepatic and skeletal muscle lipid; increased physical activity will prevent these deleterious effects. 3. These effects are more pronounced in individuals with a low mitochondrial content</detailed_description>
