	<brief_summary>The standard treatment for rectal cancer is to receive the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with radiation therapy before having surgery to remove the rectal cancer. This is known as neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The purpose of this research study is to determine if Cetuximab improves the benefits of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy when given with 5-FU and radiation therapy. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, which is found in rectal cancer, is a specific part of the cancer that is felt to encourage tumor growth. Cetuximab targets and blocks the EGF receptor and has been shown to be safe and effective in treating colorectal cancer and head and neck cancers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Prior to the first dose of cetuximab, participants will undergo a sigmoidoscopy with biopsy for research purposes as well collection of blood samples. These tests will be repeated between days 16 and 21. - After treatment begins, participants will undergo the following every week; history and physical exam; vital signs; blood tests. - On treatment weeks 1, 2 and 3: cetuximab is given once a week. On weeks 4 through 9: cetuximab is given weekly; continuous infusion of 5-FU will begin on day 22; treatment with radiation therapy Monday through Friday. - It is recommended that the participant undergo surgery 4 to 8 weeks after completion of therapy to attempt to remove the tumor.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the rectum that begins within 15cm of the anal verge as determined by sigmoidoscopy and/or colonoscopy, with no evidence of distant metastatic disease. A complete colonoscopy to the cecum is recommended prior to initiating protocol therapy. Staging with transrectal ultrasound or endorectal coil MRI to confirm clinical stage of T3 or T4 or lymph node positive rectal adenocarcinoma Tumor is Kras wildtype by method of choice at respective institution (testing codons 12 and 13) Performance status: ECOG less than or equal to 2 18 years of age or older No evidence of metastatic disease by abdominal/pelvic CT and chest imaging Adequate bone marrow, renal,and hepatic function as outlined in protocol All patients will be evaluated by a surgeon and considered a candidate for definitive surgery Coumadin or heparin management for line care of other indications is permitted. The INR will be monitored weekly in patients taking coumadin. Prior treatment for this malignancy Prior history of pelvic radiation therapy Prior history of 5FU based or EGFR receptor inhibitor therapy Prior history of an allergic reaction to a monoclonal antibody Uncontrolled serious medical or psychiatric illness Significant history of uncontrolled cardiac disease Sexually active women of childbearing potential must use an effective method of birth control during the course of the study Unwilling to agree to pre and postcetuximab sigmoidoscopy and biopsy</criteria>
