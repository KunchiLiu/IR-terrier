	<brief_summary>Researchers are developing and experimentally evaluating two variants of a 10-episode, brief (12 minutes per episode), infotainment-style television series targeted at parenting practices, to determine the potential value of television for bringing evidence-based parenting practices to parents. The study compares an "information-only" version of the television series against an "enhanced" version that is designed to actively promote parents' adoption of the targeted strategies. Both versions of the series are compared against a waitlist control group. The media series is derived from the Triple P Positive Parenting Program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Video-Based Media Series to Promote Effective Parenting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mass media, and television in particular, hold significant potential as part of a population-wide strategy for bringing evidence-based parenting practices to a broad range of parents experiencing challenges raising their children. The potential of television for affecting parenting has received very little research attention, however; thus, little is known about how media messages to affect parenting practices might be optimally designed. This study will develop and experimentally evaluate two variants of a 10-episode, brief (12 minutes per episode), infotainment-style television series targeted at parenting practices, derived from the Triple Pâ€”Positive Parenting Program (Sanders, 1999). A sample of 300 families of children ages 3-6 years with somewhat elevated disruptive behavior problems will be randomized to (a) receive a standard "information-only" version of the series that includes only modeling and demonstration of target parenting skills, (b) receive an enhanced "behavior activation" version of the series designed to actively promote parental behavior change, through elements addressing attributions, self-efficacy and expectancies, social support, and emotional reactivity, or (c) a waitlist control group. Measures of parents' parenting practices, cognitions, affect, and social support, and children's disruptive behavior problems, will be obtained at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up. The relative efficacy of the standard and enhanced versions of the Triple P Media Series in improving these outcomes will be examined, as well as moderators of these effects, such as baseline level of behavior problems and parental stress. This study will further our understanding of the potential value of television programming for improving parenting practices.</detailed_description>
