	<brief_summary>In an effort to decrease the load of peroxides in TPN solutions, multiple studies examined different strategies such as photo-protection, adding multivitamins to the lipid emulsion rather than to the dextrose-amino acid admixture, and adding antioxidants such as glutathione to the TPN solution. However, the role of trace elements as antioxidants, and their interaction with light have not been studied. Also, the impact of TPN-related oxidants on clinical morbidities has not been addressed. Therefore, we aimed in this study of preterm infants to evaluate the role of different components of TPN on urinary peroxides and to examine the biochemical and clinical effects of light protection.</brief_summary>
