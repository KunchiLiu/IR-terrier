	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy at High Field</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is twofold. The first aim is to evaluate new MRI techniques developed by the investigators of this protocol on human volunteers. The second aim is to assist other investigators who need to use MR images obtained on this device for their own research. MR images and/or spectroscopy data will be acquired from the participants in this protocol.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Healthy normal volunteers for imaging protocol optimization. Patients with implanted surgical clips (hemostatic clips) or other ferromagnetic material, Patients engaged in occupations or activities which may cause accidental lodging of ferromagnetic materials, or who may have imbedded metal fragments from military activities, Patients with permanent (tattoo) eyeliner or with facial makeup (severe eye irritation has been reported), Patients with compromised thermoregulatory systems (e.g. certain cancer patients), Patients with metallic implants, because they may cause artifacts in diagnostic images due to magnetic field distortion, Patients with implanted prosthetic heart valves, Patients with pacemakers, neurostimulation devices, Pregnant patients (the safety of magnetic resonance examination has not been completely established for embryos and fetuses), Subjects who have received orthodontic work involving ferromagnetic materials, Subjects who have claustrophobia, and The patients unwilling to participate in the study or fail to sign the consent form. Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding will be excluded from the contrast enhanced MRI studies. Subjects who had allergic response to contrast agents previously will be excluded from contrast enhanced MRI studies. Subjects with known history of asthma, allergic conditions, severe renal insufficiency, sickle cell anemia, chronic hemolytic anemia, gastrointestinal disorders will also be excluded from contrast enhanced MRI studies.</criteria>
