	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Conor Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent System in the treatment of coronary artery disease (a single atherosclerotic lesion) in native coronary arteries. The study will evaluate the outcomes of a new drug-eluting stent compared to an approved drug-eluting stent. While Cordis made a business decision to no longer pursue NEVOâ„¢ development and commercialization, the patients will be followed up as per protocol. This includes performing all protocol required follow-up visits and the collection and reporting of all safety information.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of the Conor Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent to the Taxus Liberte Paclitaxel-eluting Coronary Stent in the Treatment of Coronary Artery Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Restenosis remains a frequent cause of late failure following successful coronary angioplasty occurring in an estimated 20-40% of procedures performed. Coronary stents provide mechanical scaffolding that helps reduce restenosis by limiting the extent of elastic recoil and late vascular remodeling. Despite improvements over balloon angioplasty alone, restenosis following coronary stenting procedures has been cited to occur in 20-40% of cases and is primarily a result of neointimal hyperplasia. Thus, stents which are capable of delivering drugs to limit neointimal hyperplasia, in addition to providing mechanical support at the area of the lesion, have been developed to further limit the extent of restenosis following coronary stenting. There are several pharmacologic agents approved for use with drug-eluting stents.Two drugs have been widely studied in controlled clinical trials and real-world patient populations, sirolimus and paclitaxel. This study will evaluate a new sirolimus-eluting cobalt chromium coronary stent system compared to an approved paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system in the treatment of single de novo coronary lesions in native coronary arteries. Subjects meeting qualification will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to treatment with the Conor sirolimus-eluting coronary stent or to treatment with an approved paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent. All subjects will undergo angiographic follow-up at six months and complete clinical follow-up for a period of five years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>18 years of age or older Eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Diagnosis of stable or unstable angina or silent ischemia Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;30% The subject requires treatment of a single de novo lesion in a native coronary artery. Lesion to be treated is less than or equal to 28 mm in length in a vessel that is 2.53.5mm diameter. The target lesion diameter stenosis is &gt;50% and &lt;100% by visual estimate. The target lesion is a minimum of 10 mm distance from any previously treated segment of the target vessel. The subject understands the study requirements, is willing to comply with all study procedures and has provided written informed consent. The subject has undergone coronary revascularization to any vessel within 30 days. The subject has undergone target vessel revascularization within 6 months. Treatment of more than one qualifying lesion is required at the time of enrollment, or is planned within 30 days following enrollment. The subject has known sensitivity to sirolimus, paclitaxel, the polymeric matrices, stainless steel or cobalt chromium. There is planned treatment of the target lesion with any device other than the predilatation balloon angioplasty catheter. The subject had a myocardial infarction within 72 hours, or presents with CK elevation &gt; 2 times upper limit normal associated with elevated CKMB. The subject is in cardiogenic shock. The subject had a cerebrovascular accident within the past 6 months. The subject has acute or chronic renal dysfunction (defined as creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dl). The subject has a contraindication to aspirin or clopidogrel. The subject has thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3. The subject has had active gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 3 months. The subject has a known bleeding or hypercoagulable disorder. The subject has had prior anaphylactoid reaction to contrast agents or has contrast sensitivity that cannot be controlled with premedication. The subject is currently taking immunosuppressant therapy. The subject is currently, or has been treated wtih either Rapamune or paclitaxel within 12 months of the procedure. The subject is a female with a positive pregnancy test or is lactating. The subject has an active infection. The subject has comorbidities that could interfere wtih completion of study procedures, or life expectancy less than 24 months. The subject is participating in another investigational drug or device trial that has not completed the primary endpoint or would interfere with the endpoints of this study. Angiographic Exclusion Criteria Left main disease &gt;50% diameter stenosis. The target lesion is ostial. The target lesion or target vessel are severely calcified. The target lesion involves a bifurcation with diseased branch vessel greater than or equal to 2.0 mm that would require intervention or protection. The target lesion has TIMI o or TIMI I flow. Angiographic evidence of thrombus. The target vessel has had prior stent placement. The patient has had prior coronary brachytherapy. There is angiographic restenosis of any previously treated segment of the target vessel, or atherosclerotic area wtih &gt;50% diameter stenosis outside of the target lesion. The subject has undergone prior CABG.</criteria>
