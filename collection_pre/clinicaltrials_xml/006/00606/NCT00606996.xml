	<brief_title>Group Therapy for Women Prisoners With Comorbid Substance Use and Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Incarcerated women are a vulnerable and rapidly expanding population with high lifetime rates of both substance use disorder (SUD; abuse or dependence on alcohol, illegal drugs, or prescription drugs; 70%) and depressive disorder (DD; major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder; 20-27%). DDs tend to worsen the course of SUDs for incarcerated women by increasing their risk for suicide attempts, contributing to the persistence of substance abuse, and reducing the likelihood of a successful transition to an independent, sober life in the community. Recent evidence indicates that DDs are common in persons with SUDs, often do not remit with SUD treatment, and should be treated. Despite growing recognition that co-occurring disorders, such as DDs, among substance abusing incarcerated women present an important public health concern, integrated treatments for SUD-DD have not been well-developed for or systematically tested in this population. Group Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT-G) has been shown to be efficacious in treating DD in other populations and may be especially pertinent to the needs of incarcerated women with SUD-DD because interpersonal difficulties not only affect severity of depression, but are also strong predictors of drinking to cope, SUD relapse, and prison recidivism in women. This study tests the hypotheses that as adjuncts to prison SUD treatment, IPT-G, relative to psychoeducation on co-occurring disorders, will produce at least moderate effect sizes for: - Reduction in the risk and severity of substance use relapse after release from prison - Recovery from depressive disorder and reduction in depressive symptoms - Improvement in social support and interpersonal functioning - Reduction in the severity of legal problems during the 3 month follow-up period</detailed_description>
