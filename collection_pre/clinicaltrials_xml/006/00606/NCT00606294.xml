	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to evaluate low oxygen areas called hypoxia within tumors. These low oxygen areas are thought to be the reason why tumors are more resistant to chemotherapy and radiation treatment. An imaging technique using a hypoxia tracer called fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) can detect low oxygen areas within a tumor. This imaging technique, called a PET scan, uses positively charged particles to detect slight changes in the body's biochemistry and metabolism. FMISO PET scans have been performed in patients with head and neck cancer and have shown the ability to detect low oxygen areas within tumors.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 : Histologically confirmed diagnosis of head and neck carcinoma (excluding nasopharynx, paranasal sinus, salivary, and thyroid malignancies)Any unknown primary squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck with gross nodes is allowed (2002 AJCC) 18 years of age or older Must not have received prior radiation therapy or chemotherapy for this diagnosis. Patients who have had their primary site tumor removed by surgery but still present with grossly enlarged lymph nodes are eligible for this study. Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70. Exclusion Criteria for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2: all nasopharyngeal, paranasal sinus, salivary cancer, and thyroid malignancies prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy within the last three years patients that underwent previous surgical resection for the same disease (except for biopsy or surgery removing primary site tumor but still present with grossly enlarged lymph nodes) any prior radiotherapy to the head and neck region pregnant (confirmed by serum bHCG in women of reproductive age) or breast feeding Subject Exclusion Criteria for Optional Contrast MRIs Cohort 1 Only • Subjects with a known contraindication to the standard MRI contrast agent (Gadavist, a gadoliniumbased contrast agent) and/or a recent estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 or less will be excluded from all DCEMRIs, and will instead receive noncontrast MRIs at the DCEMRI time points.</criteria>
