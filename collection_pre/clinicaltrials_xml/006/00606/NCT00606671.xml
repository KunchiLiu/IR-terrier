	<brief_summary>The scope of the study was to investigate different metabolic aspects that may lead to or are a consequence of insulin resistance in premenopausal women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We use gold standard methods for evaluation of insulin resistance. We take muscle and fat biopsies for investigation of gene expression of different cytokines associated with insulin resistance. We investigate the incretin hormones GIP and GLP-1. These two hormones play a central role in glycemic control, and diabetic subjects are known to have alterations in their incretin hormones. The incretin hormones have not previously been investigated in women with PCOS.</brief_summary>
