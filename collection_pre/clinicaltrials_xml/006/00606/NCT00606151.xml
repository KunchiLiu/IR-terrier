	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if an intravenous (IV) antiplatelet medication is as safe and effective at preventing clot formation in your stented artery as compared in people who have stopped clopidogrel prior to surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PeriOperative Bridging - Perioperative Anticoagulation in the Setting of Recent Intracoronary Drug Eluting Stents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stent thrombosis continues to be associated with a high rate of death or myocardial infarction. While this risk has been ameliorated through the use of the oral antiplatelet agent clopidogrel, there is a small but important subset of patients who will require discontinuation of clopidogrel due to unplanned or emergency surgery. These patients are exposed to a high risk of stent thrombosis during this time period. It is not known whether a strategy of intravenous antiplatelet therapy to "bridge" these patients is effective at preventing the morbidity related to stent thrombosis in the perioperative period. We intend to assess, in a prospective observational manner, the clinical course of patients who have undergone stent implantation less than 6 months prior to a surgical procedure requiring discontinuation of clopidogrel therapy and the efficacy of intravenous antiplatelet therapy to prevent morbidity related to stent thrombosis.</detailed_description>
