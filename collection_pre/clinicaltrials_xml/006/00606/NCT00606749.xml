	<brief_title>Use of KC706 for the Treatment of Pemphigus Vulgaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study is designed to follow-up on pre-clinical observations that administration of KC706 is associated with prevention of the development of lesions in a mouse model of PV. Patients participating in this study will be those with active disease in spite of ongoing treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents. The dose chosen for this clinical study is 300 mg once daily. The primary assessment of interest will be pemphigus lesion status during dosing with KC706.</detailed_description>
