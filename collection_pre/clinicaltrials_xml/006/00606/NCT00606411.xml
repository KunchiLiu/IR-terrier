	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Topiramate in the Treatment of Sleep-Related Eating Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, 13-week, outpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, pilot study of topiramate in subjects with Sleep-Related Eating Disorder (SRED). The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of topiramate compared to placebo in the treatment of Sleep-Related Eating Disorder. SRED is a disorder that consists of out of control eating during the night with little or no awareness of the events. In this study we are comparing topiramate to placebo. A placebo is a pill that looks exactly like the study drug, but it does not have any active drug in it. Topamax (topiramate) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a therapy for epilepsy, but topiramate has not been approved by the FDA for SRED.</detailed_description>
