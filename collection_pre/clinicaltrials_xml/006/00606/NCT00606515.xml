	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is any difference of the pharmacokinetics of two taxane formulations, paclitaxel injection and liposomal paclitaxel in Chinese cancer patients with solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Study of Liposomal Paclitaxel in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pharmacokinetics of a new formulation of taxane (liposomal paclitaxel) has never been studied in Chinese cancer patients. This clinical trial is designed to find out the pharmacokinetics of liposomal paclitaxel at the dose of 175mg/m2 and whether it has a different pharmacokinetic profile to paclitaxel.</detailed_description>
