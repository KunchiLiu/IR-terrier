	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to address the question of whether or not oral alimentation and ambulation exercise should be begun early in patients following laparoscopic colorectal surgery compared to the classical diet and ambulation which depends on reappearance of functional intestinal transit. Early oral alimentation following laparoscopic colorectal surgery may decrease hospital stay and facilitate earlier discharge with comparable postoperative morbidity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fast-track Rehabilitation After Elective Colorectal and Small Bowel Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally, patients who received laparoscopic colorectal surgery were treated with the classical protocol including the use of a naso-gastric tube and starvation for several postoperative days till the recovery of bowel movement, or bed resting at immediate postoperative period followed by ward ambulation at the postoperative day 1 or 2. Restarting the oral alimentation is based on gas or feces reappearance after surgery and usually this is possible at several days following surgery. However, prolonged starvation might be uncomfortable for the patient as well as increasing his postoperative hospital stay. Recently, several studies reported the efficacy of early rehabilitation protocols after intestinal surgery, showing that early oral alimentation could reduce the length of hospital stay and cost of hospitalization without significant increase of postoperative complications, compared to traditional management. This prospective, randomized study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a postoperative care pathway using rehabilitation with early ambulation and diet for patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal resection compared with the traditional postoperative care. In order to conduct this study, patients having a laparoscopic colon resection will be randomly attributed to enhanced recovery program group or control group, which is divided based on the postoperative management protocol.</detailed_description>
