	<brief_summary>Results to date of umbilical cord blood transplantation in adult and fully mature adolescent patients are inferior to what is seen in children, due to a lower stem cell dosage in adults and a more toxic conditioning regimen. This phase 1 protocol will use a potentially less toxic bone marrow conditioning regimen, followed by infusion of a combined umbilical cord blood graft that will provide the patient with a higher stem cell dose than can be given with a single umbilical cord blood infusion. The subjects will be conditioned with a total body irradiation (TBI) 13.5 Gy and fludarabine. Following conditioning, up to two unrelated, partially matched umbilical cord blood grafts will be infused that will provide a minimum nucleated cell dose of 3 x 10e7/kg . The primary objective of this study is to measure the frequency of treatment-related toxicity and engraftment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Total Body Irradiation With Fludarabine Followed by Combined Umbilical Cord Blood (UCB) Transplants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Results to date of umbilical cord blood transplantation in adult and fully mature adolescent patients are inferior to what is seen in children. There are two reasons for this. First is that the stem cell dose, measured in nucleated cells/kg body weight, is considerably lower due to the size of the recipient. This results in a higher incidence of graft failure, delayed engraftment, and impaired immune reconstitution. Multiple studies have suggested that a nucleated cell dose below 1.5 to 2 x 107/kg results in an unacceptably high risk for graft failure. Only a minority of adult patients will have a suitably matched umbilical cord blood unit that contains more than 1.5 x 107 nucleated cells/kg. The second reason for inferior outcome of umbilical cord blood transplantation in adult patients is that in comparison to children, the conventional myeloablative bone marrow conditioning regimens are more toxic. This phase 1 protocol will use a potentially less toxic bone marrow conditioning regimen, followed by infusion of a combined umbilical cord blood graft that will provide the patient with a higher stem cell dose than can be given with a single umbilical cord blood infusion. The subjects will be conditioned with a TBI 13.5 Gy and fludarabine. Fludarabine pharmacokinetics will be measured and correlated with the kinetics of donor cell engraftment as well frequency of treatment-related toxicity. Following conditioning, up to two unrelated, partially matched umbilical cord blood grafts will be infused that will provide a minimum nucleated cell dose of 3 x 10e7/kg. The primary objective of this study is to measure the frequency of treatment-related toxicity and engraftment.</detailed_description>

Patients with high risk ALL in first complete remission, with high risk being defined by the presence of t(4;11), t(9;22) or t(1;19) or patients presenting with extreme hyperleukocytosis (WBC &gt; 500,000/ul) or partial remission after induction therapy. Adult patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) in first complete remission with highrisk cytogenetics (monosomy chromosome 5 or 7, del (5q), abn (3q26), complex karyotypic abnormalities) or failure to achieve complete remission after standard induction therapy. All patients with ALL or ANLL in second or subsequent remission or partial remission. All patients with CML in chronic (failed interferon and/or Gleevec) or accelerated phase. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk category of INT1 or greater. Patients with severe aplastic anemia must have failed immunosuppressive therapy such as cyclosporine plus antithymocyte globulin.
