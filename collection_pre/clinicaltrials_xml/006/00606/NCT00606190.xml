	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Study of Brain Protection During Aortic Arch Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the best method of protecting the brain during long periods of circulatory arrest. The significance of this project will be to determine which method of brain protection (1) retrograde brain perfusion or (2) perfusion of the right subclavian artery with antegrade perfusion of the brain protects against brain injury after total arch replacement. Thus reducing the risk of stroke or neurocognitive deficits in patients undergoing this critical surgical procedure.</detailed_description>
