	<brief_summary>Femoroacetabular hip impingement syndrome is a newly recognized cause of early arthritis of the hip. In this condition a variation in the shape of the upper thigh bone causes it to repeatedly come in contact with the hip socket leading to cartilage damage and arthritis. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether patients without hip pain have variations at the hip joint such as those seen in hip impingement syndrome.</brief_summary>
