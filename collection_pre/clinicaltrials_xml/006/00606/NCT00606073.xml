	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to examine whether incubation of human oocytes until pronuclear stage, in different culture media containing high and low concentrations of glucose affect fertilization differently, not only in standard IVF cycles, but also after intracytoplasmatic sperm injection.In addition, we wish to determine whether exposure of oocytes to different concentrations of glucose until pronuclear stage has further effect on embryo quality and development until the blastocyst stage.</brief_summary>
