	<brief_title>Relativity Study Between Idiopathic Ventricular Arrhythmia and Sex Hormone Levels in Different Stages of Menstrual Cycle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The predilection site of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia is right ventricular outflow tract ,which is called idiopathic RVOT arrhythmia , a retrospective study reported the females are susceptibility to this kind of arrhythmia and another questionaire survey of triggers for RVOT-VT initiation indicated that women have RVOT-A initiation with recognized states of sex hormonal flux , but few researches were made to study the exact relation between this kind of arrhythmia and sex hormone levels, this is the aim of our study .40 females with regular menses(20 females with RVOT arrhythmia ,20 healthy volunteers) will be screened, the Participants will undergo ECG monitoring and their blood samples will be collected at various times throughout the study.</detailed_description>
