	<brief_summary>This study investigates the effect of a inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone or "Flovent") on airway narrowing induced by hypertonic saline (salty water). The study hypothesis is that fluticasone will be more effective in preventing saline-induced airway narrowing than methacholine-induced narrowing.</brief_summary>
