	<brief_summary>Various adrenergic blockers are used for acute voiding difficulty after proctectomy. Recently, a selective alpha5-adrenergic blocker, Tamsulosin has been reported to have benefit in reducing urinary symptom score and in reducing the rate of intermittent self-catheterization for patients with rectal cancer after radical proctectomy. This study is to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacologic prevention to ameliorate the incidence of postoperative urinary dysfunction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Acute Voiding Difficulty After Radical Proctectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute voiding difficulty is caused from damage to pelvic sympathetic nerve after rectal surgery, and usually resolved spontaneously within several months after the surgery. However, acute voiding difficulty results in prolonged insertion of urinary catheter and is associated risk for urinary tract infection. Various adrenergic blockers are used for acute voiding difficulty after proctectomy. Recently, a selective alpha5-adrenergic blocker, Tamsulosin has been reported to have benefit in reducing urinary symptom score and in reducing the rate of intermittent self-catheterization for patients with rectal cancer after radical proctectomy. This study is to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacologic prevention to ameliorate teh incidence of postoperative urinary dysfunction.</detailed_description>
