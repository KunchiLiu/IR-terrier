	<brief_summary>To examine the effects of varenicline on the subjective, physiological and cognitive responses to intravenous nicotine.

	<detailed_description>This will be a 2-4 week double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Twenty four male and female smokers will have two 4-day treatment periods, in which they will be randomized to varenicline (1 mg/day) or placebo. During the first 3 days of each treatment period, smokers will have daily clinic visits and receive their study medication. On Day 4, subjects will come to the laboratory, where they will receive ascending doses of intravenous (IV) nicotine (0.1, 0.4, and 0.7 mg per 70kg). This procedure will allow accurate assessment of varenicline effects on the subjective, physiological and cognitive responses to nicotine. Following a washout period, subjects will be crossed over to the alternative treatment.</detailed_description>
