	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, two-arm Phase 2 study comparing pemetrexed plus best supportive care with best supportive care alone as maintenance therapy following first-line treatment with a pemetrexed-cisplatin combination in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. A total of approximately 100 patients are planned to be enrolled, and following completion of four cycles of pemetrexed-cisplatin (Induction Phase) those patients in which disease progression has not occurred will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms (Maintenance Phase): Arm A (pemetrexed plus best supportive care) or Arm B (best supportive care alone).</brief_summary>
