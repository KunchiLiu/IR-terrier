	<brief_summary>In recent years several reports have documented that Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors induce neoplastic cells to undergo growth arrest, differentiation and/or apoptotic cell death. Recently, inhibitors of HDACs has also been shown to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis in vivo. Several HDAC-inhibitors are currently in clinical trials as novel anticancer agents. Among these agents, ITF2357 has most recently been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the autonomous proliferation of haematopoietic cells from patients with myeloproliferative disorders carrying the JAK2 V617F mutation. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ITF2357 in the treatment of polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and myelofibrosis (MF)</brief_summary>
