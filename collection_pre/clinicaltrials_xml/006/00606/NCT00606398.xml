	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II study of combined surgical resection for patients with both intra- and extra-hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. The primary objective is to determine the two-year disease free survival (DFS) of patients who undergo surgical resection of both intra- and extra-hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. The secondary objectives are to determine the overall survival rate (OS), patterns of treatment failure, treatment efficacy (R0 resection rate), peri-operative morbidity and mortality rates, health related quality of life, and hospital length of stay.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase II clinical study will examine the outcomes of surgical therapy for patients with both intra- and extra-hepatic CRC metastases. The treatment protocol includes surgical resection of metastases from Colorectal cancer. Multi-modality co-interventions such as chemotherapy (neo-adjuvant, or post-operative), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and/or portal vein embolization (PVE) will be permitted. The eligibility criteria include: patients with both intra-hepatic and extra-hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer, the number of extra-hepatic metastases must be three or less on pre-operative imaging, all metastatic deposits must be resectable with R0 intent, there must be no contra-indications to major surgery and an ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.</detailed_description>
