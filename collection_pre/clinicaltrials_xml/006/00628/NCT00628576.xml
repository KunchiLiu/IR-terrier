	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of the new acute treatment of deep venous thrombosis by use of low-molecular-weight heparin compared with standard treatment using unfractionated heparin, especially concerning long-term morbidity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Long-Term Sequelae After Thrombophlebitis, i.e. Deep Venous Thrombosis of the Lower Extremities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deep-venous thrombosis (DVT) remains a common clinical problem (annual incidence 0.10-0.16%) and long-term morbidity as chronic venous insufficience (CVI) in 10-30%. As to recurrent DVT, initial treatment with Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin ( to-day's terminology Fractionated Heparin (FH)) and Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) has shown equal efficiency, whereas the efficacy concerning long-term morbidity has only more recently been published. This study was initiated to compare the efficacy of UFH and FH concerning the incidence of CVI after symptomatic DVT at short-term and long-term follow-up.</detailed_description>
