	<brief_summary>Systemic scleroderma (SSc) is a rare chronic inflammatory diseae of the connective tissue involving the skin and internal organs. To date there is no proven therapy for the skin fibrosis available. A number of case reports and small uncontrolled cohort studies suggest that UVA1 therapy may improve skin fibrosis. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate whether treatment UVA1 in deed is effective in treating skin fibrosis in SSc using a randomized, intraindividual half body irradiation protocol.</brief_summary>
