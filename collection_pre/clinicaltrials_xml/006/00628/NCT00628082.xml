	<brief_summary>Up to half of all patients with heart failure are found to have normal pumping function of the heart muscle, but show abnormalities in the way the heart muscle relaxes and fills with blood. These patients often have high blood pressure, and tend to have stiff arteries and stiff heart muscle. We wish to test the hypothesis that these patients have abnormal energy stores in their heart muscle.</brief_summary>
