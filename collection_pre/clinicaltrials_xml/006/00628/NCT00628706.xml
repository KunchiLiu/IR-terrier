	<brief_title>Investigating the Acute Effects of THC on Functional Brain Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cannabis is by far the most frequently used illicit drug worldwide and has significant effects on memory. Further, cannabis has an addictive potential. These effects are mediated by an action of THC, the main psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, on cannabinoid CB1 receptors. These receptors are particularly highly expressed in brain regions involved in memory and reward. Therefore, in this study we will investigate the acute effects of THC on functional brain systems underlying memory and reward. We will visualize these effects using the latest non-invasive imaging technique: pharmacological MRI (phMRI).</detailed_description>
