	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures, such as glycan analysis, may be effective in finding ovarian epithelial cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well glycan analysis works in diagnosing cancer in women with ovarian epithelial cancer and in healthy female participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glycan Analysis in Diagnosing Cancer in Women With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer and in Healthy Female Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the accuracy of glycan analysis to distinguish between normal healthy control female subjects and those with ovarian epithelial cancer. Secondary - Compare the new assay to the standard CA 125 for diagnostic accuracy. OUTLINE: - Ovarian cancer patients: Blood samples are obtained periodically for up to 2 years. Patients undergoing surgery have blood samples drawn before and after surgery. Medical charts are reviewed periodically for up to 3 years. - Healthy volunteers: One blood sample is obtained. Volunteers also complete a 1-page questionnaire. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 healthy female participants and 400 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
