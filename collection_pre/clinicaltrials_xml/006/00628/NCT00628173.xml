	<brief_summary>Purpose:To compare the efficacy and safety of Ahmed Glaucoma Valve (AGV) implantation in the superior versus inferior quadrants. Methods: In a non-randomized clinical trial and over a period of two years, consecutive patients with refractory glaucoma underwent AGV implantation in the superior or inferior quadrants. Main outcome measures included best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), number of glaucoma medications, complications and success rate (defined as at least 30% IOP reduction below preoperative values and 5&lt;IOP&lt;22 mmHg with or without glaucoma medications). Other criteria for failure included implant removal, additional glaucoma surgery, phthisis bulbi or loss of light perception.</brief_summary>
