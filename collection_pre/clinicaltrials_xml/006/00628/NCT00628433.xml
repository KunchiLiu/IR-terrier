	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot, exploratory study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics and potential activity of an investigational agent, HE3286, when administered orally, daily for 28 days to patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study of HE3286 in Patients With Active, Mild-to-Moderate Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HE3286 has a potentially new mechanism of action that may improve the current therapeutic options available to patients with ulcerative colitis. In preclinical experiments, HE3286 has shown activity in animal models of ulcerative colitis. Additionally, HE3286 has shown to have anti-inflammatory activity associated with corticosteroids but without the side effects associated with corticosteroid use, such as immune suppression and bone loss.</detailed_description>
