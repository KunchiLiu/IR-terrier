	<brief_summary>This is a research study in which your cells will be used for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), and/or genetic reprogramming research which may result in the production of stem cell lines. This study does not provide treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Create Potential Cell-Based Therapies to Treat Human Disease and Disability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is thought that studies of genetic reprogramming and SCNT using human cells have the potential to give us new basic knowledge about human development. Current work will focus on developing this basic knowledge. In the future, human embryonic stem cell lines (hESC) derived from genetic reprogramming and SCNT may also have the potential to develop into cell types that are useful for cell-based therapies to treat human disease and disability.</detailed_description>
