	<detailed_description>Objective: To investigate whether injection of botulinum toxin type A is less painful if performed through follicular openings versus traditional non-specific approach. Design: Prospective, randomized, single-blinded study. Setting: Academic dermatology department. Patients: A volunteer sample of twenty female patients aged 25-55 who had no prior history of botulinum toxin injection. Intervention: Each patient received six randomized injections of botulinum toxin type A (BotoxÂ® Allergan). Two injections into the procerus muscle and two into each corrugator muscle. Three of the injections were performed through follicular openings and three were performed traditionally. Main Outcome Measure: Patient discomfort on a 1-10 scale and direct comparison between the two injection techniques.</detailed_description>
