	<brief_summary>This preliminary study is aimed to investigate whether it is feasible to conduct a study to use fish oil compared to the placebo(olive oil) in people with cognitive impairment. We will also explore whether fish oil has better efficacy in some clinical aspects in people with cognitive impairment during 24 weeks intervention. The major clinical outcome will be: 1. general clinical impression 2. cognitive function</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preliminary Study of Fish Oil and Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite some positive findings from observational and animal studies, the effects of n-3 PUFA administration on cognitive impairment in humans have received little evaluation to date. Although some clinical trials of fish oil have been reported, the results are inconsistent. Given these inconsistent findings, we carried out a preliminary study to investigate the effect of fish oil monotherapy on cognitive function and general clinical condition in patients with cognitive impairment.</detailed_description>
