	<brief_summary>We wish to understand the association of Vitamin A serum levels and Vitamin A receptor number and responsiveness in asthmatics. We believe that Vitamin A receptors may be less prevalent in asthmatics and their responsiveness decreased.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin A, Its Receptors and Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We wish to define the association of asthma, vitamin A serum levels and vitamin A receptor number and responsiveness on circulating mononuclear cells. Asthma is a complex, heterogenous and often debilitating and potentially deadly disease. The causes for asthma are many, with susceptibility and resistance to treatment is poorly understood. Ultimately, looking at this disease from another angle such as the role of Vitamin A and/or receptors can help us learn more about the pathophysiology and treatment of asthma.</detailed_description>
