	<criteria>Children and adults 265 years of age (inclusive) of either gender. Diagnosis of VL confirmed by spleen or bone marrow aspirate. Clinical signs and symptoms compatible with VL. Biochemical and haematological test values as follows: Haemoglobin &gt; 3.5g/100mL White blood cell count &gt; 0.75 x109/L Platelet count &gt; 40 x 109/L AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase &lt; 5 times upper normal limit Prothrombin time &lt; 4 seconds above control Serum creatinine levels 1.5 times upper normal limit Serum potassium levels within normal limits HIV negative. A history of intercurrent or concurrent diseases (e.g. chronic alcohol consumption or drug addiction; renal, hepatic, cardiovascular or CNS disease; diabetes; tuberculosis; other infectious or major psychiatric diseases) that may introduce variables that affect the outcome of the study. Any condition which the investigator thinks may prevent the patient from completing the study therapy and subsequent followup. Proteinuria (&gt; 2+). A history of allergy or hypersensitivity to amphotericin B Previous treatment for VL within two weeks of enrollment into the study. Prior treatment failures with amphotericin B.</criteria>
