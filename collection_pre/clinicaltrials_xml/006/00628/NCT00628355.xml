	<brief_summary>Our hypothesis is that with comparison of effectiveness of two most common techniques of treatment for myofascial pain syndrome (injection of local anesthesia and ischemic compression) we could choice the most adequate to treat this disease. This way we could decrease the expenses with medicines, examinations, consultations and the time that women remains without a diagnosis and treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lidocaine Injection and Ischemic Compression on Chronic Pelvic Pain Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After evaluation and diagnostic confirmation, the patients will be randomized and submitted to the treatment with lidocaine injection or ischemic compression. Each treatment will be placed once a week, for four weeks. Women randomized for treatment with Ischemic compression, will be first subjected to transcutaneal electrostimulation(TENS), in order to receive analgesia on trigger point. The analgesia will be used to inhibit the painful stimulation. The device used for this will be the Dualpex 961, with 100 Hertz of frequency and pulse of 250ms. The intensity will be vary according the painful threshold of each patient. The electrostimulation will be made for 30 minutes. The electrodes will be applied around the trigger point. After analgesia, the ischemic compression will be applied. This therapy consists in a continuous pressure on trigger point. For this we will use one algometer to get maximum of homogeneity on therapy. The pressure intensity will be placed by the average between the values gotten during three previously measurements of threshold pain in each patient. This therapy will be applied three times with duration of 60 seconds each with a 30 seconds of rest between the applications. Injection of anesthesia: this therapy will be applied directly in trigger points with two mL of lidocaine 0.5% with needle of 22 gauges directly and perpendicularly in trigger point. The Evaluations for each treatment will be carried immediately before the randomization; In one month: immediately after the four weeks of treatment; - Three months: three months after the treatment; - Six months: six months after the treatment.</detailed_description>
