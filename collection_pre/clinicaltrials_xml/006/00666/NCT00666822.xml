	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To examine the relationship between adherence to endocrine therapy and variables from the Health Belief Model (i.e., perceived risk, barriers to and benefits of adherence, and cues to action such as physician recommendation) as well as measures of patient's perceptions of patient- and family-centered care in women with estrogen receptor-positive stage I-IIIA breast cancer. OUTLINE: Patients complete a 15 minute questionnaire on-line or by mail comprising questions of demographic and medical variables (i.e., age, race/ethnicity, marital and educational status, and medication side effects) as well as health beliefs and selected aspects of patient- and family-centered care. Data collected from the questionnaire will be stored in an Excel database. Patient's medical records are reviewed for information about the time since diagnosis, tumor characteristics, treatment, and comorbidity.</detailed_description>
