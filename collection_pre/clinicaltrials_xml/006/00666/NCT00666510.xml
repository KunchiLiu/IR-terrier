	<brief_summary>Intraoperative bronchospasm challenges anesthesia's safety. This study aims to investigate high concentration of exhaled nitric oxide as a marker of intraoperative bronchospasm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bronchospasm Associated With High Nitric Oxide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies in asthmatic patients suggested that exhaled nitric oxide may represent a noninvasive measure for airway inflammation. Anesthesia information forms from 1999 throughout 2004 were revised (n=146.358). Bronchospasm occurrence appeared registered on 863 forms. From those, nine were identified as non-asthmatics patients (Bronchospasm group). Also, 12 asthmatics constituted one additional group (Asthma group) and 10 subjects with no previous airway disease or symptoms (Control group). All subjects were submitted to Exhaled nitric oxide measurements (parts/billion), spirometry and induced sputum.</detailed_description>
