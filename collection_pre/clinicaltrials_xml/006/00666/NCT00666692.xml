	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to examine the safety of volociximab (V) in combination with a standard treatment of carboplatin (C), paclitaxel (P), and bevacizumab (B) in subjects previously untreated with chemotherapy for advanced stage (IIIB/IV) non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1b Study With Volociximab in Combination With Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, and Bevacizumab in First-line, Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of volociximab in combination with C/P + B in subjects with previously untreated Stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC. Subjects will be treated with the C/P + B + volociximab (V)combination for a total of 6 cycles (3 weeks/cycle). Subjects with stable disease (SD)or better per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)after the 6th cycle of combination treatment (C/P + B + V) will be considered for further treatment in a maintenance phase with B + V at the same dose until subject withdrawal from treatment. Volociximab will be administered at doses ranging from 10 to 30 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab will be administered at their registered doses for this combination. Follow up for each subject will extend over a 90-day period following the last dose of volociximab. End of study is defined as 90 days after the last dose of volociximab for the last subject treated in the study.</detailed_description>

Radiation therapy within 1 month before Cycle 1, Day 1. Documented symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) tumor or CNS metastases. History of thromboembolic events, including cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (ie, acute myocardial infarction [AMI], stroke) within 1 year prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. History of known bleeding disorders and coagulation defects. History of significant hemoptysis (ie, &gt; or = 1/2 teaspoon red blood per event) or gastrointestinal bleeding within 1 year prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. Major surgery (eg, exploratory laparotomy) within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 of the study. Clinically significant or unstable medical conditions including, but not limited to, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus requiring insulin, uncontrolled hypertension, or uncontrolled or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension.

Known active infections requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals, including but not limited to chronic human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection. Prior bone marrow or stem cell transplant. Regular use of aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, or other agents known to inhibit platelet function. Highdose warfarin or heparin use. [Note: Lowdose warfarin (1 mg/day) or lowdose heparin for IVcatheter patency, and lowmolecular weight heparin for prophylaxis are allowed).</criteria>
