	<brief_title>Microdialysis and Pharmacokinetic Study of TR-701</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in two parts: a Pilot Study and a Main Study. The Pilot Study will be conducted to assess recovery of exogenously administered TR-700 (microbiologically active moiety) via microdialysis. In the Main Study, pharmacokinetics of TR-700 will be determined in both soft tissues (via microdialysis) and plasma after a single oral dose of 600 mg TR-701 (prodrug).</detailed_description>
