	<brief_summary>This study is designed to test the hypothesis that the Synchronous Neural Interaction™ Test is useful for diagnosing Probable Alzheimer's Disease according to standard criteria. Subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease as well as age-matched normal control subjects will be evaluated for symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease and those meeting inclusion criteria will undergo a brief, non-invasive scan of brain function using a magnetoencephalography (MEG). The scan itself lasts 1 minute while the subject is asked to stare at a dot projected in front of them on a video screen. Orasi Medical believes that patterns of brain activity measured at rest are indicative of Alzheimer's Disease pathology. The protocol is amended to add a follow-up assessment for previously enrolled and completed subjects who agree to participate in the follow-up assessment approximately 9 - 15 months after initial study enrollment. Subjects who agree to participate in the follow-up assessment will undergo the same standardized tests and MEG scan procedure as completed in the initial study.</brief_summary>
