	<brief_summary>A randomised, cross-over trial targeting a small sample of older (age 45-65 years) overweight adults with type 2 diabetes the aims of this pilot study are to: 1. Determine the feasibility of investigating the acute effects of prolonged sedentary behaviour (sitting) in this target group. 2. Compare the acute effects of a single prolonged (8 hour) bout of sedentary behaviour (sitting) on glucose and triglyceride concentrations and key muscle and adipose regulatory enzymes to a similar bout of sedentary behaviour combined with intermittent bouts of light-intensity activity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed study will involve a randomised cross-over experimental trial conducted in the laboratory setting in older overweight adults with type 2 diabetes. Participants will receive both of the acute testing conditions in a randomised manner. Study design: Randomised cross-over pilot trial of 20 overweight/obese older adults with diet-controlled type 2 diabetes involving 2 acute treatment conditions, with a one-week wash-out period between testing conditions (Figure 1 a). Setting: Acute, supervised laboratory setting within the Alfred and Baker Heart Institute Medical Unit. Outcomes: We will measure acute responses in laboratory-measured plasma glucose &amp; triglyceride levels (every 60 mins) and glucose concentrations determined from continuous glucose monitoring (CGMS).</detailed_description>
