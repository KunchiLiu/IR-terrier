	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine how effective azacitidine, MGCD0103, and the combination of azacitidine and MGCD0103 are in treating AML or MDS in people over 60 years of age.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study of Azacitidine (Vidaza) vs MGCD0103 vs Combination in Elderly Subjects With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, 3-arm Phase 2 study will compare the safety and efficacy of single-agent azacitidine (currently 1 of 3 approved treatments for myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]) to that of single-agent MGCD0103 and to that of combination therapy with MGCD0103 and azacitidine in elderly patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or intermediate-2 (Int-2) or high-risk MDS, for whom no standard of care exists. The goal of the study is to determine which of the 3 treatment arms are worthy of further investigation in a subsequent Phase 3 study of elderly subjects with AML or Int-2 or high-risk MDS.</detailed_description>
