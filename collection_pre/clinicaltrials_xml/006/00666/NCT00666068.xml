	<brief_summary>In contrast to healthy subjects, patients with hypopituitarism do not exhibit endocrine responses when hormones are injected. This is at least true for those with a complete insufficiency of the anterior pituitary. For example, administration of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) is not followed by an increase of ACTH and cortisol. Therefore, "pure" hormone effects can be investigated. It is well established that hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are involved in sleep regulation. In rodents, CRH decreased slow wave sleep (SWS). In humans, CRH was reported to increase wakefulness and to decrease SWS and REM sleep. Primary objective was therefore to study the effect of CRH on patients with hypopituitarism. To date, there is no information on sleep of patients with hypopituitarism. Secondary objective is therefore to compare sleep of patients with hypopituitarism with sleep of age-matched healthy controls.</brief_summary>
