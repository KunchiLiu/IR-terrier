	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial of Exercise Training Among Men With Type 2-diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise training is well documented as part of effective treatment for type 2-diabetes patients. Endurance training has been suggested as the most suitable form of exercise. There are reasons to believe that strength training also has a positive effect. However, comparisons of endurance training and strength training regimes are limited. Therefore we randomized 26 men with type 2-diabetes to either an endurance training group or a strength training group. Both groups exercised three sessions per week for three months. The training was supervised.</detailed_description>
