	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, equivalence study involving about 462 clinically stable hemodialysis patients aged 18 years or above suffering from anemia and treated previously with a stable dose of ERYPO® intravenously.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of HX 575 vs ERYPO® for the Treatment of Anemia in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this Phase III study is the evaluation of therapeutic equivalence of HX575 and a comparator epoetin alfa in the maintenance intravenous treatment of renal anemia. Efficacy, dosage and safety of HX575 in the long-term treatment were assessed.</detailed_description>
