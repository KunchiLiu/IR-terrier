	<brief_title>Pilot Study to Determine the Safety and Efficacy of Gardasil Against the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) in HIV-infected Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective pilot study that will attempt to enroll approximately 150-200 HIV-infected males followed regularly in the ID Primary Care Clinic at the VA Long Beach Healthcare System. All consenting patients will be given the HPV vaccine (Gardasil) in three intramuscular injections. Baseline antibody titers to HPV strains 16 and 18 will be obtained at day 0 and repeat levels will be obtained approximately 8 weeks after the completion of the vaccination series to determine whether patients without antibodies at baseline have now produced antibodies, or to determine the change in antibody levels in those patients who have evidence of antibodies prior to the first injection of the vaccine. Patients will undergo routine anal PAP smear with HPV DNA testing at baseline and another PAP smear/HPV test approximately 8 weeks after completion of the series. Patients will report any side effects of the vaccine to the PI. Patients will have blood work to monitor HIV-1 viral load and CD4 lymphocytes counts at various points during the study.</detailed_description>
