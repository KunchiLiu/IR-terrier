	<brief_title>Study of Inhaled Corticosteroid Plus Montelukast Compared With Inhaled Corticosteroid Therapy Alone in Patients With Chronic Asthma (0476-386)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During this study, all patients will receive mometasone (powder, 220 mcg once-daily, for approximately 6 weeks). In a crossover manner, eligible patients will also receive montelukast (powder, 1 mg once-daily, for approximately 2 weeks) followed by placebo; or will receive placebo followed by montelukast. The order of when each of these 2 treatments are added to the mometasone will be randomized.</detailed_description>
