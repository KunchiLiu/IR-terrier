	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if IMC-A12 alone or in combination with Cetuximab (Erbitux®) can increase survival in patients with Squamous Cell Head and Neck Cancer who have had disease progression and platinum-containing chemotherapeutic regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of IMC-A12, Alone or in Combination With Cetuximab, in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma (MSCC) of the Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The routine cancer treatments for Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head and Neck Cancer have improved but still leave a percentage of patients with incurable disease. New alternatives for patients whose disease is refractory to existing therapies is needed. IMC-A12 is a monoclonal antibody which binds to special receptors known as IGF-1R. This binding action has been shown to inhibit the growth of a variety of human tumor cell lines. The purpose of this study is to evaluation the effects of IMC-A12 by itself or with Cetuximab (Erbitux®) in patients with Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head and Neck Cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, and to determine how long the drug remains in the body. The study will also look at what side effects IMC-A12 may cause when a patient is receiving treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, or oral cavity, metastasis or recurrence documented by clinical imaging studies Measurable disease, lesion size ≥ 2 cm on conventional measurement techniques or ≥ 1 cm on spiral computed tomography (CT) scan Clinical documentation of disease progression during treatment with or within 90 days after receiving the last cycle of platinumbased chemotherapy (with or without radiation therapy) If prior treatment with antiEGFR therapy, the time to recurrence from last exposure to antiEGFR therapy is &gt; 90 days Adequate hematologic function Adequate hepatic function Adequate coagulation function or is on a stable dose of an anticoagulant. Adequate renal function Fasting serum glucose &lt;120 mg/dL or below the ULN Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation Not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.
