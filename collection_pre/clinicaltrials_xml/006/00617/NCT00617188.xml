	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of ovarian epithelial cancer cells. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight ovarian cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well fulvestrant works in treating patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fulvestrant in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the 90-day clinical benefit (defined as the sum of complete responses, partial responses, and stable disease) in patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer treated with single agent fulvestrant. Secondary - To establish the time to termination of treatment (due to all causes including progression and intolerance) for patients treated with this drug. - To describe the toxicities observed in patients treated with this drug. - To evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with this drug. - To determine the effect that prolonged estrogen receptor antagonism has on markers of bone mineral turnover. OUTLINE: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on days 1 and 15 of course 1 and then on day 1 of all subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in continued response at the end of 1 year may continue treatment at the discretion of the treating physician. Urinary N-telopeptide and serum skeletal-specific alkaline phosphatase are assessed at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months during study to determine the influence of estrogen blockade on bone mineral turnover. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and every 3 months during treatment, and at the end of treatment using The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian (FACT-O) cancer questionnaire. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at approximately 30 days.</detailed_description>
