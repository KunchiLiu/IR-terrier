	<brief_summary>The investigators' project has as for principal objective to understand the impact of trans fatty acids from dairy products and industrial origin on the development of insulin resistance in obese woman. Because of the different isomeric position of the double bound those trans fatty acids may have different metabolic effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Trans Fatty Acids From Natural and Industrial Origin in the Induction of Insulin Resistance Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women will be included in the study according to their susceptibility to develop a insulin resistance (evaluated starting from the body index of mass IMC superior to 28 kg.m-², of the waist measurement 88 cm). Once included in the study, the volunteers will receive for 4 weeks butter, dairy products and biscuits enriched in stearic, elaidic or vaccenic acid. The volunteers will undergo a measurement of the body composition by biphotonic absorptiometry as well as a complete metabolic assessment (blood and urinary samples, clamp to insulin and biopsies).</detailed_description>
