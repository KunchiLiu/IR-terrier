	<detailed_description>Hypothermia, defined as a core temperature below 36 degrees celsius, is commonly seen in patients undergoing surgery. Intraoperative hypothermia is related to postoperative patient discomfort, impaired wound healing, increased blood loss, anxiety and disturbances in glucose and insulin levels. Prewarming of patients prior to surgery may result in maintenance of intraoperative temperature and reduce postoperative complications. We therefore aim to investigate the effects of prewarming of patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery on intraoperative temperature control and blood loss and postoperative patient discomfort and glucose and insulin levels. Objective of the study: Does preoperative heating of patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery reduce the incidence of intraoperative hypothermia and postoperative comfort and modulate postoperative glucose and insulin blood levels? Study design: Multi-center, prospective, randomized clinical trial. Study population: Patients undergoing an elective orthopedic hip- or knee replacement</detailed_description>
