	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the trial is: • to evaluate the change from baseline in plasma viral load with placebo and one of up to 4 dose regimens of RDEA806. The secondary objectives are: Efficacy - to describe the nadir of the plasma viral load - to describe the DAVG - to assess the proportion of subjects who reached a drop in viral load of 0.5 log, 1 log, or reach an undetectable viral load - to assess the plasma viral load decay rate - to evaluate immunologic changes (as measured by CD4 and CD8 cells) - to evaluate the genotypic and phenotypic pattern of the virus Pharmacokinetics - to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of RDEA806 Safety - to evaluate the safety and tolerability of bid and qd dosing of RDEA806 as monotherapy</brief_summary>
