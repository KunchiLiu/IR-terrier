	<brief_summary>To evaluate the change from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and other hemodynamic parameters, following the addition of ambrisentan to background phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor (PDE-5i) therapy in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) who have demonstrated a sub-optimal response to PDE-5i monotherapy. The study was originally designed as a 2-arm, double-blind, randomized study in which patients received ambrisentan or placebo for 24 weeks, and then received ambrisentan blinded to dose for 24 weeks. With Protocol Amendment 2 (12 June, 2009), the study was switched to single-arm, open-label treatment, and all patients remaining in the placebo arm were switched to open-label ambrisentan treatment. Patients who enrolled after Amendment 2 all received open-label ambrisentan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Add-on Ambrisentan Therapy to Background Phosphodiesterase Type-5 Inhibitor (PDE5i) Therapy in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (ATHENA-1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the change from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and other hemodynamic parameters, following the addition of ambrisentan to background phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor (PDE-5i) therapy in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) who have demonstrated a sub-optimal response to PDE-5i monotherapy. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the change from baseline in other clinical measures of PAH following the addition of ambrisentan to background PDE-5i therapy in subjects with PAH who have demonstrated a sub-optimal response to PDE-5i monotherapy. The safety and tolerability of ambrisentan/PDE-5i combination therapy will be evaluated throughout the study. In addition, long-term efficacy will be examined.</detailed_description>
