	<brief_summary>Q3week carboplatin with weekly abraxane and trastuzumab as neoadjuvant therapy in resectable and unresectable HER2+ (stage IIa-IIIb) breast cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Carboplatin, Weekly Abraxane and Trastuzumab in HER2+ Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our goal is to develop an induction chemotherapy regimen that will have a pCR rate above 50% in HER2+ patients without exposing patients to the toxicity of an anthracycline-based regimen. A minimum of 60 evaluable patients will be accrued to the study. We are assuming an observed pCR (or near pCR) rate of 70%. Assuming no more than 10% of patients will be inevaluable for the primary endpoint (pCR), we will have at least 54 evaluable patients. With this number, we will have 90% power, with a 1-sided alpha error of 0.05, to demonstrate a pCR rate exceeding 50% for our novel regimen.</detailed_description>
