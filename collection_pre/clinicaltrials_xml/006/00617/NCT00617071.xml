	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Developing a personalized screening plan may be more effective than usual care in increasing the number of healthy participants who regularly undergo screening for colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying personalized screening plans to see how well they work compared with usual care in increasing colorectal cancer screening in healthy participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Personalized Screening Plans to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To compare the impact of tailored intervention vs standard intervention vs usual care on patient utilization of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. - To compare the impact of these interventions on CRC screening preference. - To compare the impact of these interventions on patient perceptions about CRC screening. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Participants are stratified by practice and study wave and blocking. Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 arms. - Arm I (usual care): Participants receive usual care in accordance with their normal patterns of interaction with study practices. - Arm II (standard intervention [SI]): A generic screening invitation letter, a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening informational booklet, stool blood testing (SBT) cards, and instructions for arranging a colonoscopy screening appointment are mailed to participants on day 15. On day 45, a reminder letter is mailed to participants who have not completed SBT or undergone a screening colonoscopy. - Arm III (tailored navigation intervention [TNI]): A test-specific screening invitation letter, a CRC screening informational booklet, and additional test-specific materials (i.e., instructions for arranging a colonoscopy screening appointment or SBT cards) are mailed to participants on day 15. On day 30, a patient navigator contacts participants by telephone who have not completed SBT or undergone a screening colonoscopy. The patient navigator re-assesses screening test-specific decision stage; addresses CRC screening barriers; develops a personalized CRC screening plan to move the participant towards screening use (i.e., explains the steps in completing the SBT or scheduling a colonoscopy appointment); and facilitates screening plan implementation. On day 45, a reminder letter is mailed to participants who were contacted by the navigator. Participants in all arms complete a survey at baseline and then at 6 months. Medical records for each participant are reviewed at 6 months.</detailed_description>
