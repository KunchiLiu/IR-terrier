	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to demonstrate immunologic equivalence of three consecutive production lots of the subunit influenza vaccine compared to egg-derived inactivated influenza vaccine in healthy subjects 18 to 49 years of ages. In addition, this study is to show how safe and well tolerated a conventional inactivated subunit influenza vaccine, licensed in many countries outside the United States, is compared to an inactivated influenza vaccine, licensed in the United States.</brief_summary>
