	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as Hu3S193, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well Hu3S193 works in treating patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or peritoneal cavity cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hu3S193 in Treating Women With Ovarian Epithelial, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the efficacy of monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 in women with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, based on RECIST criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). Secondary - To determine the safety of the study drug. - To determine the drug pharmacokinetics when administered in multiple weekly injections. Exploratory analysis - Clinical Benefit (objective response rate + tumor stabilization). - Progression Free Survival (PFS). - Duration of Response. - Overall Survival. - 12-month survival rate. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 IV over 1 hour once weekly in weeks 1-8. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma Progressive disease Disease must express LewisY antigen documented by immunohistochemistry in archived or fresh primary or metastatic tumor biopsies Measurable disease, including at least one measurable lesion, according to RECIST criteria or CA125 (Cancer Antigen125) &gt; 2 times upper normal limit Pleural effusion, ascites, bone metastases, and lesions located in previously irradiated areas are not considered measurable Disease must be considered platinumrefractory or resistant, meeting any of the following criteria: Platinumrefractory defined as progression during the initial platinumbased chemotherapy regimen or failure to achieve a complete response (e.g., stable disease or partial response) with evidence of progressive disease (by physical examination, radiological exams, or CA125) during the initial platinumbased chemotherapy Platinumresistant defined as recurrence within six months of completion of the initial platinumbased regimen (primary platinumresistance) or recurrence after six months of completion of the initial platinumbased regimen (still considered platinumsensitive, but incurable by any approach, that will progress to a secondary platinumresistance scenario) and failure to ≥ 1 reinduction with a platinumbased regimen (secondary platinumresistance) No high tumor burden, as assessed by the investigator No rapidly progressing disease, as assessed by clinical evaluation No known CNS (Central Nervous System) involvement by tumor PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Inclusion criteria: Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70% Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks ANC (absolute neutrophil count) ≥ 1,500/mm³ Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ Serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) ≤ 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (≤ 5 times ULN if with liver metastases) Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Prothrombin time &lt; 1.3 times control Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception Exclusion criteria: NYHA (New York Heart Association) class III or IV heart disease Clinically significant arrhythmias by ECG Myocardial infarction within the past 6 months Any other serious illness, including any of the following: Severe ascites Severe active infections requiring antibiotics Bleeding disorders Chronic inflammatory bowel disease Diseases that might interfere with the collection of accurate results from this study Positive for human antihuman antibodies Prior history of tumor (excluding adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix) Uncontrolled hypercalcemia (i.e., &gt; 11.5 mg/dL) PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics Recovered from the toxic effects of any prior therapy No concurrent systemic steroids or immunosuppressant agents No more than 1 prior nonplatinumcontaining regimen for the treatment of platinumresistant/refractory disease Patients who receive 2 or more different nonplatinumcontaining chemotherapy regimens for platinumresistant/refractory disease are not eligible More than 4 weeks since prior and no other concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, radiopharmaceuticals (e.g., ^32P), biological therapy, antiestrogen therapy (including tamoxifen), immunotherapy, or surgery More than12 weeks since prior investigational agent No prior treatment with a murine or humanized antibody and/or antibody fragment</criteria>
