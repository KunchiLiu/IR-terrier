	<brief_summary>We hypothesized that by improving hand hygiene compliance in the operative environment, we would reduce horizontal transmission of pathogenic bacteria to surgical patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Potential Nosocomial Infection Prevention Via Modification of Anesthesia Intraoperative Aseptic Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We performed an observational study evaluating provider adherence to these techniques. We then sought to increase hand hygiene compliance through the use of a point of care alcohol based hand hygiene device. We hypothesized that increased hand hygiene compliance would reduce bacterial contamination of the anesthesia workspace and peripheral intravenous tubing, and ultimately reducing overall morbidity and mortality secondary to a reduction in nosocomial infection rates.</detailed_description>
