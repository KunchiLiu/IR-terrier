	<brief_summary>Primary objective: - to characterize the pharmacokinetic and the pharmacodynamic profile after intravenous bolus injection of unfractionated heparin (UFH) after repeated sc 100 IU anti-Xa/kg (corresponding to 1 mg/kg) twice a day during 2.5 days (every 12±2hrs) administrations of enoxaparin in Caucasian healthy subjects. Secondary objective(s): - to compare the pharmacokinetic and the pharmacodynamic profile between 3 different timing of administration of the UFH - to assess the tolerability of the different anticoagulation protocols</brief_summary>
