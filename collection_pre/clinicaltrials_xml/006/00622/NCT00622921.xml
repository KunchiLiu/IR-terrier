	<brief_summary>Purpose: Phase I focus groups with clinicians and patients will gather qualitative data to focus and inform the content of Phase II. In Phase II, 12 weeks of psychotherapy will be offered to evaluate feasibility and potential efficacy of a couples-based, integrated treatment for men with PTSD and alcohol dependence. Hypotheses: We predict that this experimental psychotherapy, Partners Encouraging Abstinence and Coping with Emotions (PEACE), will reduce patient drinking, reduce PTSD symptoms, and improve relationship functioning.</brief_summary>
