	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to demonstrate the effect of teriflunomide (HMR1726) (14 milligram per day [mg/day] and 7 mg/day), in comparison to placebo, for reducing conversion of participants presenting with their first clinical episode consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS) to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS). The secondary objectives were: - To demonstrate the effect of teriflunomide, in comparison to placebo, on: - Reducing conversion to definite multiple sclerosis (DMS) - Reducing annualized relapse rate (ARR) - Reducing disease activity/progression as measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) - Reducing accumulation of disability for at least 12 weeks as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) - Proportion of disability-free participants as assessed by the EDSS - Reducing participant-reported fatigue - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of teriflunomide - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of teriflunomide - Optional pharmacogenomic testing aimed at assessing the association between the main enzyme systems of teriflunomide metabolism and hepatic safety, and other potential associations between gene variations and clinical outcomes</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Study With Teriflunomide Versus Placebo in Patients With First Clinical Symptom of Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consisted of 4 periods: - Screening period: up to 4 weeks, - Placebo-controlled treatment period: up to 108 weeks (at least 24 weeks for participants who experienced conversion to CDMS), - Extension treatment period (without placebo-control): the extension period continued until teriflunomide was commercially available in participant's country of residence. - Post-treatment washout period: 4 weeks after last treatment intake. The maximal duration of the study period per participant was expected to be 116 weeks if he/she did not continue in the extension treatment period.</detailed_description>
