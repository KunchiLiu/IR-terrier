	<brief_summary>The primary objective: - To demonstrate in patients hospitalized for an acute medical illness that enoxaparin with Graduated Elastic Stockings is superior to enoxaparin-placebo with Graduated Elastic Stockings on overall mortality at day 30 after randomization. The secondary objective: - To compare, in patients hospitalized for an acute medical illness, enoxaparin with Graduated Elastic Stockings versus enoxaparin placebo with Graduated Elastic Stockings on overall mortality at day 90 after randomization. - To evaluate the safety of enoxaparin VTE prophylaxis in patients hospitalized for acute medical illness with respect to major hemorrhage, total bleedings, heparin induced thrombocytopenia, adverse events and serious adverse events .</brief_summary>
