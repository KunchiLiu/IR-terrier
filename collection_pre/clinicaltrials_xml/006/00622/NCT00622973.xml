	<brief_summary>Preoperative detection of lymph node metastases in patients with prostate or bladder cancer is crucial for selection of the appropriate treatment strategy (surgery, androgen deprivation with/or without radiation therapy or chemotherapy) and thus for patient prognosis. Until now CT or MRI have been the modalities of choice for preoperative staging procedures. However, current morphological assessment of lymph nodes based on size and shape is unable to detect smaller metastases or liable to give false positive results on lymph nodes with reactive hyperplasia. We hypothesize that USPIO-enhanced MRI combined with DW-MRI will be able to detect pelvic lymph node metastases preoperatively with high sensitivity and specificity.</brief_summary>
