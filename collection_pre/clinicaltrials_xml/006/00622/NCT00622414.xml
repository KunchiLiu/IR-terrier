	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of aflibercept in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. Aflibercept may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aflibercept in Treating Young Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of aflibercept administered intravenously every 14 days in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. II. To estimate the MTD or RPTD of aflibercept administered intravenously every 21 days in these patients. III. To define and describe the toxicities of intravenous aflibercept administered on a 14-day and 21-day schedule, respectively. IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of intravenous aflibercept in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To define, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of intravenous aflibercept within the confines of a phase I study. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. PART 1: Patients receive aflibercept IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive aflibercept until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. PART 2: Patients receive aflibercept as in part 1 at 150% of the MTD determined in part 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples are collected prior to treatment on day 1 of courses 1, 2, and 5 or 6 for pharmacokinetic studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 30 days.</detailed_description>
