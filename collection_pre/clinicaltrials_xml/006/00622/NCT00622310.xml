	<brief_summary>This project is aimed at determining whether an exercise-based weight loss intervention causes a compensation in some component of energy expenditure such that the increase in measured energy expenditure is less than the added exercise. The study will compare two separate exercise interventions to determine if this is influenced by exercise intensity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Energy Expenditure &amp; Activity During &amp; After Exercise-Induced Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this proposed study is to determine how total daily activity thermogenesis (TDAT) and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) are regulated in obese humans attempting to lose weight and maintain weight loss through exercise. Two exercise interventions will be compared; a structured aerobic exercise program and a walking program. EAT will be verified, and NEAT, TDAT, and TDEE will be measured using state-of-the-art technologies. Subjects will be studied during a 6 month intervention period and then during a 6 month follow-up period. It is hypothesized that the walking program will have more favorable effects on TDAT and TDEE during both the intervention and follow-up periods. If our hypotheses are correct, then data from the proposed study could be used to improve the effectiveness of exercise-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance programs.</detailed_description>
