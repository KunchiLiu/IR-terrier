	<brief_summary>This was a randomized, double blinded, controlled trial. The aim of the study was to compare xylometazoline HCL nasal drops to inhalation of epinephrine as a treatment for bronchiolitis. The study hypothesis is:xylometazoline HCL nasal drops treatment is good as epinephrine inhalation for treatment of bronchiolitis. Signed informed consent was obtained from a parent of each child. And the human ethics committee of our hospital approved the study according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.(Approved - 2002) Patients: 65 infants who were admitted to Pediatric A- a general pediatric ward, in Schneider Children's Medical Center because of bronchiolitis during winter in two consecutive years 2004-2005.

	<detailed_description>All eligible patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 (control) received inhalation of epinephrine 1mg, in 2cc of 0.9% saline solution four times a day, and nasal drops of 0.9% saline for each nostril every twelve hours. Group 2 - the study group received four inhalation of 0.9% saline four times a day and one nasal drop of xylometazoline HCL to each nostril twice a day. This treatment continued until the patient was ready for discharge. Patients were examined and evaluated at the study entry and were re-evaluated every 10-12 hours. Length of hospital stay,time to improve Oxygen saturation, time to the need of IV fluid and clinical score between the two groups of treatment were compared.</detailed_description>
