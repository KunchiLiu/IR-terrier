	<brief_summary>We are performing a research study to learn more about the control of an individual's blood thinning (anticoagulation) on warfarin. Individuals from an anticoagulation clinic are being asked to participate in order to see if a lottery which provides the opportunity to win money in combination with the use of the Med-eMonitor might be useful in helping patients to achieve better control of their anticoagulation therapy. Half of the participants will be enrolled in the lottery arm and the other half will be a control group who will receive the Med-eMonitor only.</brief_summary>
