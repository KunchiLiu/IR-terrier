	<brief_summary>The previous two studies of generic GPO saquinavir failed to prove bioequivalence. In this study the bio-equivalence will be investigated in healthy Thai volunteers, to see whether the generic GPO saquinavir shows bioequivalence when boosted with Norvir®. If the generic formulation is bioequivalent subsequent studies may follow in HIV-1 positive patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Generic GPO Saquinavir and Norvir® Versus Invirase® and Norvir®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to establish bioequivalence of "ritonavir boosted generic GPO saquinavir", with Invirase® and Norvir® as the reference drug. The secondary objective is to evaluate the short-term tolerability and safety profiles of generic saquinavir in healthy male volunteers.</detailed_description>
