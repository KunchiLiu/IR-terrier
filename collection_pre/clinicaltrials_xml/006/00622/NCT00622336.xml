	<brief_summary>The study evaluated the safety of Lenalidomide monotherapy in participants with advanced multiple myeloma who had discontinued treatment with combination thalidomide plus high-dose dexamethasone or high-dose dexamethasone alone in studies Thal-MM-003, CC-5013-MM-009 and CC-5013-MM-010 due to the development of documented disease progression or the inability to tolerate the lowest dosing regimen per previous protocol of thalidomide and/or high-dose dexamethasone without grade 3 or 4 toxicity.</brief_summary>
