Known hypersensitivity to SS734 or to any of the ingredients in the study medications. Known hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones or to any of the ingredients in the study medications. Ocular surgery (including laser surgery) in either eye within the past six weeks. Subjects with suspected viral or allergic conjunctivitis (i.e., severe itching or acute follicular conjunctivitis), or any other disease conditions that could interfere with the efficacy and safety evaluations of the study medication.
