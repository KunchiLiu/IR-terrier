	<brief_summary>DiObex Inc. is developing an experimental drug (DIO-902) that is made up of part of the ketoconazole molecule for the treatment of elevated blood glucose associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Ketoconazole (NizoralÂ®) is a drug available by prescription for the treatment of fungal infections however DIO-902 is an investigational drug. DIO-902 may lower blood glucose by lowering levels of a naturally occurring hormone called cortisol. Elevated cortisol may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Label Safety &amp; Pharmacodynamic Study 24Wk w/DIO-902 Combo w/Metformin &amp; Atorvastatin in T2DM Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To maintain the blind in Protocol DIO-502, subjects will be re-randomized at Study Visit 1 to one of three doses of DIO-902: 150, 300 or 450 mg QHS. All subjects receiving DIO-902 placebo and 50% of subjects receiving DIO-902 will be re-randomized to one of three DIO-902 doses. The remaining 50% of subjects receiving DIO-902 will be assigned to their original DIO-902 dose. The re- randomization will be performed by a group independent of study conduct to ensure the treatment status of the subject while in Protocol DIO-502 remains blinded. In addition, subjects will continue on the same dose of metformin that they had been taking during the conduct of Protocol DIO-502. Subjects will continue on atorvastatin 10 mg for the first 4 weeks of this protocol. Thereafter, at Study Visits 3 and 4, the dose of atorvastatin may be increased up to a maximum of 40 mg daily in order to achieve LDL-cholesterol/non-HDL cholesterol goals specified within the protocol. In addition, after Study Visit 4 (Week 12) subjects with HbA1c levels of &gt; 7.5% (0.075 Hb Fract.) will undergo a one time titration of their oral hypoglycemic regimen as per the algorithm provided in the protocol.</detailed_description>
