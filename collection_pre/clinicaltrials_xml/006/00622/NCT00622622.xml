	<brief_title>Gemcitabine With Antiangiogenic Peptide Vaccine Therapy in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2(VEGFR2) is essential target for tumor angiogenesis, and VEGFR2-169 induces specific Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) against VEGFR2 expressed targets. VEGFR2-169 shows strong anti-tumor effects restricted to HLA-A*2402 in vitro, and this peptide induces CTL from cancer patients. 60% in Japanese population have HLA-A*2402. VEGFR2-169 is suitable for clinical trial, and gemcitabine has been approved against pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine is reported to improve immune-response, therefore synergistic effect between vaccine therapy and chemotherapy will be expected. In this clinical trial, we evaluate the safety, tolerability and immune response of different doses of VEGFR2-169 emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 in combination with gemcitabine and to determine the recommended phase II dose of peptide.</detailed_description>
