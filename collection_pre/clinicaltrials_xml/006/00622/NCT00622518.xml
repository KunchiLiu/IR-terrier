	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a commercially available homeopathic ear drop preparation is effective in reducing symptoms in children 6 months - 11 years old with acute otitis media. A total of 120 study patients with otitis media will be randomized to receive homeopathic ear drops, or no ear drops, in addition to receiving standard care. It is postulated that children using the ear drops will have more rapid resolution of symptoms and need fewer antibiotics than those randomized to not receive the ear drops.</brief_summary>
