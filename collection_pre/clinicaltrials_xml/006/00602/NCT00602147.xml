	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying blood or mouthwash samples in the laboratory from patients receiving melphalan for cancer may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA, identify biomarkers related to cancer, and help predict how patients will respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying common genetic mutations related to mucositis in patients with multiple myeloma receiving high-dose melphalan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Common Genetic Mutations Related to Mucositis in Patients With Multiple Myeloma Receiving High-Dose Melphalan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that encode the melphalan transporters are associated with the development and/or severity of mucositis in patients with multiple myeloma receiving high-dose melphalan. - To determine whether SNPs in genes that influence melphalan metabolism are associated with the development and/or severity of mucositis in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Blood or mouthwash samples are collected and DNA isolated from these specimens is analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LAT1 or other candidate genes. Public databases (i.e., dbSNP and HapMap) are reviewed to select representative SNPs for genotype analysis.</detailed_description>
