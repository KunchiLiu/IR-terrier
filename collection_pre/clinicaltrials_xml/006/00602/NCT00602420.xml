	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Naproxen may help prevent or lessen bone pain caused by pegfilgrastim. It is not yet known whether naproxen is more effective than a placebo in preventing bone pain caused by pegfilgrastim in patients with non-hematologic cancer undergoing chemotherapy. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying naproxen to see how well it works compared with a placebo in preventing bone pain caused by pegfilgrastim in patients with non-hematologic cancer undergoing chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Pegfilgrastim-Induced Bone Pain (PIBP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To compare the efficacy of daily administration of naproxen vs placebo in preventing or reducing the severity and duration of pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain (PIBP) in patients with non-hematologic malignancies undergoing chemotherapy. Secondary - To identify potential risk factors for the development of PIBP. - To identify potential clinical predictors for the response or failure to respond to naproxen in preventing PIBP. - To assess the toxicity of naproxen when administered in the preventive setting. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by Clinical Community Oncology Program (CCOP) site. Patients are randomized to 1 treatment arm vs placebo. - Arm I: Patients receive oral naproxen twice daily beginning on the day pegfilgrastim is administered (day 2, 3, or 4) and continuing for 5-8 days. - Arm II: Patients receive matching placebo twice daily beginning on the day pegfilgrastim is administered (day 2, 3, or 4) and continuing for 5-8 days.</detailed_description>
