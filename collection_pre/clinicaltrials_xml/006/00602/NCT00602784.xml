	<brief_summary>The objectives are 1. to determine the immunological profile (CD4+, CD8+ cells, DTH) induced by immunization with HCV antigen peptide vaccine with polyarginine. 2. to document virological (HCV-RNA) and biochemical (ALT) responses following immunization with HCV antigen peptide vaccine with polyarginine. 3. to assess the safety of immunization with HCV antigen peptide vaccine with polyarginine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Immunization With a Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Antigen Peptide Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double blind, randomized, parallel group, controlled, multicenter phase II study. 60 patients will be enrolled and assigned to one of the 5 dose or control groups. Each study group will include 8 patients. Each patient will receive a total of 6 injections according to the dose of the assigned study group. The injections will be administered subcutaneously in the upper arm once every four weeks for 5 months, i.e. at days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113 and 141. The volume of each injection will be 0.5 ml in all groups.</detailed_description>
