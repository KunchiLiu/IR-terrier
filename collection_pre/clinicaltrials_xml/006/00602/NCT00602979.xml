	<brief_summary>The placement of endotracheal tubes (intubation) is a physiologically stressful procedure for patients. Laryngoscopes are devices-typically composed of a blade attached to a handle with a light source—that allow examination of the upper airway through the mouth, often for the purposes of intubation. Recently some new laryngoscope devices (including the Airtraq® Optical Laryngoscope, the Storz DCI Video laryngoscope®, McGRATH® Video Laryngoscope, and the GlideScope®) have been developed, which may either decrease the stress related to intubation (reduce neck extension, reduce risk of complications or reduce time elapsed during intubation) or improve intubation success (reduce the number of attempts at intubating). Data are being collected in this study to determine which of these commonly-used devices may be better, particularly in comparison to the current hospital standard, the Macintosh laryngoscope. All of the devices to be used in this study are currently cleared or exempt by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</brief_summary>
