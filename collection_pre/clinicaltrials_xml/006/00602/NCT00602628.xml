	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as multifunctional magnetic resonance imaging and CT scans, may help reduce normal tissue damage in patients undergoing radiation therapy for cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well radiation therapy planning techniques work in reducing damage to normal tissue in women undergoing breast-conserving surgery for ductal breast carcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Planning Techniques in Reducing Damage to Normal Tissue in Women Undergoing Breast-Conserving Surgery for Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To improve precision of tumor bed localization and definition of clinical target volume, and to reduce normal tissue irradiation in women undergoing partial breast or breast boost radiotherapy. - To test whether post-operative MRI improves the precision of tumor bed delineation after wide-local excision in comparison with the current standard CT scan/clip method. - To determine the impact of tumor position within the excision specimen upon the localization of clinical target volume in relation to the tumor bed. - To compare theoretical non-target tissue exposure from partial breast irradiation planned in the supine and prone (face-down) positions. OUTLINE: Patients undergo planned breast-conservation surgery and placement of titanium clips to the four radial, the deep, and superficial margins of the excision cavity (for localization of tumor bed). Within 2 weeks after surgery, patients undergo supine radiotherapy-planning CT scan as standard analysis. Patients then undergo a radiotherapy-planning CT scan in the prone position. Patients complete a linear analogue questionnaire after both scans designed to assess patient comfort and anxiety in each position. Patients then undergo multifunctional MRI (including dynamic contrast-enhancement MRI and diffusion-weighted MRI) of the ipsilateral breast in the prone position (≥ 3 weeks after surgery). If suspicious lesions ≥ 5 mm are found on MRI, patients are referred for a second-look ultrasound with biopsy (if lesion visible on ultrasound); where suspicious lesions are seen only on MRI, patients undergo MRI-guided biopsy. Lesions &lt; 5 mm are included in the whole-breast radiotherapy treatment.</detailed_description>
