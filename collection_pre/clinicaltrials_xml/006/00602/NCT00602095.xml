	<brief_summary>This is a randomised study aimed at comparing the currently most frequently used prostaglandin dinoprostone to two other methods, the cheaper and perhaps more effective prostaglandin misoprostol and a transcervical catheter. 592 women were recruited and randomised to one of the three methods. The main outcome measures were time to delivery, rate of instrumental deliveries and maternal neonatal outcome. Our hypothesis was that misoprostol would be superior to the other methods. The main finding of our trial was that the catheter showed the shortest induction to delivery interval. There were no differences between the two other prostaglandins. No differences in maternal and neonatal outcome was found</brief_summary>
