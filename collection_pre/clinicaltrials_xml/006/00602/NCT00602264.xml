	<brief_title>Adipokines and Ghrelin Concentrations in Different Stages of Anorexia Nervosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: The aim of this study is to determine serum concentrations of adiponectin (ApN), leptin and ghrelin in different stages of anorectic patients and to evaluate their relationships between biochemical, hormonal and anthropometric parameters. Design: The study group is composed of four groups. Group1: Treatment-naïve patients with a recent diagnosis of AN (n:19), Group 2: The weight recovered (10 % increase in body weight compared with baseline weight) subgroup of group 1 at the end of a mean 117.72±98.14 days of follow-up (n: 12), Group 3: Recovered patients with a previous history of AN but normal menstrual cycles and body weight at the present time (n:10), Group 4: Control group: constitutionally thin healthy young women with normal menstrual cycles (n:10). Venous blood was obtained for measurements of biochemical parameters, ApN, leptin and ghrelin and body composition was determined by bioimpedance analysis.</detailed_description>
