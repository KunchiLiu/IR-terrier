	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of patient education (PE) in patients with arthritis. PE has become a task that is dictated by law in Norway, and is increasingly used as an element in the treatment of patients with chronic complaints. Our hypothesis is that - PE delivered as group education, followed by an individual nurse consultation increases the patients wellbeing an ability to cope with the disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Patient Education in Rheumatic Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There has been a rather long tradition of PE for patients with arthritis. A recent systematic review found that PE had small short-term effects on disability, joint counts, patient global assessment, psychological status and depression, but this effect disappeared on the latest time of follow up (3-14 months). A recent large British study also failed to show an effect on pain, physical functioning, or contact with primary care after 12 months, but found a significant effect on anxiety and improved the participants' perceived self efficacy. This indicates that the present forms of interventions fails to show a long term effect. One possible reason for the lack of long term effect might be that these interventions are given to groups only. Patients seem to prefer one-to-one interaction regarding information about the disease and its treatment together with emotional aspects, while education in groups are preferred for physical training and relational topics.</detailed_description>
