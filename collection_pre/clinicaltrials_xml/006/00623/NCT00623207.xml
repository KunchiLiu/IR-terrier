	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the Safety and feasibility of atropine added during treadmill stress testing in patients with chronotropic incompetence or poor exercise capacity. Our hypothesis is that we can increase heart rate by using atropin in these patients, so we will achieve more conclusive results.</brief_summary>
