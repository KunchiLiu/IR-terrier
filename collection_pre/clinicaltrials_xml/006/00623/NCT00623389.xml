	<detailed_description>Protocol Outline: Patents undergo surgery in which electrodes are implanted into muscles of the trunk and legs. Electrode leads are connected to an stimulator/telemeter. Following implantation, patients undergo training in standing, transfers and other advanced mobility skills using the functional electrical stimulation system. A prescribed course of exercise, functional training and rehabilitation with the implanted stimulation system, followed by laboratory assessments of strength, balance and functional abilities with and without the system, as well as the technical performance of the implanted components. Home-based training follows prior to discharge for home use of the system. Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months after discharge and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
