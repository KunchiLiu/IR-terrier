	<brief_title>Left Ventricular Function Assessment After Acute Myocardial Infarction: Comparison Between Bi-, Three-dimensional and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a critical step after a myocardial infarction because it determines the prognosis and the therapeutic management (indication of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators). Three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) are accurate and reproducible techniques to quantify left ventricular volumes and LVEF. However, all the large randomized trials which evaluated the role of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) on survival in primary prevention were based on LVEF values obtained by older techniques like bi-dimensional echocardiography (2DE), angiography or radionuclide scanning. From now, no study has compared the measurements of left ventricular volumes and LVEF obtained by further current techniques after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) particularly after 1 month when ICD could be indicated.</detailed_description>
