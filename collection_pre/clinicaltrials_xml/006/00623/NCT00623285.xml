	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that the perioperative administration of pregabalin will significantly decrease pain scores and post-operative opioid requirements for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, and reduces the incidence of opioid-induced side effects such as respiratory depression. This may reduce ICU admission and possibly abbreviate length of hospital stay.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients whom are able and willing to provide written informed consent. Male and female 1870 years of age. Patients whom are undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting through a midline sternotomy for the treatment of ischemic heart disease. Exclusion criteria Patients undergoing cardiac surgery for valvular or pericardial surgery. Patients with a documented ejection fraction of less than 50%. Patients with known chronic renal insufficiency and a calculated creatinine clearance of &lt; 60mL/min. Patients with known sensitivity to the study drugs. Patients with documented preexisting chronic pain. Patients with seizure disorders. Patients whom are taking pregabalin or gabapentin Patients on chronic neuroleptic medications for control of psychiatric disorders as to avoid possible drug interactions and to avoid modulation of any pain states by such medications. Patients whom are taking tricyclic antidepressants or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors(SNRI) will be excluded because of the effect of these drugs on neuropathic pain. Patients greater than 70 years of age will also be excluded because of their increased risk of sideeffects and perioperative confusion. Pregnant or breast feeding females</criteria>
