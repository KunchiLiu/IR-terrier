	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a 3-day course of therapy with orally administered VCH-916 given at different dosages can effectively reduce the amount of circulating virus (i.e., viral load) in patients with early-stage chronic hepatitis C-infection. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of treatment with VCH-916. Blood samples will also be taken to measure the levels of VCH-916 present in plasma at various time points during the treatment period.</brief_summary>
