	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine if treating patients who have coronary heart disease with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) prior to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery reduces injury to the heart and vascular system during and after surgery. Furthermore, this study also aims to identify some of the post CABG clinical effects of HBO treatment prior to CABG.</brief_summary>
