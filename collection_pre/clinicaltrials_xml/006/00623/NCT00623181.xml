	<brief_summary>To describe any degree of preference for the route of administration of Fluzone influenza vaccine, ID versus IM, in healthy adult subjects 18-49 years of age. To collect safety data, injection site reactions, and systemic reactions, through Day 7 post-vaccination; SAEs through day 28 post-vaccination</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Determine a Preference for Fluzone Vaccine Given Intradermally (ID) and Intramuscularly (IM) in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine, in a relatively small sample of persons 18-49 years of age, if there is a preference trend for a particular route of administration, ID vs IM, when receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine. Uptake of influenza vaccine is disappointingly low in this age group, and there is the perception that aversion to IM injection plays a role in vaccination avoidance. The BD Micro-Injection System to be used in this study may offer a more acceptable alternative to the standard IM injection for influenza immunization and thereby promote wider acceptance of influenza vaccination.</detailed_description>
