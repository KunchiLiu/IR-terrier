	<brief_title>Bioenergetic Alterations After Exenatide Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The bioenergetics study is looking at how and why the diabetes drug exenatide causes people to lose weight.Bioenergetics is the study of how your body burns calories. Adults 18-65 who do not have diabetes and have a body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 may be eligible. Women who could get pregnant must be on birth control during the study and women who are pregnant cannot participate in the study. Subjects will take exenatide for 12 weeks. There are 6 study visits in the Univ. Wisconsin Hospital General Clinical Research Center. Visits range from 1 to 6 hours and include blood and urine tests, resting metabolic rate testing over a four hour period, physical exam, ECG, and a be bone mineral density testing at another clinic during 2 clinic visits of the study. All study procedures and testing are free of charge.</detailed_description>
