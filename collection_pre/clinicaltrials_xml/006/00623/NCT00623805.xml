	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study assessed the efficacy and safety of maintenance treatment with Avastin (bevacizumab) + Xeloda (capecitabine), after initial treatment with Xeloda + oxaliplatin + Avastin, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients were randomized into one of 2 groups to receive 1) Xeloda + oxaliplatin + Avastin until disease progression or 2) Xeloda + oxaliplatin + Avastin for 6 3-week cycles, followed by Xeloda + Avastin until disease progression. Xeloda was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m^2 orally twice a day on days 1-14 of each cycle, oxaliplatin at a dose of 130 mg/m^2 intravenously (iv) on day 1 of each cycle, and Avastin at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg iv on day 1 of each cycle.</brief_summary>
