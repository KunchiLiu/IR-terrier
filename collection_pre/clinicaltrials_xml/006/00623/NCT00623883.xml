	<brief_summary>We hypothesized that aberrant crypt foci (ACF) are precursors of colon cancer; their prevention would correlate with cancer risk and their elimination would reduce that risk. In this study we wished to (1) establish the feasibility of stain-enhanced magnification colonoscopy, (2) determine whether colorectal cancer is asociated with increased numbers of ACF, and (3) investigate the natural history of ACF and the durability of their elimination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Colonoscopic Removal of Aberrant Crypt Foci: a Prospective, Randomized, Blinded Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects are randomly assigned at the time of stain-enhanced magnification colonoscopy to have any ACF removed or merely observed. Subjects are evenly divided into those with and those without a personal history of colon cancer. ACF are tabulated by an observer blinded to the subject's personal history. All subjects are then re-evaluated after one year by an observer blinded to the original procedure.</detailed_description>
