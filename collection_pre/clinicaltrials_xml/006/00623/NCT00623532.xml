	<brief_summary>Few previous studies have explored the effects of mind body approaches on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in frail elderly. Cognition and action are an inseparable whole while functioning. A new intervention-based approach using familiarity based movements and a non-judgmental approach was labeled "cognition-action." The investigators aimed to explore the effects of two different mind-body exercise types on (HRQoL) in frail institutionalized elderly. The investigators' main hypothesis is that adaptated physical activity in frail institutionalized elderly can improve HRQoL.</brief_summary>
