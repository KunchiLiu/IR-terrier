	<brief_summary>The prognosis for older individuals with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has been historically poor, with 2 year disease-free survival rates &lt; 20% reported. Younger patients with AML in first complete remission are routinely treated using a full intensity (myelo-ablative) chemotherapy followed by a blood stem cell transplant. For the older patient with AML, full intensity therapy transplants have been greatly limited by increased rates of toxic effects related to this type of conditioning regimen. Reduced intensity (non-myeloablative) conditioning regimens have been used in a number of clinical settings, including AML therapy, to lessen the regimen related toxicity in the older patient. Recent data from the University of Michigan Blood and Marrow Transplant Program suggests improved survival for individuals &gt; 55 years in age undergoing reduced intensity, transplants from unrelated donors. This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of this treatment option for older patients with AML, with the primary goal being to improve the survival and lifespan for older patients with AML.</brief_summary>
