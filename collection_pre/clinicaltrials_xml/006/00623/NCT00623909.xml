	<criteria>Men and women age 2565 years old with chest wall pain after lung surgery lasting more than 2 months after surgery. Subjects shall have failed conservative treatment which may include rest, physical therapy, braces, and over the counter antiinflammatory medications. All those enrolled will be native English speakers and have at least a high school degree Subjects will be excluded if they are pregnant (which will be confirmed by a urine pregnancy test if they are of childbearing age) Have previous history of other pain syndromes or psychiatric disorders. We will exclude the morbidly obese (BMI &gt;30) because the laser may not be able to penetrate deep enough through adipose tissue. In addition, subjects who have had previous back surgery, or are on antidepressants for the treatment of depression in the preceding 6 weeks will be excluded as these may represent potential confounding factors.</criteria>
