	<brief_summary>This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of RO5045337 and the optimal associated 4 weekly dosing schedule of RO5045337, administered as monotherapy in patients with hematologic neoplasms. A first cohort of patients will receive the starting dose of 20mg/m2/day orally, once daily for 10 days in each 28 day cycle. Subsequent cohorts of patients will receive dose escalations, and possible changes in dosing schedule, based on tolerability and pharmacokinetic knowledge gained from prior treatment cohorts. Different formulations of RO5045337 will be tested and the food effect evaluated. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.</brief_summary>
