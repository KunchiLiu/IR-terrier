	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures, such as vibro-acoustography imaging, may be an effective method of diagnosing breast cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well vibro-acoustography imaging works in diagnosing breast masses in women with a breast mass or breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vibro-Acoustography Imaging in Diagnosing Breast Masses in Women With a Breast Mass or Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To study in vivo detection of breast masses by vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging. - To evaluate the performance of VA imaging in differentiating between benign and malignant breast masses identified as BI-RADS 4 or 5. OUTLINE: Patients undergo clinical mammography of the breast, followed by vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging using ultrasonography over 90 minutes. Patients may also undergo further imaging using clinical ultrasonography.</detailed_description>
