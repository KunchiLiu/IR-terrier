	<brief_title>The Atrial High Rate Episodes in Pacemaker Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence of fast heart rates that originate in the upper chamber of the heart (atrial tachyarrhythmias) in pacemaker patients that have not been previously diagnosed with this condition. The study will also look at how the diagnostic feature in the pacemaker that detects atrial tachyarrhythmias helps physicians with the medical management of patients' heart rhythm.</detailed_description>
