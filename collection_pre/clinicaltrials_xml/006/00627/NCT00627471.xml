	<brief_summary>To compare in terms of HbA1c insulin naive patients with Type 2 Diabetes starting with insulin glargine on an algorithm with insulin naive patients starting with insulin glargine on the physician's standard practice. To compare in terms of FBG insulin naïve patients starting with insulin glargine on an algorithm with insulin naïve patients starting with insulin glargine on the physician's standard practice. To compare the percentage of patients achieving HbA1c&lt; 7% in each treatment group. To compare hypoglycaemic events (minor, severe and nocturnal) between groups. To compare average insulin dose between groups. To compare PRO (patients' reported outcomes) between groups. To compare mean changes in body weight between treatment groups.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients in treatment with OADs (one or more) for at least 1 year who failed metabolic control (HbA1c &gt; 8% and &lt; 11%). FBG &gt; 130 mg/dl and &lt; 240 mg/dl. BMI &lt; 40 kg/m2 and &gt;25 kg/m2. Ability and willingness to follow a tight antidiabetic therapy and to perform SMBG controls. C peptide &lt; 0.30 nmol/l. Unexplained weight loss of more than 10% of body weight in the last 6 months. Pregnant women or women with the intention of becoming pregnant. Women with childbearing potential who will not use contraceptive protection. Breastfeeding women. Patients using or that have used rapid or ultrarapid acting insulins; except for those patients that have used rapid or ultrarapid insulins during intercurrences such as AMI, severe infection or surgery. Renal impairment defined as serum creatinine &gt;1.4 mg/dl in women and &gt;1.5 mg/dl in men. Hepatic impairment defined as GPT or GOT above 2x the normal threshold. Likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with drugs not permitted by the study protocol (non selective beta blockers and systemic corticosteroids). History of drug or alcoholic abuse. Diabetic retinopathy with surgical treatment in the 3 months prior to study entry or which may require surgical treatment within 6 months of study entry. Clinically relevant cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, neurological, endocrine, hematological, oncologic or other major systemic disease making implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult, at the discretion of the investigator. Evidence of an uncooperative attitude, including poor compliance to any anti diabetic treatment. Known hypersensitivity to insulin glargine. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial</criteria>
