	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with oxaliplatin works compared to gemcitabine alone in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine With Or Without Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced urothelial cancer treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride with vs without oxaliplatin. Secondary - Determine the tolerance of these regimens in these patients. - Determine the overall survival and progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the duration of response in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 120 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. - Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 100 minutes on days 1 and 15 and oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes on days 2 and 16. Treatment in both arms repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.</detailed_description>
