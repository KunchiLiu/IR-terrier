	<brief_summary>Compared to placebo, treatment with ChAgly CD3 has a beneficial effect on preservation of beta cell function and metabolic outcome in type 1 diabetic patients with recent clinical onset of disease that persists until 48 months after administration. The investigators also hypothesize that in type 1 diabetic patients with recent clinical onset of disease compared to placebo, ChAgly CD3 will be safe and well tolerated between 18 and 48 months after administration, based on assessment of clinical and laboratory adverse events.</brief_summary>
