	<brief_summary>Chronic postherniotomy pain affects every day activities in 5-8% of patients. However, no established treatment for this pain syndrome exists and previous reports on the effect of surgical intervention suffer from methodological problems. The neurophysiological characteristics suggest that pain arises from deeper neuronal structures injured during surgery or by ongoing inflammation from the mesh. This study investigates the effect of removing inserted mesh and compressed nerves on pain related daily impairment of activities assessed by the validated AAS questionnaire before and 6 months after surgery</brief_summary>
