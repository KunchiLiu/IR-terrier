	<brief_summary>DYNAMIT is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open strategy trial run in 45 French hospitals. Diabetic patients with no evidence of coronary artery disease and at least 2 additional cardiovascular risk factors are randomized to screening for silent ischemia using a bicycle exercise test or Dipyridamole Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (N=316), or follow-up without screening (N=315). All have access to cardiovascular prevention according current guidelines. The main end point is time to death from all causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or heart failure requiring hospitalization or emergency service intervention.</brief_summary>
