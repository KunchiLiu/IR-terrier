	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of PTK787/ZK222584 administered daily in subjects with neuroendocrine tumors that are experiencing progressive disease and/or whose tumor-related syndrome symptoms (flushing and diarrhea) are considered inadequately controlled despite optimal doses of octreotide therapy. Inadequate control is defined as a minimum of 2 flushing episodes or 6 bowel movements per day for 7 consecutive days. Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria and have completed all baseline and screening testing will receive an initial dose of PTK787/ZK222584 1,250 mg once daily and subjects will also remain on the scheduled doses of Sandostatin LAR 30 mg every 4 weeks. Both drugs will be dosed on a flat schedule of mg, not by weight or body surface area. The PTK787/ZK222584 medication will be taken orally with daily dosing. Each tablet of PTK787/ZK 222584 is 250 mg. The subject will take five tablets of study medication per day 2 tabs am and 3 tabs pm. Subjects may continue to receive therapy as long as they do not experience unacceptable toxicities or evidence of disease progression as defined by RECIST criteria. Subjects will be evaluated with a daily log to assess the degree of symptom control (flushing and diarrhea) and subjects will be monitored every 2 weeks for 3 months then monthly for biochemical control and every three months for tumor response. Subjects will be monitored by the Investigator every two weeks for 3 months then monthly for safety and efficacy.</brief_summary>

Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test 48 hours prior to study treatment. Any of the following concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions which could compromise participation in the study: Uncontrolled high blood pressure, history of labile hypertension, or history of poor compliance with an antihypertensive regimen Unstable angina pectoris Symptomatic congestive heart failure Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to randomization Active or uncontrolled infection Interstitial pneumonia or extensive &amp; symptomatic interstitial fibrosis of the lung Chronic renal disease Subjects at risk of significant cardiac arrhythmias Uncontrolled diabetes Acute or chronic liver disease Impairment of gastrointestinal function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of PTK787/ZK 222584 A confirmed diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus infection are excluded at the investigator's discretion If you are taking therapeutic warfarin sodium or similar oral anticoagulants. Heparin is allowed. If you are unwilling to or unable to comply with the protocol If you have symptomatic gallstones If you have received glucocorticoid therapy within 6 months, or who are currently receiving any chemotherapeutic agents, insulin sensitizers, or exogenous growth hormones If you have unacceptable concomitant diagnoses, or who have received medication and/or therapies that would place the patient at increase risk, or would in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with the evaluation of efficacy and safety If you exhibit symptoms indicative of intolerance of Sandostatin LAR</criteria>
