	<brief_summary>Parkinson's Disease is a major neurodegenerative disorder in which there is a progressive loss of dopamine-containing neurons. The understanding that PD is a syndrome of dopamine (DA) deficiency led to the introduction in the clinical practice of L-dopa, a precursor of DA that crosses the blood brain barrier, and also to the use of selective inhibitors of MAO-B, the major DA metabolising enzyme in man. Safinamide is an inhibitor of MAO-B. This is a phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of safinamide (50 and 100 mg p.o. q.a.m.) compared to placebo as add-on therapy to a stable dose to levodopa in subjects with advance idiopathic Parkinson's Disease. The principal efficacy measure is the increase in mean daily "on" time during the 18-hr diary recording period.</brief_summary>
