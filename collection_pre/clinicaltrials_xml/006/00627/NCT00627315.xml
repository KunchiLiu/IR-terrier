	<brief_title>Prospective Study of Hormone Levels After Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be recruited from the outpatient obesity and surgical clinics at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center after they have chosen to undergo a surgical procedure. The groups will not be randomized. Rather, they will decide on their choice of surgery along with their physicians. The patients will be evaluated pre-operatively and followed post-operatively for 5 years. Initial evaluation will include a complete history and physical examination, measurement of calcium, PTH and vitamin D, and assessment of skeletal health using markers of bone turnover and bone mineral density.</detailed_description>
