	<brief_title>Utility of Amantadine Hydrochloride in the Treatment of Post-traumatic Irritability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amantadine hydrochloride is a drug used commonly in clinical practice at the Carolinas Rehabilitation for the treatment of mood and behavior changes following traumatic brain injury. Clinical observation suggests that the use of amantadine improves caregiver report of "irritability" though there are no studies to validate this observation. This study investigates the efficacy and side effect profile of amantadine hydrochloride given in 2 doses of 100 mgs each. Subjects are screened during regularly scheduled clinic appointments for the presence of irritability. If they are interested in possible participation in the study, they will be invited to meet with the research coordinator who will obtain informed consent. If the subject meets all the inclusion/exclusion requirements, they will leave clinic with study medication and begin taking the drug the next day. There will be a safety call between day 3 and 5 where the dose may be reduced to once per day. Follow-up assessment occurs at day 14 (by phone) and day 28 (in clinic). At study completion, the subject will have the opportunity to receive a prescription for amantadine as part of ongoing clinical care.</detailed_description>
