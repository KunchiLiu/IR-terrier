	<brief_summary>A multicentre randomized controlled trial that will be conducted at Level 1 trauma centres across Canada. It will compare patients who receive open reduction, internal fixation for Sanders IV calcaneal fractures to patients who receive primary subtalar fusion for the same type of fracture. Patients will be followed up for a period of two years from the time of operation with evaluations being performed at 5 time points: 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months.</brief_summary>
