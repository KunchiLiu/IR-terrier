	<brief_title>Safety Study of Oral MGCD265 Administered With Interruption to Subjects With Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MGCD265 belongs to a new class of drugs with anticancer potential, known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. MGCD265 was shown to slow down the growth of human cancer cells in mice. Clinical studies are being pursued to evaluate the safety of MGCD265 in cancer patients. In this study, oral MGCD265 is administered daily on a 7 days on / 7 days off schedule to patients with advanced malignancies.</detailed_description>
