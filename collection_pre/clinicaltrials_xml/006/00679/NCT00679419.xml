	<brief_summary>It is the aim of the multi-centric and prospective registry to analyze in patients with CAD the impact of different grades of renal failure on the outcome and course of the patients and to correlate these with clinical variables. In particular, the registry has the following objectives: - prospective consecutive assessment of all patients with coronary artery disease and renal failure in the participating hospitals of the registry - evaluation of the outcome and course of patients with regard to their different stages of renal failure at baseline - analysis of the impact of different therapeutic strategies on acute and long-term outcomes - identification of clinical risk factors, novel biomarkers and genetic markers for an unfavorable long-term outcome</brief_summary>
