	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND The insulin-like growth factor system (IGFs) plays an important role in cell growth and differentiation. Nevertheless, the roles played by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and human growth hormone (HGH) in the progression of chronic liver disease remain to be elucidated and investigated. METHODS The subjects in the present study included 60 healthy controls, 30 hepatitis patients, 60 liver cirrhosis patients and 60 untreated hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Blood was drawn by venipuncture into Venoject tubes. To find the possible correlations between liver damage and IGFs, serum IGF-1, GH, IGFBP-3 concentration and related biochemical parameters were measured. We used immunoradiometric assay to determine the levels of IGF-1, HGH and IGFBP-3 in serum.</brief_summary>
