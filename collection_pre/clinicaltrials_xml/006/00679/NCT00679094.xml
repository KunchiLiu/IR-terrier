	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the toxicity of single-dose Bowman-Birk Inhibitor Concentrate (BBIC) when administered as a suspension in orange juice in healthy male participants. II. Determine the appropriate dose range and doses to be used in a subsequent phase I multiple-dose BBIC study that will be based upon the data gathered from this phase I single-dose study. III. Characterize the pharmacokinetics of single-dose BBIC. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Bowman-Birk Inhibitor Concentrate (BBIC). Participants are sequentially assigned to 1 of 4 dose level cohorts. One participant in each dose level cohort is randomized to receive placebo or BBIC. Participants receive a single dose of oral BBIC or placebo, as an orange juice suspension, immediately followed by consumption of a defined low-fat breakfast. Participants continue to consume a low-fat diet for the next 48 hours and then resume their normal diet. Participants undergo blood and urine sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies. Samples are analyzed by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure concentrations of BBIC and its metabolites in serum and urine. After completion of study treatment, participants are followed once weekly for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
