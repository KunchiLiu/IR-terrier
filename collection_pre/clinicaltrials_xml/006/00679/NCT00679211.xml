	<criteria>Signed studyspecific Informed Consent Form(s) Age ≥ 18 years Histologically documented breast cancer HER2positive disease Metastatic breast cancer Disease progression on the last chemotherapy regimen received in the metastatic setting Prior treatment with an anthracycline, trastuzumab, a taxane, lapatinib, and capecitabine in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, locally advanced, or metastatic setting and prior treatment with at least two lines of therapy (a line of therapy can be a combination of two agents or singleagent chemotherapy) in the metastatic setting At least two lines of antiHER2 therapy must have been given in the metastatic setting as monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. The HER2targeted agent can include trastuzumab, lapatinib, or an investigational agent with HER2inhibitory activity. A minimum of 6 weeks of trastuzumab for the treatment of metastatic disease is required Patients must have had at least 14 days of exposure in the metastatic setting to lapatinib and capecitabine (given together or separately) unless they were intolerant of lapatinib and/or capecitabine Chemotherapy ≤ 21 days before enrollment Trastuzumab ≤ 21 days before enrollment Hormone therapy ≤ 7 days before enrollment Granulocytestimulating agent &lt; 14 days before enrollment Investigational therapy ≤ 28 days before enrollment Previous radiotherapy for treatment of metastatic breast cancer ≤ 21 days before enrollment Brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control symptoms; or any radiation, surgery, or other therapy to control symptoms from brain metastases within 3 months of the first study treatment History of intolerance (including Grade 34 infusion reaction) or hypersensitivity to trastuzumab or murine proteins History of exposure to the following cumulative doses of anthracyclines: Doxorubicin or liposomal doxorubicin &gt; 500 mg/m^2; Epirubicin &gt; 900 mg/m^2; Mitoxantrone &gt; 120 mg/m^2 and idarubicin &gt; 90 mg/m^2 Peripheral neuropathy of Grade ≥ 3 per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), v3.0 History of other malignancy within the last 5 years, except for carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell carcinoma Current unstable angina History of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), or ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment History of myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% within 28 days of enrollment History of decreased LVEF to &lt; 50% or symptomatic CHF with previous adjuvant trastuzumab treatment Severe dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or requiring current continuous oxygen therapy Current severe, uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g., clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic disease) Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 28 days before enrollment or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of study treatment Current pregnancy or lactation Current known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis B, and/or hepatitis C virus Assessed by the investigator to be unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements of the protocol</criteria>
