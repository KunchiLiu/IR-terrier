	<criteria>Patients will be selected from a high risk population of hospital clinic attendees, defined as RA greater than 5 years' disease duration, and all will be RA latex seropositive or IgM RF ELISA &gt;14iu/ml. The subjects will be of either sex and &gt;40 years of age. Patients should have both tender and swollen joint counts &gt;4 each and either a CRP &gt;10mg/l, ESR &gt;25mm/h or PV &gt;1.78. Patients on cyclosporine or other medications known to be contraindicated with this form of drug will not be enrolled. The patient's hospital and general practice records will be scrutinised for evidence of symptomatic vascular disease. Any patient not free from vascular disease symptoms will be excluded. In addition to evidence of symptomatic vascular disease (either previous or current), the exclusion criteria consist also of those already taking lipidlowering therapy or those with contraindications to these therapies. Also excluded will be subjects with a total cholesterol level of &gt;7.5mmol/L as it might be argued that such patients merit primary prevention on the basis of dyslipidemia alone.</criteria>
