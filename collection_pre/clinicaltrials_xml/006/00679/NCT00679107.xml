	<brief_summary>This study will explore the use of OP-1 Putty in conjunction with surgical treatment for the treatment of spinal decompression and lumbar spinal fusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Pilot Study of the OP-1 Putty in Uninstrumented Posterolateral Fusions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is postulated that the addition of OP-1 Putty to autogenous bone will prove beneficial in the treatment of patients requiring decompression and lumbar spinal fusion. The Investigational system is intended to stimulate bone growth. It is indicated as an adjunct or a replacement for autograft in spinal fusion.</detailed_description>
