	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, open label, non randomized correlative study of AZD2281 in patients with recurrent breast and ovarian cancer in both BRCA inherited mutation carriers and non-carriers to identify objective response rate and to assess for early markers of activity and to assess correlative markers that may provide helpful information for subsequent clinical trials. Approximately 110 patients from 7 centers in Canada will be enrolled into this study.</brief_summary>
