	<brief_summary>In this study, we evaluate whether dietary advice based on two healthy nutritional programs can be effectively delivered to families over one month by telephone. We hypothesize that among overweight school age children, a one-month telephone intervention will result in specific dietary changes consistent with the randomly assigned dietary intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nutrition Study for School Age Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overweight and obesity have increasingly become problems faced by children. However, the best dietary approach for managing weight in children remains unclear and how to make dietary advice practical remains a challenge. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of a one-month telephone-based dietary intervention for pediatric obesity in achieving changes in the target variable (dietary glycemic load or dietary fat) of the assigned intervention. We hypothesis that among overweight school age children, a one-month telephone intervention will elicit specific dietary changes consistent with the randomly assigned prescriptions. Specifically, children counseled to reduce glycemic load will achieve a significantly greater mean reduction in glycemic load than those counseled to reduced dietary fat and, conversely, those counseled to reduce dietary fat will achieve a significantly greater mean reduction in dietary fat than those counseled to reduce glycemic load. The first ten participants enrolled will comprise a pilot study group intend to inform study design/methods and will not be included in the primary analysis.</detailed_description>
