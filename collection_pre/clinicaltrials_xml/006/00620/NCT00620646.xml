	<brief_title>The Comparison of Effects Between Increased Dose of Clopidogrel and Addition of Cilostazol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using dual antiplatelet agents with aspirin and clopidogrel is essential after drug-eluting stent implantation to prevent restenosis and stent thrombosis. However, variable platelet response and potential resistance to therapy have emerged with clopidogrel. Several studies showed that clopidogrel resistance is associated with increased cardiovascular events after coronary interventions. New antiplatelet therapeutic strategy of is needed in case of clopidogrel resistance. We started this study to compare the effect of double dosing of clopidogrel to 150mg per day and adding cilostazol to standard dose of clopidogrel after the insertion of drug-eluting stent in patients with clopidogrel resistance.</detailed_description>
