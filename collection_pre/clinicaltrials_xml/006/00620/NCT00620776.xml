	<brief_title>Combined Treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aims of this study are to collect preliminary data relevant to the following hypotheses: 1. Primary Hypothesis: Acute phase improvement for combined cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) plus medication will be superior to medication alone. 2. Secondary Hypotheses: Combined CBT plus medication will be superior to medication alone on a number of secondary outcome measures, including the core feature of GAD (worry), depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and quality of life. 3. Additional Exploratory Aim: We will explore the comparative relapse rates for the combined CBT plus medication treatment and the medication alone treatment condition at 6-month follow-up.</detailed_description>
