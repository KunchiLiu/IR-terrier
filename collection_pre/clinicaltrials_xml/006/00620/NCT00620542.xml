	<criteria>Clinical indication for coronary angiography Angiographic evidence of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), as defined by at least 1 lesion in a native coronary artery that has &gt;20% reduction in lumen diameter by visual estimation Left main coronary artery must have &lt;=50% reduction in lumen diameter by visual estimation LDLC &gt;100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) for patients with no statin therapy in the past 4 weeks; LDLC &gt;80mg/dL (2.08mmol/L) for patients on therapy in the past 4 weeks Use of certain lipidlowering medication for more than 3 months within the previous 12 months. Longer periods of treatment are not permitted because of the potential effects of such therapy on coronary atherosclerosis. Patients who have symptoms consistent with moderate or greater severity of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). Clinically significant heart disease which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator (or designee), is likely to require coronary bypass surgery, cardiac transplantation, surgical repair and/or replacement during the course of the study</criteria>
