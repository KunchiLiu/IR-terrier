	<criteria>Male and female adults aged ≥ 40 years, who have signed an informed consent form prior to initiation of any studyrelated procedure. Cooperative outpatients with a diagnosis of moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as classified by the GOLD Guidelines (2006), and: Smoking history of at least 20 pack years. Postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) &lt; 80% and ≥ 30% of the predicted normal value. Postbronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 70%. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women. Women of childbearing potential. Patients who have been hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation in the 6 weeks prior to screening or during the runin period. Patients requiring oxygen therapy or who experience oxygen desaturation to &lt; 80% during cycle exercise on room air. Patients with a Wmax value &lt; 20 W (as determined by the incremental cycle endurance test) at screening. Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection within 6 weeks prior to screening. Patients with contraindications of cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Patients with concomitant pulmonary disease. Patients with a history (up to and including the screening visit) of asthma. Patients with diabetes Type I or uncontrolled diabetes Type II. Any patient with lung cancer or a history of lung cancer. Any patient with active cancer or a history of cancer with less than 5 years disease free survival time. Patients with a history of long QT syndrome or whose QTc interval (Bazett's) measured at the collection of informed consent visit (Visit 1) or randomization is prolonged. Patients who have been vaccinated with live attenuated vaccines within 30 days prior to screening or during the runin period. Patients unable to successfully use a dry powder inhaler device, metered dose inhaler (MDI), or perform spirometry measurements.
