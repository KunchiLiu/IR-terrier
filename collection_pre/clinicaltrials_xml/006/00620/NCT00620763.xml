	<brief_summary>The impact of protein sources such as beef as part of Western diet on calcium retention remains controversial. We propose to test the hypothesis that the positive effect of high protein intake (especially from meat protein) can offset the negative effect of protein-induced net acid load on bone metabolism and the retention of body calcium. Healthy postmenopausal women recruited from the community will consume two diets differing in meat protein and acid load for 7 weeks. Calcium retention from diets will be determined using a highly sensitive measurement of whole body retention of a calcium isotope added to the diet.</brief_summary>
