	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Atorvastatin to Treat Variant Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vasospastic angina is presented by myocardial ischemia with spasm of coronary artery accompanying chest pain or discomfort. The precise mechanisms have not been established, but a reduction in NO (nitric oxide) production, an imbalance between endothelium-derived relaxing and contracting factors,or an injury of endothelium have been suggested. Impaired FMD(flow mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation) in the brachial artery was demonstrated in vasospastic angina,and improvement of endothelial dysfunction with treatment of statin is documented in several studies. So, we expect that statin treatment for vasospastic angina provide additional therapeutic effects via improvement of endothelial dysfunction.</detailed_description>
