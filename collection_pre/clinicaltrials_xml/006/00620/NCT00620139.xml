	<brief_summary>This pilot study seeks to evaluate the feasibility of measuring the proximal effects of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) on the expression of potential therapeutic target molecules in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). Specifically, this study proposes to evaluate the extent to which CRT induces the differential expression of components along two critical, and potentially interdependent, molecular pathways: the arachidonic acid and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways.</brief_summary>

Breastfeeding, pregnancy or of childbearing potential (including those women who are less than two years post menopausal) and unable to confirm adequate contraception (abstinence, IUD, birth control pills, or spermicidal gel with diaphragm or condom) since last menses. History of chronic inflammatory disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis or pancreatitis). Corticosteroid use within 6 weeks of enrollment, excluding topical nasal sprays. NSAID (including celecoxib) or aspirin (&gt; 81 mg/day) use within 1 week of enrollment. Investigational medication use within 6 weeks of enrollment or is scheduled to receive an investigational drug during the course of the study.</criteria>
