	<brief_summary>This trial will evaluate whether the sequential administration of Cisplatin/Vinorelbine/Bevacizumab followed by Docetaxel/Gemcitabine/Bevacizumab versus the Cisplatin/Docetaxel/Bevacizumab combination as first line treatment offers a survival advantage in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin/Vinorelbine/Bevacizumab Followed by Docetaxel/Gemcitabine/Bevacizumab Versus the Cisplatin/Docetaxel/Bevacizumab Combination in Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An unanswered question in first line treatment of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is whether the administration of more than 2 active drugs provides greater efficacy than a two-drug combination. Docetaxel/gemcitabine combination is a well tolerated regimen, which has comparable efficacy to docetaxel/cisplatin or vinorelbine/cisplatin. In a recent phase II study in first line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC, the sequential administration of vinorelbine/cisplatin followed by docetaxel/gemcitabine produced a response rate of 45.8% and a 1-year survival rate of 51%. The addition of bevacizumab to a platinum-based regimen provided a survival benefit in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC.</detailed_description>
