	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy With Parental Involvement for Treating Children With Anxiety Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anxiety disorders are among the most common emotional, behavioral, and mental disorders in children, affecting an estimated 1 out of every 10 children and adolescents. Symptoms of anxiety disorders include an excessive sense of worry, stress, and fear; headache; nausea; and impaired learning and concentration. If left untreated, anxiety disorders can lead to difficulties with school and relationships, substance abuse, and the persistence of anxiety problems into adulthood. Individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), in which children learn to cope with fears through behavior and thought modification, has been an effective form of treatment for children with anxiety disorders. Studies have indicated that ICBT involving children and parents may be more effective than ICBT involving only children for improving anxiety levels and long-term recovery rates. This study will compare the effectiveness of ICBT with either parent reinforcement training or parent relationship training versus ICBT without parent involvement in treating children with anxiety disorders. Participation in this study will last 15 months, with 3 months of treatment and 12 months of follow-up. Both parent and child participants will first undergo initial assessments that will include psychological questionnaires; a video-taped child-parent interaction session; and interviews about behaviors, psychological functioning, and problem situations. Participants will then be assigned randomly to one of three treatment groups: ICBT, ICBT with parent reinforcement training (PRT1), or ICBT with parent relationship training (PRT2). All participants will attend between 12 and 14 weekly treatment sessions, lasting 60 minutes each. During all sessions, child participants will learn how to change anxious and fearful thoughts and to deal with feared objects and events. ICBT PRT1 and ICBT PRT2 sessions will also involve the parent and child working together. ICBT PRT1 will specifically teach the parent strategies for managing the child's behavior through the use of positive rewards and positive parental behaviors to help discourage child avoidant behaviors. ICBT PRT2 will specifically teach the parent ways to communicate with the child and to solve problems to help discourage child avoidant behaviors. All participants will be asked to complete questionnaires throughout treatment, upon completion of treatment, and 6 months after the end of treatment. Three and 9 months after the end of treatment, participants will undergo a 15-minute telephone assessment to evaluate how the child participant has been doing. The final assessment will occur 12 months after the end of treatment and will include repeat interviews and questionnaires.</detailed_description>
