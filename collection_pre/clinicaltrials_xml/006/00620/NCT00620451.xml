	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to look at how effective and safe larazotide acetate (AT-1001) is when it is given to subjects who have active Celiac Disease. A "leaky gut" is often found in Celiac Disease patients, and it is thought that the leakiness contributes to the disease, possibly by letting more gluten enter the body. Larazotide acetate (AT-100l) is an experimental drug that may possibly reduce gut leakiness and is being investigated to see if it can help people with Celiac disease along with a gluten free diet.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Larazotide Acetate (AT-1001) in Active Celiac Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be an outpatient, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, multicenter, 8-week study with the following treatment arms: 1. larazotide acetate (AT-1001) 4 mg (three times a day) 2. larazotide acetate (AT-1001) 8 mg (three times a day) 3. placebo (three times a day) Subjects will be required to have a baseline/screening biopsy and a follow-up biopsy at Day 56. Subjects will be required to adhere to a gluten free diet for the duration of the study. Primary Outcome: * To assess the efficacy of larazotide acetate (AT-1001) versus placebo in inducing remission in subjects with active Celiac Disease. Improvement is defined by changes (Villous Height to Crypt Depth (Vh:Cd) ratio),measured by duodenal-jejunal biopsy. Secondary Outcome: *To assess safety and tolerability of larazotide acetate (AT-1001) in subjects with active Celiac Disease. Estimated Enrollment 106 subjects Estimated Study Start Date: February 2008 Estimated Study Completion Date: December 2009</detailed_description>
