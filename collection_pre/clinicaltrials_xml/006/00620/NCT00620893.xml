	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate and compare 2 artificial tears in their ability to reduce post LASIK dry eye signs and symptoms. The secondary endpoint of this study is to evaluate refractive regression in these patients. The 'Refractive Outcome' data point will be defined as the difference between the post-op spherical equivalent (SE) and the pre-op targeted SE.</brief_summary>
