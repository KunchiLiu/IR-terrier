	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that 18FDG Positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET) imaging, carried out after the first cycle of chemotherapy, will identify responders, thus permitting early termination of potential toxic therapy in non- responders leading to a significant decrease in morbidity and cost. The value of PET imaging as an early predictor of response to chemotherapy has been shown in other cancers.</brief_summary>
