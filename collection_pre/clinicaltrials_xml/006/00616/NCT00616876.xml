	<criteria>Premature infants were recruited based on the following criteria: 2334 weeks' gestation (as determined by a combination of maternal dates, early prenatal ultrasonography and postnatal gestational age estimation based on physical and neuromuscular signs (New Ballard Score), as long as there will be gestational age agreement between the 3 methods &lt; 2 weeks); Absence of major congenital malformations; and Informed consent obtained from parents. Major congenital malformations and parental refusal.</criteria>
