	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to prospectively determine the effect of a very low carbohydrate diet on quality of life and gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D); and to determine possible physiological correlates of symptom improvement, as related to post-prandial 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) release, weight loss and fiber content.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of a Very Low Carbohydrate Diet on Symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 10-15% of individuals in the United States have symptoms consistent with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) which is a costly disorder and negatively impacts patient quality of life. The pathogenesis of this heterogeneous disorder is still not well understood. Patients frequently identify worsening of symptoms after meals and often cite particular foods as triggers of their IBS symptoms. Unfortunately, there is insufficient randomized clinical trial data to allow for specific dietary recommendations. Previous research has suggested a role for carbohydrate ingestion in IBS. There is also evidence for the role of the post-prandial release of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and its turnover (as represented by the ratio of its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), to 5-HT in response to a carbohydrate-rich meal, especially in those with IBS-D. As the prevalence of overweight (body mass index [BMI] &gt; 25 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2) has risen in recent years, very low carbohydrate diets have become popular for those attempting to lose weight. Patients with IBS, especially IBS-D, anecdotally report improvement in their gastrointestinal symptoms after initiating a very low carbohydrate diet. However, no study has investigated the effect of a very low carbohydrate diet on symptoms and quality of life in patients with IBS-D.</detailed_description>
