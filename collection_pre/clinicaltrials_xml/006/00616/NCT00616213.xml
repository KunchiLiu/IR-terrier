	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as PR-104, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help the immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Giving PR-104 together with G-CSF may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of PR-104 when given together with G-CSF in treating patients with solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PR104 and G-CSF in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PR-104 in combination with filgrastim (G-CSF) in patients with solid tumors. Secondary - Characterize the safety of this regimen in these patients. - Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of PR-104 and its alcohol metabolite. - Evaluate the rate of hypoxia in various solid tumors using F-MISO PET (18F-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography) imaging. - Assess for antitumor toxicity in these patients. - Collect plasma samples for the assessment of potential biomarkers of tumor hypoxia. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of PR-104. Patients receive PR-104 IV over 1 hour on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) on day 2. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo 18F-fluoromisonidazole PET scans at baseline and prior to course 3 to assess tumor hypoxia. Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically during course 1. Samples are analyzed for the pharmacokinetics of PR-104 and for identification of biomarkers for tumor hypoxia. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.</detailed_description>
