	<brief_summary>In major orthopaedic surgery of the lower extremities both continuous spinal anesthesia (CSA) and combined spinal epidural anesthesia (CSE) are safe and reliable anaesthesia methods. Our results suggest that both continuous spinal anesthesia and combined spinal epidural anesthesia provide good surgical conditions with a low incidence of complications. The sensory block level and hemodynamic changes were lesser with CSA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Spinal Anesthesia Versus Combined Spinal Epidural Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>240 patients scheduled for hip, knee arthroplasty or fracture of the femur were randomly assigned to receive either CSA or CSE. Blocks were performed in the lateral position at L3-L4 interspace. Puncture success, technical difficulties, paresthesia, highest level of sensory and motor block, need for complementary doses of local anesthetic, degree of technical difficulties, cardiocirculatory changes and post dural puncture headache were registered. At the end of the surgery, the catheter was removed and CSF leak was evaluated.</detailed_description>
