	<brief_title>Early Postoperative Fitting of the Air- Limb Prosthesis for Transtibial Amputees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The method of immediate adjustment of a temporary Prosthesis has been developed in the past, aiming to reduce the healing time of the stump and the process of rehabilitation. According to this method, a temporary Prosthesis is being adjusted immediately after amputation, or during the first week after it. Rehabilitation starts with the patient's standing while partial weight bearing on the Prosthesis. In spite of many experiments and trials to adopt this process of rehabilitation, it is not universally adopted, because of the bad adjustment and damages to the stump caused by the Plaster of Paris. At present, with the improvement of materials and research experiments are being renewed, to check the efficiency of the process, using the Air- Limb a temporary Prosthesis.</detailed_description>
