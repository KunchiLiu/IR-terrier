	<brief_summary>Novel therapies for AD that avoid immunosuppression and potential carcinogensis are needed. EpiCeram™ , a topical cream, represents a novel class of therapy for skin disorders that does not contain corticosteroids or other anti-inflammatory drugs. The objective of the present study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of EpiCeram ™ in the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis as compared to mid-strength topical steroid cream following twice daily dosing for four weeks in pediatric patients with AD. The potential benefit to patients lies in the potential for EpiCeram ™ to provide restoration of the normal skin barrier as shown in previous studies and eliminate or reduce the requirement for supplemental topical steroid administration.</brief_summary>
