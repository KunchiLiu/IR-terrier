	<brief_summary>Clinical practice indicates that Quetiapine has sedating properties, and its sedative effects may play an important role in restoring quality of sleep in patients with various psychiatric conditions who frequently experience sleep disturbances as part of their illness. It is well known that depressive disorders are very frequently associated with significant sleep disturbance. Sleep disruption is a feature of Bipolar Disorder during both Depressed and Manic/Hypomanic episodes. Considering that Seroquel has good antidepressant properties (Calabrese, 2004), the investigators suggest that Seroquel's effect on sleep architecture contributes to its antidepressant properties.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Quetiapine on Sleep Architecture in Bipolar Depression and Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To assess the objective (polysomnographic) change in sleep quality before and after introduction of Seroquel (Quetiapine) in treatment of patients with Bipolar Depression or Major Depressive Disorder. Secondary Objectives: To assess the objective (polysomnographic) and subjective changes in sleep quality parameters before and at different stages after introduction of Seroquel (Quetiapine) treatment, longitudinally, and to correlate these changes with measures of illness severity. Study Design: Prospective polysomnographic (PSG) study of patients before and after treatment with Seroquel (Quetiapine). PSG recordings will be done three (optional four) times during the study: before starting the Seroquel (Quetiapine) (baseline), at day 2 to 4 (early) and day 21 to 28 (longer term). (Optional fourth PSG can be done at day 42-56). PSG will be completed at patients home with a portable PSG.</detailed_description>
