	<brief_summary>This study intends to compare postoperative outcomes of a tissue expander placement following a mastectomy with two different operative techniques. This study will be randomized and double blinded comparing the traditional placement of the tissue expander under an inferolateral serratus muscle flap to a new technique which uses an acellular dermal matrix as an inferolateral sling, instead of the muscle flap. The study we are proposing will evaluate the question of whether there is a difference between the traditional method of serratus flap and the new technique of using an acellular matrix with tissue expander placement. This will be a double blinded randomized study of thirty women in each group comparing outcomes which will include postoperative pain, complications (wound infection, hematoma, capsular contracture, etc), and patient satisfaction with the procedure.</brief_summary>
