	<brief_title>Ph. II Treatment of Adults w Primary Malignant Glioma w Irinotecan + Temozolomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives of study are to determine activity of combo of Irinotecan + Temozolomide &amp; to further characterize any toxicity associated w combo of Irinotecan + Temozolomide. Temozolomide administered orally at 200mg/m2 in fasting state 1hr prior to CPT-11 infusion. Temozolomide administered on day 1 of treatment cycle &amp; every 24hrs thereafter for 5 days w treatment cycles repeated every 6wks. Treatment cycles may be repeated up to maxi of 3 cycles until occurrence of either unacceptable toxicity/evidence of disease progression. At end of 3rd cycle/if cycles are stopped early for toxicity or progression, subject will undergo radiation therapy. CPT-11 administered intravenously in fasting state over 90min. CPT-11 will begin 1hr after Temozolomide administration on day 1 of treatment cycle. CPT-11 administered on days 1, 8, 22, &amp; 29 of 6wk treatment cycle. Treatment cycles may be repeated up to maxi of 3 cycles until occurrence of either unacceptable toxicity/evidence of disease progression. Dose of CPT-11 will be based on whether pt is receiving CYP3A4-inducing antiepileptic drugs due to increased drug clearance produced by these agents. For pts receiving EIAEDs including phenytoin, fosphenytoin, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital/ primidone, CPT-11 dose of 325mg/m2 administered. For pts not receiving EIAEDs, CPT-11 dose of125 mg/m2 administered. Subjects have newly diagnosed histologically proven supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme. Toxicities associated w CPT-11 are anemia, decreased blood counts, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, fever, mouth sores, dehydration, rash, itching, changes in skin color, swelling, numbness, tingling, dizziness, confusion, low blood pressure, sweating, hot flashes, hair loss, inflammation of liver, flu-like symptoms, decreased urine output, shortness of breath,&amp; pneumonia. Low white blood cell &amp; platelet counts may be associated w risk of infection/bleeding, respectively. Irinotecan has also caused birth defects in animals. Most frequent toxicities in earlier studies have been low white blood cells &amp; diarrhea, &amp; death has been seen from these &amp; other side effects. Temozolomide has been well tolerated by both adults &amp; children w most common toxicity being mild myelosuppression. Other, less likely, potential toxicities include nausea &amp; vomiting, constipation, headache, alopecia, rash, burning sensation of skin, esophagitis, pain, diarrhea, lethargy, hepatotoxicity, anorexia, fatigue &amp; hyperglycemia. Hypersensitivity reactions have not yet been noted w Temozolomide. As in case w many anti-cancer drugs, Temozolomide may be carcinogenic.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pts have histologically proven supratentorial GBM Pts have newly diagnosed disease There must be measurable disease on contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging performed &lt;14 days before drug administration. Those who underwent resection must have MRI &lt;72 hrs/ &gt;14 days after surgery Prior Surgical Resection/Biopsy: Although surgical resection is not required, pts must be treated &lt;42 days of surgery or biopsy Age &gt;18 yrs Karnofsky Performance Status &gt;70 percent Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1500 cells/microliter; platelet count &gt;100,000 cells/microliter Serum SGOT &amp; total bilirubin &lt;2.5 x ULN Signed informed consent, approved by IRB, will be obtained prior to initiating treatment Pts must agree to practice effective birth control measures while on study &amp; for 2 months after completing therapy Pregnant/breast feeding women / women/men w reproductive potential not practicing adequate contraception. This therapy may be associated w potential toxicity to fetus/child that exceeds minimum risks necessary to meet health needs of mother Active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics Known diagnosis of HIV infection Pts w history of another primary malignancy that currently requires active intervention Pts unwilling/unable to comply w protocol due to serious medical/psychiatric condition Pts who underwent surgical resection for GBM &lt;2 weeks of start of treatment Pts who have received prior chemo, biologic therapy, XRT, interstitial brachytherapy/radiosurgery to brain</criteria>
