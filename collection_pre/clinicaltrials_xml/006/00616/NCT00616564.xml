	<brief_summary>High-dose IL-2 treatment for metastatic melanoma has been approved by the FDA in 1998. Studies of GM-CSF plus IL-2 have not addressed the approved dose and schedule. This protocol will study the combination of HD-IL2 and GM-CSF given the potential synergistic interactions discussed above.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial of (IL-2) With Priming and (GM-CSF) in Patients With Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this phase II multicenter trial are to: Determine the 1 and 2-year survival of patients treated according to protocol. Assess the safety and toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. The secondary objectives are to: Determine the freedom from progression (FFP). Measure the response rate (RR). Obtain immunological data from the use of this regimen in vivo (as separate project: Moffitt?). The proposed study is a multicenter phase II trial of HD-IL-2 in combination with GM-CSF. GM-CSF will be started 7 days before day 1 of HD-IL-2 and will be continued for 4 weeks to day 28, encompassing two cycles of HD-IL2. The first 9 patients will be closely monitored for unexpected toxicity.</detailed_description>
