	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of RO4607381 in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalents. Patients will be randomized to receive either RO4607381 600mg po daily or placebo po daily. Endothelial function will be measured by flow mediated dilatation and blood pressure monitoring will be assessed. The anticipated time on study treatment is up to 12 months, and the target sample size is up to 500 individuals.</brief_summary>
