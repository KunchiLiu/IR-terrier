	<brief_summary>- Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a secreted glycoprotein containing 401 amino acids. It is a member of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. It was firstly discovered as a protein regulating bone metabolism, inhibiting osteoclastogenesis, consequently, inhibiting bone resorption - Evaluation of OPG level as disease markers has also been reported. It has been showed that patients with coronary artery disease had higher serum OPG levels than healthy volunteers. Moreover, serum OPG levels correlate with the number of stenotic coronary arteries - OPG is detected in lung using Northern blot analysis - It is likely that OPG would contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD and could be an effective disease marker of the disease</brief_summary>
