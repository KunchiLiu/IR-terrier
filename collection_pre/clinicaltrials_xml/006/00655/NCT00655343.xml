	<brief_summary>The study aim is to evaluate the influence of the anti-T-lymphocyte globulin ATG-Fresenius S given pre-transplant in addition to standard GvHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine A and a short course of methotrexate with respect to efficacy and safety.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease (aGvHD) Prophylaxis With ATG-Fresenius in Matched Unrelated Donor-Stem Cell Transplantation (MUD-SCT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess the efficacy of ATG-FRESENIUS S in addition to standard therapy (cyclosporine A / methotrexate) with respect to early treatment failure defined by the occurrence of severe acute GvHD grade III-IV or early mortality within 100 days post transplantation compared to standard therapy alone. All patients receive myeloablative therapy. Recommended regimens: For patients with ALL: fractionated TBI (8-12 Gy) plus cyclophosphamide (1-2 x 60 mg/kg) [etoposide/melfalan are also allowed]. For all other indications: either TBI (8-12 Gy) or busulfan (per os 14-16 mg/kg b.w. or equivalent for IV administration) plus cyclophosphamide (1-2 x 60 mg/kg) or thiotepa ≥ 15 mg/kg or BCNU ≥ 300 mg/m2. Conditioning regimens may differ from centre to centre; each centre decides for constant (disease specific) regimen(s) throughout the whole study period. Standard GvHD prophylaxis consists of cyclosporine A (target trough level ≥ 200 ng/ml starting from day -1 until day +100) and short course methotrexate (15 mg/m2 at day +1, 10 mg/m2 at days +3, +6 and +11).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participation of patients in simultaneous diagnostic and comprehensive therapeutical trials for certain entities is allowed. Patients 1860 years of age; Patients suffering from one of the following diseases: AML: 1st complete remission (CR1) or beyond 1st remission (CR2, CR3), in relapse, not in remission (primary refractory, induction failure); ALL: 1st complete remission (CR1) or beyond 1st remission (CR2, CR3), in relapse, not in remission (primary refractory, induction failure); MDS, if transplantation is medically indicated: RA (with poor risk factors as classified by the International Prognostic Scoring System of MDS), RARS, RAEB, RAEBt, CMML; CML: beyond 1st chronic phase (CP1): accelerated phase, blast crisis, chronic phase (CP2, CP3); OMF, if transplantation is medically indicated: Osteomyelofibrosis; Patients designated to undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation; Patients with a HLAA, B (DNAbased, 2 digits), HLADRB1, DQB1 (DNAbased 4 digits) matched (8 out of 8 alleles) unrelated donor; serological typing is not required Patients with a Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS): &gt; 60%; Patients who underwent all obligatory screening examinations (special examinations within the last 4 weeks); Patients who have given their written informed consent to participate in the study. Patients with significant cardiac (e.g. ejection fraction &lt;50%), pulmonary (e.g. FEV1 &lt;50%), renal (e.g. creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl), metabolic (e.g. bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dl) and/or CNS disease, currently uncontrolled by treatment, which may interfere with the completion of the study; Patients with any bacterial, viral, or fungal infections not under adequate antimicrobial control; Patients who are known to have serum hepatitis or who are carriers of the Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or Hepatitis C antibody, or who are known to have a positive result to the test of HIV antibodies; Patients with any additional concurrent or previous malignant disease; Patients with known hypersensitivity to rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies in past patient history or with known allergy to any substance chemically related to the study medication; Pregnant (βHCG test) or lactating women; Patients who formerly underwent transplantation including previous autologous transplants; Patients who cannot communicate reliably with the investigator or who are not likely to cope with the requirements of the study.</criteria>
