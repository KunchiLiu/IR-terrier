	<brief_title>Efficacy of Alogliptin and With Pioglitazone in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SYR-322 (alogliptin) is a selective, orally available inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV being developed as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is the primary enzyme involved in the in vivo degradation of at least 2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide. Pioglitazone HCl (ACTOS®) is a thiazolidinedione developed by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Pioglitazone HCl depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. This study will assess the effects of alogliptin and alogliptin coadministered with pioglitazone HCl on postprandial lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in participants with type 2 diabetes. Individuals who participate in this study will be required to commit to a screening visit and up to 6 additional visits at the study center. Study participation is anticipated to be about 20 weeks (or approximately 5 months). Multiple procedures will occur at each visit which may include fasting, blood collection, urine collection, physical examinations and electrocardiograms. At 3 of the visits a meal will be served that must be eaten within 10 minutes.</detailed_description>
