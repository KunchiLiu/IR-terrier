	<brief_title>Prevention of Depression in HIV/HCV Co-infected Substance Abuse Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment for active hepatitis C in both HCV mono-infected and HCV/HIV co-infected patients is a long and difficult course, involving combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin for 6 to 12 months, a therapy with significant side effects. Up to 40% of patients being treated will develop depression due to the medication, which in turn leads to discontinuation of therapy and lost opportunities to prevent end stage liver disease. In fact, the presence of depression prior to interferon treatment often excludes patients from receiving interferon therapy, thereby denying them a potentially life-saving treatment. Non-pharmacological therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have demonstrated efficacy in treating primary depression in numerous studies including in patients under going treatment with chronic medical illness. CBT is a well-established treatment modality and has been shown in several large randomized trials to be as effective, and in some cases more effective, than antidepressants. CBT has also shown efficacy in preventing the development of depression and other emotional disorders in high-risk populations. Offering CBT prior to and during treatment with interferon to non-depressed patients is a unique method that may reduce rates of depression and increase adherence to treatment without exposing patients to the risk of an additional medication.</detailed_description>
