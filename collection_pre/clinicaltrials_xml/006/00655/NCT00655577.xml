	<brief_summary>The significance of this population-based study is in producing new information for planning interventions and rehabilitation programs for the elderly, planning education of health care personnel and planning national health education programs for different age groups. The study consists of an epidemiological cross-sectional study and a randomized controlled intervention study. The study population consisted of all the 1689 home-dwelling women born during 1924-1927 residing in Oulu, Northern Finland, who were asked to a screening visit including bone mineral density (BMD) measurement of the distal radius in 1997. 1222 women attended the clinic and were afterwards mailed a postal questionnaire focusing on lifelong risk factors for osteoporosis, e.g. the amount of physical activity at work and during leisure time, daily intake of calcium and use of alcohol and cigarettes. Those with BMD value more than 20% lower than the reference value, underwent a densitometry of the hip. All women with femoral neck BMD more than 20% below the reference value (n=160) were randomly selected to either exercise (n=84) or control (n=76) group. At baseline and after that annually during the 30-month intervention, balance, muscle strength, aerobic capacity, walking speed, cognitive functions and mood are measured from all the participants. Hip BMD will be measured annually. The exercise group participates in a supervised training program with weekly sessions from the beginning of October to the end of April. In addition to the supervised sessions the participants train daily at home. From April to October the exercises are performed purely at home. The training regimen consists of balance, strength and impact exercises. The intervention group keeps diary of their daily physical activity. The number and severity of falls are recorded from both the groups. The purpose of the study is: 1. to identify factors accounting for low BMD in elderly home-dwelling women with severe osteopenia. 2. to evaluate how supervised regular weight-bearing exercise program affects BMD in elderly home-dwelling women with severe osteopenia 3. to evaluate how supervised regular balance and muscle training affects balance and muscle strength in elderly home-dwelling women with severe osteopenia. In addition the aim is to: 4. study how regular supervised exercise affects the incidence and severity of falls, mood and cognitive functions in women with severe osteopenia. Hypothesis and research methods The main hypothesis is that long-term supervised, mainly home- based regular impact-type and balance and muscle exercises can improve balance and muscle strength of lower extremities and maintain bone mass in elderly women. We also hypothesize that the incidence of falls is lower in the exercise group than in the controls and that the falls are more injurious in the control group than in the intervention group during the follow-up period</brief_summary>
