	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of ondansetron, metoclopramide, and promethazine for the treatment of nausea in the adult emergency department population. We hypothesize that a single intravenous dose of ondansetron is more effective in reducing nausea than a single IV dose of metoclopramide, promethazine or normal saline placebo in undifferentiated adult emergency department patients.</brief_summary>
