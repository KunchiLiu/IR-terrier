	<brief_summary>The trial is a parallel group, multi-centre, randomized, double blind, non-inferiority trial investigating the immunogenicity and safety of two DTaP-IPV combination vaccines: A)The investigational vaccine: DTaP-IPV containing IPV produced in a vero-cell line (DTaP-IPVvero) B)The reference vaccine: DTaP-IPV containing IPV produced in monkey kidney cells (DTaP-IPVmkc) The DTaP-IPV vaccines are administered to healthy infants at 2, 3½, 5, and 16 months of age concomitantly with Act-HIB vaccine administered as a separate injection in the opposite thigh. Three blood samples are collected at 6, 16 and 17 months of age. Sera are analyzed for antibodies against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and prp.</brief_summary>
