	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving panitumumab together with irinotecan may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II clinical trial is studying giving panitumumab together with irinotecan to see how well it works as third-line therapy in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Panitumumab and Irinotecan as Third-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To assess the objective response rate when panitumumab is administered in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride as third-line therapy in patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer without KRAS mutation (wild type) previously treated with FOLFOX or XELOX chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab and irinotecan hydrochloride alone or FOLFIRI or CAPIRI chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. Secondary - To assess the efficacy in terms of disease control rate, duration of response, time to response, progression-free survival, time to progression, time to treatment failure, and duration of stable disease. - To assess the efficacy and safety of this regimen, followed by panitumumab alone in patients who discontinue third-line irinotecan hydrochloride due to toxicity. Tertiary - To correlate this regimen with EGFR expression, detection of the functional genetic polymorphisms of the EGFR gene, EGFR gene amplification (FISH), EGFR activation detection, EGFR downstream protein and gene expression parameters, proteomics, and epigenetics. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive panitumumab IV over 30-90 minutes and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Patients who discontinue irinotecan hydrochloride may receive panitumumab monotherapy. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity. Archived tumor tissue specimens are obtained at baseline for correlative laboratory studies. Tissue samples are analyzed for EGFR amplification status by chromogenic in situ hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization, KRAS and KRAF mutations, and STAT3 expression. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at approximately 56 days.</detailed_description>
