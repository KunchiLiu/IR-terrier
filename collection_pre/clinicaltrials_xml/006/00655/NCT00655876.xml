	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may stop the growth of esophageal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving paclitaxel and cisplatin together with radiation therapy is more effective with or without cetuximab in treating esophageal cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing how well giving paclitaxel and cisplatin together with radiation therapy works with or without cetuximab in treating patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel, Cisplatin, and Radiation Therapy With or Without Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate whether the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel, cisplatin, and radiotherapy improves overall survival compared with paclitaxel, cisplatin, and radiotherapy alone in patients with esophageal cancer treated without surgery. Secondary - To evaluate whether the addition of cetuximab to paclitaxel, cisplatin, and radiotherapy improves local control by increasing the clinical complete response and decreasing local recurrence in these patients. - To evaluate adverse events in these patients. - To evaluate endoscopic complete response rates in these patients. - To evaluate if the addition of cetuximab to paclitaxel, cisplatin, and radiotherapy improves the Esophageal Cancer Subscale score of the FACT-E quality of life tool. - To evaluate the quality-adjusted survival of each treatment arm using EQ-5D if the primary endpoint supports the primary hypothesis. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histology (adenocarcinoma* vs squamous), cancer lesion size (&lt; 5 cm vs ≥ 5 cm), and disease status of celiac nodes (present vs absent). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. NOTE: * The adenocarcinoma stratum is closed as of 5/3/2012. - Arm I: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour, and cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Patients also undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5½ weeks for a total dose of 50.4Gy. - Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel and cisplatin as in arm I. Patients also undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients undergo endoscopy 6 to 8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, within 1 week of post-treatment endoscopy, and at 1 and 2 years from beginning of study treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
