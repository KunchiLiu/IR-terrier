	<brief_summary>This study is being done to determine the overall progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced or metastatic (Stage IIIB - pleural effusion/IV), non-squamous histology NSCLC treated with metronomic chemotherapy plus Avastin. Also, currently there are no defined markers that predict for clinical benefit to Avastin. Preliminary studies show that there are several observations that support the concept of metronomic chemotherapy with or without the combination of an anti-angiogenic agent. The metronomic chemotherapy with Avastin was shown to enhance the clinical endpoints of the study (response rate and progressive-free survival). Proof of metronomic scheduling requires the development of appropriate intermediate surrogate markers. Several markers will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lower Dose Chemotherapy Given More Frequent With Avastin to Treat Advanced Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized, open-label, pilot Phase II study of metronomic chemotherapy plus Avastin in chemo naïve subjects with advanced non-squamous, non-small cell carcinoma of the lung. The primary endpoint of this study is to assess the overall progression-free survival. Subjects will be treated with metronomic chemotherapy with paclitaxel and gemcitabine weekly for 3 out of 4 weeks, and Avastin will be administered every 2 weeks. Treatment with metronomic chemotherapy will be expressed as a 4-week cycle. Tumor response to treatment will be evaluated every 8 weeks. Treatment with metronomic chemotherapy and Avastin will continue for a total of 6 cycles unless there is evidence of disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Maintenance therapy with Avastin will then continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Potential biologic parameters to monitor anti-tumor activity of metronomic chemotherapy will be evaluated in 10 subjects. These biomarkers include: sequential determination of blood levels of VEGF, VEGFR2, thrombospondin-1, E-selectin, ICAM-1, and circulating endothelial cells and endothelial precursor cells.</detailed_description>

Subjects must not have radiation therapy within 3 weeks prior to initiation of treatment. Female subjects must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or using effective contraception. All females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the initiation of treatment. Informed consent must be obtained in writing prior to the initiation of treatment. Exclusion Criteria Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedures Life expectancy of less than 12 weeks Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned participation in an experimental drug study other than a Genentechsponsored Avastin cancer study Active malignancy, other than superficial basal cell and superficial squamous (skin) cell, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix within last five years AvastinSpecific Exclusions Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg) Prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to Day 1 History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to Day 1 Known CNS disease, except for treated brain metastasis Treated brain metastases are defined as having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment and no ongoing requirement for dexamethasone, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT) during the screening period. Anticonvulsants (stable dose) are allowed. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), radiosurgery (RS; Gamma Knife, LINAC, or equivalent) or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Patients with CNS metastases treated by neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed within 3 months prior to Day 1 will be excluded Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, requiring surgical repair or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to Day 1 History of hemoptysis (greater than or equal to 1/2 teaspoon of bright red blood per episode) within 1 month prior to Day 1 Evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy (in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation) Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 1 or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of a vascular access device, within 7 days prior to Day 1 History of abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal perforation within 6 months prior to Day 1 Serious, nonhealing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture Proteinuria as demonstrated by a UPC ratio greater than or equal to 1.0 at screening Known hypersensitivity Criteria: Pathologicalproven NSCLC except squamous cell carcinoma as the predominant histology. Advanced NSCLC: Stage IIIB with pleural effusion or Stage IV or recurrent disease. Measurable or nonmeasurable disease as defined by solid tumor response criteria (RECIST) ECOG Performance Status 0 to 1. No prior systemic chemotherapy or biologic therapy. Required laboratories (obtained ≤ 1 week prior to the initiation of treatment) Absolutely any component of Avastin Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation. Use of effective means of contraception (men and women) in patients of childbearing potential Intrathoracic lung carcinoma of squamous cell histology Mixed tumors will be categorized by the predominant cell type unless small cell elements are present, in which case the patient is ineligible; sputum cytology alone is acceptable. Patients with extrathoraciconly squamous cell NSCLC are eligible. Patients with only peripheral lung lesions (of any NSCLC histology) will also be eligible (a peripheral lesion is defined as a lesion in which the epicenter of the tumor is less than or equal to 2 cm from the costal or diaphragmatic pleura in a threedimensional orientation based on each lobe of the lung and is greater than 2 cm from the trachea, main, and lobar bronchi).</criteria>
