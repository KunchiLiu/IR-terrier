	<criteria>Women who had hysterectomies were classified into simple hysterectomy or hysterectomy with both ovaries removed. Evidence of cancer, coronary heart disease (MI or Angina Pectoris), stroke, or hip fracture before entering the study were excluded. Cancer as an indication for hysterectomy also excluded. Women reporting unilateral oophorectomy, unknown oophorectomy status, unknown age of hysterectomy, or those who had oophorectomy before hysterectomy were excluded.</criteria>
