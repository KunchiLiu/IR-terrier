	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of the Stapled Trans Anal Rectal Resection (STARR) procedure for patients with obstructive defecation syndrome. This involves a dynamic pelvic MRI and obstructive defecation score (ODS) at 6 month post STARR procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic MRI Evaluation Post Operative Stapled Trans Anal Rectal Resection (STARR) Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of dynamic pelvic MRI has greatly impacted our preoperative evaluation of pelvic floor disorders, both anatomically and functionally. The STARR procedure is a new approved procedure for patients with obstructive defecation, who have failed conservative therapy of medications and aggressive pelvic floor retraining. Most patients have also been screened for colonic transit problems. The traditional study for evaluating these patients was defecating proctograms. With the advent of the dynamic pelvic MRI, we are now beginning to understand the interaction of the entire pelvic structure in the complex act of defecation. This study is providing us a different view of the pelvic structures to better understand the pathophysiology of this disorder. The defecating proctogram, though informative in certain cases, lacks information outside the rectum. We wish to evaluate and compare our preoperative dynamic pelvic MRI with a six month dynamic pelvic MRI in 10 patients. We also will compare pre and post op obstructive defecation scores (ODS). We expect this small sample to direct us to a much more pointed evaluation of this disorder.</detailed_description>
