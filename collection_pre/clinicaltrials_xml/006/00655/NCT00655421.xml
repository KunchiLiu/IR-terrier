	<brief_title>Oral Cancer Screening in Mumbai, India by Primary Health Care Workers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral cancer is the most common cancer among men in India mainly due to the habit of using smokeless tobacco. Pre-cancerous lesions like leukoplakia, melanoplakia, erythroplakia,oral submucous fibrosis and indolent ulcers can be easily detected by periodic examination of the oral cavity of the at-risk populations. Several methods of oral cancer screening have been tried over the past three-four decades with varying success. This study investigates the feasibility of application and compares the test characteristics of three oral cancer screening techniques: Unaided Visual Inspection, VelScope assisted examination and examination after application of Toluidine blue dye by primary health care workers among tobacco users attending a cancer early detection clinic, in Mumbai, India.</detailed_description>
