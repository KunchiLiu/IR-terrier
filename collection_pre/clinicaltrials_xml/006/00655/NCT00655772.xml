	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial to Assess the Effects of a Mouthwash Containing Chlorine Dioxide on Oral Malodor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, double blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted among 15 healthy male volunteers, who were divided into 2 groups: experimental or control group. In the first test phase, the subjects in the experimental group were instructed to rinse with the mouthwash containing ClO2 and those in the control group with the placebo mouthwash without ClO2. In the second test phase after one week washout period, same procedure was conducted with the opposite mouthwashes. Oral malodor was evaluated at before rinsing, right after rinsing and follows up every 30 minutes till 4 hours with OM, and the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) and dimethyl sulfide ((CH3)2S) which are the main volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) of human oral malodor were evaluated with GC.</detailed_description>
