	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: one-dose pamidronate will prevent post-operative bone loss in children at risk for low bone density Plan: children with chronic disease such as CP, spina bifida, etc. will be recruited pre operatively and studied with DXA scan. After surgery, children will be randomized to receive either pamidronate or saline. Repeat DXA scan will determine bone lost after end of immobilization or nonweightbearing.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Children at risk for post operative bone loss will be studied with preoperative DXA scan of spine and distal femora Preoperative screening with standard labs electrolytes, Ca++, PO4, creatinine, Vit D Following surgery of hip(s) or lower extremities, randomization into treatment with low dose IV pamidronate (one dose) v placebo group Repeat DXA scan after end of immobilization or non-weightbearing</detailed_description>
