	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this study is to examine the role of fish oil supplementation in ameliorating the inflammatory state of uremia and the related muscle protein catabolism associated with this disease state. We hypothesize that if administered for a period of 3 months, fish oil will improve the chronic uremic inflammation. We further hypothesize that fish oil administration will improve the muscle protein breakdown associated with uremia and inflammation.</brief_summary>
