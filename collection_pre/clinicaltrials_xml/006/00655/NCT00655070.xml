	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the use application of low frequency ultrasound, administered by the Timi3 ultrasound device, increases myocardial blood flow to the heart, in subjects with reduced myocardial blood flow at rest (hibernating myocardium). The primary endpoint of the trial is to assess the increase in myocardial blood flow from baseline to post Timi3 Ultrasound treatment in a hypoperfused region of myocardium. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging will be used to noninvasively evaluate cardiac blood flow. The hypothesis is that ultrasound increases blood flow in hibernating myocardium.</brief_summary>
