	<brief_summary>Pomegranate has a long history of use in folk medicine. There is vast data on the health benefits of pomegranate fruit and juice. Multiple studies have established the strong antioxidative effects of pomegranate polyphenols (primarily the ellagitannin punicalagin) and their health effects. A vast number of animal and human clinical studies have provided evidence on effect of pomegranate products on reducing symptoms of common cold, reducing blood pressure, improving endothelial function, anti-tumor activity, and its anti-atherosclerotic activity. This study will evaluate the protective effect of a pomegranate concentrate (POMx) in decreasing the incidence and duration of the common cold among healthy adults.</brief_summary>
