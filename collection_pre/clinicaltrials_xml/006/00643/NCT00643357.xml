	<brief_title>Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Kalinox® 170 Bar for the Performance of Care Procedures in Children With Burns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain due to burns is one of the most intense and persistent types of pain. This pain consists of a permanent background pain, overlaid by episodes of temporary exacerbations triggered by treatment procedures or burn-care procedures. Care procedures, such as changing the dressings or cleaning the wounds, make it necessary to handle the painful areas, and this causes transient intense pain. Analgesia with a 50/50 mix of nitrous oxide and oxygen is a simple and effective technique, which induces a state of light sedation during which verbal contact is not lost, which is rapidly reversible and is devoid of any major side effects. This gas is used in paediatrics for carrying out painful procedures of a short duration, such as lumbar puncture and minor surgery. The nitrous oxide/oxygen mix has also been used to treat the pain induced by care procedures in children with burns for more than 30 years. The objective of our study is to obtain qualitative and quantitative data about the efficacy of Kalinox® 170 bar in care procedures in children with burns.</detailed_description>
