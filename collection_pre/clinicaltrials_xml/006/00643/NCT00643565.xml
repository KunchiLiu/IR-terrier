	<brief_summary>This open-label two-arm study will assess the safety and efficacy of a combination of bevacizumab + standard chemotherapy with standard chemotherapy alone as active comparator in childhood and adolescent patients with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma or non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma. Patients will be randomized to receive bevacizumab + standard chemotherapy or standard chemotherapy alone. Treatment will consist of 9 x 3-week cycles of induction treatment (standard chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg iv on day 1 of each cycle) followed by 12 x 4-week cycles of maintenance treatment (standard chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab 5 mg/kg iv on days 1 and 15 of each cycle). The anticipated time on study treatment is 1-2 years.</brief_summary>
