	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether gabapentin enacarbil (XP13512/GSK1838262), hereafter referred to as GEn is effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy(DPN)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study In Patients With Neuropathic Pain From Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a dose-response study of XP13512 compared with concurrent placebo control and LYRICA (pregabalin), in subjects with neuropathic pain associated with DPN. Three doses of XP13512 (1200 mg/day, 2400 mg/day and 3600 mg/day) are being evaluated for the management of neuropathic pain associated with DPN. Approximately 392 subjects from 70 to 80 participating sites in the US will be randomized to receive either XP13512 at the above mentioned doses, placebo or pregabalin (300mg/day).</detailed_description>
