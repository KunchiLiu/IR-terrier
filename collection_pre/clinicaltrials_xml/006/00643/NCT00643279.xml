	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical research study is to evaluate the safety of an investigational implantable hemodynamic monitor (IHM). The IHM is implanted surgically under the skin in the upper chest area and records the force with which the heart pumps blood (heart pressures). This study will also determine how doctors use the information related to heart pressures in the management of heart failure.</brief_summary>
