	<brief_title>A Study to Test the Design, Functionality, and Ergonomic Features of the Autoinjector</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This device (called an autoinjector) automatically injects medicine under the skin with a sterile needle, and is similar to other types of autoinjectors currently being used for this purpose. This trial has been designed to make sure that people, who are likely to use this device, are able to self-inject and understand the training material. A total of 68 subjects took part in the study. About half (30 patients) will have either Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and the other half will have psoriasis (a type of skin disease), since this device will be used by patients with one of these diseases to inject their medication. The study is designed to have each patient complete 2 self-injections with the autoinjector in 2 different sites-one in the front of the thigh and one in the abdomen 2 inches away from the navel. The order of the first injection location is decided by randomization. The patient will have an equal chance of having the thigh or the abdomen as the first injection. The study staff will assess the subject's safety prior to the patient leaving the clinic. Two prefilled, 1mL placebo autoinjectors for subcutaneous injection</detailed_description>
