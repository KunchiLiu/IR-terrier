	<brief_title>Safety Study of RPE65 Gene Therapy to Treat Leber Congenital Amaurosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of the proposed trial is to determine the safety and efficacy subretinal administration of a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV 2/2.hRPE65p.hRPE65) at three different dosage levels in individuals with autosomal recessive severe early-onset retinal degeneration due to mutations in RPE65. We have a comprehensive clinical monitoring plan to investigate the safety and efficacy of vector delivery.</detailed_description>
