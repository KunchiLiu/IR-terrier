	<brief_title>CyberKnife Radiosurgery For Low &amp; Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer: Emulating HDR Brachytherapy Dosimetry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, CyberKnife radiosurgery will be used to produce dose distributions comparable to those created by HDR brachytherapy treatment, without the use of invasive catheters. The radiosurgery volumes will closely be made to resemble HDR brachytherapy therapeutic volumes with similar dose limitation objectives to adjacent normal tissues. The CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System is a unique radiosurgical system capable of treating tumors anywhere in the body noninvasively and with sub-millimeter accuracy. The CyberKnife System delivers radiation using a precise targeting methodology allowing a focal treatment margin around the target, thus limiting the volume of adjacent tissue receiving high doses radiation. This in turn allows the delivery of high doses of radiation to the prostate over a short series of treatments.</detailed_description>
