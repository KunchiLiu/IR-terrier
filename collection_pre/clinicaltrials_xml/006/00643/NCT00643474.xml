	<brief_summary>This randomized, parallel study compares 2 groups of type 2 non-insulin treated (NIT) diabetes patients using the Accu-Chek Aviva glucometers. One group (Intensive Group) will perform a 4-point daily glucose monitoring profile 3 times a week Monnier-based. These patients will also receive specific glycemic targets and suggestions on how to reach them following lifestyle recommendations. At the same time, investigators will use SMBG results, downloaded from glucometers, to improve patients' therapy. The second group (Control Group), will follow the SMBG standard care usually adopted in their centers. To be eligible, patients do not to have performed a previous intensive SMBG management (the execution of SMBG measurements used to modify lifestyle, diet or physical activity, in a systematic/structured manner and/or to manage therapeutic approach). The anticipated duration of the trial is 12 months, and the target sample size is 1000 individuals.</brief_summary>
