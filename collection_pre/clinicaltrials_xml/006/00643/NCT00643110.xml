	<brief_summary>Test hypothesis that milk can raise blood sugars as well as orange juice or glucose tablets without raising blood sugars too much the way that orange juice or glucose tablets sometimes do.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Milk as Treatment for Hypoglycemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will wear a continuous glucose monitor prior to test to determine normal glucose levels. The morning of the test an IV will be inserted into the subject and insulin and saline drips will be started. Blood glucose levels will be checked every 10 minutes until the subject becomes hypoglycemic. IVs will be stopped at that time and subject will be given skim milk, orange juice or glucose tablets at that time. Blood will be drawn every 15 minutes until blood sugars stabilize. Blood draws will be analyzed to determine glucose, insulin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone and GLP-1 levels. Procedure will be repeated two more times using other glucose methods (skim milk, orange juice or glucose tablets).</detailed_description>
