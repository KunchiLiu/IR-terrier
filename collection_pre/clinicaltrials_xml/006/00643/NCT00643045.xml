	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and efficacy of two dose ranges of safinamide (High Dose: 150 to 200 mg/day and Low Dose: 50 to 100 mg/day) orally, as compared to Placebo, as add-on therapy in patients with early idiopathic Parkinson's disease who are currently receiving a stable dose of a single dopamine agonist. It is hypothesized that, over a 24-week period, add-on treatment with safinamide will result in greater improvement of motor symptoms in these patients, compared to treatment with a dopamine agonist alone.</brief_summary>
