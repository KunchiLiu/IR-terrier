	<brief_title>Trial of Preoperative Hepatic and Regional Arterial Chemotherapy (PHRAC) to Prevent Postoperative Liver Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We administered FUDR, MMC and Oxaliplatin as preoperative hepatic and regional arterial chemotherapy (PHRAC) to patients with Stage II or Stage III colorectal cancer without apparent liver metastasis based on a thorough preoperative evaluation. The study endpoints were disease-free survival, overall survival, and liver metastasis-free survival as evaluated by intent-to-treat analysis.</detailed_description>
