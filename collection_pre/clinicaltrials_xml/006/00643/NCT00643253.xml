	<brief_summary>We will conduct a randomized, controlled trial of routine, pre-natal care practice-site based pre- and post-natal breastfeeding promotion interventions in low-income minority women, with stratification for maternal country of origin. Our primary outcome measure is breastfeeding duration and extent, i.e. "intensity." Our secondary outcomes measures are: a) infant weight, and b) participant/ provider experiences of the intervention. The Provider Approaches to Improved Rates of Infant Nutrition &amp; Growth Study (PAIRINGS) trial randomizes women to a Prenatal Care Provider (PNC) + Lactation Consultant (LC) intervention, or Control group. The PNCs will use a brief, computer prompted protocol throughout pregnancy and at follow-up of maternal-infant dyads. The LC will meet women, one-on-one while pregnant, at daily hospital rounds, during well-infant care and (as needed) home visits. Post-partum interviews at 1,3 and 6 months will collect infant feeding data. Primary Outcomes (Hypotheses): Breastfeeding 1. Breastfeeding Intensity at 1,3, and 6 Months- There will be significant differences, by treatment group, in BF intensity. Intensity will be assessed via 7 day recall of the frequency of breastmilk feedings vs. other liquids and solids. 2. Exclusive Breastfeeding at 1,3, and 6 Months- There will be significant differences, by treatment group, in the rate of exclusive BF. Secondary Outcomes (Hypotheses): Infant Growth 3. Weight-for-Length, by Breastfeeding Intensity: There will be a significant association between BF intensity and weight-for-length z scores at 4,6,9, and 12 month well-child visits. 4. Weight Gain, by Breastfeeding Intensity: There will be a significant association between BF intensity and weight gain from the 4th -12th month of age. 5. Weight-for-Length, by Treatment Group: There will be a significant association between treatment group and weight-for-length z scores at 4,6,9, and 12 month well-child visits 6. Weight Gain, by Treatment Group: There will be a significant association between treatment group and weight gain from the 4th - 12th month of age.</brief_summary>
