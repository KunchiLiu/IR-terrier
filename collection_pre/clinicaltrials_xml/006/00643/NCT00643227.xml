	<criteria>Outpatients with a diagnosis of pneumonia, as demonstrated by a productive cough and at least 2 of the following signs and symptoms: rales and/or evidence of pulmonary consolidation; dyspnea or tachypnea; elevated body temperature; or elevated total peripheral white blood cell count (WBC &gt;10,000/mm3) or greater than 15% immature neutrophils were included. Patients were to have a chest radiograph demonstrating evidence of a new infiltrate or consolidation, and a Modified Fine Risk score of â‰¤ 70 (Fine Class I and II). Patients who were treated with any systemic antibiotic of greater than 1 dose or 1 combination dose (such as cephalosporin and macrolide) within the previous 7 days, or the likelihood of receiving other systemic antibiotics during participation in the study; were hospitalized in the previous 14 days or had an infection acquired in the hospital, and who were residents of a longterm care facility were excluded.</criteria>
