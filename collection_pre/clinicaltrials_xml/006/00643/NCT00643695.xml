	<brief_summary>In this study, depressed veterans with hepatitis C will be randomly assigned to the control group or to the exercise intervention group. The exercise intervention is designed to begin slowly for most participants and to progress within each participant's target heart rate range for moderate intensity exercise. The exercise intervention is a 12 week home based walking program. Ideally individuals will walk for 30 minutes, at a moderate intensity, a minimum of three times per week. However, the duration and relative intensity will be tailored for each individual. Central Hypothesis Veterans who receive the exercise intervention will be significantly less symptomatic for depression than veterans in the control group.</brief_summary>
