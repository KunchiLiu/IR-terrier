	<brief_title>CyberKnife Radiosurgery for Organ-Confined Prostate Cancer: Homogenous Dose Distribution</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System is a unique radiosurgical system capable of treating tumors anywhere in the body noninvasively and with sub-millimeter accuracy. The CyberKnife System delivers radiation using a precise targeting methodology allowing a focal treatment margin around the target, thus limiting the volume of adjacent tissue receiving high doses radiation. This in turn allows the delivery of high doses of radiation to the prostate over a short series of treatments.</detailed_description>
