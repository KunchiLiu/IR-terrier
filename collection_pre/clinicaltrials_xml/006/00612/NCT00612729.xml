	<brief_summary>Visible-light-filtering IOLs are implanted increasingly often in cataract surgery. Several studies examined the effect of light-filters on contrast and colour vision. However, the study outcomes were varying. The present study investigated the effect of two light-filtering IOL on colour perception and contrast acuity using highly sensitive measurement methods.</brief_summary>
