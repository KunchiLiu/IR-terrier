	<criteria>Histologic diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic CRC that is not curable. The histology types to be included are adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, signet ring, and undifferentiated. Patients with neuroendocrine carcinomas will be excluded. Received 6 cycles (3 months [12 weeks]) of firstline therapy with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI, plus bevacizumab for metastatic CRC. Patients have received at least 5 cycles with bevacizumab. Patients who received 6 cycles of firstline therapy with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI, plus bevacizumab for recurrent CRC that has relapsed at least 12 months after completion of adjuvant therapy will also be included. All standard FOLFOX ( or FOLFIRI) regimens given on a biweekly schedule will be permitted; however, 21day regimens will not be allowed. No more than 4 weeks may pass between the end of firstline therapy (that is, Day 14 of Cycle 6) and randomization. Documented evidence of tumor response of CR, PR, or SD by computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Confirmation of response is not required. Are unable to swallow tablets. Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry. Have known central nervous system metastases. Are receiving concurrent administration of any other antitumor therapy. Patients who have significant heart, liver, kidney, or psychiatric disease or have an active infection</criteria>
