	<brief_summary>A study concerning viral kinetic with 10 co-infected HIV-HCV patients on treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a + ribavirin o IFN + ribavirin was reported in Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections 2002 by Dr. Torriani shown half-life of HCV virions and the viral clearance was larger than mono-infected patients. The doubt is if this difference in viral kinetic of HIV-HCV co-infected patients versus mono-infected is related with the loss of profited on treatment. In the APRICOT trial patients genotype 2/3 were treated for 48 weeks and the relapse rates was only 2%. The present study want to evaluate is the treatment extent for 24 weeks more in patients genotype 1 and/or 4 will be improve the percentage of patients with viral clearance at the end of the follow-up period, to prevent relapsed in patients with response at the end of treatment. Patients will be randomized to received 180 µg/week of peginterferon alfa-2a + 1000-1200 mg/day of ribavirin during 24 weeks more or control.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients on treatment with Peginterferon alfa2a (180 µg/week) in combination with Ribavirin (10001200 mg/day) who are RNAHCV undetectable at 44 week RNAHCV positive at 48 week before study and genotype 1 or 4. HIV1 positive: ELISA y Westernblot. Stable status of HIV1 infection in the opinion of the investigator, (patients who are not expected to progress during the study). Negative urine or blood pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential) documented within the 24hour period prior to the first dose of study drug. Additionally, all fertile males and females must be using two forms of effective contraception during treatment and during the 6 months after treatment end. This may include, but is not limited to, using birth control pills, IUDs, condoms, diaphragms, or implants, being surgically sterilized, or being in a postmenopausal state. Willingness to give written informed consent and willingness to participate to and comply with the study. Patients with RNAHCV detectable after 44 weeks of treatment with Peginterferon alfa2a (180 µg/week) in combination with Ribavirin (10001200 mg/day). Patients with other treatment for chronic hepatitis, different which of inclusion criteria is described. More of tree weeks from the end of treatment with Peginterferon alfa2a (180 µg/week) in combination with Ribavirin (10001200 mg/day) to the inclusion in "EXTRADOS" trial.</criteria>
