	<brief_summary>The aim of the trial is to compare two operations which are used to treat bile duct stones. The hypothesis of the study is that there is no difference between endoscopic sphincterotomy followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy or laparoscopic bile duct exploration during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the treatment of bile duct stones in higher risk patients.</brief_summary>
