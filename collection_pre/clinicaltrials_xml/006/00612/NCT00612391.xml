	<brief_summary>A prospective randomized clinical trial is proposed to compare the plate fixation of proximal humerus fractures using a minimally invasive lateral approach and the traditional anterior approach.Forty five patients will be assigned to each approach (total of 90 patients) and will be assessed 7 times over a two-year period. The trial's primary objectives will be to demonstrate the efficacy of the plating technique in terms of speed of recuperation of function. The Quick DASH will be used for evaluation of function.The study will also examine secondary end-points of pain, range of motion, esthetic satisfaction and radiographic outcome, as assessed by the components of the Constant Score3,4, SF-12V2 Questionnaire, and Patient Scare Assessment Scale Questionnaire. Furthermore, the assessment of safety will be based on the rates of all reported complications and adverse events at 2 years</brief_summary>
