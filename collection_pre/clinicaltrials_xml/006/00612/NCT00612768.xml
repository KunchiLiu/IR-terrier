	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of T.R.U.E. TESTÂ® Fragrance Mix and Thimerosal Allergens:Bioequivalence of PVP Formulations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are conducting an open, prospective, multi-center study to evaluate the bioequivalence of polyvinylpyrrolidone formulations of T.R.U.E. TEST fragrance mix and thimerosal allergens. Bioequivalence will be determined in 40 adult subjects, 20 per allergen, with a clinical history of contact dermatitis and a positive patch test (current or previous) to the corresponding reference petrolatum allergen ("sensitives").</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Current or previous symptoms and/or history consistent with allergic contact dermatitis, and positive patch test (within the past 5 years) to fragrance mix AND/OR thimerosal. All subjects must be adults (18 years of age or older) and otherwise in good health. Premenopausal female subjects must consent to a urine pregnancy test; results must be negative for study inclusion. Informed consent must be signed and understood by each subject, and consistent with all institutional, local and national regulations. Subjects unable to meet inclusion requirements. Women who are breastfeeding or pregnant. Topical treatment during the last 7 days with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents on or near the test area. Systemic treatment during the last 7 days with corticosteroids (equivalent to &gt; 10 mg prednisone) or other immunosuppressive agents. Treatment with ultraviolet (UV) light (including tanning) during the previous 3 weeks. Acute dermatitis outbreak or dermatitis on or near the test area on the back. Subjects unable to comply with patch test study requirements including multiple return visits and activity restrictions (e.g., protecting test panels from excess moisture due to showering or vigorous activity). Subject participation in clinical trials of investigational drugs, treatments, or devices, other than T.R.U.E. TEST, during this study or 3 weeks prior to inclusion in this study.</criteria>
