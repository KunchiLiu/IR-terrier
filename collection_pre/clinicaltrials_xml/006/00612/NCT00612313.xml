	<brief_title>Sequential Treatment of Pediatric MDD to Increase Remission and Prevent Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 1 out of every 12 to 15 children and adolescents. Depression can cause problems with school, family, and friends, and if left untreated, these difficulties can persist into adulthood. Treatments using antidepressants and forms of psychotherapy have been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression. However, many youth experience a return of depressive symptoms within 1 to 2 years of remission. Recent studies have shown that adding cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a form of psychotherapy that focuses on behavioral modification, to initial antidepressant treatment may increase remission and reduce relapse rates. This study will compare the effectiveness of fluoxetine alone versus fluoxetine plus added CBT in increasing recovery and preventing relapse in youth with MDD. Participation in this study will last 78 weeks. Potential participants will undergo initial screening, which will include interviews and questionnaires about mood, behavior, and medical history; vital sign measurements; a meeting with a psychiatrist; and lab draws and/or urine drug or pregnancy tests if indicated by the psychiatrist. All eligible participants will then begin 6 weeks of treatment with fluoxetine. During this 6-week period, participants will attend weekly study visits, which will include vital sign measurements, questionnaires on symptoms and mood, and medication dosage adjustments. At Week 6, participants will be evaluated by an independent evaluator who will determine whether their depression has significantly improved. Participants who have not improved with fluoxetine will end their study participation and will be provided with recommendations for other treatment options. All participants who have shown significant improvement will continue to receive fluoxetine for another 24 weeks, for a total of 30 weeks of treatment. Half of these participants will be randomly assigned to additionally receive CBT for the remaining 24 weeks. All participants will attend study visits that will occur every other week for 3 months and then monthly for 3 months. These visits will last 20 to 30 minutes and will include vital sign measurements and questions about mood and behavior. Participants receiving CBT will also attend 10 to 12 CBT sessions, which will last 50 minutes each and will occur weekly for the first 4 weeks, every other week for 1.5 months, and monthly for the last 3 months. The CBT sessions will involve both individual child and parent-child sessions, which will focus on modifying depressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Participants will undergo repeat evaluations with the independent evaluator at Weeks 12, 18, 24, 30, 52, and 78.</detailed_description>
