	<brief_summary>Primary Objective to estimate 6-month progression free survival probability of patients with recurrent malignant glioma treated with Etoposide + Bevacizumab. Secondary Objectives To evaluate safety &amp; tolerability of Etoposide + Bevacizumab among patients with recurrent malignant glioma (RMG). To evaluate radiographic response, progression free survival &amp; overall survival of patients with recurrent malignant glioma treated with Etoposide + Bevacizumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph II Bevacizumab + Etoposide for Pts w Recurrent MG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exploratory, single-arm, ph II study designed to assess anti-tumor activity of combinatorial regimen consisting of Etoposide + Bevacizumab among patients with RMG. Primary endpoint of study is probability of progression-free survival at 6 months. Important secondary objective is to further assess safety of Etoposide &amp; Bevacizumab for patients with recurrent malignant glioma. If study demonstrates that combinatorial regimen of Etoposide + Bevacizumab is associated with encouraging anti-tumor activity among patients with RMG, further assessment of regimen in additional phase II &amp; possibly phase III studies, will be considered.</detailed_description>
