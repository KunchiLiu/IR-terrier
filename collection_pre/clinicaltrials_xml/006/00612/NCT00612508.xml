	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to help determine if the route by which women receive hormonal contraception causes different changes to occur in the lining of the vagina. The investigators plan to compare an oral route (taking birth control pills) with a vaginal route (using a vaginal ring).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators intend to conduct a prospective, randomized study at Oregon Health and Science University. This study will be conducted over six 28-day cycles. Subjects enrolled in the study will undergo baseline vaginal biopsy and then be randomized to receive either intravaginal ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel (NuvaRing®) or oral ethinyl estradiol and desogestrel (Desogen®). Repeat vaginal biopsies will be obtained after three and six months of exposure to either oral or intravaginal hormonal contraception. These will be analyzed to measure the thickness of the vaginal epithelium and to quantify the presence of Langerhans cell, macrophages, T-lymphocytes and dendritic cells.</detailed_description>
