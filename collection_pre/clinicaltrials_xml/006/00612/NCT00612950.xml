	<brief_summary>The incretin effect is attenuated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus partly due to impaired potentiation of beta-cell responsiveness to glucose by glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 respectively. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether 4 weeks of near-normalization of blood glucose could improve the insulin responses to GIP and GLP-1 in patients with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
