	<brief_title>Study Comparing Efficacy and Safety of Amaryl M and Metformin Uptitraion to Type 2 DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment algorithms for type 2 DM generally employ monotherapy as a first-line pharmacologic treatment option. Disease progression renders monotherapy less effective in controlling blood glucose over time, with approximately half of the patients requiring additional therapy by 3 years after diagnosis. As a result, the use of multiple pharmacologic agents to control blood glucose is well accepted. In combination therapy, selection of suitable drug may be individualized depending on their health conditions. However, it is advisable to select drugs having different mechanism considering their complimentary action with each other. Therefore, sulfonylureas and metformin HCL is the best combination in which "insulin deficiency" and "insulin resistance", the basic two pathophysiologies in type 2 diabetes could be targeted. The efficacy and safety of the combination with sulfonylureas and metformin HCL have been proven in numerous clinical studies as combination is more effective than monotherapy using each drug in blood glucose control. Also, new approaches are required in order to attain and maintain good glycaemic control over time and aggressive earlier introduction of combination therapy is being increasingly recommended over conventional stepwise strategies.</detailed_description>
