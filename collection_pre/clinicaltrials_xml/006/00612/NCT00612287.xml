	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test clinical guidelines for the use of buprenorphine for the treatment chronic pain among patients with substance abuse histories. Buprenorphine, an opioid medication, holds promise as a treatment of chronic pain because, compared to most other opioid analgesics, it has a high safety profile, a low level of physical dependence, and mild withdrawal symptoms on cessation. Moreover there are promising reports from Europe of its use as a skin patch to treat chronic pain as well as clinical reports in the U.S. that it may be effective when used sublingually (placed under the tongue). This study will test the sublingual formulation.</brief_summary>
