	<detailed_description>Major depression has been associated with many individual and interpersonal problems in later life, including inadequate social support, marital distress, spousal depression, poor physical health, and higher rates of mortality. Marital therapy has shown promise as a treatment for depression and coexisting marital distress in younger cohorts, and there is a robust association between social support and depressive symptoms in older adults. The combination of couple therapy and antidepressant medication may provide an ideal treatment for older adults by targeting interpersonal and biochemical aspects of depression. Couples interested in this study will complete an initial assessment with study personnel. In Phase I, eligible couples will receive weekly marital therapy and the depressed partner will receive medication management with a study doctor for 6 months. In Phase II, couples will be randomly assigned to either the combination treatment (marital therapy plus medication management) or medication management alone for 6 months. At the end of the treatment phase, a thorough assessment will be completed. A follow-up assessment will be completed 6 months after completion of treatment.</detailed_description>
