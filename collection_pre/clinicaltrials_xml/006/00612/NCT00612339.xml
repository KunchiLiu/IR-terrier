	<brief_summary>Primary objective- To determine efficacy of Avastin, 10 mg/kg every other week, in combination with standard 5-day temozolomide in terms of response rate. Secondary objective- To determine safety of Avastin &amp; Temozolomide in unresectable glioblastoma patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Avastin in Combination With Temozolomide for Unresectable or Multifocal GBMs and Gliosarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects have histologically confirmed WHO gr IV primary malignant glioma that is unresectable/multifocal. This is Phase II study where up to 41 subjects will receive up to 4 cycles of Avastin &amp; Temozolomide. Avastin administered at 10 mg/kg every 14 days beginning a minimum of 7 days after biopsy/28 days after craniotomy. Temozolomide dosed at 200 mg/m2 daily for 5 days in 28-day cycle. Patients will receive up to 4 cycles of Avastin &amp; Temozolomide, then proceed with standard XRT. Study will use 2-stage "minimax" study design in which 21 subjects are accrued during 1st stage, with possibility that additional 20 patients accrued during 2nd stage. In initial Phase I &amp; II trials, 4 potential Avastin-associated safety signals were identified: hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events, &amp; hemorrhage. Avastin-associated adverse events in Phase III trials include congestive heart failure, GI perforations, wound healing complications, &amp; arterial thromboembolic events. Most common toxicity associated with Temozolomide has been mild myelosuppression.</detailed_description>
