	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to measure the variations of serum and urinary hepcidin levels following a single intravenous injection of erythropoietin in healthy volunteers. Hepcidin is a major regulator of iron homeostasis. It acts by binding on ferroportin, and limits cellular efflux of iron through enterocytes and macrophages. Anemia and hypoxia are known to modulate hepcidin synthesis. In these situations, erythropoietin synthesis is increased, so it can be postulated that erythropoietin could modulate hepcidin synthesis.</brief_summary>
