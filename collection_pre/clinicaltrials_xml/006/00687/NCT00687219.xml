	<brief_summary>The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with peginterferon alfa-2b 1.0 Âµg/kg/week subcutaneous (SC) + ribavirin administered for 48 weeks in participants with chronic hepatitis C and type C compensated liver cirrhosis. Participants who are hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) positive after 24 weeks of treatment will be discontinued from therapy.</brief_summary>
