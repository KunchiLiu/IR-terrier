	<brief_title>Insulin Glargine Versus Twice-Daily NPH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin glargine has a longer action than compared to NPH insulin, but whether this results in improved control when compared to twice-daily NPH insulin is not known when used in low-income ethnic minority patients. This study investigates whether insulin glargine may be more or less effective and safe than twice-daily NPH insulin in this population.</detailed_description>
