Diagnosed history of mildmoderate persistent asthma for at least 12 months. FEV1 must be &gt;60% of predicted normal or personal best FEV1 during the last 12 months. Using daily inhaled corticosteroids for at least 30 days prior to Screening. In the Screening Visit patients FEV1 should be &gt;= 65% to &lt;= 90% predicted. Asthma Symptom Total daily (AM+PM) severity score at Screening Visit should be &lt;= 2. For two weeks prior to Screening, subjects must have been on a stable regimen of one of the following twice daily regimen: fluticasone propionate (FP) &gt;= 100 &lt;= 500 mcg/day; budesonide (BUD) &gt;= 200 &lt;= 1000mcg/day; beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) &gt;= 200 &lt;= 1000 mcg/day; triamcinolone acetonide (TA) &gt;= 400 &lt;= 2000 mcg/day During the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) Dose Reduction period (max. of 4 weeks; min. of 1 week) of sequential ICS Dose Reduction (approximately 50% reduction in daily dose or discontinue according treatment scheme), subjects must demonstrate a measurable loss of asthma control, with both A) Decreased Lung Function (from the Screening value in absolute FEV1 of &gt;= 10% or &gt;= 220ml OR a decrease in AM PEFR of 25% from the average value for the preICS Dose Reduction period on at least 2 consecutive days out of the last 7 days) AND B) Increased Symptoms (Total AM and PM symptom score of &gt;= 10 out of 24 (using 03 scale for each of 4 individual symptoms) on at least 2 days out of the last 7 days OR Increased use of rescue medication from the average value for the preICS Dose Reduction period (one week) of &gt;= 2 puffs on at least 2 days out of the last 7 days) Once criterion above have been fulfilled, subjects can be initiated if the FEV1 is 60%80% predicted Subjects must agree to inform their usual treating physicians of their participation in this study Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Subjects who have not observed the designated washout periods for any of the prohibited medications Subjects who have used any investigational product within 30 days or any antibodies for asthma or allergic rhinitis in the past 90 days prior to enrollment. Subjects who have any clinically significant deviation from normal in the physical examination that may interfere with the study evaluations or affect subject safety. Subjects who have required systemic steroids within the previous month. Subjects who are allergic or have an idiosyncratic reaction to corticosteroids. Subjects who have required inpatient hospitalization for asthma control within the previous 3 months, or more than once in the previous 6 months. Subjects with clinical evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or lung diseases other than asthma. Subjects who have experienced an upper or lower respiratory tract infection within the previous 2 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. Subjects with evidence of clinically significant oropharyngeal candidiasis Subjects with any clinically significant immunologic, metabolic, cardiovascular, neurologic, hematologic, gastrointestinal, cerebrovascular, or respiratory disease (other than asthma), or any other disorder which may interfere with the study evaluations or affect subject safety. Subjects with a history of drug abuse, antagonistic personality, poor motivation, hypochondriasis, or any other emotional or intellectual problems that are likely to limit the validity of consent to participate in the study</criteria>
