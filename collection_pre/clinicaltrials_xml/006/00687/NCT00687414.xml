	<brief_summary>Aim of the study is to analyze the expression of genes and sequences encoding the human mammalian diaphanous (mDia) related formin proteins to test the hypothesis that defects in the mDia expression or function might drive the pathophysiology of myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloproliferative diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Formin Gene Status and Expression in Myeloproliferative and Myelodysplastic Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leukocytes and myeloid lineage cells from these specimens will be assayed for expression of DRF genes using standard molecular biological approaches to measure mRNA levels. Extracted DNA will be analyzed for mutations that affect expressions or function using direct sequencing techniques. Alternatively, expression of DRF gene products (mDia proteins) will be assessed using specific antibodies and flow cytometry. Molecular findings resulting from these assays will be correlated with clinical information recorded in specimen logbook.</detailed_description>
