	<brief_title>Prevention of Obesity in Women Via Estradiol Regulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many factors contribute to the current epidemic of obesity. Although estrogen status is not commonly recognized as a determinant of obesity risk in women, there is strong evidence from large randomized controlled trials that estradiol (E2)-based hormone therapy (HT) reduces weight gain by about 40% in postmenopausal women. Importantly, there is also strong evidence that E2 reduces abdominal fat accumulation, a fundamental component of the Metabolic Syndrome. Some studies suggest risks of HT outweigh the benefits for some women. However, this does not negate the importance of learning the mechanisms by which E2 influences energy balance and fat patterning. This study uses gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog therapy to determine the effects of chronic (5-month) sex hormone suppression on resting energy expenditure (REE), altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, and fat gain. It is hypothesized that REE will be reduced in response to chronic sex hormone suppression, promoting fat gain. It is also hypothesized that stress-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)axis activity will be amplified during sex hormone suppression; altered HPA axis activity leading to cortisol excess causes abdominal fat accumulation. Finally, it is hypothesized that E2 add-back therapy will lessen these responses. Participants will be randomized so that half of the women in each treatment arm will participate in an exercise training program, consisting of progressive resistance exercise to prevent the decline in fat-free mass (FFM) and the increase in fat mass that has been observed in young women in response to GnRH analog therapy.</detailed_description>
