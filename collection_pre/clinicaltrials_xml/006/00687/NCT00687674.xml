	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Lenalidomide may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Sorafenib and lenalidomide may also stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Giving sorafenib together with lenalidomide and dexamethasone may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sorafenib when given together with lenalidomide and dexamethasone and to see how well they work in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib tosylate and lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. (phase I) - To describe the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. (phase I) - To evaluate the confirmed response in patients treated with this regimen. (phase II) Secondary - To correlate clinical effects (adverse events and/or tumor response or activity) with pharmacologic parameters (pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) and/or biologic results (correlative laboratory). (phase II) - To assess overall survival and time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen. (phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of sorafenib tosylate in combination with lenalidomide followed by a phase II study. Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate once to twice daily on days 1-28, oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21, and oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo blood and bone marrow sample collection periodically during study for laboratory correlative studies. Bone marrow plasma samples (i.e., fresh marrow aspirates) are assessed for marrow angiogenesis (microvessel density) by IHC; angiogenic capability (tubular network formation) by in vitro angiogenesis assay; tumor cell proliferation by bromo-2-deoxyuridine uptake; tumor cell apoptosis by three-color flow cytometry (CD38, CD45 or CD138, and 7AAD); and expression of VEGF and soluble VEGF receptors on plasma cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bone marrow biopsies are assessed for various phosphoproteins by IHC; phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 by immunoblotting; and for pharmacodynamic markers (e.g., P70 S6K) by immunoblotting. Blood samples are assessed for surface markers of circulating endothelial cells (CD105, CD34, and CD146) by flow cytometry and for circulating endothelial cell progenitors by late colony formation in mononuclear cells. The endothelial lineage is confirmed by phenotyping of surface markers for endothelial cells. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for phase I and 44 for phase II of this study.</detailed_description>
