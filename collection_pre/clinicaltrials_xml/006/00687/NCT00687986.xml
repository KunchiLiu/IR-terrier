	<brief_summary>The standard treatment for an early stage I lung cancer is surgery. However, surgery can be associated with complications and long-term impairment of the quality of life of patients. Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is a outpatient technique which allows for local control rates that are comparable to those achieved using surgery. In this study, patients with stage IA non-small cell lung cancer will be randomized to either surgery or SRT in order to study the local and regional tumor control, quality of life and treatment costs at 2- and 5-years.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with a cytological or histological diagnosis of stage IA noncell lung cancer diagnosed in accordance with Dutch CBO guidelines [2004]. When no pathological diagnosis is available, a patient with a new or growing pulmonary lesion with radiological features consistent with malignancy AND a lesion showing uptake on a FDGPET scan will be eligible [Herder 2005]. No evidence of regional or distant metastases on a standardized FDGPET scan within 6 weeks of any protocol treatment . The medial extension of tumors should be least 2 cm away from main and lobar bronchi, and also minimum of 1.5 cm from large peripheral blood vessels such as the aorta and main pulmonary artery. Lesions of at least 2 cm from the mediastinal pleura will be eligible if the responsible radiation oncologist judges that the specified normal tissue tolerance doses specified in the protocol will not be exceeded. Patients who are judged by a multidisciplinary team to have 2 primary lung tumors (on the basis of clinical, radiological, FDGPET and/or cytopathology findings) are eligible for randomization provided that both surgery and SRT can be performed in accordance with protocol requirements. Patient should be fit to undergo a complete surgical resection of the lesion in accordance with Dutch CBO guidelines [2004] Performance score of ECOG â‰¤ 2 before any treatment. Able to comply with posttreatment followup Patients must sign and date a written Independent Ethics Committee approved informed consent form. Prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for the present diagnosis of NSCLC. History of any active malignancy (other than NSCLC) unless treated more than 3 years with curative intent and no recurrence, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancers or insitu cervical cancers. Any unstable systemic disease (including active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous year, severe cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, hepatic, renal or metabolic disease). Concomitant treatment with any other experimental drug under investigation. Pregnancy Men and women of childbearing potential not using effective means of contraception for 6 months after treatment has been completed.</criteria>
