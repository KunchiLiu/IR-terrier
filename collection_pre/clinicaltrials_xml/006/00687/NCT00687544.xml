	<brief_summary>In this study, adult Indonesian subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfected with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) will be given peginterferon alfa-2b (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy. The efficacy rate (sustained virologic response, end of treatment virologic response, and sustained biochemical response), the subject morbidity rate as caused by other opportunistic infection (eg, bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis, and other bacterial infection), and the safety and tolerability of this combination therapy will be examined.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Previously untreated chronic hepatitis C with HCVRNA positive in plasma. Must have finished the detoxification phase of a drug rehabilitation program and abstained for at least 6 weeks from using abused substance (alcohol, I.V. drugs and inhaled drugs) before starting therapy. Liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) 1.5fold above the upper limit of normal. Controlled HIV infection with a viral load &lt;10,000 copies/mL and a CD4 cell (Tcell) count &gt;200 x 10^6 cells/L, in response to a stable antiretroviral treatment (ART) or without ART if it is not required. Compensated liver disease with protocolspecified minimum hematologic, biochemical, and serologic criteria at the Entry visit. Alphafetoprotein value within normal limits obtained within one year prior to entry. Results above the upper limit of normal but &lt;=50 ng/mL require both of the following: Alphafetoprotein value &lt;=50 ng/mL obtained within 3 months prior to entry in the study and Ultrasound obtained within 3 months prior to entry in the study or that is negative for evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver biopsy (optional) within 12 months prior to study entry with a pathology report confirming that the histologic diagnosis is consistent with chronic hepatitis. Women of childbearing potential must be using an acceptable method of birth control or be surgically sterilized. Reconfirmation that sexually active males must be practicing acceptable methods of contraception during the treatment period and for 6 months after discontinuation of therapy. Subjects must be free of any clinically significant diseases other than hepatitis or HIV infection that would interfere with study evaluations. Suspected hypersensitivity to interferon, PEGinterferon, or ribavirin. HIV therapy using didanosine (ddI) and stavudine (d4T) in their HIV medications, due to the potentiality of the resulting lactic acidosis. Participation in any other clinical trial within 30 days of entry to this protocol. Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days of entry to this protocol. Subjects with organ transplants other than cornea and hair transplant. Any cause for the liver disease based on subject history and biopsy (where applicable) other than chronic hepatitis C, including but not limited to coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV); hemochromatosis (iron deposition &gt;2+ in liver parenchyma); alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency; Wilson's disease; autoimmune hepatitis; alcoholic liver disease; obesityinduced liver disease. Hemophilia or any other condition that would prevent the subject from having a liver biopsy, including anticoagulant therapy. Hemoglobinopathies (eg, Thalassemia) Evidence of advanced liver disease such as history or presence of ascites, bleeding varices, and encephalopathy. Any known preexisting medical condition that could interfere with the subject's participation in and completion of the protocol such as preexisting psychiatric condition, especially severe depression, or a history of severe psychiatric disorder. Significant cardiovascular dysfunction within the past 6 months (eg, angina, congestive heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, severe hypertension, or significant arrhythmia). Subjects with electrocardiogram (ECG) showing clinically significant abnormalities. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Chronic pulmonary disease (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Immunologically mediated disease. Any medical condition requiring, or likely to require during the course of the study, chronic systemic administration of steroids. Clinical gout. Clinically significant retinal abnormalities. Alcohol consumption of &gt;20 gr/day. Women who are pregnant or nursing. Subjects who have not observed the designated washout periods for any of the prohibited medications.</criteria>
