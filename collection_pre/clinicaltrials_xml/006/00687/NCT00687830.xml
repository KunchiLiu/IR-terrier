The conventional regimen of giving bowel prep on the evening prior to the day of the colonoscopy will be compared with that given on the morning of an afternoon colonoscopy. Endoscopist scoring the bowel cleansing efficacy with an Ottawa Scale are blinded to the randomization process.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Morning-only Bowel Preparation for Afternoon Colonoscopy.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two bowel preparation regimens of Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), commonly referred to as "Golytely" will be tested for their efficacy (bowel cleansing effect) and patient tolerability. The goal is to reduce the failure rates of afternoon colonoscopies, for which, one of the main reasons attributed is inadequate bowel preparation. For the afternoon colonoscopies, the conventional PEG regimen given on the evening prior to the day of the colonoscopy will be compared with the novel PEG regimen given on the morning of the day of the colonoscopy. The comparison will be drawn for two measures - bowel cleansing effect measured from the questionnaire given to the gastroenterologists performing the colonoscopy and the patient tolerability evaluated from the information gathered from the patient's questionnaire.</detailed_description>
