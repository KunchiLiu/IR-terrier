	<brief_title>Participative Rehabilitation in Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a randomized trial, the project Participative rehabilitation process management "Stroke in Saxony-Anhalt" (PaReSiS) implements a case management trial, explicitly including all providers in the course of illness, treatment and rehabilitation. To achieve this, patients in the intervention group have the opportunity to choose, specifically and according to their own needs, from the offers of a web portal and a telephone hotline, from individual counselling and info sessions as well as from home visits. Patients in the control group receive patient-information-notes beyond primary care. There will be qualitative interviews with the persons concerned and/or their relatives in both groups in order to validate the instruments.</detailed_description>
