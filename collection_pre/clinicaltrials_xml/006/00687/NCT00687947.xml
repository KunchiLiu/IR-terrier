	<brief_title>Calcitonin Gene-related Peptide in Familial Hemiplegic Migraine (FHM) and Migraine With Aura (MA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) induces migraine attacks indistinguishable from spontaneous attacks in a large proportion of migraine sufferers. Treatment of spontaneous migraine attacks with an inhibitor of CGRP is effective in many patients. These data show that CGRP is involved in migraine pathophysiology. The importance of migraine genetics is disputed. Evidence from FHM patients with known mutations indicates that migraine pathways in FHM may be different from normal migraine. The aim of the present study is to examine whether this difference also exists in FHM patients without known mutations. The project will improve our understanding of the neurobiology of migraine and stimulate development of new treatment targets.</detailed_description>
