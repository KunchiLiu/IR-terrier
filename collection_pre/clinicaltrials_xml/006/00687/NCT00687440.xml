	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in a first stage, the safety (incidence of cardiac toxicity) of Caelyx in combination with Trastuzumab and Docetaxel; and in a second stage, the tumor response rate of this regimen. This study will be conducted in approximately 30 centers. A total of approximately 70 to 95 subjects will be enrolled.</brief_summary>
