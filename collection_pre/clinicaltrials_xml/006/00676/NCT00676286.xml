	<brief_title>Biological Investigations in Active Surveillance (BIAS) IGAR 2008 I 19 in Prostate Cancer Using High Field MRI (3 Tesla), PET, and Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study may lead to the identification of additional investigations that can monitor for signs of disease progression in active surveillance protocols. This can directly benefit patients by providing them with greater confidence that their disease is being accurately monitored. In addition, this study may be beneficial to the general management of prostate cancers by adding to our knowledge of these investigations characterizing prostate cancers.</detailed_description>
