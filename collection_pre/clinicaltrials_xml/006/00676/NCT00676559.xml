	<brief_title>Combined aPproach to Treatment Using Ranibizumab and Efalizumab for Diabetic Macular Edema Study: The CAPTURE DME Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cell adhesion molecules are key mediators of inflammatory processes, which have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy . Efalizumab inhibits the binding of leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) thereby inhibiting the adhesion of leukocytes to other cell types. Clinical studies have demonstrated the bioactivities of intravitreal ranibizumab, a Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonist, in reducing retinal thickness and improving visual acuity in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). The objective of the CAPTURE Study is to assess the safety and tolerability of efalizumab, administered subcutaneously as a weekly (1 mg/kg) dose, compared to and in combination with ranibizumab, administered intravitreally (0.5 mg), in the treatment of DME.</detailed_description>
