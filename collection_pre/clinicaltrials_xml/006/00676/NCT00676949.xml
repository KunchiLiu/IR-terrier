	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacies of cyclophosphamide combined cancer specific epitope peptides cocktail for advanced/relapsed solid tumors including GI/lung/cervical cancers</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of Cancer Specific Epitope Peptides Cocktail for Cervical, GI, and Lung Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>KOC1, TTK, CO16(URLC10), DEPDC1, MPHOSPH1 have been identified using genome-wide expression profile analysis by the use of cDNA microarray in the previous studies. The investigators have determined the HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides respectively derived from KOC1, TTK, CO16(URLC10), DEPDC1, and MPHOSPH1 showed strong INF-gamma production when stimulated with the appropriate targets expressing the appropriate protein and HLA-A*2402. Furthermore, when vaccinated these peptides, specific CTLs were determined after the vaccination. Therefore the investigators focused on the prevention of further expansion of the solid tumors highly expressing these 5 proteins using these 5 peptides.</detailed_description>
