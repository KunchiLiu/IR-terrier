	<criteria>Male and female outpatients Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 75 years Hypertension and metabolic syndrome defined, according to the ATP III/IDF 2005 and ESH/ESC 2007 definitions, as BP greater than or equal to 130/85 mmHg and &lt;150/95 mmHg (i.e. untreated high normal BP or "low range" mild hypertension) and at least 2 of the following traits at: Abdominal obesity (waist circumference &gt;102 cm for men and &gt;88 cm for women) Triglyceride level greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL High density lipoprotein (HDL) &lt;40 mg/dL for men and &lt;50 mg/dL for women Fasting blood glucose greater than or equal to 110 mg/dL and &lt;126 mg/dL (i.e. no type 2 diabetes) No antihypertensive treatment or treatment with only one antihypertensive medication within the last 3 months. Note: treatment with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)or angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) is not allowed within the last 6 months. Pregnant or lactating female (prerequisite for female subjects of childbearing potential: adequate contraception) Type 1 and type 2 diabetes "High range" mild hypertension (i.e. systolic blood pressure [SBP]: 150 &lt;160 mmHg and /or diastolic blood pressure [DBP]: 95 &lt;100 mmHg) Moderate (SBP: 160 179 mmHg and DBP: 100 109 mmHg), severe (SBP: greater than or equal to 180 mmHg and/or greater than or equal to 110 mmHg), or resistant (hypertension resistant to treatment)hypertension Secondary hypertension of any aetiology, such as renal disease, pheochromocytoma, or Cushing's syndrome</criteria>
