	<brief_title>Resistant Starch on Glycemic Response in Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To measure the blood glucose response, we collected blood samples before eating and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after eating each bar. The incremental area under the curve was used to calculate glycemic index.</detailed_description>
