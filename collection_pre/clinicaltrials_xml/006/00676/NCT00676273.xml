	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether TVT-Secur (TVT-S) (Hammock method) and TVT-Obturator (TVT-O) suburethral sling procedures have equivalent patient satisfaction and clinical efficacy in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence alone or the stress component in mixed urinary incontinence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TVT-Secur Versus TVT-Obturator: A Randomized Trial of Suburethral Sling Operative Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient satisfaction will be measured by symptom quality of life questionnaires (pre-operatively, 3 months and one year) and patient pain will be measured by verbal analogue rating scale (post-operative day 1 and day 7). Clinical efficacy will be measured by a cough stress test pre-operatively and post-operatively at 3 months and 1 year. A Q-tip test will also be performed pre-operatively and at 3 months and 1 year post-operatively. Subjects will be followed for a minimum of one year to evaluate recurrence of symptoms and complications, including the rate of mesh erosion, time to normal void in the post-operative period, the rate of sling revision, post-operative pain, voiding dysfunction and de novo urgency.</detailed_description>
