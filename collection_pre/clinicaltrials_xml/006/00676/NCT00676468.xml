	<brief_summary>Combining fish oil supplementation and Montelukast [a commonly used cyst LT1 receptor antagonist to treat exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB)] will provide a greater antiinflammatory effect against developing EIB that either agent alone</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Effects of Fish Oil Supplementation and a Montelukast on EIB and Airway Inflammation in Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to extend previous published findings that fish oil supplementation represents a beneficial treatment on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). An important question is how dietary fish oil supplementation fits in with the available armamentarium [e.g., leukotriene (LT) modifiers] to decrease the expression of LTs, and whether fish oil supplementation may be additive, or used in its own right to block the EIB response. For example, it is possible that a combination of fish oil supplementation and a cyst LT1 receptor antagonist (LTRA) may provide a greater antiinflammatory effect against developing EIB that either agent alone.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Demonstrate a fall in postexercise FEV1 of &gt; 10% after dry air exercise challenge for the diagnosis of EIB and &gt; 12% increase in FEV1 from the baseline value after the administration of a Î²2agonist. However, if the bronchodilator response is &lt; 12% increase in FEV1 from the baseline value then asthmatic subjects with EIB must further demonstrate A &lt; 16.0 mg.ml1 concentration of methacholine causing a 20% decrease in FEV1 (PC20) Subjects will be excluded if they are pregnant Have a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, bleeding disorders, delayed clotting time Taking aspirin medication and have a resting FEV1 less than 65% predicted. A complete blood count and urinary pregnancy tests will be conducted at the beginning of the study and subjects with a hematocrit &lt; 35 will be excluded from participation in the study. In addition, subjects will also be excluded if they have a history of taking n3 PUFA supplements or supplements with antioxidants above the levels recommended for Adequate Intake, or regularly consume more than one fish meal per week.</criteria>
