	<brief_summary>Phase 1: - Evaluate the safety and tolerability of MEDI-538 given by escalated doses with continuous IV infusion for 4 weeks in adult patients with CLL. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MEDI-538 administered by continuous IV infusion for 4 weeks in this patient population - Describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MEDI-538 - Describe the immunogenicity (IM) of MEDI-538 - Determine the overall response, which is defined as follows: (1) conversion from PD/SD to PR/nPR/CR or conversion from PR to nPR/CR using standard NCI-WG criteria; or (2) conversion from MRD positivity to MRD negativity using 4-color flow cytometry; and - Describe any antitumor activity (ie, time to response and duration of response) of MEDI-538 in this patient population. Phase 2: - To determine the overall response in adult patients with CLL who have residual disease following previous therapy for CLL. - Describe the safety,PK,and IM of MEDI-538 - Determine the time to MRD relapse - Determine the antitumor activity (ie, time to response, duration of response,and time to progression [TTP])of MEDI-538 in this patient population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Antitumor Activity of Continuous Intravenous Infusion of MEDI-538 in Adults With B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1: - Evaluate the safety and tolerability of MEDI-538 at doses of 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, or 60 mg/m2/24h by continuous IV infusion for 4 weeks in adult patients with CLL who have measurable disease following previous therapy for CLL. Patients with measurable disease include patients who demonstrated PD, SD, or PR following previous therapy for CLL; and - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MEDI-538 administered by continuous IV infusion for 4 weeks in this patient population; - Describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MEDI-538 - Describe the immunogenicity (IM) of MEDI-538 - Determine the overall response, which is defined as follows: (1) conversion from PD/SD to PR/nPR/CR or conversion from PR to nPR/CR using standard NCI-WG criteria; or (2) conversion from MRD positivity to MRD negativity using 4-color flow cytometry; and - Describe any antitumor activity (ie, time to response and duration of response) of MEDI-538 in this patient population. Phase 2: - Determine the overall response in adult patients with CLL who have residual disease following previous therapy for CLL. - Describe the safety of MEDI-538 - Describe the PK of MEDI-538 - Describe the IM of MEDI-538 - Determine the time to MRD relapse - Determine the antitumor activity (ie, time to response, duration of response, and time to progression [TTP]) of MEDI-538 in this patient population.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult men or women at least 18 years of age; Written informed consent and Heath Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization (applies to covered entities in the USA only) obtained from the patient prior to performing any studyrelated procedures, including screening visits; Previous confirmation of Bcell CLL with a characteristic immunophenotype by flow cytometry; MRD positivity, determined by 4color flow cytometry of bone marrow or peripheral blood in all patients following previous therapy for CLL; Measurable and/or residual disease following previous therapy for CLL as follows: 1. Measurable disease, as determined by NCIWG criteria, following standard firstline or salvage therapy; this includes patients with PD, SD, or PR (Phase 1 only); 2. Residual disease as determined by measurable disease (ie, PD, SD, or PR) or by MRD positivity, determined by 4color flow cytometry of bone marrow and/or peripheral blood in patients with CR or nPR (Phase 2 only); Time from completing last therapy for CLL is ≥ 3 months but ≤ 1 year; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2; Presence of livein companion (relative or friend) who agrees to NOT leave the patient unattended for &gt; 8 hours per day; Patient agrees to refrain from engaging in hazardous occupations or activities requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; Females, unless surgically sterile or at least 1 year postmenopausal, must use an effective method of avoiding pregnancy (including oral, transdermal, or implanted contraceptives, intrauterine device, female condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap, abstinence, use of a condom with spermicide by the sexual partner or sterile sexual partner) for 21 days prior to the first dose of MEDI538, and must agree to continue using such precautions through 3 months after the last dose of MEDI538. Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Males, unless surgically sterile, must likewise use an effective method of birth control (condom with spermicide) and must agree to continue using such precautions through 3 months after the last dose of MEDI538; Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL and platelets &gt; 75.0 x 109/L; Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN; aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), amylase and lipase ≤ 2 x ULN; Serum creatinine ≤ 2 x ULN and creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1.0 × 109/L; and For patients who have received previous treatment with alemtuzumab, CD4 counts must be &gt; 200 cells/μL with a negative status for cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen.
