	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility and clinical benefits of a new rapid treatment for secondary treatment for secondary brain injury called Discrete Cerebral Hypothermia System by CoolSystems, Inc., Berkley, CA. This device induced hypothermia in the adult brain without significant whole body hypothermia. Discrete Cerebral Hypothermia System holds a great potential for protecting the brain from the devastating secondary complications of trauma without the associated deleterious system effects.</brief_summary>
