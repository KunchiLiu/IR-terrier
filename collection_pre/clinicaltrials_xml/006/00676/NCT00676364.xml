	<brief_title>Randomized Control Trial of a Topical Anesthetic to Evaluate Pain and Anxiety During Venipuncture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric patients frequently receive eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) or other anesthetic medications prior to venipuncture. However, the time for the anesthetic to take affect is approximately 60 minutes. Another anesthetic medication besides EMLA is lidocaine 4% topical anesthetic cream (LMX4), which has a shorter acting time (30 minutes) compared to the EMLA, making it a more desirable medication when urgent labs are required. This medication is being evaluated to assess the anxiety and pain associated with venipuncture in 15 minutes versus the approved 30 minutes of pediatric patients treated as an inpatient or outpatient in the local Emergency Department, compared to standard care (no prior treatment).</detailed_description>
