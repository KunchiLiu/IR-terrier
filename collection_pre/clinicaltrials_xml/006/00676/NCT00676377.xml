	<brief_title>A New Approach of Neostigmine in Unavoidable Post Operative Ileus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We honestly declare that, the use of parasympathomimetic agents such as neostigmine is not without risk. Patients with underlying bradyarrhythmias or those receiving β-adrenergic antagonists may be more susceptible to neostigmine-induced bradycardia. Similarly, neostigmine increases airway secretions and bronchial reactivity, which may exacerbate active bronchospasm. Recently, a new class of drugs—peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists—may help enhance multimodal management of POI. Although, the cost benefit of the new class of drugs is debated. It has been suggested that the individual components of multimodal protocols—for example, laparoscopy—may reduce certain post surgical morbidities (including POI) But do not by them prevent POI. Therefore, combinations of strategies with demonstrated effectiveness—early feeding , epidural analgesia, laparoscopic surgery, and use of peripherally acting mu-opioid-receptor antagonists—may help transform the reactive approach to POI into a proactive multimodal paradigm that effectively targets the diverse etiologic factors leading to this common clinical problem.</detailed_description>
