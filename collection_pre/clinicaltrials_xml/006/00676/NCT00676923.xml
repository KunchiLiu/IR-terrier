	<brief_title>Improving Diabetes After Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this project is to examine the physiological mechanisms that contribute to improvements of glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) following gastric bypass Roux-en-Y bariatric surgery (GBP). The central hypotheses are: 1) that surgical changes in the anatomy of nutrient absorption achieved by GBP change incretin hormone secretion which in turn improves pancreatic islet function; and 2) that improvement in insulin secretion induced by the changes in incretin function, together with improvement in insulin resistance induced by weight loss, normalize glucose homeostasis in type 2 DM. Funds are not available to pay for the surgery for patients, only to address research questions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who are at least 18 years of age and undergo bariatric surgery by a LABS certified surgeon. Enrollment in LABS1 or LABS2. Documented type 2 diabetes (fasting plasma glucose greater than 125 mg/dl) that is treated with lifestyle efforts (drug na√Øve) or taking acceptable oral medications (see appendix) with a HgA1c less than or equal to 8.5% and a fasting blood glucose less than or equal to 180 mg/dL. This will be one group. Nondiabetic (ND) with normal values for fasting glucose and HbA1c. This will be the second group. Adequate IV access. Informed consent not obtained. Patient with diabetes with an HbA1c greater than 8.5% or a fasting blood glucose greater than 180 mg/dL. Creatinine greater than 1.7. Unlikely to comply with the 6 month followup (postsurgical) protocol (i.e. geographically inaccessible for study visits) or unable to communicate with local study staff. Use of unacceptable diabetic medications (see appendix) at baseline (see appendix).</criteria>
