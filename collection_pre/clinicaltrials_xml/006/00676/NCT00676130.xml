	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to quantify the effectiveness of Bactrim as additional therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis in adults, by comparing: standard therapy plus Bactrim, versus standard therapy plus placebo. The primary hypothesis of this study is that, in light of increasing CA-MRSA prevalence, subjects treated with standard therapy plus Bactrim will have higher cure rates than those treated with standard therapy plus placebo.</brief_summary>
