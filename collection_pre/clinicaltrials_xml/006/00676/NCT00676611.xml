	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to study a specific acetabular (hip socket) fracture pattern and how its treatment affects the functional, clinical, and x-ray outcomes. There are no experimental procedures involved.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acetabular Fractures of Both Columns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will identify a small subset of patients that fall outside the Letournel classification system of acetabular fractures. The fracture pattern, its influence on the surgical treatment decision making process, and the radiographic and outcomes will be detailed. In particular, both-column acetabular fractures with significant posterior deformity have been correlated with poor functional outcomes, increased arthritis radiographically, and worse prognosis in general. Despite these findings, there has been no specific study evaluating these injury patterns to date. We present ten patients with both column acetabular fractures and an associated posterior column/wall piece and their clinical outcomes in an effort to help guide surgical treatment and offer prognostic guidance.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patients that underwent surgical fixation of the hip at Hershey Medical Center between June 2006 and May 2007 by Dr's J. Spence Reid and David Goodspeed. They will include patients that are admitted directly from the field or are transferred from outside hospitals. will be those acetabular fractures of nontraumatic etiology (e.g.: secondary to malignancy or fatigue) fractures that have not undergone operative fixation pediatric populations under the age of 18 mentally compromised patients those that do not give consent for the clinical evaluation.</criteria>
