	<brief_summary>AZD6482 is a new drug substance aiming to prevent blood clots which may arise in atherosclerotic blood vessels and cause myocardial infarction or stroke. This is the first study with AZD6482 in humans. The primary aim for this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD6482 in healthy human volunteers. How the substance is metabolised and eliminated from the body will also be studied. This will be done by comparing the effect of single ascending doses of AZD6482 to placebo (inactive substance).</brief_summary>
