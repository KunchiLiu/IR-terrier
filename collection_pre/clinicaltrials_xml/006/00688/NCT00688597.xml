	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of three different doses of AT2220 in people affected by Pompe disease. The study will also evaluate the effects of AT2220 on functional parameters in Pompe disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Safety of AT2220 in Pompe Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will undergo physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), spirometry, muscular strength test, functional muscle test, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) (when appropriate), laboratory tests, MRI and muscle (needle) biopsy. Quality of life will be assessed via SF-36 questionnaire. Functional ability and level of handicap will be assessed by Rotterdam handicap scale.</detailed_description>
