	<brief_title>The Effect of Nasal Carbon Dioxide (CO2) in the Treatment of Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a nasal, non-inhaled administration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. An estimated 500 patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled into this study at approximately 25 sites to ensure that approximately 400 patients are randomized and complete the study.</detailed_description>
