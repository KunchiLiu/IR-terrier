	<brief_summary>IPI-504-06 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IPI-504 as compared to placebo in patients with metastatic and/or unresectable GIST following failure of at least imatinib and sunitinib. Approximately 195 patients will be randomized using a 2:1 ratio to receive either IPI-504 (N=130) or placebo (N=65). Upon unblinding, patients receiving either IPI-504 or placebo may receive IPI-504 in the open-label portion of the study if defined inclusion criteria are met. Early and frequent imaging timepoints (Weeks 2, 5, 8, 14 and every 6 weeks thereafter) are incorporated into this study to capture progression events and limit patient exposure to ineffective agents.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>At least 18 years of age at the time of study randomization. Histologically confirmed metastatic and/or unresectable GIST. Measurable disease on CT or MRI as defined by RECIST. Documented radiographic progression or intolerance to imatinib and sunitinib. Clinical failure of the most recent prior therapy for GIST. Note: There is no limit to the number of prior therapies a patient may have received. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: 0 or 1. Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL (80 g/L). Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1500/µL (1.5 x 109/L). Platelets ≥ 100,000 /µL (100 x 109/L). ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), or ≤ 5.0 x ULN if considered secondary to liver metastases. Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN, or ≤ 5.0 x ULN if considered secondary to liver metastases. Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN. PT and PTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless the patient is receiving warfarin. If the patient is receiving warfarin, the INR must be within therapeutic range. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN. Previous administration of other known heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors. Surgery, radiotherapy, or lesion ablative procedure to the only area of measurable disease. Initiation or discontinuation of concurrent medication that is a potent CYP3A inhibitor less than 2 weeks prior to administration of IPI504 or placebo. History of any of the following within the last 6 months: cardiac disease such as acute coronary syndrome or unstable angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, cirrhotic liver disease, cerebrovascular accident, or any other significant comorbid condition or disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would place the patient at undue risk or interfere with the study. Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhagic event within the last 6 months. Known human immunodeficiency virus positivity. Sinus bradycardia (resting heart rate &lt; 50 bpm) secondary to intrinsic conduction system disease. QTcF ≥ 470 milliseconds, or previous history of clinically significant QTc prolongation while taking other medications. History of prior malignancies within the past 3 years other than nonmelanomatous skin cancers that have been controlled, prostate cancer that has been treated and has not recurred, nonmuscleinvasive bladder cancer, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Active or recent history (within 3 months) of keratitis or keratoconjunctivitis confirmed by ophthalmology or optometry exam. Presence of Left Bundle Branch Block, Right Bundle Branch Block plus left anterior hemiblock, bifascicular block, or 3rd degree heart block. This does not include patients with a history of these events with adequate control by pacemaker. Known CNS metastases. Women who are pregnant or lactating.</criteria>
