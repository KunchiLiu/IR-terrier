	<brief_summary>This non-randomized, prospective, interventional observational multi-center study is designed to assess the long-term clinical performance of the Medtronic Melodyâ„¢ Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve (TPV) in the post market environment over a period of five years after transcatheter implantation in patients with dysfunctional RVOT conduits. In addition, the quality of life of implanted subjects will be assessed over five years.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Prospective subjects have complex congenital heart defects that have been palliated with RVOT conduits that have become dysfunctional and have a clinical indication for invasive intervention. Prospective subjects must meet all of following inclusion and exclusion criteria: Age greater than or equal to 5 years of age Weight greater than or equal to 30 kilograms Existence of a full (circumferential) RVOT conduit that was equal to or greater than 16 mm in diameter when originally implanted Any of the following by transthoracic echocardiography For patients in NYHA Classification II, III, or IV: Moderate (3+) or severe (4+) pulmonary regurgitation, or Mean RVOT gradient greater than or equal to 35 mmHg. For patients in NYHA Classification I: Severe (4+) pulmonary regurgitation with RV dilatation or dysfunction, or Mean RVOT gradient greater than or equal to 40 mmHg. Active endocarditis A major or progressive noncardiac disease (e.g. liver failure, renal failure, cancer) that results in a life expectancy of less than one year Patient or for patients who cannot legally give consent themselves the guardian unwilling or unable to provide written informed consent or comply with followup requirements Obstruction of the central veins (including the superior and inferior vena cava, bilateral iliac veins) such that the delivery system cannot be advanced to the heart via transvenous approach from either femoral vein or internal jugular vein Known intravenous drug abuse</criteria>
