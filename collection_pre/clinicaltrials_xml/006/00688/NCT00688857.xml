	<brief_summary>This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, multi-dose crossover study assessing the pharmacokinetic profiles of diazoxide choline coated versus uncoated formulations in healthy volunteers. The primary objective is to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of diazoxide choline controlled-release coated tablets versus uncoated tablets in healthy volunteers under fed conditions. Secondary objectives are to assess diazoxide choline pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters under fasted conditions, and to assess the safety and tolerability of diazoxide choline controlled-release coated tablets versus uncoated tablets in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
