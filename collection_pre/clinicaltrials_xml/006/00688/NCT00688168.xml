	<brief_summary>The goal of this research study is to learn about the pain and/or other symptoms that patients may experience either while you are being monitored by your doctor before a decision is made to start you on treatment for your MM, or during and after treatment for MM, and how these symptoms may affect therapy. A second goal is to learn how differences in genes may affect the symptom burden from cancer and cancer therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete 5 questionnaires during a regularly scheduled clinic visit. These questionnaires will measure pain and other symptoms, such as your mood and quality of life. You will also be asked to give a tissue sample by inserting a swab into your mouth and rubbing firmly against the inside of your cheek or underneath your lower or upper lip for about a minute at most. Completing the 5 questionnaires and the swab sample collection takes about 30 minutes in total. This is an investigational study. Up to 500 patients will take part in the cross-sectional phase of this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
