	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefits and risks of lixisenatide (AVE0010), in comparison to placebo, used in a 2-step dose titration regimen in monotherapy, over a period of 12 weeks of treatment. The primary objective is to assess the effects of lixisenatide, in comparison to placebo, on glycemic control using a 2-step dose titration regimen in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction (absolute change) at Week 12. Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of lixisenatide, in comparison to placebo, on glycemic control in terms of HbA1c reduction when it is used in a one-step dose titration regimen over a period of 12 weeks, body weight, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) after a standardized meal, to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and anti-lixisenatide antibody development.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-arm, unbalanced design, parallel group study with a two-step titration regimen or a one-step titration regimen. The study is double-blind with regard to active and placebo treatments; however neither the study drug volume nor the titration regimens (that is, two-step or one-step) are blinded.</detailed_description>
