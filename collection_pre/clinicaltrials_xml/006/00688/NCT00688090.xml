	<brief_title>Safety and Immune Response to a Multi-component Immune Based Therapy (MKC1106-MT) for Patients With Melanoma.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The multi-component active immunotherapy, MKC1106-MT, consists of 1 plasmid dose and 2 peptides doses designed to stimulate an immune reaction to two tumor associated antigens (Melan-A and tyrosinase). The plasmid component will be administered on Days 1,4, 15 and 18 of each treatment cycle followed by administration of peptides on Days 29 and 32 of the treatment cycle. All components will be administered separately into superficial inguinal lymph nodes under ultrasound guidance.</detailed_description>
