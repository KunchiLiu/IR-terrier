	<brief_summary>Treatment of chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is challenging for patients and physicians once conventional therapies fail. We hypothesize that combined sono-electro-magnetic therapy can improve refractory CPPS in men. In addition, we postulate that combined sono-electro-magnetic therapy as well as placebo therapy has a significant effect on brain activity detectable by functional MRI.</brief_summary>
