	<brief_title>Antimicrobial Susceptibility Patterns of N. Gonorrhea Isolates in an Era of Quinolone Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Until recently, the fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) have been the first line oral agents for the empiric treatment of gonorrhea. The prevalence of quinolone resistant Neisseria gonorrheae (QRNG) has been rising since 2000. In 2006, the CDC updated its guidelines to include recommendations against the use of quinolones for treatment of Neisseria gonorrheae. Ceftriaxone (available only by intravenous or intramuscular route) was named as the first line treatment for urogenital and pharyngeal disease. Availability, in the United States, of the other two CDC recommended agents cefixime (oral) and spectinomycin (IM) has been nonexistent. At this time, there is little data on the in-vitro (laboratory test) susceptibility of antibiotics against gonorrhea, particularly oral drugs. The purpose of this study is to collect specimens of gonorrhea in a non-invasive swab manner from men with symptomatic urethral discharges for laboratory sensitivity testing against a wide array of antibiotic agents. Specific Aims: To perform a laboratory sensitivity testing survey of antibiotic agents against Neisseria gonorrhea isolates from men with symptomatic urethritis seen at a Duval County STD clinic .</detailed_description>
