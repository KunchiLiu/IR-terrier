	<brief_title>Blind Elderly Melatonin Treatment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators intend to study as many as 26 subjects through up to four melatonin treatment regimens, all of which involve a dose step-down in which the melatonin dose will be reduced gradually to find the lowest effective dose. The 4 treatment plans differ only in the start dose and the time of administration. Successfully treated subjects will enter a one-year intensive assessment of the safety and efficacy of melatonin treatment in which the subject will take the same dose for one year and complete biweekly assessments of efficacy and side-effects. The final phase of the study involves a placebo discontinuation, in which the subject's circadian rhythm will be returned to the baseline rhythm (this may take up to 6 months for some subjects).</detailed_description>
