	<brief_summary>Residual renal function is reported to contribute to the survival and cardiovascular disease of peritoneal dialysis patients. Oxidative and carbonyl stress are increased in peritoneal dialysis patients and are associated with cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to determine the relations between residual renal function and oxidative and carbonyl stress in peritoneal dialysis patients.</brief_summary>
