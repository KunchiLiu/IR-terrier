	<brief_title>Safety Study Involving Oxaliplatin With Docetaxel for Recurrent Ovarian,Primary Peritoneal, and Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized, open-label Phase I trial in patients with previously treated, recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Patients may have either platinum -sensitive (relapse &gt; 12 months from primary therapy) or platinum-resistant (relapse ≤ 12 months from primary therapy) disease. Up to 20 patients will be enrolled into each of the following arms: - Arm 1 patients will receive intravenous docetaxel at standard dosing of 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour on day #1 followed by intraperitoneal oxaliplatin on day #2 until maximum tolerated dose is achieved. - Arm 2 patients will receive intravenous oxaliplatin at standard dosing of 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour on day #1 followed by intraperitoneal docetaxel on day #2 until maximum tolerated dose is achieved. Treatment will be repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity.</detailed_description>
