	<brief_summary>Vitamin D is available in two forms, vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. It has previously been assumed that these two forms maintain blood vitamin D equally. However, this may not be the case. This study will evaluate whether D2 and D3 produce equal elevation of blood vitamin D. Additionally, it will evaluate whether once per month vitamin D dosing is as effective in maintaining blood vitamin D levels as daily dosing.</brief_summary>
