	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and safety of simultaneous islet-kidney transplantation in patients of type 1 diabetes with end-stage renal disease using a glucocorticoid-free immunosuppressive regimen with alemtuzumab induction. Islet transplantation can result in insulin independence with excellent metabolic control when glucocorticoid-free immunosuppression is combined with the infusion of an adequate islet mass. Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H ®) is a 150-kDa humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets the CD52 antigen. Prolonged lymphocyte depletion can be expected following alemtuzumab treatment.</brief_summary>
