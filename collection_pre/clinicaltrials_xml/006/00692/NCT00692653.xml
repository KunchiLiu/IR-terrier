	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not participation in an experimental program called the "P4 program" is useful to men who are faced with choices about treatment for their early stage prostate cancer. The P4 program consists of a series of questions and information for the participant. Before seeing the cancer specialist, participants will answer several questionnaires on a computer. This will take about 20-30 minutes. Participants may choose to do this on a computer at home or on a touch-screen computer in the clinic. Half the participants will then be shown several highly rated informational websites about prostate cancer treatments. The other half, based on the individual participant's answers, will receive the P4 program's customized written and on-screen information. Reading the information and watching videos will take about 20 minutes. About one month later, and again 6 months, participants will complete follow-up questionnaires electronically or by mail. These questionnaires will help us understand how each participant's decision for treatment of their prostate cancer went. Answering these questionnaires should take about 20 minutes each time.</brief_summary>
