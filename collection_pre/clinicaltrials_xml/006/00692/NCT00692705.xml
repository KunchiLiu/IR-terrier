	<brief_summary>The study is carried out in order to investigate if [11C]AZD2995, compared to [11C]AZD2184, is a more suitable PET ligand for in vivo imaging of β amyloid depositions in the human brain. In the study the two PET ligands will be examined in both healthy volunteers and patients with Alzheimer's Disease.</brief_summary>
