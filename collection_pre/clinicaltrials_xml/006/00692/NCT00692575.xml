	<brief_title>Telephone Intervention for Caregivers of Persons With Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Caregivers and patients with TBI are recruited from the acute medical and inpatient rehabilitation units at Harborview Medical Center and the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle, WA. After informed consent is obtained, information is gathered from the caregiver about his/her living situation, support systems, and the nature of the caregiving relationship. Additional information is gathered from the person with TBI about how he/she is doing cognitively, socially, and emotionally. Prior to discharge home, caregivers are randomly selected to receive either standard care (typical support and/or resources) or standard care plus problem-based telephone counseling. The telephone follow-up group receives a telephone call from a caregiver support specialist at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 weeks after discharge of the patient with TBI home with the option of two additional calls. During those calls, the caregiver support specialist provides training on problem-solving skills along with education on topics of interest to caregivers of persons with TBI. An outcome assessment is done at 6 months and 1 year after discharge home.</detailed_description>
