	<brief_summary>Serious bacterial infections are often difficult to detect in children with fever without source. Procalcitonin is a better blood marker of infection than White blood cell count and possibly than C-reactive protein. This could lead to a reduction in antibiotic prescription. Our objective is to evaluate the impact of Procalcitonin result on antibiotic prescription in children 1 to 36 month old with fever without source and our hypothesis is that it will lower the antibiotic prescription rate</brief_summary>
