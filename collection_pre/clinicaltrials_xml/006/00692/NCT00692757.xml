	<brief_title>Wound Antiseptic Study With Hypochlorous Acid &amp; Iodopovidone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A topical antimicrobial that decrease the bacterial bioburden of surgical wounds without impairing the wound's ability to heal is a need. A stabilized form of hypochlorous acid has been demonstrated in vitro and in animal studies to possess properties that could fulfill these criteria but it is imperative to assess its efficacy and safety in humans. To assess hypochlorous acid efficacy and safety, it was designed a clinical controlled randomized trial to compare hypochlorous acid to iodopovidone, the gold standard, in preoperative scrub of surgical area.</detailed_description>
