	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) on shortness of breath, exercise capacity, symptom control, mental health, cognitive function, and quality of life in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Pulmonary rehabilitation has already been shown to benefit patients with other chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We believe that pulmonary rehabilitation will benefit patients with IPF as well.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goals of this project are to assess the effect of PR on a number of important outcomes in patients with IPF. Once enrolled in the study, subjects will complete a battery of questionnaires and tests that assess symptoms, quality of life, cognition, and mental health, and then subjects will complete a six week outpatient PR program (at National Jewish Medical and Research Center or other PR programs). Subjects will complete the same battery of questionnaires and tests immediately after completion of the PR program and again six months later.</detailed_description>
