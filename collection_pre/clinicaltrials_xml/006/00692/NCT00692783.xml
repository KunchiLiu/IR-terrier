	<brief_summary>C. dubliniensis has been identified as pathogen in Oropharyngeal Candidiasis(OPC)particularly among HIV patients. Azole therapy is a cornerstone in OPC, but resistance within C. dubliniensis isolates to diflucan is common.This is a prospective collection of biological specimens from oropharyngeal cavity with the purpose of determining the prevalence of C. dubliniensis in HIV/AIDS patients at the Duval County Department of Health Comprehensive care Center. It is hereto proposed an estimation of azole-resistance in these isolates.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incidence of Oral Candidiasis, Prevalence of C. Dubliniensis in HIV Patients and In-vitro Azole Susceptibility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study to try to establish the prevalence of C. dubliniensis as a causative organism of OPC in HIV and/or AIDS patients. We will aim to establish the resistance pattern for azoles but also for Flucytosine and amphotericin of these isolates. This study will serve as a support to previously published articles that have suggested intrinsic azole-resistance within this particular species of candida and we will try to postulate its possible correlation with clinical failure.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Any patient 18 years old or older with a documented diagnosis of HIV infection with or without AIDSdefining illnesses at the time of assessment, who is presenting with clinical symptoms and physical findings compatible with oropharyngeal candidiasis (as defined by the IDSA Guidelines for the Treatment and Management of HIV and HIV related complications. Any prior diagnosis or established treatment for oropharyngeal, mucocutaneous or esophageal candidiasis documented in the patient's chart or any proven diagnosis based on reviews of physically available medical records and or history provided by patients that can be subject to later confirmation pertaining to the use of parenteral antifungals within 6 months prior to enrollment (azoles, echinocandins, amphotericin B, Flucytosine, etc).</criteria>
