	<brief_summary>acidosis, acute renal failure and acute pulmonary oedema are common, and frequently fatal, manifestations of severe P. falciparum malaria. The course of all three might be ameliorated by optimising a patient's intravenous fluid therapy. The fluid treatment of severe malaria is presently empirical, by defining cardiovascular responses to volume replacement we would provide a physiological basis for resuscitation strategies. We will use pulse contour cardiac output monitoring (PiCCOTM) to guide the fluid resuscitation of patients admitted to intensive care with severe malaria. With data collected during the patients' admission we hope to: 1. Assess the degree of hypovolaemia in adults with severe malaria and its contribution to microcirculatory dysfunction and acidosis. 2. To assess the relationships between volume status, haemodynamic parameters and the renal and pulmonary manifestations of severe malaria. 3. To assess the utility of central venous pressure measurement as a guide for fluid administration in patients with severe malaria 4. To investigate the prognostic and clinical utility of central venous oxygen saturation in severe malaria In this way we hope to develop a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of haemodynamic derangement in severe malaria. By comparing the PiCCO derived data with simpler clinical parameters, we hope to determine potential fluid resuscitation strategies - relevant for a resource poor setting - whose efficacy could be confirmed in future trials.</brief_summary>
