Uncontrolled hypertension according to the treating physician Unstable angina or recent myocardial infarction (within the last 3 months), current NY Heart Association Class III (marked limitation of physical activity; although patients are comfortable at rest, lessthanordinary activity leads to fatigue, dyspnea, palpitations, or angina3) or IV (symptomatic at rest; symptoms of CHF are present at rest; discomfort increases with any physical activity) or symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmias, as per medical history (a baseline ECG will not be required.) Any history of seizure, except for febrile seizures of childhood Participation in another clinical trial involving rehabilitation (recreational therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy) or involving an investigational drug.
