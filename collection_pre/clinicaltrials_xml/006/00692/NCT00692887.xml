	<brief_summary>Study come to investigate the correlation between visual fields (VF) defects map generated by preferential hyperacuity perimeter (PHP) and features of the choroidal neovascular lesions (CNV) demonstrated by Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT). To investigate the Foresee PHP ability to asses treatment progression post treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation Between Visual Field Defects on Foresee Preferential Hyperacuity Perimeter(PHP) and on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) in Patients With Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Foresee PHP is used in the recent years to detect Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) lesions. The device is capable of differentiation as to stages of AMD and early detection of changes including choroidal neovascularization (CNV) The Foresee PHPâ„¢ demonstrates a high level of sensitivity and specificity as to the different stages of AMD including newly diagnosed or early detection of CNV. The OCT May be use as well to identify choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Comparison between the two methods will allow better understanding of both devices. The Foresee PHP can use as an assessment tool for the progression and success of the treatment given to AMD lesions. Therefore, evaluation the size and the location of the treated lesions may serve as an additional tool.</detailed_description>
