	<brief_title>Maintenance Bee-Venom Immunotherapy Administered at 6-Month Intervals Does Not Protect Against re-Stings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The intervals at which maintenance venom immunotherapy (MVIT) is administered have been progressively extended over the years. Objective: To examine whether the administration of bee venom (BV) maintenance dose (MD) at 6-month interval is safe and efficacious. Methods: The usual 3-month interval at which venom allergic patients were receiving their MVIT was gradually extended to 6 months. Systemic reactions (SRs) to immunotherapy injections or to field stings were regularly recorded. BV allergic patients were deliberately sting-challenged after reaching the 6-month interval.</detailed_description>
