	<brief_summary>The first phase of the study is a hospital-based cross-sectional, epidemiological survey. The required sample size is 1,260 patients from 50 hospitals across Thailand. Each of the hospital will enroll 10 to 40 consecutive patients, depending on case availability on the date conducting the survey, with dyslipidemia and classified as high risk as defined by the protocol. Lipid levels will be based on serological analysis conducted by a local laboratory. For the second phase, each subject will be followed for survival status at 36 months after enrollment. Such follow-up will be done by searching the Thai National Vital Event Registration Database using subjects' Population Identification Number. All activities regarding case selection and data collection will be done by well trained clinical research associates (CRAs). The CRAs are from Khon Kaen University where the Statistical Coordinating Center (SCC) for this project is based and are independent of the investigator. Random auditing visits will also be performed by auditors independent of the SCC. These are to ensure not only high quality data but also protecting right and well being of subjects.</brief_summary>
