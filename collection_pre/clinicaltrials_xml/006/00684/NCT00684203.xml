	<brief_summary>The study is designed to assess safety and effects of vorapaxar, when added to standard of care (aspirin and clopidigrel), in Japanese subjects with acute coronary syndrome. The study may also provide information about the effect of vorapaxar on preventing heart attack and stroke in this subject population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial to Assess the Safety and Effects of Vorapaxar in Japanese Subjects With Acute Coronary Syndrome (P04772; MK-5348-016)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study drug (loading dose) is administered at least 1 hour before catheterization for diagnostic imaging or percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The incidence of bleeding is thought to be an important index to assess the safety of this drug, therefore thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) is evaluated.</detailed_description>
