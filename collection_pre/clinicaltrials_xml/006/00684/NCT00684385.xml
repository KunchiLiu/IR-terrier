	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to provide ZD1839 for those patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic non-operable non-small cell lung cancer (stage III or IV) or recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer who receive the therapy on an expanded access basis due to their inability to meet eligibility criteria for on-going recruiting trials, inability to participate in other clinical trials (e.g., poor performance status, lack of geographic proximity), or because other medical interventions are not considered appropriate or acceptable.</brief_summary>
