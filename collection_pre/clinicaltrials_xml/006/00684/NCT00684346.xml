	<brief_title>18FDG-PET Imaging to Detect Changes in Airways Inflammation in Cystic Fibrosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neutrophils play a key role in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease. We know that neutrophilic inflammation is related to a decline in pulmonary function. Therefore, early anti-inflammatory intervention is an opportunity to slow this irreversible pulmonary destruction. However, the development of sensitive, non-invasive diagnostic tools of airways inflammation is essential to the study and implementation of anti-inflammatory therapies. Our current armentarium of measures of airways inflammation is limited. BAL is invasive and not clinically acceptable as a tool for the serial measurement of inflammation. Sputum samples are highly variable and not reliable. 18FDG-PET is a promising tool because it is non invasive, has been shown to quantify the amount and location of neutrophilic inflammation and has the potential to be used to track inflammation over time. Therefore, the goal of this research study is to evaluate the ability of 18FDG -PET imaging to detect changes in airways inflammation in CF patients in response to conventional treatment for a pulmonary exacerbation</detailed_description>
