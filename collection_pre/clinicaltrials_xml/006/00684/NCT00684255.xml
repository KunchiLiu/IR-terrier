	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a reduced intensity (RI) (non-myeloablative) chemoimmunotherapy followed by Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation AlloSCT (matched family donors and matched unrelated cord blood donors) will be well tolerated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced Intensity Transplant in Medically Refractory Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Systemic Sclerosis (SSc)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is to test whether a reduced intensity will result in a high degree of mixed or complete donor chimerism and stabilization of autoimmune disease in a select group of patients with medically refractory SLE or SSc.</detailed_description>
