	<brief_summary>Subcutaneous injections are a widely used method for drug delivery. One of its major drawbacks is the pain inflicted during the process. Sindolor has developed the chemical-free EZ-Ject Injector device, based on employing cutaneous local anesthesia on the injection site by an electronic anesthetic system. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the EZ-Ject for subcutaneous injections.</brief_summary>
