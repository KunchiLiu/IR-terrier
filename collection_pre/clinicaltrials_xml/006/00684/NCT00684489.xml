	<brief_summary>Plasma renin values determine whether volume or vasoconstrictor (renin) factors predominate in elevating blood pressure and are useful in selecting effective antihypertensive therapy.2,3 The researchers hypothesize that: 1. Plasma renin-guided therapeutics will improve systolic and diastolic blood pressure control in patients with untreated hypertension as well as in patients with treatment refractory or resistant hypertension that are managed by Clinical Hypertension Specialists. 2. Renin-guided therapeutics will reduce the number of medications required to maintain blood pressure control to &lt;140/90 mmHg in hypertensive patients receiving 3 or more medications, while under the care of a Clinical Hypertension Specialist. 3. Renin-guided therapeutics selection will reduce the total cost of antihypertensive care provided by Clinical Hypertension Specialists.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypertension affects ~25% of adults. The prevalence of hypertension and related complications is greater among the elderly, obese, and ethnic minorities. Unfortunately, hypertension control rates remain in the 25% range and are often significantly lower for the high-risk groups noted.1 Since the high-risk groups are growing more rapidly than the general population, the prevalence of hypertension and associated morbidity and mortality will probably increase sharply in the years ahead unless successful strategies are implemented for dramatically improving blood pressure control. Direct measurements of plasma renin reflect the relative balance between volume (V) and vasoconstrictor (renin [R]) factors underlying the elevated blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension.2 While many antihypertensive medications have effects on both the volume (V) and vasoconstrictor (renin [R]) components of elevated blood pressure, one or the other usually predominates</detailed_description>
