	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets and Ambien速 Under Fasting Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to compare the bioequivalence of a test formulation of zolpidem tartrate tablets to an equivalent oral dose of the commercially available reference drug product Ambien速 (zolpidem tartrate tablets) in adult subjects under fasted conditions. Thirty-eight healthy, non-smoking, non-obese male and female volunteers at least 18 years of age will be randomly assigned in a crossover fashion to receive each of two zolpidem tartrate dosing regimens in sequence with a 7 day washout period between dosing periods. On the morning of Day 1, after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will receive either a single oral dose of the test formulation, zolpidem tartrate (1 x 10 mg tablet) or a single oral dose of the reference formulation, Ambien速 (1 x 10 mg tablet). After a 7 day washout period, on the morning of Day 8 after an overnight fast, subjects will receive the alternate regimen. Blood samples will be drawn from all participants before dosing and for 12 hours post dose at times sufficient to adequately define the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem tartrate. A further goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this regimen in healthy volunteers. Subjects will be monitored throughout the confinement portion of the study for adverse reactions to the study drugs and/or procedures. Blood pressure and pulse rate will be obtained prior to dosing and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 hours post-dose. All adverse events whether elicited by query, spontaneously reported or observed by clinic staff will be evaluated by the investigator and reported in the subject's case report form.</detailed_description>
