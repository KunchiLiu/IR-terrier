	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the overall response rate to imatinib mesylate in participants with relapsed or refractory T cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This drug has been used in chronic myeloid leukemia and information from those other research studies suggests that it may help to treat T cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary Objective To evaluate the overall response rate Secondary Objectives To assess the safety and tolerability To assess the duration of response To assess the progression free survival and overall survival STATISTICAL DESIGN: This trial will use a single stage design to differentiate a &gt;/= 25% response rate from a &lt;/= 5% rate. If observed data is consistent with the alternative response rate of 25%, imatinib would be deemed clinically interesting and worthy of a larger phase II study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed T NHL, excluding T prolymphocytic leukemia, T lymphoblastic lymphoma, and T/NK large granular lymphocytic leukemia. Measurable disease, defined as at least one bidimensionally measurable site of disease measuring at least 1.5cm in greatest diameter. Failed at least one systemic chemotherapy or biologic therapy for T cell lymphoma unless it can be clearly documented that the patient can not tolerate such therapy. 18 years of age or older Life expectancy of greater than 3 months ECOG Performance Status of lesser then or equal to 2 Normal organ and marrow function as outlined in the protocol Agree to the use of adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of the study Chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study Receiving any other study agents CNS lymphoma requiring active therapy History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to imatinib mesylate Participants requiring concomitant administration of any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible Patient previously received radiotherapy to 25% or greater of the bone marrow Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant or lactating women History of a different malignancy except for individuals who have been diseasefree for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy HIVpositive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy Known chronic liver disease Major surgery within 2 weeks prior to study entry</criteria>
