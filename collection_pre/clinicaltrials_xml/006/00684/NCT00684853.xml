	<brief_title>Intravitreal Bevacizumab Combined With PDT Versus Bevacizumab to Treat Exudative AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exudative AMD is the leader of blind in people more than 60 years. The best treatment for this disease today are monthly injections of anti-VEGF in the vitreous cavity which increase the chance to get endophthalmites. The participants of this study will be randomized in 1:1 ration to one of the two study groups: single therapy of bevacizumab (3 injections in 3 months) or association of bevacizumab (3 injections in 3 months) and full fluence of PDT (single at the baseline). All bevacizumab injection will contain 1.25g of the drug and will be administrate every month for 3 continuos months. After randomization, participants will return to the clinic approximately every four weeks for 4 months for study assessments and possible re-treatment (if is necessary). Participants will return to the clinic at week 20 for a final study assessment. Study assessments include: visual acuity, optical coherence tomography and fundus photography.</detailed_description>
