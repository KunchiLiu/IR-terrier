	<brief_summary>The study aims at determining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surgical management of subacromial impingement (including partial tears) compared to conservative treatment. The research setting is prospective, randomised, and controlled. The aim of the study is to search out evidence based data of indications for subacromial decompression. The investigators also aim at offering patients the most efficient and effective treatment and reduce the number of operations that do not have sufficient effectiveness. The data obtained will facilitate developing guidelines for referrals to a specialist when subacromial impingement is suspected. The investigators hypothesise that there are subgroups of patients suffering from subacromial impingement that benefit from surgery whereas other subgroups are best treated conservatively.</brief_summary>
