	<brief_summary>Human immunodeficiency virus/Hepatitis B virus (HIV/HBV) co-infections are frequently observed due to shared routes of transmission, with reported figures indicating 6-9% of HIV-infected individuals in developed countries are chronically infected with HBV. HIV infection impacts on the natural progression of HBV infection, increasing levels of HBV replication and the risk of liver-associated mortality. Liver diseases associated with HBV are affected by the antiviral drugs used for HIV infection (toxic side effects), the current immune function in the patient, by improvements in the immune system brought about by control of the HIV infection, and by the development of resistance to the antiviral agents used for both the hepatitis B and the HIV infection. Co-infection with HBV increases the risk for hepatotoxicity in those individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for their HIV infection. This study will recruit patients who are co-infected with HIV and HBV, and are currently taking or who are about to commence HAART. The study cohort will include HIV-HBV co-infected individuals from the Alfred Hospital, the Royal Melbourne Hospital and high case load GP clinics who are referred to the Alfred Hospital. The aim of the study is to investigate chronic hepatitis B and its impact on the progression of liver disease in HIV-infected persons receiving HAART. This will be achieved by 6 monthly assessment with medical history, physical examination, bloods for markers of liver disease and hepatitis B activity and completion of questionnaires to measure adherence and alcohol use.</brief_summary>
