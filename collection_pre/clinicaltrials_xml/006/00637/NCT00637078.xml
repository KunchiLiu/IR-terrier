	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess if the implementation of a treatment algorithm including initial treatment with a low dose diuretic/ACE-inhibitor or ARB combination and subsequently a low dose DHP-CCB/statin combination will improve the management of hypertension/hypercholesterolemia compared to guidelines-base management at family practices.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>STITCH2 (Simplified Therapeutic Intervention to Control Hypertension and Hypercholesterolemia)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Utilization of fixed dose combination therapy has been advocated as an adherence-enhancing strategy and has been so recommended in the 2007 Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP) recommendations. Further, in a previous study (STITCH) it was demonstrated that a simplified treatment algorithm utilizing initial therapy with a low dose fixed-dose combination therapy improved blood pressure control in hypertensive patients. However, the effectiveness of either a simplified treatment algorithm or the initial use of fixed dose combination therapies for 2 risk factors in hypertensive dyslipidemic patients has yet to be determined. Therefore, the current study is designed to determine whether utilization of a fixed dose combination hypertension/hypercholesterolemia therapy results in improved adherence, patient satisfaction as well as improved rates of reaching target LDL cholesterol and blood pressure.</detailed_description>
