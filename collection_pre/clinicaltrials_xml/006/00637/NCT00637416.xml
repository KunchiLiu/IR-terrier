	<criteria>1. Healthy children with a diagnosis of dysphonia age 318 years. 2. Dysphonia must be present for at least one month duration. 3. May have vocal cord nodules present. 4. Preenrollment flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy must not show any potentially lifethreatening cause, including but not limited to laryngeal papillomatosis, congenital glottic webs, vocal cord paralysis, or benign and malignant neoplasms. 5. Must be able to cooperate with recording of voice for analysis(3 seconds of sustained vowel). 6. Caregiver must be able to read, write, and understand English. 7. Patient with history of diagnosed asthma must have their asthma well controlled and treated at the time of enrollment for study. 1. Dysphonia must not be due to a potentially lifethreatening cause, such as laryngeal papillomatosis, congenital glottic webs, vocal cord paralysis, or benign and malignant neoplasms. This will be determined by visualization with flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy. 2. Dysphonia must not be due to an acute upper respiratory infection. 3. Must not have been treated with proton pump inhibitor medication in the past 12 months. 4. Inability of child to cooperate with recording of voice for analysis. 5. Inability of caregiver to read, write, and understand English. 6. Mental retardation, cognitive impairment, or developmental delay. 7. History of allergic reaction of any kind to lansoprazole or any other proton pump inhibitor.</criteria>
