	<brief_summary>The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the long-term (up to 12 months) outcome of the 200 mm long self-expanding nitinol EverFlex (ev3) stent in long femoropopliteal lesions (TASC C &amp; D) Is is the first time that the use of 200 mm long stents will be evaluated in these lesions. It is expected that the outcome of the treatment with this type of long stents will be better as the treatment of identical lesions lengths with multiple shorter stents.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>GENERAL De novo, restenotic or reoccluded lesion located in the femoropopliteal arteries suitable for stenting Patient presenting a score from 2 to 5 following Rutherford classification Patient is willing to comply with specified followup evaluations at the specified times Patient is &gt;18 years old Patient (or their legal representative) understands the nature of the procedure and provides written informed consent, prior to enrolment in the study Prior to enrollment, the guidewire has crossed target lesion Patient is eligible for treatment with the selfexpanding nitinol EverFlex (ev3) stent ANGIOGRAPHIC The target lesion is located within the native femoropopliteal artery until maximally 3 cm proximally of the knee joint. The target lesion has angiographic evidence of stenosis or restenosis &gt; 50% or occlusion which can be passed with standard guidewire manipulation The target lesion, visually estimated, has a minimal length of 15 cm and can be categorized as either a type C or D lesions according the TASC II guidelines Target vessel diameter visually estimated is &gt;4mm and &lt;6.5 mm There is angiographic evidence of at least onevesselrunoff to the foot Presence of another stent in the target vessel that was placed during a previous procedure Presence of an aortic thrombosis or significant common femoral ipsilateral stenosis Previous bypass surgery in the same limb Patients for whom antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulants or thrombolytic drugs are contraindicated Patients who exhibit persistent acute intraluminal thrombus of the proposed lesion site Perforation at the angioplasty site evidenced by extravasation of contrast medium Patients with known hypersensitivity to nickeltitanium Patients with uncorrected bleeding disorders Aneurysm located at the level of the SFA Female patient with child bearing potential not taking adequate contraceptives or currently breastfeeding Life expectancy of less than twelve months Ipsilateral iliac treatment before the target lesion procedure with a residual stenosis &gt; 30% or ipsilateral iliac treatment conducted after the target lesion procedure Use of thrombectomy, artherectomy or laser devices during procedure Any planned surgical intervention/procedure within 30 days of the study procedure Any patient considered to be hemodynamically unstable at onset of procedure Patient is currently participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not completed the entire follow up period.</criteria>
