	<brief_summary>PF-04603629 is being investigated for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Specifically, PF-04603629 is a protein that is a combination of exendin-4 (a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetic currently marketed as Byetta®) fused to human transferrin (a naturally occuring protein) in order to increase the concentration of exendin-4 in the blood. The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of PF-04603629 following multiple escalating subcutaneous doses in adult subjects with T2DM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiple Dose Escalation Trial Of PF-04603629 Given To Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>B0571002 was terminated August 19 2008 due to the decision to discontinue development of PF-04603629 after observing (in both B0571001 and B0571002) a trend for a reversible increase in heart rate within the normal range, which occurred at efficacious doses. Thus, the compound was primarily terminated due to safety concerns, although there was no immediate safety risk to any subject in the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not taking any treatment or are taking metformin (with no change in the treatment, including dose, over the past 2 months). Subjects previously treated with a sulfonylurea in combination with metformin may be eligible if switched over to metformin only for a minimum of 4 weeks before dosing. Male and/or female subjects (females will be women of nonchildbearing potential) between the ages of 18 and 70 years, inclusive. Body Mass Index (BMI) of approximately 22 to 40 kg/m2 Fasting Cpeptide test result must be &gt;0.4 nmol/L. HbA1c ≥7% and ≤11%. If the subject requires to be washed off a sulfonylurea, the HbA1c limits will be ≥7% and ≤9.5%. Screening fasting blood glucose, ≤60 or ≥270 mg/dL. One repeat screening fasting blood glucose will be allowed. Previous treatment with an approved or investigational GLP1 mimetic. Have a known allergy to yeast, yeastderived or yeast containing products.</criteria>
