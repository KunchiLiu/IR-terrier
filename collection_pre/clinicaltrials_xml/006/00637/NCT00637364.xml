	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, non-randomized, single-center, therapeutic trial in patients with AJCC Stage III or IV pancreatic cancer with tumor related abdominal and/or back pain to evaluate the safety of high intensity focused ultrasound therapy using the FEP-BY02 HIFU system for palliation of pancreatic cancer-related pain. Patients meeting all eligibility criteria without any exclusion criteria will be offered an opportunity to participate in the study. After obtaining informed consent a baseline history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and any additional imaging studies needed will be performed. The major theoretic risk to the patient with this procedure is the development of acute pancreatitis. If acute pancreatitis were to develop, it should become clinically evident by day 3 following HIFU ablation. Therefore, the initial phase of this pilot study is designed to allow a sufficient interval between HIFU treatments to identify whether this theoretic risk will manifest clinically. Previous clinical experience in China suggests that HIFU of pancreatic tumors is safe without risk of developing severe acute pancreatitis. Patients treated with HIFU will have approximately 15-20% of the tumor volume treated per session. The first 5 patients (feasibility study) will receive their first HIFU treatment followed by a 3-5 day interval for observation. Following the feasibility study the results will be reviewed with the FDA. If no serious adverse events are encountered, and the FDA agrees with continuing the study, then the next 5 patients will be treated with an interval of 2-3 days between each treatment. If no serious adverse events are encountered in this group, then the next group of 5 patients will be treated at intervals of 1-2 days between each treatment.</brief_summary>
