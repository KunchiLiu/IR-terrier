	<brief_title>Oxycodone and Pregabalin for the Treatment of Oncological Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuropathic pain is frequently diagnosed as a complication of cancer pain. While opioids are the mainstay of cancer pain management,their efficacy in neuropathic pain seems to be less then optimal,and adjuvant drugs, mainly anticonvulsants and antidepressants,are often combined with opioids in the analgesic regimen of patients with neuropathic cancer pain. This approach is suggested by well-established guidelines, but the analgesic benefit and the safety of pregabalin and oxycodone in combination is not yet documented. The aim of this study is to assess the activity and tolerability of the addition of pregabalin to oxycodone in the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain due to neoplasm.</detailed_description>
