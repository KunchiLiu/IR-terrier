	<brief_summary>Aim: To investigate the effect of high intra- and postoperative oxygen concentration (80%, as opposed to normally 30%) on pulmonary gas exchange and other pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery. Background: Previous studies have shown possible beneficial effects of high perioperative oxygen concentration on surgical wound infection and healing, but all pulmonary effects are not clarified. Change in perioperative PaO2/FiO2 and shunt-fraction, measured by a gas rebreathing technique, can describe pulmonary oxygenation. This could add knowledge to the pulmonary effects of high vs. normal oxygen concentration. Primary hypothesis of study: Perioperative use of a 80% oxygen concentration reduces the PaO2/FiO2-index compared to 30% oxygen.</brief_summary>
