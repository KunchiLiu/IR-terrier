	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes is one of the fastest growing public health problems in both developed and developing countries. It is estimated that the number of people with diabetes in the world will double in coming years, from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030.The role of physiotherapy in diabetic care is to reduce immobilisation effects, to maintain functional capacity and to minimise diabetes-related complications. The physiotherapist also has a role in providing advice about exercise and daily living activities. The fundamental principle of rehabilitation is to improve quality of life while diminishing the health care burden. By reducing the heightened risk of falling, the fall related injuries and the fear of falling one could improve quality of life in diabetic patients and reduce health care costs. The goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of gait and balance training in pre frail subgroup diabetes patients. Our program is based on recommendations of Robertson et al.(2002) and Page et al.(2002) The investigators randomly assign patients in a control group (no treatment) or in a treatment group. The treatment program consists of two group sessions per week over 12 weeks. Patients were encouraged to perform specific home exercises. After this 12-week program, patients were asked to continue their exercises. The effect of the treatment will be evaluated after the treatment program and after a 6-month follow up.</brief_summary>
