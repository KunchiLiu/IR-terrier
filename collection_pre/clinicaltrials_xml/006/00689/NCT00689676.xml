	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to describe the performance of very low birth-weight preterm toddlers regarding expressive language and cognitive development during sensorimotor and beginning of pre-operational periods, as well as to compare the performance presented by these children to that presented by their full-term peers, according to Genetic Epistemology theoretical principles. The hypothesis of this study is that very-low birth weight preterms would present a poorer performance, concerning expressive language and cognition development,than their full-term peers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Very low birth weight preterm infants are known to have risks of cognitive and behavioral problems, including learning difficulties, attention deficits and hyperactivity, as well as neuromotor deficits. Moreover, they are reported to have a high risk of speech and language impairments up to school age, even in cases where major neurological abnormalities are excluded. Impairments have been reported both in receptive and expressive language and, more specifically, in morphosyntax and naming.</detailed_description>
