	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether low-molecular-weight heparin could be equally or more effective than oral anticoagulation in the long-term treatment of deep venous thrombosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-Term Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin Versus Oral Anticoagulants in Deep Venous Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The open-label prospective randomized clinical trial compares subcutaneous LMWH (tinzaparin)administered for 6 months versus initial treatment using subcutaneous LMWH followed by oral anticoagulants given for a similar period of time in patients with proximal venous thrombosis.</detailed_description>
