	<brief_title>A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of an Investigational Product Called CT Gel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CT Gel is a fixed-combination product that addresses the multifactorial factors of acne vulgaris pathogenesis. Based on numerous nonclinical pharmacology studies of each active ingredient, it is expected that this new product will have three biological actions: 1) comedolytic, 2) antimicrobial, and 3) anti-inflammatory.</detailed_description>
