	<brief_summary>This study will help to determine whether an injection log on a recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) delivery device improves subjects' adherence with injection schedules. Adherence will be compared between a group of subjects who are aware of the injection log on the easypod™ rhGH delivery device and a group of subjects who are not aware of the easypod™ injection log. It is the study hypothesis that subject non-adherence rate is different for those who are aware of the injection log capability versus those who are unaware of the injection log capability. Subject perception will also be evaluated by comparing the ease and convenience of use and subject preference for the easypod™ compared to two other rhGH pen injection devices.</brief_summary>
