	<brief_summary>Curcumin as well as the ashwagandha extract are ingredients from traditional indian medicine and have been shown to be potent anti-cancer compounds in laboratory as well as animal studies. This study will test the safety and efficacy of a curcumin formulation and the ashwagandha extract in high grade relapsed or metastatic osteosarcoma where no other second line chemotherapy is being given. The pharmacokinetics will be studied along with response as measured on CT scans and PET scans as well as the quality of life and any toxicity.</brief_summary>
