	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy of FOLOFOXIRI plus Cetuximab combination in young patients with good performance status with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan/Oxaliplatin/5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin/Cetuximab As First Line Treatment In Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination of FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab is reasonable safe regimen especially for patients with good performance status. The estimated benefit from the combination is greater than the possible risk, especially for the patients who will become resectable after treatment. It will be extremely interesting to evaluate the resectability rate of this specific group of patient with good performance status and unresectable disease when they are treated with all active chemotherapeutic agents and cetuximab</detailed_description>
