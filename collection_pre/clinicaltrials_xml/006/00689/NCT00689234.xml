	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of unilateral or bilateral diaphragm plication in a prospective randomised controlled way on symptoms, pulmonary function including gas exchange, respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity and breathing during sleep in patients with proven uni- or bilateral phrenic nerve paralysis present for at least 1 year without any evidence of spontaneous recovery.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Uni or bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis due to phrenic nerve paralysis present for at least 1 year With reduced VC, at least in supine position and no significant change in VC for at least 6 months At the time of randomisation symptomatic patient, defined by one of the following symptoms: not able to sleep in supine position or exertional dyspnoea No informed consent obtained Other disease that may interfere with the evaluation of pulmonary function or the exercise capacity: COPD, parenchymal lung disease on the thoracic Xray, documented ischemic heart disease or left heart failure, active rheumatological disease, severe orthopaedic problems,.... Abnormal neuromuscular clinical investigation (apart from diaphragmatic dysfunction) and/or abnormal electromyography of the limbs compatible with generalized neuromuscular disease Known diseases resulting in abnormal blood coagulation Proven oncological origine of the phrenic nerve paralysis Age below 18 yrs old</criteria>
