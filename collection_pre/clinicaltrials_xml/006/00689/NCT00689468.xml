	<brief_title>Echinacea Purpurea and Osteopathy in Children With Recurrent Otitis Media</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of complementary and alternative therapies by parents of young children remains common despite the lack of clinical trials demonstrating either the efficacy or safety of these treatments. Two of the more common complementary therapies used in young children with a history of recurrent otitis media are preparations of the herb Echinacea purpurea and cranial osteopathic manipulative treatment. This study represents one of the first double-blinded, placebo controlled trials of each approach in a population of young children who presented with three or more recent episodes of acute otitis media.</detailed_description>
