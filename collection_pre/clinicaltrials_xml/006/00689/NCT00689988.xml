	<brief_title>Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) and Lexical Gain in Children With Down Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Five children with DS, with the same cognitive level, participated in this study. Longitudinal follow-up of twelve months of speech-language therapy with AAC use was undertaken. A lexical evaluation was done at the beginning and the end of this follow-up. Correct responses in the lexical evaluation were increased, but not necessarily in the spoken modality. The comparisons showed significant results in use of substitutions processes, and to no-answers.</detailed_description>
