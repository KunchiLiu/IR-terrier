	<brief_title>The Effect of Pharmacist Intervention on the Use of Zostavax in a Community Pharmacy Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies exist documenting the perception and satisfaction of patients receiving immunizations from pharmacists, as well as the effects of pharmacist involvement in advocating and administering vaccinations. The most well documented studies have been conducted in hospital settings. Undoubtedly, there is enormous opportunity for the community pharmacist to identify potential vaccine recipients, advocate immunization and administer said immunizations to their established patient populations. However, there is a lack of concentrated study in the implementation of immunization services in the community setting and their effects. The investigators intend to evaluate the intervention of pharmacists in an immunization program and the resulting changes in immunization rates.</detailed_description>
