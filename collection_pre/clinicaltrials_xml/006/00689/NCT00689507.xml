	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Safety Study of LY2127399 in Combination With Bortezomib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study of a drug known as LY2127399, which will be given with a common treatment for multiple myeloma called bortezomib (Velcade). The primary purpose of this study is to (1)Determine the safety of LY2127399 in combination with bortezomib and any side effects that might be associated with it; (2)Assess whether LY2127399 in combination with bortezomib may help patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma; (3)How much LY2127399 should be given to patients along with bortezomib.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma treated with at least 1 prior regimen. Prior therapy with bortezomib is allowed if there has been no relapse or progression within 3 months of the last dose of bortezomib, and bortezomib is considered by the treating physician to be a reasonable therapy for the patient. Have measurable disease defined by one or more of the following: Monoclonal protein in the serum of ≥1 g/dL (10 g/L). Monoclonal light chain in the urine protein electrophoresis of ≥ 200 mg/24 hours. Involved Serum Free Light Chain (SFLC) level &gt; 10 mg/dL (100 mg/L) provided SFLC ratio is abnormal. Measurable plasmacytoma. Are ≥ 18 years of age. Have given written informed consent prior to any studyspecific procedures Have adequate organ function including: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/microliter Platelet (PLT) count ≥ 50,000/microliter Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 8.0 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (if total is elevated check direct and, if normal, patient is eligible) Aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤ 3 x ULN Creatinine ≤ 3.0 mg/dl. Have a performance status of ≤ 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale (refer to Attachment JDCF.5). Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy at least 2 weeks (6 weeks for mitomycinC or nitrosoureas) prior to study enrollment and recovered from the acute effects of therapy. Are reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study and are willing to follow study procedures. Males and females with reproductive potential must agree to use medically approved contraceptive precautions during the trial and for 4 months following the last dose of study drug. Females with child bearing potential must have had a negative urine or serum pregnancy test ≤ 3 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Have an estimated life expectancy of ≥ 16 weeks. Treatment with prior autologous transplant is permitted. If a transplant is used as consolidation following chemotherapy, without intervening disease progression, it will be considered one line of treatment with the preceding chemotherapy. Have received treatment within 30 days of the initial dose of study drug with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication. Have one or more serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study. Have uncontrolled infection. Females who are pregnant or lactating. Have known positive test results in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg), or hepatitis C antibodies (HCAb). Have peripheral neuropathy of &gt; Grade 2, or of any grade with pain, as measured by CTCAE v3.0. Previously treated with LY2127399, or have had significant allergy to humanized monoclonal antibodies that, in the opinion of the investigator, poses an increased risk to the patient. Prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Prior therapy with experimental agents targeting BAFF. Have QTc interval &gt; 450 msec on baseline 12lead ECG.</criteria>
