	<criteria>Aged from 18 to 65 years. Patient with pathologically proven, high grade Bcell Lymphoma CD 20 positive (WHO classification) : Diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Adverse prognostic factors IPI&gt;1 In Complete Remission, or partial response to first line treatment. Previously treated with chemotherapy regimen containing rituximab: R CHOP or R ACVBP Chemosensitive disease PET Scan prior transplant Eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation With a minimum life expectancy of 3 months. Negative HIV, HBV and HCV serologies (in the last 4 weeks except after vaccination). Having previously signed a written informed consent. Histological transformation in diffuse large B cell lymphoma, any type of low grade lymphoma More than one line of treatment. Prior transplantation. Prior exposure to Zevalin Central nervous system or meningeal involvement by lymphoma. Contraindication to any drug contained in the chemotherapy regimen. Any serious active disease or comorbid medical condition (according to the investigator's decision and information provided in the IDB). Poor renal function (creatinin level up to 2.5 maximum normal level) unless these abnormalities are related to the lymphoma. Poor hepatic function (total bilirubin level up to 30 micro mol/l, transaminases up to 2.5 maximum normal level) unless these abnormalities are related to the lymphoma. Poor bone marrow reserve as defined by neutrophils less than 1.5 G/l or platelets less than 100 G/l Large bone marrow irradiation more than 40percent. Bone marrow infiltration Lack of sufficient autologous hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation. Prior treatment with murine antibodies Known hypersensibility to murine antibodies or proteins Any history of cancer during the last 5 years, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin tumors or stage 0 (in situ) cervical carcinoma. Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days before planned first cycle of chemotherapy and during the study. Adult patient unable to give informed consent because of intellectual impairment. Pregnant or lactating women.</criteria>
