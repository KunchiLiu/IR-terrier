	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the subjective response of iron substitution (Tardyferon®) on fatigue in women blood donors with a mean serum ferritin &lt; 30ng/ml and to assess variation of ferritin and hemoglobin after a blood donation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of Iron Treatment Efficiency Among Non-anemic But Iron-deficient Female Blood Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Actually, there's no recommendation to check ferritin level in blood donors, even if several studies pointed out the high prevalence of iron deficiency after a blood donation. Furthermore, some clinical trials showed that non-anaemic women with unexplained fatigue may benefit from iron supplementation. - The purpose of this study is to determine the subjective response of iron substitution (Tardyferon®) on fatigue in women blood donors with a mean serum ferritin &lt; 30ng/ml and to assess variation of ferritin and hemoglobin after a blood donation. - We will measure blood count, ferritin level and C-reactive protein at the time of the blood donation and then after a week, a month and 3 months. A week after the blood donation, donors with a ferritin level &lt;30 ng/ml and hemoglobin &gt; 120g/l (non anaemic) will be included in the study and randomised. A one-month iron treatment vs placebo will be introduced. To assess the subjective response on fatigue, the donors will fill in different questionnaires at the time of the blood donation and then after a week, a month and 3 months.</detailed_description>
