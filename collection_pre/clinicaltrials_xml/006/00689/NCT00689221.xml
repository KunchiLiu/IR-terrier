	<brief_summary>CENTRIC is a Phase 3 clinical trial assessing efficacy and safety of the investigational integrin inhibitor, cilengitide, in combination with standard treatment versus standard treatment alone in newly diagnosed glioblastoma subjects with a methylated O6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter in the tumor tissue. The MGMT gene promoter is a section of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that acts as a controlling element in the expression of MGMT. Methylation of the MGMT gene promoter has been found to be a predictive marker for benefit from temozolomide (TMZ) treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Tumor tissue specimens from the glioblastoma surgery or open biopsy (formalinfixed, paraffinembedded block; stereotactic biopsy not allowed) must be available for MGMT status analysis and central pathology review 2. Newly diagnosed histologically proven supratentorial glioblastoma (World Health Organization [WHO] Grade IV) 3. Proven methylated MGMT gene promoter methylation status 4. Available postoperative gadoliniumenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (GdMRI) performed within less than (&lt;) 48 hours after surgery (in case it was not possible to obtain a GdMRI within &lt;48 hours post surgery, a GdMRI is to be performed prior to randomization) 5. Stable or decreasing dose of steroids for greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 5 days prior to randomization 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score (ECOG PS) of 01 7. Meets 1 of the following recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) classifications: Class III (Age &lt; 50 years and ECOG PS 0). Class IV (meeting one of the following criteria: a) Age &lt; 50 years and ECOG PS 1 or b) Age &gt;= 50 years, underwent prior partial or total tumor resection, mini mental state examination [MMSE] &gt;= 27). Class V (meeting one of the following criteria: a) Age &gt;= 50 years and underwent prior partial or total tumor resection, MMSE &lt; 27 or b) Age &gt;= 50 years and underwent prior tumor biopsy only) 8. Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply 1. Prior chemotherapy within the last 5 years 2. Prior RTX of the head 3. Receiving concurrent investigational agents or has received an investigational agent within the past 30 days prior to the first dose of cilengitide 4. Prior systemic antiangiogenic therapy 5. Placement of GliadelÂ® wafer at surgery 6. Inability to undergo GdMRI. 7. Planned surgery for other diseases 8. History of recent peptic ulcer disease (endoscopically proven gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, or esophageal ulcer) within 6 months of enrollment 9. History of malignancy. Subjects with curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or subjects who have been free of other malignancies for &gt;= 5 years are eligible for this study 10. History of coagulation disorder associated with bleeding or recurrent thrombotic events 11. Clinically manifest myocardial insufficiency (New York Heart Association [NYHA] III, IV) or history of myocardial infarction during the past 6 months; uncontrolled arterial hypertension 12. Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply</criteria>
