	<mesh_term>Head and Neck Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Patients with malignant tumors seen at the Stanford University Cancer Center. Eligible patients will have a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and will have been seen in the Stanford Head and Neck Oncology Program. A decision to undergo surgery at Stanford will have been made, prior to recruiting patients for the study, and prior to obtaining the samples during surgery. (Histological confirmation of the diagnosis need not be made prior to obtaining consent.) 2. A definitive resection of a malignant tumor is planned. 3. Surgeon judgment that the definitive procedure will not be compromised by including FNA Core needle biopsy Cup forceps or punch biopsy of&lt;4mm. 4. Informed consent documented prior to procedure</criteria>
