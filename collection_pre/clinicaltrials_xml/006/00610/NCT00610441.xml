	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of MK-8777 (Org 26576, SCH 900777) in adult subjects with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). MK-8777 or placebo will be administered in a crossover fashion for two 3-week treatment periods. The two 3-week treatment periods will be separated by a 2-week placebo washout period. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of various doses of MK-8777 to that of placebo in the treatment of ADHD symptoms in adults.</brief_summary>
