	<criteria>Male and non pregnant female aged 18 to 75 years Patients hospitalized in ICU, under mechanically assisted ventilation expected to be mandatory for 3 days or more Reasonable survival chance within next few days with an Apache score 1025 Tracheal aspirate found positive for P. aeruginosa The subject (or a close family member in case of incompetence) understands the procedure, agrees to participate, and is willing to give written informed consent Informed consent must be obtained for all subjects before enrollment in the study, by patient or by a close family member Poor prognosis as judged by Apache score II score &gt;25 Pregnant female Grossly underor overweight (BMI&lt;18or &gt;29) Ongoing therapy with a macrolide Known allergy to any macrolide Proven P. aeruginosa pneumonia Ongoing antipseudomonal therapy with a proven susceptible colonizing strain Anticipated short duration of mechanical ventilation (&lt;3 days) Known drug interaction that could either decrease efficacy or raise safety concerns Severe hepatic failure (type C, score &gt;10 on Child Pugh scale) Sick sinus syndrome or long QT syndrome Recent donation of blood or participation in another clinical trial within 3 months Any situation exposing the patient to higher risk or possibly confounding results</criteria>
