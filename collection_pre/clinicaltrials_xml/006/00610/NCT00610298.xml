	<brief_title>Effects of Whole Body Vibration in Elderly Patients Requiring Rehabilitation: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We know that whole body vibration can cause remarkable increase in power in athletes, however, to what extent elderly and disabled individuals could benefit from it is currently unknown. Our primary goal is to investigate if treatment with whole body vibration in elderly persons and patients with various neuromuscular and musculoskeletal deficits would result in more rapid return of their function and presumably at a higher level than comparable group of patients undergoing standard physical therapy.</detailed_description>
