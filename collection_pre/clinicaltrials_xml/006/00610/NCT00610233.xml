	<brief_summary>The precise mechanisms underlying cerebral regulation of lower urinary tract (LUT) function are still poorly understood. Patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) offer the unique opportunity to investigate the role of different cerebral centers on LUT function. We hypothesize that DBS has a significant effect on LUT function and that these effects depend on the specific stimulated cerebral center.</brief_summary>
