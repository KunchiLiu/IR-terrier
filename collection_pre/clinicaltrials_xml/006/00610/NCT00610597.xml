	<brief_summary>Alcoholic liver disease is characterized by circulating T cell activation and liver T cell infiltration but their phenotype is poorly studied. The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that the (CD4+ T cell secreting Interleukin-17) Th17 pathway is involved in alcoholic liver disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consecutive patients undergoing transjugular liver biopsies for alcoholic liver disease or hepatitis C virus infection will be included in the study to measure plasma cytokines levels, peripheral blood mononuclear cells cytokine release and liver T cell infiltrates.</detailed_description>
