	<brief_title>International PRospective Multicenter Study On RadiaTion Dose Estimates Of Coronary CT AngIOgraphy IN Daily Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective analysis of cardiac CT angiographies enrolled over 1 month Collection of 1 axial data set and the "patient dose protocol" (including kV, mAs, CTDI, DLP, etc.) on a CD Dose estimation in dose/cm with the use of a method proposed by the European Working Group for Guidelines on Quality Criteria in CT. Assessment of diagnostic, qualitative image quality on a per-vessel basis by the participating study sites and in randomly selected cases by the primary study investigators (approximately 5-10% of patients to "spot check" interobserver variability of image quality assessments) Assessment of image quality with the use of quantitative parameters including image noise, signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios</detailed_description>
