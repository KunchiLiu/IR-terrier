	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as digital colposcopy, may help doctors find and diagnose cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying digital colposcopy to see how well it works in finding cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in patients with an abnormal Pap smear.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Digital Colposcopy in Finding Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia in Patients With An Abnormal Pap Smear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To identify potential improvements for a noninvasive method of diagnosing cervical dysplasia and neoplasia using the Multispectral Digital Colposcope (MDC), a device that uses fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy to compare images with histopathologic mapping of the cervical epithelium. - To measure MDC images in vivo of the cervix using a modified device that makes measurements in seconds rather than over 2 minutes before and after acetic acid. - To evaluate, preliminarily, the effect of the fading of acetic acid in the image contrast obtained over time to see if this fading can predict the grade of intraepithelial neoplasia. - To evaluate mapping of the cervix so that software can reconstruct the cervical epithelial map to compare the map with routine colposcopic images as well as with those from the MDC. - To compare, preliminarily, MDC performance with colposcopy and pathologic analysis of tissue removed after colposcopy in the form of the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo routine colposcopy as part of their regular colposcopic evaluation. The digital colposcope is used to take images of the vagina and cervix, pre- and post-acetic acid, using white, green, and blue light. Colposcopically abnormal areas are biopsied; a normal area may also be biopsied. Patients undergoing loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) may undergo one additional biopsy of a colposcopically normal site.</detailed_description>
