	<brief_summary>We propose a feasibility study of aggressive CV risk factor management directed by preventive cardiology compared to usual care. We will determine: 1) the efficacy of a preventive cardiology program compared to usual care in slowing the progression of carotid IMT and plaque, and 2) the effect of a preventive cardiology program versus usual care at achieving CV risk factor target goals. We hypothesize Lupus patients randomized to the preventive cardiology program will have less cardiovascular progression over two years than those lupus patients who are given standard care for cardiovascular risk, defined by carotid intima-media thickness and plaque.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will recruit 30 eligible patients from the Lupus Center of Excellence outpatient clinic. Patients will either be randomized into a preventive cardiology program for aggressive treatment, or randomized to usual care (1:1 ratio) in a single-blinded, randomized trial of 24 months duration. In this feasibility trial we hope to identify and refine any limitations in anticipation of designing a larger, randomized intervention study. For both arms of the study, at baseline, 6 month, 12 month, 18 month, and 24 month visits (5 visits in total) all patients will be seen by Dr. Elliott, Principal Investigator. Visits will include an interview, fasting laboratory tests completion of questionnaires regarding demographics, socioeconomic status, health status, and risk factors (traditional, inflammatory, and lupus-specific). Dr. Elliott will perform the physical examinations on all patients and complete the lupus-specific disease activity and damage questionnaires. At the Baseline visit, 12-month visit, and 24 24-month visits, all patients will have a carotid ultrasound. Cohort 1: Preventive Cardiology Program arm: Above and beyond the standard care, which is listed below, the patients in this arm will be aggressively treated by the cardiologist. As deemed prudent, the following may be prescribed: antihypertensives, lipid reducing agents, anti-platelets, further cardiac testing, and behavioral modifications. No standard care treatment will be withheld. Cohort 2: Standard Care arm: The PI will send a letter of all testing results to their designated PCP. No standard care treatment will be withheld.</detailed_description>
