	<brief_summary>The research proposed here will determine the effect of a novel treadmill gait training strategy using a robotic gait trainer (the Lokomat) on functional ambulation in people with SCI. The effect of the new therapy will be evaluated by analyzing changes in functional ambulation and gait patterns during walking.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Walking in People With Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury: a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community-dwelling individuals with motor-incomplete spinal cord injury will be recruited. In total, 20 participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of 2 types of body-weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) with the Lokomat, which differ only in the level of assistance that the Lokomat provides to the leg movements while walking. Therapy for both groups will take place 3 times/week for 12 weeks. During each session, participants will first complete a 10-minute warm-up period followed by 45 minutes of the assigned therapy. Rest breaks will be provided as needed, but participants should complete 45 minutes of walking per session.</detailed_description>
