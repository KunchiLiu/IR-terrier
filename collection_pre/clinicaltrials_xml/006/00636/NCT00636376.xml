	<brief_summary>Head injury is the most common cause of mortality and acquired disability in childhood. It is common to elevate the head of patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure, although it is not clear if it is always beneficial. Every severe pediatric traumatic brain injured patient will have an optimal head position that prevents rising pressure in the brain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Head Elevation on Intracranial Pressure in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head injury is the most common cause of mortality and acquired disability on childhood. Management of children at risk for intracranial hypertension is both complex and increasingly controversial. Also, effect of head position on intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, adn cerebral venous outflow in the pediatric population has not been studied. We will examine the effect of head positioning on ICP, CPP, and cerebral venous outflow in pediatric patients at risk for intracranial hypertension. The hypothesis is that ICP will be reduced with improvement in cerebral venous outflow by each patient having their own optimal head position.</detailed_description>
