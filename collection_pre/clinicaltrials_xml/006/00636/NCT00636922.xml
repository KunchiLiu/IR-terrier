	<brief_summary>The main goal of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of RAD001 in combination with low-dose cytarabine in acute myeloid leukemia patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy. The secondary goals are to investigate the likely causes of drug response or failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus (RAD001) in Elderly Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicentre 2-stage Phase Ib/II trial of 5-Azacitidine combined with Everolimus for AML patients over the age of 60 or relapsed AML over the age of 18. The MTD and DLT of 5-Azacitidine (7 doses over 9 days) given monthly combined with Everolimus orally for 17 days (day 5-21) each month (1 cycle) for a minimum of 6 cycles and for at least 2 cycles beyond achievement of CR and for a maximum of 12 cycles. Everolimus maintenance therapy alone may be continued at investigator's discretion until either progressive disease or dose limiting toxicity. Groups of 3 patients will be entered at each dose level. Dose escalation/stopping rules to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) are as follows: Number in cohort experiencing DLT by day 42 Action 2/3 or 3/3 No further dose escalation. Previous level is defined as MTD 0/3 Dose escalate to next level 1/3 Expand cohort to 6 patients 1/6 or 2/6 Dose escalate to next level &gt;2/6 No further dose escalation. Previous level is defined as MTD Note that if dose escalation is still indicated at the highest dose level, then the MTD is at or above the last dose level. If the trial stops at the first dose, then the MTD is below the first dose level. In either of the above cases, the MTD is not determined from the trial. Once the maximum dose level has been identified, a dose expansion phase will continue recruiting patients at the MTD until a total of 40 patients for the entire study is accrued.</detailed_description>
