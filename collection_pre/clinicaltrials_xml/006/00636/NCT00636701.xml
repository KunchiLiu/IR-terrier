	<detailed_description>This case series assesses the effects of five consecutive days of low‐frequency (1 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with and without a 6‐Hz primer. Although this paper studies able‐bodied individuals, similar rTMS protocols are used to facilitate motor recovery in patients with hemiplegia following stroke. However, the cortical mechanisms associated with repeated daily doses of rTMS are not completely understood.</detailed_description>
