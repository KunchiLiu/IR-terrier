	<brief_summary>This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of vismodegib (GDC-0449) added to biochemotherapy standard-of-care regimens for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), with treatment until disease progression. Patients received either FOLFOX (FOL=leucovorin calcium [folinic acid], F=fluorouracil, OX=oxaliplatin) or FOLFIRI (FOL=leucovorin calcium [folinic acid] F=fluorouracil, IRI=irinotecan hydrochloride) chemotherapy with bevacizumab. The decision of which regimen (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) to use was made by the treating physician and patient. Patients were randomized to receive vismodegib or placebo and were stratified based on the chemotherapy regimen chosen and whether or not Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) measurable disease was present at baseline.</brief_summary>
