	<criteria>Male and female subjects, 40 to 80 years of age, with a documented diagnosis of mild, moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria and &gt;20pack year history of smoking, a postbronchodilator 40% ≤ FEV1 ≤ 80% of predicted normal and postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 70% who have signed an informed consent form (ICF) prior to the initiation of any studyrelated procedure (Post bronchodilator refers to 30 minutes after the inhalation of 400 µg of salbutamol) Subjects who demonstrate a plethysmographic functional residual capacity &gt;120% predicted normal No COPD exacerbations within 6 weeks prior to dosing, no concomitant lung disease such as asthma, no requirement for long term oxygen treatment or history of lung reduction surgery. No medical conditions that would interfere with the performance of spirometry or clinical exercise testing. Any other medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator may cause the patient to be unsuitable for completion of the study or place the patient at potential risk from participating in the study e.g. uncontrolled hypertension or unstable ischemic heart disease Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
