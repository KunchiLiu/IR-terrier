	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of BSYX-A110 in a small number of healthy adult volunteers. Following the demonstration of safety in adults, this anti-Staphylococcal monoclonal antibody will then be evaluated in the target population of hospitalized low birth weight neonates.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study in Adults for the Prevention of S. Epidermidis Infection in Low Birth Weight Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the safety of three doses of BSYX-A110 in adults before initiating studies in the target population of low birth weight infants. This will be an open label, dose-ranging study of BSYX-A110 in 12 adults. The dose levels to be evaluated are 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg. Each dose level will enroll 4 adult volunteers who will receive one dose of BSYX-A110 intravenously. The primary endpoint of this study is safety and tolerability. The secondary endpoints include the pharmacokinetics of the rise in anti-LTA antibody and opsonic activity against S. epidermidis.</detailed_description>
