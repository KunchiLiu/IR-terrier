	<brief_summary>We are looking at the effects of Stress Management and Relaxation Response training on stress hormones (like adrenalin and cortisol), immune function and physiology (heart rate, breathing rate, muscle tension).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biochemical and Physiological Changes Associated With Differing Durations of Relaxation Response Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is to determine whether differing durations of relaxation response (RR) training will be associated with different degrees of change in physiological, psychological, hormonal, molecular and immunological markers. Prior studies have reported reduction on many of these parameters after 8 weeks of RR training. However, we now seek to understand the degree to which incremental decreases in these parameters are exhibited at 0, 4, and 8 weeks of RR practice in 30 healthy adults. Furthermore, we will explore correlations between levels of exhaled nitric oxide or plasma nitrites/nitrates and oxygen consumption during RR elicitation. We will also examine any associations between changes in oxygen consumption and psychological factors, physiological parameters, and biochemical outcomes. Lastly, we will bank plasma and peripheral blood cells from these samples for future assessments of immune markers, cell typing and gene expression.</detailed_description>
