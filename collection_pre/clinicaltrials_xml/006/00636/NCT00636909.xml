	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to provide allogeneic stem cell transplantation to patients who have not traditionally undergone this procedure because of it high incidence of treatment related side effects. We hope to decrease these side effects by decreasing the chemotherapy dose prior to transplant (non-myeloablative, smaller dose of chemotherapy given so bone marrow is not completely eliminated) and by using donated stem cells to treat cancer of the blood.</brief_summary>
