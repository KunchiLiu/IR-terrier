	<detailed_description>Treatment of FM is difficult. Conventional treatments do not appear to be managing the problem effectively and this has led to other forms of treatment. The aim of treating FM is to decrease pain and increase function by means of a multimodal therapeutic strategy, which, in most cases, includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. In the literature on non-pharmacological treatment approaches for FM, different managements are described, such as exercise, electrotherapy, patient education, self-management programmes, massage techniques, cryotherapy, and acupuncture. There are a number of reasons why patients choose these complementary and alternative medicine approaches, including dissatisfaction with conventional treatments or concerns over the toxicity of drugs. However, there is no consensus about which treatment approach is the best.The current randomised controlled trial was undertaken as a first pilot study to assess and compare the effectiveness of Pilates exercises, an active-group therapy, and connective tissue massage, a passive-personalised therapy, in the management of FM in females.</detailed_description>
