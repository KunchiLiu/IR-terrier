	<brief_summary>The Polyflux HD-C4 (Gambro Renal Products) is a new dialyzer based on the existing Polyflux H membrane and dialyzer technology, but which achieves a performance comparable to Polyflux 210H in a significantly smaller device. The objectives of this study are: 1. To compare and contrast small and large molecule removal by the Polyflux HD-C4 and Polyflux 210H dialyzers under conditions of routine hemodialysis; and, 2. To compare and contrast the ease of use of the Polyflux HD-C4 dialyzer with that of the Polyflux 210H under conditions of routine clinical use for hemodialysis.</brief_summary>
