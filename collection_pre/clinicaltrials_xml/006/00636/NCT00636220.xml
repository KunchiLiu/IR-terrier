	<brief_title>Evaluation of the DPP HIV 1/2 Test and the HIV 1/2 Stat Pak Test Using Oral Fluid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using fresh oral fluid specimens, from known HIV-positive individuals, to test for HIV-1 antibodies using both the DPP HIV 1/2 and HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK tests. Two oral fluid collection devices will be used and compared (MPC and Chembio collection devices) and the results obtained from oral fluids will be compared with those obtained from whole blood and plasma using paired samples from the same participants. The comparison between oral fluid, whole blood and plasma will be made in both Chembio devices (HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK and DPP HIV 1/2).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants with known HIV infection who are willing to participate in the study and who sign an informed consent (or assent), will be included in the study. Patients on HAART treatment for HIV will be included, but this information as well as the dates (duration) of treatment will be obtained through the interview of study participants; a medical record review is not necessary or required. The study participant's responses will be recorded by study staff on a Data Collection Form. Patients with immunosuppressive conditions other than HIV will be included if available, but will be limited to &lt; 25% of the total test population. Immunosuppression will also be assessed through interview of study participants and/or through verbal confirmation by the treating physician; a medical record/chart review is not required. Patients must be willing to undergo venipuncture to donate one tube of EDTA whole blood (not more than 10cc), and to provide three oral fluid samples. Patients who do not consent, withdraw consent, or for whom the investigator determines that venipuncture or gum swabbing may create a health risk will be excluded from the study. Participants who have been enrolled in HIV vaccine studies will be excluded from the study. This will be ascertained through interview of study participants. Participants who have been enrolled once in this study will be excluded from repeat enrollment. Participants must not have introduced any substance into their oral cavity (gum, food, beverage, candy, lozenges, mouthwash, etc.) for 30 minutes prior to providing an oral fluid sample. This will be ascertained through interview of study participants.</criteria>
