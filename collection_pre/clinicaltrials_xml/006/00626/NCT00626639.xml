	<brief_title>A Study of Palifermin for the Reduction of Oral Mucositis in Patients With Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Receiving Postoperative Radiotherapy and Concurrent Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consisted of 2 phases. The acute oral mucositis (OM) evaluation phase includes the time from randomization to the time of severe OM (WHO Grade 3 or 4) resolution (up to Week 12 or up to Week 15 for participants whose severe OM is not resolved at Week 12). In the acute OM evaluation phase, participants were randomized to receive either a single IV bolus dose of palifermin or placebo at 120 Î¼g/kg, 3 days before the start of radiotherapy, plus 7 once-weekly palifermin or placebo doses at the same dose level during a 7-week radio/chemotherapy course. In the long-term follow up phase, participants are followed until death, withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow-up. The long-term follow up phase is still ongoing.</detailed_description>
