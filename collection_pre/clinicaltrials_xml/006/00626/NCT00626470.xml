	<brief_summary>Fractures just below the hip often are treated with a so called Gliding Screw and Plate (DHS). Recently a new additional plate called a Trochanter Support Plate (TSP) which attaches to the DHS has become available which is claimed to give extra support to the fracture. In a prospective randomised study we wish to test the hypothesis that the TSP does not give any additional stability to the fracture treated with the DHS.</brief_summary>
