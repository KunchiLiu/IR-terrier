	<brief_summary>A minimum of 100 patients will be enrolled in the study to demonstrate which diagnostic treatment (oxygen or nitric oxide) is most capable of identifying patients with a reactive pulmonary vascular bed. Each patient will be given all three treatment regimen, nitric oxide, oxygen, and the comparison treatment (nitric oxide plus oxygen), with a wash out period of 10 minutes between each dose. Patients will be randomized at the time of enrollment to determine which comparison treatment they will receive.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Inhaled Nitric Oxide and Oxygen in Patient Reactivity During Acute Pulmonary Vasodilator Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open, randomized, prospective, multi-center study designed to demonstrate which diagnostic treatment is most capable of identifying patients with a reactive pulmonary vascular bed. A minimum of 100 patients will be enrolled in the study to compare the number of patients with reversible pulmonary hypertension (vasoreactivity) due to nitric oxide for inhalation and oxygen as compared to 100% oxygen. This primary objective will be obtained by measuring the decrease in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAPm) ≥ 20% and no decrease in cardiac index (within 5%) in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (IPAH) or Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) who do not have an unrestricted shunt at the level of the ventricle or ductus arteriosis, and by measuring the decrease in PAPm ≥ 20% and no decrease in cardiac index (within 5%) and decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) ≥ 25% and no decrease in cardiac index (within 5%) in patients with cardiomyopathy or CHD who have unrestricted shunt at the level of the ventricle or ductus arteriosis. Additionally, comparison of the incidence and types of drug related and serious adverse events as well as the number of patients with reversible pulmonary hypertension due to nitric oxide for inhalation alone compared to 100% oxygen and to oxygen with nitric oxide for inhalation will also be assessed.</detailed_description>
