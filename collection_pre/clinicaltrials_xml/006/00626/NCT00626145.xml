	<brief_summary>The benefit of current reperfusion therapies for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is limited by post-infarction left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Many clinic trails showed the short term outcome of bone marrow stem cell transplantation for MI patients, but rare report of long term follow-up results. Our aim was to investigate 4 years' efficacy and LV functional improvement of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) transplantation in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Follow-up of Autologous Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells Therapy in STEMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The benefit of current reperfusion therapies for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is limited by post-infarction left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Many clinic trails showed the short term outcome of bone marrow stem cell transplantation for MI patients, but rare report of long term follow-up results. Aim is to evaluate the long term efficiency of unselected bone marrow mononuclear cells in treatment of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), especially with regard to the left ventricular function. The cells are delivered by intracoronary infusion 7 days after the PCI. Outcomes including LVEF, myocardial viability and coronary artery status are assessed by echocardiography, SPECT and coronary angiography.</detailed_description>
