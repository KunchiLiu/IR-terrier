To determine the response rates in patients with recurrent small cell, large cell, and neuroendocrine cervical and uterine cancers when treated with bevacizumab and paclitaxel. 3. To characterize the quality of life (QoL) in patients with recurrent small cell, large cell, and neuroendocrine cervical and uterine cancers when treated with bevacizumab and paclitaxel. 4.

	<brief_title>Bevacizumab and Paclitaxel for Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs: Paclitaxel is designed to block the mechanisms of cell division in cancer cells, which may cause them to die. Bevacizumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the effects of Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a blood-vessel stimulating agent that plays an important role in the growth of both normal and abnormal blood vessels. Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day study "cycle", you will receive paclitaxel through a needle into your vein over 1 hour. On Days 1 and 15 of each cycle, you will receive bevacizumab by vein. The first dose of bevacizumab will be given over about 90 minutes. If the first dose is well tolerated, the second dose may be given over about 60 minutes. If this is well tolerated, the third and any other doses may be given over about 30 minutes. Before you receive the study drugs, you will receive premedication (selected by your doctor) to help prevent or lessen any side effects from the study drugs. Study Visits: About every 4 weeks, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam and measurement of your vital signs. - You will have a performance status evaluation. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to test how your blood clots. - You will be asked if you have experienced any side effects. About every 8 weeks, you will have a chest x-ray and a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your abdomen and pelvis to check the status of the disease. Length of Study: You may stay on study for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse or you experience intolerable side effects. End-of-Study Visit: After you go off study, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam and measurement of your vital signs. - You will have a performance status evaluation. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and possibly blood clotting tests. - You will have a CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis to check the status of the disease. - You will be asked if you have experienced any side effects. This is an investigational study. Paclitaxel is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of breast cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, ovarian cancers, and treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Bevacizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for use in combination with chemotherapy in patients with colon cancer, but its use in this combination for this type of cancer is considered experimental. Up to 20 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with histologically confirmed, advanced stage (stage IVB), recurrent, or persistent small cell, large cell, or neuroendocrine tumor of the uterine corpus and cervix 2. All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded). Each lesion must be &gt; / = 20 mm when measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain xray, CT, and MRI, or &gt; / = 10 mm when measured by spiral CT. Biopsy confirmation is required if the lesion measures &lt; 30 mm or if the treating physician determines it is clinically indicated. 3. Patients must have at least one "target lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy. 4. Patients must have adequate: BONE MARROW FUNCTION: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mcl and platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcl. RENAL FUNCTION: Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 * institutional upper limit normal (ULN), and measured or estimated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50 ml/min. For the purpose of estimating the creatinine clearance, the formula of Jelliffe should be utilized. HEPATIC FUNCTION: Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 * ULN. serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) and alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 * ULN 5. Patients must have adequate: BLOOD COAGULATION PARAMETERS: prothrombin time (PT) such that international normalized ratio (INR) is &lt; / = 1.5 (or an inrange INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin) and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 1.2 times the upper limit of normal.
