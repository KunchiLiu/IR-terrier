	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures, such as vibro-acoustography imaging, may be an effective method of finding microcalcifications and lesions in the breast. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well vibro-acoustography imaging works in finding breast microcalcifications and lesions in women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vibro-Acoustography Imaging in Finding Breast Microcalcifications and Lesions in Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To further develop a new method of in vivo imaging of the breast using vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging. - To demonstrate and evaluate the capability of VA imaging in detecting microcalcifications and lesions inside the human breast. OUTLINE: Participants undergo vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging of the breast using ultrasonography over 90 minutes. Participants may also undergo further imaging using clinical ultrasonography.</detailed_description>
