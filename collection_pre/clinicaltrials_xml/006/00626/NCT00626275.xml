	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ADL5859 in relieving pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with placebo and naproxen (similar to Aleve®). A second objective is to see whether the effect of ADL5859 differs after a single dose compared with multiple doses.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 2a study was conducted in 2 parts. Part A was a randomized, single-dose, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, 3-way crossover phase during which participants were administered study medication in the clinical facility. Part B was a 14-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multiple-dose phase in which participants self-administered study medication at home.</detailed_description>

Have an overall pain intensity (OPI) score equal to 10 at screening or before the first dose of study medication in Part A Have a pain intensity score for the upper body (that is, back, neck, fingers, wrists, elbows, and/or shoulders) above 7 on a numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) before study medication administration Have a history of headache requiring prescription treatment within 6 months of study entry Have significant renal disease (as indicated by blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal) or have significant hepatic disease (as indicated by liver function test results ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal) Have evidence of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension Have a history of a seizure disorder, including febrile seizures Have, as determined by the investigator or the sponsor's medical monitor, a history or clinical manifestations of significant renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or other conditions that would affect study participation Are taking cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 or P glycoprotein (P gp) transporter inhibitors Have taken oral steroids within 30 days of study entry or intra articular steroids within 60 days of study entry (inhaled or topical steroids or stable oral dose ≤ 10 mg is permitted) Have a history or presence of allergy or intolerance to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or acetaminophen, or have a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation in the study Have a history of alcoholism or drug addiction or abuse within 5 years before the scheduled administration of study medication Have participated in a trial of any investigational medication within 30 days before study drug administration</criteria>
