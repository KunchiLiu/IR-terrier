	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to find out if the daily consumption of English walnuts (Juglans regia L.) for 6 wk, at a dose readily incorporated into the diet (0.75 or 1.50 oz), will have a positive effect on antioxidant capacity and nutrient status in a population of healthy adults, aged 50-70 y.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Walnuts on Antioxidant Capacity and Nutritional Status in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological studies conducted in large populations have consistently shown that increased consumption of plant-based, antioxidant-rich foods, i.e., fruits, vegetables, grains, and nuts, reduces the risk for several chronic diseases. Among the various plants consumed worldwide, English walnuts (Juglans regia L.) have been reported to have the highest antioxidant activity, second only to rosehips (Rosa canina L.). There are a number of different compounds present in walnuts that are known to exhibit antioxidant activity, including vitamin E (as γ-tocopherol), melatonin, and several non-flavonoid polyphenols (e.g., ellagic acid monomers and polymeric ellagitannins). In vitro and ex vivo, studies have demonstrated the ability of walnuts and walnut extracts to increase the resistance of low density lipoprotein (LDL) to oxidation. Walnuts and/or their constituents have also been shown to decrease levels of oxidative stress in diabetic mice and increase serum antioxidant capacity in rats2. In humans, in vivo antioxidant capacity changes after consuming walnuts have only been measured in subjects with Type 2 diabetes. The antioxidant capacity of the lipophilic compartments, as well as the cooperative/synergistic interactions between the water- and fat-soluble antioxidants present in plasma after walnut consumption have not been measured. Indeed, there have been no studies conducted to date of the effect of walnut consumption on the total antioxidant capacity of healthy men and women. The goal of our proposed study is to determine if consuming walnuts in amounts readily incorporated into the diet can affect the antioxidant capacity of older adults.</detailed_description>
