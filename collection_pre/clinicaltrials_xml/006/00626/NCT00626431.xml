	<brief_summary>To assess the efficacy and safety of 2 new formulations of leuprolide acetate 45 mg 6-month depot, Formulation A or Formulation B, for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer. A formulation will be deemed successful if the percentage of subjects with suppression of testosterone to &lt;= 50 ng/dL from Week 4 to Week 48 is not less than 87%, (the lower bound of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval), a protocol-specified criterion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Leuprolide to Treat Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 300 male subjects were planned to be enrolled. Subjects were to receive a total of 2 intramuscular (IM) injections of the same formulation, either Formulation A or Formulation B, administered 24 weeks apart. The first 150 subjects were to receive Formulation A for both injections and the next 150 subjects were to receive Formulation B for both injections. The sponsor was to conduct an ongoing review of the primary endpoint data (suppression of testosterone &lt;= 50 ng/dL) and planned to stop enrollment of Formulation A or Formulation B, or not to administer the second injection of Formulation A or Formulation B, if 15 or more subjects did not achieve testosterone suppression by Week 4 or failed to maintain testosterone suppression during the treatment period. All analyses and summaries were to be conducted separately for subjects who received Formulation A or Formulation B. This study was to be conducted at approximately 60-80 investigative sites. Subjects participated in the trial for approximately 14 months. This trial was to include a Screening Period (up to 4 weeks), a 12-month Treatment Period (two 6-month treatment cycles), and a Follow-Up Period (30 days).</detailed_description>

History of bilateral orchiectomy, adrenalectomy, or hypophysectomy. History of clinical hypogonadism. Current malignancy or history of malignancy except for prostate cancer or basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Clinical or laboratory evidence of any severe underlying disease state (excluding prostate cancer) that would place subjects in additional jeopardy by participating in this trial. Hypersensitivity to leuprolide, polylactic acid, or any excipient of the drug. Incomplete recovery from the effects of any major surgery. History of receiving of the following prostate cancer therapies within 8 weeks prior to the Screening Visit: chemotherapy, immunotherapy, antiandrogen, radiation therapy, cryotherapy, strontium, or biological response modifiers.

Received hormonal therapy, including GnRH analogs (less than or equal to 6 month depot administration), estrogen, Megace and phytotherapy, within 32 weeks prior to the Screening Visit and during the trial. Alternative medical therapies which have an estrogenic, androgenic, or antiandrogenic effect (including phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens) within 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit and during the trial. Requires the chronic use of systemic corticosteroids and anticonvulsants that may affect bone loss such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproic acid or primidone. May require antiandrogen, immuno, or surgical therapy for prostate cancer during the trial.
