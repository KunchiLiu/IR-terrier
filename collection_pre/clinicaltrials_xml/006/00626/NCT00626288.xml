	<brief_title>Mesalazine Therapy in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study is a prospective, double blind, randomised, multicenter trial designed to study the efficacy of mesalazine treatment on symptoms of IBS. In a subgroup of patients the efficacy of this treatment will be also assessed on low-grade inflammation. We expect to confirm that mesalazine treatment reduces the number and activation of inflammatory cells in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients, thus providing the rationale for the assessment of this treatment on symptoms of IBS.</detailed_description>
