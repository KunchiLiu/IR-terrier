	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures, such as contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, may be an effective method of finding ovarian cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well contrast-enhanced ultrasonography works in diagnosing early-stage ovarian cancer in patients with an adnexal mass undergoing surgery to remove the ovary.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasonography in Diagnosing Early-Stage Ovarian Cancer in Patients With an Adnexal Mass Undergoing Surgery to Remove the Ovary</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether use of a contrast agent improves the images of the ovaries during ultrasonography. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients may undergo baseline transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasonography, if not already done. Patients then undergo contrast-enhanced transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasonography using perflutren lipid microspheres (Definity®) IV. Pathology reports from tissue collected during subsequent oophorectomy is analyzed and compared with ultrasonography findings.</detailed_description>
