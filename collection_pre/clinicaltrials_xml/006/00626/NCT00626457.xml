	<brief_summary>Losing weight has many health benefits for women such as reducing the risk of heart attacks, high blood pressure, diabetes, and cancer. However, women often struggle with maintaining the weight they have lost. This may be because they need to learn skills for maintaining weight, not just losing weight. When is the optimal time is to learn these maintenance skills? It may be better to lose weight first and then learn maintenance skills since people may feel good about the weight they have lost and be motivated to maintain. Alternatively, it may be better to learn maintenance skills first and then lose weight since they may experience how easy it is to use these maintenance skills and become confident they can maintain a weight loss in the future. Therefore, this study will examine whether learning these maintenance skills--before or after losing weight--helps women succeed at maintaining weight loss.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Promoting Healthy Weight With 'Stability Skills First'</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized trial will test whether learning a novel set of 'stability skills' before losing weight improves long-term weight management (i.e., during a subsequent follow-up period once classes and staff contact have ended). Overweight/obese participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions (Maintenance First or Weight Loss First). In the Maintenance First condition, participants will learn stability skills during a novel 8-week maintenance program before participating in a standard 20-week behavioral weight-loss program. In the Weight Loss First condition (usual care/active comparator condition), participants will participate in a standard 20-week behavioral weight-loss program followed by a standard 8-week problem-solving skills maintenance program. Participants in both conditions will participate in identical standard 20-week behavioral weight-loss programs and be offered the same number of 90-minute weekly classes over the 6-month intervention period, (thus matching for time and attention from study-led health educators). Participants will be assessed at baseline and 6 months during the 6-month intervention period and at 12 and 18 months during the subsequent 12-month follow-up period (i.e., after classes and staff contact have ended). There will be no intervention staff contact during the 12-month follow-up, only 6, 12 and 18-month assessments. The primary aim will test whether participants in the Maintenance First condition gain less weight during the 12-month follow-up period (i.e., 6-18 months) than those in the Weight Loss First (active comparator) condition. Secondary questions of interest include examining psychometrics of lifestyle behavior questions (e.g., physical activity).</detailed_description>
