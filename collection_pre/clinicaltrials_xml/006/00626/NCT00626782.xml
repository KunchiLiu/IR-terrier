	<brief_summary>Does a new add on (or adjunctive) therapy used in glaucoma surgery improve the success of trabeculectomy? Ranibizumab may offer benefit similar to mitomycin C in preventing epi-scleral fibrosis while avoiding the well known complications of mytomycin C which include late bleb leaks, hypotony and infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lucentis Versus Mitomycin C During Glaucoma Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, single center trial with two arms for patients who will undergo guarded filtration surgery to control glaucoma. The control will consist of patients randomly assigned to receive inter-operative mitomycin C 0.4 mg/ml which is applied in a standard fashion with a soaked pledget inserted in the sub-tenon's space during surgery. The study arm will consist of patients randomly assigned to receive a sub-tenon injection of Ranibizumab 0.5 mg/0.05mL with a 30 gauge needle on a tuberculin syringe at the termination of the surgery. No mitomycin C will be applied. Post operative follow-up will consist of a minimum of 6 visits over a one year period.</detailed_description>
