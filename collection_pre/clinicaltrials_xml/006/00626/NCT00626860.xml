	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine if the vacccine can be used safely in patients with advanced melanoma (cancer of the pigment cells) and whether the cells in this vaccine are capabale of producing immune responses against your own cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Dendritic Cell/Tumor Hybridomas as a Novel Tumor Vaccine in Patients With Advance Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess the toxicity associated with vaccination of melanoma patients with dendritic cell (DC)/tumor fusions. To determine if cellular and humoral immunity can be induced by serial vaccination with DC/tumor fusions cells. To determine if vaccination DC/tumor fusions results in a tumor response.</detailed_description>
