	<brief_summary>Glaucoma is a group of diseases in which visual loss occurs because of damage to the optic nerve. Research has shown that certain genes may cause glaucoma in some cases. So far, research has only been able to find the genes responsible for glaucoma in a small percentage of people who have glaucoma. The purpose of this project is to study the genes in patients with and without glaucoma to find additional genes that may be responsible for causing glaucoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Four tubes of blood will be taken from 100 people. Of those, half will have primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and the other half will be controls (normals), half will be caucasians and the other half will be african americans, half male and half female.
