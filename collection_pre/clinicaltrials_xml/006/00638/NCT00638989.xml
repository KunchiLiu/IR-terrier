Any active concomitant disease including psychological disorders. History of medication that might carry over effects into study. Previously received monoclonal antibody, or a similar related protein, that might sensitize subjects to CAT354. Participation in another investigational medicinal product study within three months of the start of this study or five half lives of the previously administered investigational medicinal product (IMP), whichever is the longer except methodological studies in which no IMP was given. Any acute illness in the two weeks before Day 0 (Visit 2). Any blood donation or significant loss of blood within 56 days of study initiation or plasma donation within 7 days of study initiation.
