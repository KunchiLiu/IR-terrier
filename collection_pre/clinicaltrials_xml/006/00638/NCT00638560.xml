	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare the effects of an intensive 4 weeks exercise training program with or without additional treatment with antioxidants. 16 volunteers are included into the study and randomized into a treatment (n=8,Vitamine E 400 IU od + vitamine C 1g twice daily) and a non-treatment (n=8, training only) group. Before and after the training program, skeletal muscle biopsies will be taken to measure PGC-1alpha and PPARgamma mRNA expression. In addition before and after the training program individuals will have the following measurements: body weight, waist circumference, body fat content (DEXA scan), euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps, ergospirometer (VO2 max), routine laboratory measurements, serum malondialdehyde concentrations.</brief_summary>
