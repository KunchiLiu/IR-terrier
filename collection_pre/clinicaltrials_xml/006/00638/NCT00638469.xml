	<brief_summary>Adalimumab, a fully human anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibody has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. However, in a portion of cases adalimumab does not induce reduction of psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of 75% or greater, now being considered as gold standard for treatment efficacy. In this study we aim to determine in a randomized half-side comparison whether additional narrowband UVB-311nm phototherapy accelerates and improves the clearance of psoriatic lesions in adalimumab-treated patients after initial slow response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>UVB-311nm After Initial Slow Response to Adalimumab in Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who have received treatment with adalimumab (loading dose of 80 mg and thereafter 40 mg s.c. biweekly) for at least 6 weeks without a PASI reduction of 75% or greater qualify for the study. Adalimumab is continued and UVB-311nm phototherapy is added at 6 weeks or thereafter one a randomized body half (left or right; head exempt) 3 x per week until complete response (defined as reduction in PASI to &lt; 3) for a maximum of another 6 weeks (until week 12). PASI score, visual analogue score (VAS) patient score for therapeutic response, and VAS patient score for severity of skin lesions is assessed weekly; and at follow-up visits at month 3, 6, and 12. Paired Wilcoxon testing for differences in PASI and patient VAS scores is done; Fischer exact test is applied to determine differences in complete remission, PASI reduction &gt; 90%, &gt; 75% and/or 50% between body sites.</detailed_description>
