	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to monitor sleep in patients using breathing machines, because little is known about sleep when patients use masks to help their breathing. We'd like to compare sleep in patients using masks to that in patients with a tube in their throats.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Of Invasive And Noninvasive Mechanical Ventilation On Sleep In The Intensive Care Unit (ICU)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep in critically-ill patients is commonly severely fragmented, and sleep architecture is altered as compared to a healthy person. This abnormal sleep may cause some important adverse psychological and physiological consequences. Noise, light, patient-care activities, pain, or medications are some of the contributing factors to sleep disruption in the ICU. Recent evidence also suggests that invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) itself may lead to sleep fragmentation in the ICU. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is a well-established, relatively new form of ventilation which improves sleep quality or gas exchange in some patients with chronic hypoventilatory disorders. Although sleep may be disrupted due to discomfort from the mask or air leaking during NIV use; intermittent use of NIV may result in better sleep quality between NIV sessions. The effects of NIV on sleep in the acute care setting have not yet been studied. The purpose of the study is to describe the sleep architecture of a cohort of critically-ill patients using NIV, comparing findings to a reference group of patients using (IMV).</detailed_description>
