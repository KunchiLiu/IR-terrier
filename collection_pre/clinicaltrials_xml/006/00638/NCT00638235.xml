	<brief_summary>1. This is a prospective, multi-center, post market study, which will be conducted under a common protocol. 2. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate long-term efficacy of the AMS Pelvic Floor Repair System devices for prolapse repair. 3. The study population is female subjects &gt; 21 years of age who require surgical reconstruction of their pelvic floor due to prolapse. 4. The clinical data will be analyzed by comparing post-treatment data with the baseline data, with the subject acting as her own control. The follow-up is for two years after the procedure. 5. Prolapse improvement measured by ICS POP-Q Stage at 12-months will be the primary endpoint of the study. The secondary endpoints include quality of life changes from baseline and adverse event rates.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Have been diagnosed with one or more clinically significant anterior, apical or posterior genital prolapse disorder(s) (symptomatic POPQ stage II or higher) requiring surgical repair The Investigator determines the subject is not a candidate for surgical repair of her genital prolapse. Subject has had a prior prolapse implant/procedure (i.e., IVS tunneler, Perigee, Apogee, graft augmented repair, etc) Note: previous traditional repairs are allowed. Subject has active or latent systemic infection or signs of tissue necrosis. Subject has restricted leg motion (inability to abduct or adduct leg positioning in the lithotomy position) with or without a hip replacement/prosthesis. Subject is currently pregnant or intends to become pregnant during the study period. Note: the risks and benefits of performing the procedure if the subject is planning future pregnancies should be carefully considered. Subject has had radiation therapy to the pelvic area. Subject has pelvic cancer, has had pelvic cancer within the past 12 months or has been on cytostatic medication within the past 12 months. Subject has a known hypersensitivity to the graft material(s). Subject has uncontrolled diabetes. Subject is on any medication which could result in compromised immune response, such as immune modulators. Subject was involved in any other research trial &lt; 30 days of enrollment into this study. Subject has undergone previous pelvic surgery &lt; 6 months prior to enrollment in this study. Subject is unwilling or unable to give valid informed consent. Subject is unwilling or unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol, complete all Quality of Life questionnaires and return for all followup visits. Subject is contraindicated based on intended use and warnings in the AMS PFR System devices for prolapse repair Instructions for Use (IFU).</criteria>
