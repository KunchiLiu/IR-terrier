	<brief_summary>Airway management in anesthesia is critical to guarantee appropriate treatment of possible respiratory complications and successful operative practice. LMA速 is an alternative to tracheal tube in some surgeries like as mastectomy on breast cancer. Given no need using muscular relaxants in mastectomy, the investigators hypothesized that LMA速 would be a superior manner in airway management in radical modified mastectomy on breast cancer than the tracheal tube, and the LMA速 might produce less influence on patients' circulatory homeostasis, and easier to be placed before operation.</brief_summary>
