	<brief_title>Cranberry Juice in the Prevention of Urinary Tract Infections in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Five percent of children have at least one UTI episode and 30% of these episodes recur. Recurrences and the risk of renal damage are indications for long term antimicrobial prophylaxis, but emerging antimicrobial resistance underlines the need for alternatives. The bacteria causing urinary tract infection arise from the stools. Dietary changes can alter the balance of faecal bacteria. Vaccinium berries and products containing lactobacilli have been shown to act against the coliform bacteria that cause most urinary tract infections. In our previous study cranberry juice was effective in preventing symptomatic recurrences of urinary tract infections in women. The objective of our study is to determine whether recurrences of urinary tract infection in children can be prevented with cranberry juice.</detailed_description>
