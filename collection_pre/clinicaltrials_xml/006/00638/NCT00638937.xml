	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well saracatinib works in treating patients with recurrent, stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with combination chemotherapy that included cisplatin or carboplatin. Saracatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AZD0530 to Treat Recurrent Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC Previously Treated With Combination Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the rate of disease control (i.e., lack of disease progression, a combined rate of objective complete and partial response, and stable disease) for at least 4 cycles of therapy in patients with AZD0530 (saracatinib) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer that had previously been treated with platinum-based combination chemotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the objective response rate (complete and partial response), stable disease rate, duration of response or stable disease, progression-free, median and 6 month overall survival rates, safety and tolerability of this treatment. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate potential predictive markers by assessing pretreatment intratumoral levels of src, Y419 phospho-src (P-Src) and c-terminal src kinase (Csk) in archival tumor biopsies. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive saracatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor tissue samples are collected at baseline and at 2 weeks after beginning treatment and are analyzed for c-Src protein expression and activity by immunofluorescence staining. P-glycoprotein levels and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin, caveolin, and Stat-3 are also measured using tumor tissue samples. Blood samples are also used to measure levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 4 weeks.</detailed_description>

Patients requiring treatment with these agents are not eligible; prohibited drugs should be discontinued 7 days before first dose of AZD0530 and for 7 days after discontinuation of AZD0530 Cannot receive other investigational agents History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical/biologic composition to AZD0530 QTc prolongation (i.e.QTc interval &gt;=460 msec)/other significant ECG abnormalities Poorly controlled hypertension (i.e.systolic BP of 140 mmHg or higher, diastolic BP of 90mm Hg or higher) Any condition impairing ability to swallow AZD0530 tablets Treated brain metastases which are clinically and radiologically stable are permitted; patients requiring steroids/with neurological symptoms should be excluded because of poor prognosis/often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction Intercurrent cardiac dysfunction including but not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia are excluded as are those with ischemic heart disease history including myocardial infarction Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing/active infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant women excluded because AZD0530 has potential teratogenic/abortifacient effects; because unknown but potential risks for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of mother with AZD0530, breastfeeding should be discontinued if mother is treated with AZD0530 HIVpositive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because potential for PK interactions with AZD0530; these patients have increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated</criteria>
