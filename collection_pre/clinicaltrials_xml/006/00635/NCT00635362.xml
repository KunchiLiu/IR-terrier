	<brief_summary>The study is a randomized controlled trial comparing outcomes of immediate postplacental insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) vs. interval insertion of the LNG-IUS performed 4-8 weeks after delivery for patients undergoing scheduled cesarean delivery. Our primary hypothesis is that the proportion of women using the LNG-IUS for contraception at 12 months after delivery will be higher in the group randomized to immediate post-placental insertion.</brief_summary>
