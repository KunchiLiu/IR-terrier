	<brief_summary>This 12-week clinical study evaluates the safety and efficacy of Albuterol Sulfate HFA Inhalation Aerosol (Albuterol-HFA, or: A004), Armstrong's proposed HFA formulation of metered dose inhaler (MDI) of Albuterol (Treatment T), in comparison with: 1. Placebo control: (HFA propellant only, Treatment P); and 2. Active control: 3M/Key's Proventil-HFA (Treatment R). The treatments will be given as self-administered oral inhalations in adult and adolescent patients with mild-to-moderate asthma, for 12-weeks. Dosing regimen throughout the 12-week study is two actuations four times daily (QID).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Controlled, 12-Week Study of Albuterol HFA Versus the Active Control, Proventil(R)-HFA in Asthmatic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, parallel, multicenter, 12-week study in adolescent and adult patients with mild-to-moderate asthma, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Armstrong's Albuterol-HFA MDI, in comparison to a Placebo Control and an Active Control of Proventil-HFA. While Albuterol-HFA (Treatment T) and Placebo (Treatment P) will be double-blinded to both the subjects and investigational staff, the active comparator drug, Proventil-HFA (Treatment R), can only be evaluator-blinded, due to: (1) its physical appearance differing from that of the T and P devices; and (2) unavailability of a Proventil-HFA placebo which would otherwise be used for a double-dummy design. All study medications will have the canisters and all product-identifying text or graphics (e.g., molded text on actuator) masked so that the treatments cannot be identified. No subject in any study arm will be given any information that could reveal the nature of the treatment given. All study subjects will be instructed not to reveal or discuss the study medications to the study staff or other subjects. The designated study evaluator(s), who conduct the clinical visits and safety and efficacy evaluations and perform the data recording and transcription, will be blinded to the study medications. All subjects will be screened for enrollment, and will be randomized into the following three treatment groups in a double-blinded (for Treatments T and P) or evaluator-blinded (for Treatment R) manner: Treatment T (Albuterol-HFA, N=200): 216 mcg albuterol sulfate (equivalent to 180 mcg albuterol base), QID; Treatment R (Proventil-HFA, N=50): 216 mcg albuterol sulfate (equivalent to 180 mcg albuterol base), QID; Treatment P (Placebo-HFA, N=50): two actuations of placebo, QID. Randomization is achieved with blocks of six (6), with four (4) patients receiving Albuterol-HFA for every one (1) patient receiving Proventil-HFA and every one (1) receiving the Placebo-HFA. At each Clinical Visit that takes place every 3 weeks, the double-blinded (T, P) or evaluator-blinded (R) study drugs will be distributed in resealable masking pouches to the subjects of each arm. An additional aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of weekly cleaning on the Albuterol-HFA MDI device clinical performance throughout the four, 3-week life-of-device treatment cycles, in conformance with the FDA's specific requirements. Arms: All subjects will be screened for enrollment, and will be randomized into the following three treatment groups in a double-blinded (for Treatments T and P) or evaluator-blinded (for Treatment R) manner: Treatment T (Albuterol-HFA, N=200): 216 mcg albuterol sulfate (equivalent to 180 mcg albuterol base), QID; Treatment R (Proventil-HFA, N=50): 216 mcg albuterol sulfate (equivalent to 180 mcg albuterol base), QID; Treatment P (Placebo-HFA, N=50): two actuations of placebo, QID.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female asthma patients aged 12 75 years, in general good health. A documented history of mild to moderate asthma, for atleast 6months prior to Screening, requiring inhaled B2adrenergic agonists, with or without orally inhaled corticosteroids, for asthma treatment. Satisfying criteria of asthma stability, defined as no asthmarelated hospitalization or emergency visits, and no significant changes in asthma therapy, over 4 weeks prior to Screening (with exception for switching from long to shortacting B2agonists). Can tolerate withholding treatment with inhaled bronchodilators and other allowed medications for the minimum washout periods indicated in Appendix II prior to the Screening Baseline FEV1 testing. Having a Screening Baseline FEV1 test that falls within 5090% of the predicted values. Airway Reversibility PFT at screening should demonstrate a greater than 12% increase in FEV1 at 30 minutes of inhaling 2 actuations of VentolinHFA (180 mcg albuterol base). Demonstrating satisfactory techniques in the use of metereddose inhaler (MDIs) and a hand held peak flow meter. Female patients of childbearing potential being nonpregnant and nonlactating at Screening and throughout the study, and using an acceptable method of contraception during the study. Has properly consented to participate in this study. Male and female asthma patients aged 12 75 years, in general good health.
