	<brief_summary>Skeletal muscle atrophy is associated with catabolic conditions such as major surgical interventions and leads to reduced muscle strength, increased clinical complications and prolonged convalescence. Several studies revealed immobilisation as a major stimulus for muscle wasting in severely ill patients. This study investigates the potency of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on skeletal muscle growth factors and degradation processes in major abdominal surgery patients.</brief_summary>
