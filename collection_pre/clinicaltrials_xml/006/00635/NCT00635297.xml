	<brief_summary>Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a treatment for painful osteoporotic compression fractures. Multiple reports have shown as high as 20 % refracturerates in vertebrae adjacent to those that have been treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty. The purpose of the study is to determine if prophylactic vertebroplasty of unfractured vertebrae adjacent to the treated fractured vertebrae can reduce the rates of refracture in adjacent vertebrae.</brief_summary>
