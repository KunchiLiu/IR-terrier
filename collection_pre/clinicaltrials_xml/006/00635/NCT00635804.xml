	<brief_summary>This study will examine the safety, tolerability and plasma pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of MK-3281 in healthy male participants in Part I, and in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-infected male participants in Part II. The clinical efficacy of MK-3281, as measured by viral load reduction, will also be assessed in Part II. The primary hypothesis is that twice daily administration of MK-3281 for 10 days in healthy adult male participants and for 7 days in HCV-infected male participants is sufficiently safe and well tolerated, based on assessment of clinical and laboratory adverse experiences, to permit continued clinical investigation. The results of this study will guide dose selection for future studies in both healthy participants and HCV-infected participants.</brief_summary>
