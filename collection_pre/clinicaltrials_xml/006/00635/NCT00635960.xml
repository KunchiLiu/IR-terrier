	<brief_summary>Several drugs have been proposed for ALS. These drugs included: Topiramate, Lamotrigine, creatine, Vit. E, Pentoxifylline, etc. Although most of the trials showed a positive trend, none of them reached a statistically significant result. The only exception is the Riluzole trial, that demonstrated a small but significant reduction in mortality between treated and untreated patients. Aim of our study is to determine if the add-on of GH to treatment with Riluzole is able to reduce neuronal loss in the motor cortex of ALS patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several drugs have been proposed for ALS. These drugs included: Topiramate, Lamotrigine, creatine, Vit. E, Pentoxifylline. Although most of the trials showed a positive trend, none of them reached a statistically significant result. The only exception is the Riluzole trial, that demonstrated a small but significant reduction in mortality between treated and untreated patients. When administered to SOD-1 transgenic mice, IGF-I prolongs survival, ameliorates muscular strength, and reduces weight and motor neuron loss, astrocyte gliosis, and ubiquitin positive protein inclusions. Two clinical trials have been performed in ALS patients with s.c. administration of IGF-I indicating a possible beneficial effect, and a third clinical trial is in progress. Methionyl growth hormone (mGH) showed no effect on survival, disease progression and muscular strength. MGH was administered at a fixed dose and peripheral production of IGF-I appeared to be normal. We propose a double-blind trial of Growth Hormone (GH) as add-on therapy to Riluzole, with an individually regulated dose based on the peripheral response of IGF-I. Aim of our study is to determine if the add-on of GH to treatment with Riluzole is able to reduce neuronal loss in the motor cortex of ALS patients. As secondary objectives, effect of GH on mortality, QoL, and motor function will be assessed.</detailed_description>
