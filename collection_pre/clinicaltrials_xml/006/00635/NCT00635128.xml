Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressant or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the booster dose. Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days prior to vaccination, or planned administration during study period. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Previous booster vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, or poliomyelitis since the booster dose received in study 711866/001. History of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, or poliomyelitis diseases. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficiency condition, based on medical history and physical examination. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Administration of immunoglobulin and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the booster dose or planned administration during the study period. Occurrence of transient thrombocytopenia or neurological complications following an earlier immunisation against diphtheria and/or tetanus. Occurrence of any of the following adverse events (AEs) after a previous administration of a DTP vaccine: hypersensitivity reaction to any component of the vaccine, encephalopathy of unknown aetiology occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussiscontaining vaccine, fever ≥ 40°C within 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiable cause, collapse or shocklike state within 48 hours of vaccination Persistent, severe, inconsolable screaming or crying lasting &gt;3 hours occurring within 48 hours of receipt of a previous dose of DTP vaccine convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination.
