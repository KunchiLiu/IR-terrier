	<brief_summary>CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Myofascial syndrome is the most frequent condition of chronic pain. The objective of the present study was to compare the analgesic action of acupuncture and trigger point injection combined with cyclobenzaprine and dipyrone. DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized study was performed at the Pain Clinic. METHODS: Thirty patients were divided into two groups: G1 received trigger point injection of 0.25% bupivacaine (1 ml/point) twice a week, 10 mg/day cyclobenzaprine and 500 mg dipyrone every 8 h. G2 was submitted to classical and trigger point acupuncture twice a week. The patients were asked to continue physical exercise. The following parameters were evaluated: pain intensity rated on a numerical and verbal scale, quality of life before and four weeks after treatment, and quality of analgesia.</brief_summary>
