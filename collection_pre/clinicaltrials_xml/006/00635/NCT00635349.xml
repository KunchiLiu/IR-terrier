	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of tramadol hydrochloride 37.5 milligram (mg) plus acetaminophen 325 mg maintenance with that of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) maintenance in participants with knee osteoarthritis (a progressive and degenerative joint disease, in which the joints become painful and stiff) whose pain was relieved after the add-on treatment of tramadol hydrochloride to NSAIDs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparative Study of Tramadol Hydrochloride Plus Acetaminophen Tablets Maintenance Versus Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Maintenance in Participants With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), comparative study to compare the efficacy of tramadol hydrochloride plus acetaminophen maintenance with that of NSAIDs maintenance in participants whose pain was relieved after the add-on treatment of tramadol 37.5 milligram (mg) plus acetaminophen 325 mg to NSAIDs. All participants will receive tramadol hydrochloride 37.5 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg, 1 to 3 tablets per day along with NSAIDs (meloxicam [7.5 mg or 15 mg once daily] or aceclofenac [100 mg twice daily]) from Day 1 to Day 28, and participants will be randomly assigned into 2 treatment groups at Day 29 if the numerical rating scale score less than or equal 4. Tramadol plus acetaminophen group will receive 1 or 2 tablets containing tramadol 37.5 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg 4 times daily (maximum daily dose will be 8 tablets) from Day 29 to Day 85 and NSAIDs group will receive either meloxicam 7.5 mg or 15 mg per day or aceclofenac 100 mg twice a day from Day 29 to Day 85. The efficacy will be evaluated on Day 1, Day 29, Day 57 and Day 85. The primary efficacy end point will be assessed through change in Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total score from Day 29 to Day 85. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
