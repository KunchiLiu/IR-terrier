	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Generic Lopinavir/Ritonavir in Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HAART in pregnant HIV-infected serves two goals, preventing mother to child transmission and providing adequate treatment for the mother. Levels of HIV RNA at delivery and the use of antiretrovirals (ARV) are independently associated with decreased transmission[1]. With a HAART regimen the transmission rate can be reduced till under the 2 %[1, 2]. Possibly suitable drugs which can be used during pregnancy is lopinavir/ritonavir based regimens. In Thailand, aluvir is not available therefore a generic lopinavir/ritonavir tablet formulation will be used in our study. In order to prove adequate levels of lopinavir/ritonavir, we will record 12-hour PK at third trimester. Second trimester and post-partum 12-hour PK are optional. Furthermore, we will collect safety and efficacy throughout the study.</detailed_description>
