	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effect of 3-month treatment with the combination of 200 mg ofloxacin twice daily and 150 mg roxithromycin twice daily on clinical course of recent-onset reactive arthritis. Patients are followed-up at regular intervals until 6 months. The main outcome measure is recovery from arthritis, and secondary outcome measures include swollen and tender joint counts, Ritchie index, joint pain, serum C-reactive protein level and blood erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The study will also address the safety and tolerability of long-term antibiotic treatment. 56 patients are enrolled and the enrollment of patients has been completed.</brief_summary>
