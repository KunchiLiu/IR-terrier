Varicose veins and duplex verified GSV incompetence defined as &gt;0,5 seconds reflux time after manual compression in upright position 60 degrees. Vein size &lt;20 mm in upright position 60 degrees, 2 cm below the SFJ. Minimum distance between skin and the GSV in the first 20 cm from the SFJ &gt; 5mm. CEAP classification C2C5 BMI &lt;35 Nonconsent for randomisation. Age &lt;18 years. Age &gt;75 years. Deep vein insufficiency in the same extremity (duplex verified). Vein size &gt;20mm in upright position 60 degrees below the SFJ. Meander and superficial veins with a distance of &lt;5mm to the skin surface ( RF or Laser cannot be applied). Patients with double GSV's and/or lateral accessory insufficient branch. Patients with cognitive disturbances, dementia or unable to understand for any reason the importance of follow up. Earlier operation with HL/S (recurrency). Operated for small saphenous vein (SSV) incompetence the last 3 months. Known ABI &lt;0,9 or history of intermittent claudication or peripheral pulselessness (clinical examination)in either extremity. Patients with recent cancer diagnosis or undergoing cancer treatment. BMI &gt;35. Patients with other known medical condition that contradict any of the treatments in the study. Minimum distance between skin and the GSV in the first 20 cm from the SFJ &gt;5mm.</criteria>
