	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized trial evaluates whether one can predict which infertile women with endometriosis who are candidates for in vitro fertilization will benefit from prolonged therapy with a GnRH agonist by the determination of the absence of endometrial expression of the integrin, alpha v, beta 3 vitronectin. This is a prospective randomized trial in which all patients will undergo endometrial biopsy prior to initiation of ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization and then undergo randomization to a three month course of a depot preparation of the GnRH agonist leuprolide acetate in depot suspension prior to ovarian stimulation or standard therapy. prio</brief_summary>
