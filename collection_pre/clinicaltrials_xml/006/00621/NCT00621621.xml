	<brief_summary>The purpose of this post approval study of heart block is to gather additional information regarding how often patients develop heart block (atrioventricular block) after having standard ablation procedure using cryotherapy with the Freezorâ„¢ catheter.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Due to the lack of enrollments for the trial. The FDA and Medtronic discussed the inclusion of data found from from published literature (external studies) to corroborate study endpoint. The FDA allowed this data and the study was closed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Some inclusion criteria can only be established during the electrophysiologic study (EPS); thus there are two groups of inclusion criteria. For inclusion in the study subjects must fulfill ALL of the following criteria: PreEPS inclusion criteria: 1. Patients with a clinical history of AVNRT who are referred for ablation. 2. Patients willing to provide written informed consent. PostEPS inclusion criteria: 1. Patients with EPSdocumented AVNRT ANY of the following is regarded as a criterion for excluding a subject from the study: 1. Patients with any preexisting AV block. 2. Patients with known cryoglobulinemia</criteria>
