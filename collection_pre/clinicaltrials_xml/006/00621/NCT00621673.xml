	<brief_summary>Most transient inhibitor formation, if any, will develop within the first 4 weeks. The study is to further monitor whether participants with severe Hemophilia A will develop inhibitors or antibodies at the later stage when switched from their current recombinant therapy produced from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line to Kogenate-FS raised in a Baby Hamster Kidney cell line.</brief_summary>
