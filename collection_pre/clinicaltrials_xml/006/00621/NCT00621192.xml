	<brief_summary>Meropenem is an antibiotic that is commonly used to treat serious infections. Although it is used in premature and young infants, the correct dose is not known. The purpose of this study is to determine the correct dose and the safety of meropenem for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections in these young babies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Safety Study of Meropenem in Young Infants With Intra-abdominal Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and Pharmacokinetics - Pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) of meropenem in infants &lt;91 days of age with suspected and complicated intra-abdominal infections. The specific aims of this trial are: 1. To characterize meropenem single-dose and multiple-dose PK in subjects with suspected and complicated intra-abdominal infections. 2. To characterize the safety profile of meropenem in the treatment of suspected and complicated intra-abdominal infections. 3. To assess collected efficacy data for meropenem for the treatment of suspected and complicated intra-abdominal infections.</detailed_description>

These include peritonitis, NEC (Necrotizing Enterocolitis) Grade II or higher by Bell's criteria, Hirschsprung's disease with perforation, spontaneous perforation, meconium ileus with perforation, bowel obstruction with perforation, as evidenced by free peritoneal air on abdominal radiograph, intestinal pneumatosis or portal venous gas on abdominal radiographic examination. OR 2) Possible NEC OR 3) Otherwise receiving meropenem per local standard of care Exclusion criteria: 1. Renal dysfunction evidenced by urine output &lt;0.5 mL/hr/kg over the prior 24 hours 2. Serum creatinine &gt;1.7 mg/dL 3. History of clinical seizures or EEG (Electroencephalogram) confirmed seizures 4. Concomitant treatment with another carbapenem (ertapenem or imipenem) at the time of informed consent 5.
