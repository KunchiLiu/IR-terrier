	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Drug Interaction Between Ezetimibe and Tacrolimus After Single Dose Administration in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypercholesterolemia is a frequent finding in organ transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive drugs such as tacrolimus. To prevent increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients, co-medication with lipid-lowering statins is recommended. However, treatment with statins is limited in many patients by insufficient cholesterol-lowering efficacy, drug interactions and serious adverse drug reactions (e.g. rhabdomyolysis). These patients may benefit from comedication with the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe. Since tacrolimus and ezetimibe were shown to be substrates of the efflux transporter ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), drug interactions between both compounds may occur. Therefore, this clinical study in healthy subjects was initiated to evaluate the clinical relevance of drug/drug interactions between tacrolimus and ezetimibe according to the accepted bioequivalence approach.</detailed_description>
