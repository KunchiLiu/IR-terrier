	<detailed_description>Central venous catheters are increasingly used to provide long-term venous access, e.g. after failure of the primary arteriovenous fistula, and they are the first choice in case of an acute need for extracorporeal therapy. Microbial adhesions and biofilm formation have been implicated in serious infections associated with the use of indwelling catheters. In view of the necessity to reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections and of the inadequacy of currently available antimicrobially coated devices, a new antimicrobial catheter surface was developed. The clinical study described below aims at providing further data on antimicrobial efficiency and a supposed additional preventive effect on catheter-related infections.</detailed_description>
