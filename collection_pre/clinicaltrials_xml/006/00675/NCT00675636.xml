	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Gathering medical and family history information from patients and family members may help doctors better understand hereditary colorectal cancer and hereditary polyposis syndrome and identify patients at high risk of developing hereditary colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is collecting information from patients and family members with hereditary colorectal cancer or polyposis syndrome or who are at high risk of developing hereditary colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collecting Information From Patients and Family Members With Hereditary Colorectal Cancer Syndromes or Who Are at High Risk of Developing Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To identify patients and their family members who have either hereditary colorectal cancer or polyposis syndrome or are at high risk for developing hereditary colorectal cancer. Secondary - To establish a tissue and data repository that will be used to further research in hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes. OUTLINE: Data is collected on patients and their families for inclusion in a hereditary colorectal cancer registry. Registry data is entered into a secure database that includes information on patient demographics and medical and family cancer history. The information collected will be used to formulate screening and surveillance recommendations, to further knowledge of hereditary colorectal cancer, and to facilitate cancer research. Registry data will also be used to improve the quality of current standard of care through timely tracking and notification of patients for follow-up care, identification of registry participants at high risk for developing an inherited form of colon cancer, and by serving as a resource for future research. Registry patients may undergo optional blood, urine, and/or sputum sample collection for inclusion in the tissue repository. Tissue samples from a previous biopsy may also be obtained. Samples will be stored for future research studies.</detailed_description>
