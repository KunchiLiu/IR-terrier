	<brief_summary>A stroke is a sudden loss of brain function. It is caused by the interruption of flow of blood to the brain (ischemic stroke) or the rupture of blood vessels in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). This study will investigate the use of far infrared radiation for stroke rehabilitation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Far Infrared Irradiation for Stroke Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A stroke is a sudden loss of brain function. The interruption of blood flow or the rupture of blood vessels causes brain cells (neurons) in the affected area to die. The effects of a stroke depend on where the brain was injured, as well as how much damage occurred. A stroke can impact any number of areas including your ability to move, see, remember, speak, reason and read and write. It is hereby postulated that irradiation using far infrared, with wavelength between 5 to 20 microns, of the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the whole body could prevent, control, manage or possibly lead to complete rehabilitation of people with stroke.</detailed_description>
