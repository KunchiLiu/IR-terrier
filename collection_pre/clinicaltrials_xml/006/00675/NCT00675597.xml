	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a combination of the drugs docetaxel (Taxotere ® ), plus vinorelbine (Navelbine ® ), will result in fewer side effects than cisplatin chemotherapy, thereby improving delivery of chemotherapy in patients. Another purpose of this study is to determine whether a third drug, bevacizumab (Avastin®), may be delivered safely with docetaxel plus vinorelbine in patients who are eligible to receive bevacizumab.</brief_summary>
