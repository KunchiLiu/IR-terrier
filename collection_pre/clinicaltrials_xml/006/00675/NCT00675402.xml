	<brief_summary>Given that previous studies demonstrated the feasibility of the required MRI techniques, we propose to study the macro- and microvascular adaptations in PAOD patients undergoing supervised exercise therapy. It is expected to provide valuable insights into the contribution of each vascular mechanism to the rehabilitation and to identify which vascular mechanism fails or is insufficient for a successful rehabilitation. Improvement of future treatment requires the identification of relevant adaptive mechanisms. With this we will provide early noninvasive MRI readout tools to diagnose and monitor the potential rehabilitation during any form of therapy for PAOD that affects the peripheral vasculature.</brief_summary>
