	<brief_summary>The main purposes of this study are to find out if the study drug losartan (Cozaar) or placebo ("sugar pill") has an effect on insulin sensitivity (how your body responds to insulin) and to measure the effect of the study drug losartan or placebo on how the arteries in your arm dilate (enlarge to carry more blood). We hope to learn if taking losartan changes the amount of certain proteins in the blood that effect blood vessel function. Losartan is approved by the US FDA to treat high blood pressure. It will take approximately 4 months for you to complete this study.</brief_summary>

History of clinically important gastrointestinal resection or malabsorption Patient with a history or current evident of any condition, therapy, lab abnormality, or other circumstance that might confound the results of the study, or interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study, such that it is not in the best interest of the patient to participate. (Including but not limited to: recent or current alcoholism, drug abuse within the prior 2 years, mental or legal incapacitation, any disease which could reasonably be expected to be fatal or lifethreatening, or a history of malignancy ≤ 5 years prior to signing informed consent.) Currently participating or has participated in a study with an investigational compound or device within 30 days of signing informed consent. Inability to be taken off all current antihypertensive medication and placed on placebo for up to 12 weeks.
