	<brief_summary>Brain death patients who are selected for organ donation very often suffer from haemodynamic instability. To treat this, high amounts of vasoactive drugs(norepinephrine) may be needed to raise blood pressure. However,norepinephrine may have negative influence on several organs causing reduced blood flow ischemia. Our hypothesis is that hydrocortisone treatment may reduce the amount of vasoactive drugs needed to keep the blood pressure stable in patients selected for organ donation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>When patients are treated in the ICU only as possible organ donators they will be assessed for eligibility for the study. Iv hydrocortisone or placebo will be administered every 6 hours. Several hormonal samples will be collected.</detailed_description>
