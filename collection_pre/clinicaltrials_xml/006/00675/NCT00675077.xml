	<brief_summary>Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal disease with profound neurological and behavioral features. HD is typically characterized by uncontrollable movements and psychological disturbances. This study will investigate the use of far infrared radiation for control, management and treatment of HD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Far Infrared Irradiation for Managing, Control and Treatment of Huntington's Disease (HD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observations from our research studies indicate that, far infrared rays provide energy to the body, improve the autonomic functions of the nervous system, restore the functions of the endocrine system, strengthen the immune system, improve blood circulation and increase the level of oxygen in the cells and promote the regeneration of muscle cells, nerves and brain cells. It is hereby postulated that irradiation using far infrared, with wavelength between 5 to 20 microns, of the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the whole body could prevent, control, manage or possibly lead to complete rehabilitation of people who have HD.</detailed_description>
