	<brief_title>Thrombectomy in Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute myocardial infarction is caused by an abrupt occlusion of coronary vessel or severe reduction of coronary flow. It has been shown that the reperfusion therapy significantly improves the clinical outcome. Currently the optimal strategy is the primary angioplasty with stent implantation. The treatment is recommended by AHA/ACC and ESC if can be performed within 90 minutes from the first medical contact. However there is still a certain percentage of procedure failure. To further improve the outcome new techniques and devices are tested . Aspiration thrombectomy may facilitate the reperfusion by reducing thrombus burden. The aim of the study is to assess if adjunctive thrombectomy may improve clinical outcome in patients with an acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.</detailed_description>
