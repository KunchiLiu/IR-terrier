	<brief_summary>The study aims to clarify the functional anatomy of key brain circuits associated with cognitive control in children and adolescents with chronic tic disorders (CTD) and to compare and contrast hypothesized mechanisms related to increased tic control associated with Habit Reversal Training, a behavioral treatment that been previously shown to be effective in treating CTD. We also seek to better understand the relationship between fMRI and quantitative EEG in relevant brain circuits with the hope of establishing EEG as a valid and cost-effective marker of treatment responsiveness. A total of 25 subjects will be randomized to 10 weeks of Habit Reversal Training (HRT), a behavioral treatment, and 25 to 10 weeks of minimal-contact waitlist. Treatment responders will be re-assessed at three months. Waitlist nonresponders will be provided with 10 weeks of HRT. Study assessments, including a neurocognitive battery and quantitative EEG will be administered at baseline, Wk 5, Wk 10, and 3-month follow-up. Neuroimaging (fMRI) will be conducted at baseline and Wk 10.</brief_summary>
