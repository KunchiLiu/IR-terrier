	<brief_summary>To examine the clinical efficacy of sertraline (200 mg/day) alone or sertraline in combination with gabapentin. The purpose of this study is to examine whether the antidepressant sertraline alone or combined with gabapentin delays time to relapse relative to placebo in recently abstinent cocaine-dependent volunteers who are also depressed. In addition, whether depressive symptoms or genetic factors influence treatment response to the study medications will be examined. Our hypothesis is that those on combined sertraline-gabapentin will show a longer period of abstinence than those on sertraline alone or placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Efficacy of Sertraline Augmented With Gabapentin in Depressed, Recently Abstinent Cocaine-dependent Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects enrolled in this 12-wk, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial are admitted to a residential facility in North Little Rock (RCA-NLR) and randomized by depressive symptom severity to receive one of the following: sertraline alone (200 mg/day), sertraline (200 mg/day) plus gabapentin (1200 mg/day), or placebo. Subjects are expected to participate in the Substance Abuse Day Treatment Program while residing on the RCA-NLR and being inducted onto the maintenance dose of study medication (weeks 1-2). When participants transfer to the Outpatient Treatment Research Unit (TRU) at the start of their third week, they will continue to receive study medications or placebo (weeks 3-12) and they will be expected to participate in weekly individual cognitive behavioral therapy. Supervised urines and vital signs will be obtained thrice weekly; self-reported adverse effects, mood and drug use self-reports will be obtained once weekly. At the end of 12 weeks, participants will be tapered off the study medication over a five-day period, discharged from the study, and referred to an appropriate treatment or treatment/research program in the community if they are interested.</detailed_description>
