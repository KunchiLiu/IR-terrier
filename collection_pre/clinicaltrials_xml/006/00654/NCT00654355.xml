Face and genital areas can be included in the body surface area determination and treatment area. 3. The ability and willingness to follow all study procedures, attend all scheduled visits, and successfully complete the study. 4. The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent/assent form, which must be obtained prior to treatment. 1. Known allergy to tacrolimus or to any component of the formulations. 2. The use of systemic therapy for atopic dermatitis within the past 4 weeks. 3. Use of prescription topical therapy for atopic dermatitis (e.g., corticosteroids or retinoids) within the past 2 weeks. 4. Use of any investigational therapy within the past 4 weeks. 5. Pregnant females, females who are breast feeding, or females of childbearing potential who are not practicing an acceptable method of birth control (abstinence, birth control pill/patch, barrier with spermicidal jelly, IUD, etc.), as determined by the investigator. Acceptable contraception must be used during the entire study. A pregnancy test will be performed on females of childbearing potential at baseline and at week 4. 6. Any other condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would put the subject at unacceptable risk for participation in the study.</criteria>
