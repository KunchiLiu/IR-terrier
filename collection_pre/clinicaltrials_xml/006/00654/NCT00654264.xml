	<brief_summary>This is an unblinded pilot study comparing (against a randomized control day without water immersion) the diuretic and natriuretic effects of water immersion in patients with right heart failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Water Immersion in Right-Sided Heart Failure: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be immersed in a tub for 3 hours (on one day) and neurohormones will be obtained before and after immersion. Urine will be collected for quantification and evaluation of sodium concentration.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Heart Failure</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Dextrocardia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients must have right sided failure secondary to right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, or tricuspid regurgitation Age greater than 18 years of age Right heart catheterization within the last year to rule out leftsided failure. Evidence of fluid overload as indicated by 2 or more of the following: 1.) 2+ or more pitting edema of the lower extremities, 2.) scrotal or penile edema, 3.) JVP greater than or equal to 10 cm, 4.) abdominal ascites Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure above 16 mmHg or history of elevated left ventricular filling pressures. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 Current use of an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker will preclude participation in the RAS neurohormone portion of the study.</criteria>
