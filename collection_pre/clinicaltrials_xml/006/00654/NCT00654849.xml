	<brief_summary>Objective: To compare the safety and efficacy of the use of bipolar plasmakinetic vessel sealing (Gyrus Pk) usage versus standard technique when performing total abdominal hysterectomy for benign disease. Material and Methods: controlled randomized trial involving 94 women who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy. 47 procedures were performed using bipolar plasmakinetic vessel sealing and the remaining 47 with the standard sutures technique. The primary outcomes were improvement in terms of blood loss, procedure time, length of hospital stay, and overall cost of the procedure. Statistical methodology considered significant P &lt;0.05.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrosurgical Bipolar Plasmakinetic Vessel Sealing During Abdominal Hysterectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients were right-holders of the Petroleos Mexicanos (Mexican oil company) medical network who required hysterectomy surgical treatment for benign causes All patients included in the study signed an informed consent form, knowing all possible implications of the procedure Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two techniques: 1. plasmakinetic bipolar energy forceps (Gyrus PK) and 2. Standard technique using sutures The surgical steps other than placement of suture are identical to those used during standard abdominal hysterectomy. Time of the procedure was considered from the moment skin was first cut-open, until it was fully closed, previously checking satisfactory homeostasis. Blood loss was estimated by the anesthesiology service. Further data compiled included time spent in hospital and the total cost of the procedure. Post-surgery complications were recorded at the follow up visits one and 4 weeks after the surgery.</detailed_description>
