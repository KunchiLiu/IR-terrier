	<brief_summary>Wound complications after Cesarean section (C-section) are common in obese women. Approximately 25% of obese women having a C-section will have a wound complication. This research study is designed to assess whether applying a source of vacuum (suction) to the wound can reduce the risk of wound complications. The investigators plan to enroll 220 women into the study. Women will be randomly selected to receive standard stitching and stapling of the incision (cut on the abdomen) or closure with stitches, staples and wound suction. Subjects will be seen for follow-up visits in 7-14 days and again at 4-6 weeks after surgery. The number of wound complications in each group will be compared. If the wound suction technique is successful in preventing wound complications, this may substantially reduce pain and suffering in a large number of women undergoing C-section for delivery.</brief_summary>
