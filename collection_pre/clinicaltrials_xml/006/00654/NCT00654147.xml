	<brief_summary>A prospective, randomized, open-label pilot study to assess virologic suppression and immunologic recovery associated with a two-drug antiretroviral regimen of Raltegravir and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and a three drug regimen with Raltegravir and two nRTIs (emtricitabine/tenofovir) in HIV-1 infected treatment-naïve subjects. Immunology Substudy added to determine the kinetics of recovery of CD4 T cells and subpopulations (regulatory T cell [T regs], TH-17 and TH1) after treatment initiation with Raltegravir based regimens and their relationship with functional CD8 T cells and if Raltegravir containing therapies leads to decreases in markers of gut microbial translocation and of cellular and soluble markers of immune activation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A009 is a prospective, randomized, open-label pilot study to assess virologic suppression and immune recovery rates associated with a two-drug potent antiretroviral regimen of raltegravir and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir and a three-drug regimen with raltegravir and two nRTIs (emtricitabine/tenofovir) in treatment-naïve subjects. HIV-1-infected subjects who are antiretroviral drug-naïve and have plasma HIV-1 RNA levels ≥5000 copies/ml obtained within 30 days prior to study entry will be randomized 1:1 to Raltegravir 400 mg BID + LPV 400 mg/RTV 100 mg BID (Arm A) or Raltegravir 400 mg BID + FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 mg QD (Arm B). Subjects will have measurements of HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts at pre-entry and entry. The average of these measurements will be used to establish their baseline values. Following entry, subjects will have plasma HIV-1 RNA samples drawn at days 2, 4, 8 and at weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48 and at virologic failure. CD38 expression on CD4+/CD8+ cells and CD38/HLA-DR activation antigen on CD4+ and CD8+ cells and subsets T-cell percentage will be done at entry, day 8 and weeks 4, 8, 24 and at virologic failure by advanced flow cytometry.</detailed_description>
