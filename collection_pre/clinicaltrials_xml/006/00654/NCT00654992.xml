	<brief_title>Effect of Erythropoietin (EPO) in Kidney After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 7% to 40% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, depending on the definition of AKI used. Even small increments in serum creatinine have been shown to be associated with increased mortality after cardiac surgery. However, there are no proven interventions to prevent AKI after cardiac surgery. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to have tissue-protective effects in various experimental models. In this prospective placebo-controlled randomized trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of EPO in the prevention of AKI after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).</detailed_description>
