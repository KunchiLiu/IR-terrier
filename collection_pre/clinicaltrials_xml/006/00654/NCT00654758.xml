	<brief_title>A Phase 1b Study With Volociximab in Combination With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in First-line, Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of volociximab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel (C/P) as first-line treatment in subjects with Stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Volociximab doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg (or 15 mg/kg if 20 mg/kg is not tolerable) with carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy will be tested for determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Subjects will be dosed once very 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles. Volociximab is a high-affinity, chimeric monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to α5β1 integrin, a cell-surface receptor for fibronectin. Volociximab blocks the binding of α5β1 to fibronectin, thereby inhibiting a pivotal interaction required for angiogenesis. More than 170 subjects with various solid tumor types have received volociximab in Phase 1 and Phase 2 single and combination studies. At the doses tested, there has not been a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) defined.</detailed_description>

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt; or =1. 6. A negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) in women of childbearing potential at screening. Exclusion Criteria 1. Known allergy or sensitivity to murine proteins, chimeric antibodies or other components of the product, Cremophor EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil), cisplatin, or other platinumcontaining compounds. 2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1500/mm3, hemoglobin level &lt;9 g/dL, or a platelet count &lt;100,000/mm3. 3. Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), or alkaline phosphatase values of .2.5 of the upper limits of normal values (ULN) (&gt;5 ULN for subjects with liver metastases) or alkaline phosphatase values &gt;2.5 ULN (unless documented bone metastases are responsible for the increase of alkaline phosphatase); total bilirubin &gt;1.5 mg/dL, or serum creatinine &gt;1.8 mg/dL. 4. Radiation therapy within 1 month before Cycle 1, Day 1. 5. Documented symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) tumor or CNS metastases. 6. History of thromboembolic events, including cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (ie, acute myocardial infarction [AMI], stroke) within 1 year prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. 7. History of known bleeding disorders and coagulation defects. 8. History of significant hemoptysis (ie, &gt; or =1/2 teaspoon red blood per event) or gastrointestinal bleeding within 1 year prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. 9. Major surgery (eg, exploratory laparotomy) within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 of the study. 10. Clinically significant or unstable medical conditions including, but not limited to, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus requiring insulin, uncontrolled hypertension, or uncontrolled or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. 11. Oxygendependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 12. Known active infections requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals, including but not limited to chronic human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection. 13. Prior bone marrow or stem cell transplant.</criteria>
