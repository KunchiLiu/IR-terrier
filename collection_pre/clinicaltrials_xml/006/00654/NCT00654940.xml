	<criteria>Patients require a diagnosis of posttraumatic peripheral neuropathic pain (NeP), including postsurgical NeP and NeP due to peripheral nerve injury, which has lasted at least 3 months following the traumatic event. Patients during the screening week must have completed ≥ 4 daily pain scores and have an average daily pain score ≥ 4. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Screening and be practicing an acceptable form of contraception. Patients with neuropathic pain (NeP) that is not due to trauma; e.g. patients with trigeminal neuralgia, central pain, complex region pain syndrome type I, phantom limb pain, radiculopathy, painful diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia or patients with any other coexisting pain which cannot be differentiate from NeP of peripheral origin. Patients who have previously failed to respond to pregabalin at a total daily dose of equal to or greater than 300 mg or are intolerant to those doses. Patients who have previously failed to respond to gabapentin at a total daily dose of equal to or greater than 1800 mg. Patients with any type or history of malignancy, except either where there has been no ongoing treatment for at least 6 months or all basal cell carcinomas; all patients with a history of brain or spinal tumors will be excluded. Patients who currently have ongoing litigation related to any injury affecting their pain symptomatology.</criteria>
