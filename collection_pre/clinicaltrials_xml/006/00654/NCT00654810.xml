	<detailed_description>Thirty-one patients randomized to low-intensity exercise rehabilitation and 33 patients randomized to high-intensity exercise rehabilitation completed the study. The 6-month exercise rehabilitation programs consisted of intermittent treadmill walking to near maximal claudication pain three days per week at either 40% (low-intensity group) or 80% (high-intensity group) of maximal exercise capacity. Total work performed in the two training regimens was similar by having the patients in the low-intensity group exercise for a longer duration than patients in the high-intensity group. Measurements of physical function, peripheral circulation, and health-related quality of life were obtained on each patient before and after the rehabilitation programs.</detailed_description>
