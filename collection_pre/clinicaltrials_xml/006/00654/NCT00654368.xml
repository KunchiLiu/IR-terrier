	<brief_title>CAMEO: Canadian Methotrexate and Etanercept Outcome Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This noninferiority study was a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients who did not have an adequate response to methotrexate (MTX) had etanercept (50 mg/week subcutaneously [SC]) added to existing MTX therapy of at least 15 mg/week (or 10 mg/week in case of documented intolerance to higher doses of MTX) at baseline and were followed for 6 months. After 6 months of therapy, participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the 2 treatment arms: either discontinue MTX (tapered over 6 weeks) and continue etanercept alone or continue both etanercept plus MTX for an additional 18 months.</detailed_description>
