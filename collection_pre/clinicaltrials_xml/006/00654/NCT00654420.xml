	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I/IIa study to evaluate safety and efficacy of dalotuzumab (MK-0646) in combination with erlotinib in participants with recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The Phase I part of this study will determine the highest tolerated dose of dalotuzumab to be given in combination with erlotinib. The primary hypothesis for the Phase I part of the study is that administration of erlotinib in combination with dalotuzumab in participants with recurrent NSCLC is generally well-tolerated as evidenced by accumulated safety data from this trial. The Phase II part of this study will investigate how well dalotuzumab works in conjunction with erlotinib at treating recurrent NSCLC. The primary hypothesis for the Phase II part of this study is that administration of erlotinib in combination with dalotuzumab in participants with recurrent NSCLC results in improvement in Progression Free Survival (PFS) compared to participants treated with erlotinib alone. PFS is defined as the time from randomization until either the emergence of radiographic evidence of disease progression (as documented by an independent core laboratory) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Dalotuzumab (MK-0646) in Combination With Erlotinib for Participants With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (MK-0646-007)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dalotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets the Insulin-like Growth Factor Receptor (IGF-1R). Dalotuzumab may act through: - Inhibition of IGF-1-mediated cell signaling to cause reductions in tumor growth and spread - Antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity In preclinical studies, dalotuzumab improved the activity of an anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mAb and the activity of Erlotinib, a small molecule inhibitor of EGFR Trial Duration of Treatment: Participants will continue on the study for as long as their disease is not progressing and they do not have unmanageable side effects from the treatment.</detailed_description>
