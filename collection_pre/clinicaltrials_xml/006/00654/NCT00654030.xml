	<brief_summary>Rationale: Vaccines made from allogeneic tumor cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. The Purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a lung cancer vaccine in patients with Stage I or Stage II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) after completion of initial definitive therapies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Cellular Vaccine 1650-G for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is an open label investigation of the cellular vaccine called 1650-G. Patients receive 2 vaccine injections intradermally in the thigh given 4 weeks apart. Patients will be followed weekly after each vaccine injection and then monthly for 4 months. Patient follow-up continues with evaluations at 6 months and 1 year after receiving the first vaccine injection. Immunologic responses to the vaccine will be assessed from blood samples obtained at each visit following immunizations.</detailed_description>
