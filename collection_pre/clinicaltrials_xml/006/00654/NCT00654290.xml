	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia post coronary bypass surgery, currently B-blockers are the class I indication to prevent AF post CABG. We decide to evaluate use of propranolol and amiodarone separately and together to find a better prophylaxis for AF peri-CABG</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Prophylaxy of Amiodarone and Propranolol and Amiodarone With Propranolol in Prevention of Atrial Fibrillation Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this double blind randomized study 240 consecutive patients underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting, being randomized prospectively into three groups, propranolol (p) (n=80), amiodarone (A) (n=80) and amiodarone with propranolol (AP) (n=80). All groups received their medications from 7 days preoperatively and continued their medications for 5 days post CABG.</detailed_description>
