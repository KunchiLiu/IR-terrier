	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy together with safety of a flexible regimen, for a period of twelve weeks, of three doses (5 mg, 10mg and 20mg) of Bay 38-9456, a phosphodiesterase type V inhibitor, in males with erectile dysfunction treated with sildenafil in the previous &lt;6 months .At entry, once the Inclusion and Exclusion criteria are confirmed, the study medication will be administered for twelve weeks in an open label design. Vardenafil will be administered, as needed, at a fix dose of 10 mg once daily for the first four weeks of treatment. At the Investigators' discretion, on the basis of efficacy and safety evaluations, the patients may, then, receive the same dose strength of their assigned study medication or, at the subsequent clinic visit(s), the next lower dose (5 mg vardenafil) or the next higher dose (20 mg vardenafil) for the subsequent four weeks of treatment. Previous dose level of vardenafil is either maintained, increased or decreased by one step according to the three applicable dose strengths (5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg ). The highest dosage of vardenafil (20 mg) per day will not be exceeded. After twelve weeks of treatment, the patient will be contacted twenty four hours following the last visit in order to collect data concerning serious adverse events.</brief_summary>
