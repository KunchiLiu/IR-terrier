	<brief_summary>Idebenone is a synthetic analogue of coenzyme Q10 and is a powerful antioxidant and essential constituent of the process of energy production on the cellular level. It can protect mitochondria from oxidative damage and boost their impaired function. It is thought that this mechanism will slow decline in heart function that is part of the disease process of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). It is possible that patients may benefit in terms of muscle strength and respiratory function. This pilot trial is designed to investigate this.</brief_summary>
