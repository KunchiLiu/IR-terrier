	<brief_title>Psychological Effects of Bone Marrow Transplants in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research on bone marrow transplants has conflicting results concerning the effects of maladjustment. The current research is conducted in consortium with DeVos Children's Hospital. Children receiving bone marrow transplants are assessed using the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) and Cognitive based testing. Parents are assessed using the Parenting Stress Index (PSI). Children and parents are evaluated prior to transplant and then 50 days, 6 months, and one year post transplant. Descriptive statistics are currently being used to determine results.</detailed_description>
