	<brief_title>CHARM: Chronic Hepatitis B Antihepadnaviral Resistance Mutation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a naturalistic cross-sectional study of chronic hepatitis B subjects receiving nucleoside or nucleotide antihepadnaviral therapy. It is anticipated approximately 800 subjects will be recruited at 20 Australian sites. Data will be collected on the study subjects and analyses performed to describe factors contributing to the emergence of viral mutations in Australian patients with chronic hepatitis B.</detailed_description>
