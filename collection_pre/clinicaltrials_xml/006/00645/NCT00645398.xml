If this objective is met, then the second objective will be to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin versus placebo for the management of fibromyalgia (pain, patient global assessment, and functional status). Additionally, the study will evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin versus placebo to improve sleep, fatigue, and mood disturbance associated with fibromyalgia.</brief_summary>
