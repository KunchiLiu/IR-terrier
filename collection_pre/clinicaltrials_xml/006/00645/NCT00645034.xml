	<brief_summary>To investigate the effects of a single dose of sildenafil (100 mg) or placebo on blood pressure and pulse rate in subjects taking doxazosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). To investigate the pharmacokinetics of doxazosin when co-administered with sildenafil 100 mg, and to investigate the safety and toleration of sildenafil 100 mg when co-administered with doxazosin.</brief_summary>
