	<brief_title>A 52 Week Open Label Extension Trial Following the Recurrence Prevention Study R076477-SCH-301 to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Paliperidone ER in Subjects With Schizophrenia.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the open-label extension was the long-term assessment of safety and tolerability of ER OROS paliperidone 3 to 15 mg/day in subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia. In addition, the long-term efficacy and effect of ER OROS paliperidone on overall functioning and personal and social functioning, as well as quality of life, health economics, and subjective sleep measures, was explored. This open-label extension study followed a recurrence prevention study (R076477-SCH-301) that had both an open-label run-in/stabilization phase and a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase. Open-label study drug (ER OROS paliperidone 3 mg to 15 mg/day) was administered for 52 weeks.</detailed_description>
