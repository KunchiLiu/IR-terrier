	<criteria>Males or females aged 18 years or older. 2. Patients undergoing coronary angiography and possible PCI with planned use of at least one drugeluting stent (DES), and without planned use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. One or more bare metal stents (BMS) may be implanted, and other lesions may be treated without stenting, as long as at least one DES is implanted. However, the procedure must be successful and uncomplicated for all lesions (DES + BMS + non stent). Indication for the procedure may be stable angina or ischemia, unstable angina, nonST elevation MI (NSTEMI), or ST elevation MI (STEMI). Have the ability to understand the requirements of the study, including consent for use and disclosure of researchrelated health information. Have the ability to comply with study procedures and protocol, including required study visits. 6. A female patient is eligible to enter the study if she is (1) of childbearing potential and not pregnant or nursing; (2) not of childbearing potential (i.e., has had a hysterectomy, have both ovaries removed, has tubal ligation, or are postmenopausal, defined as 24 months without menses). PrePCI PCI within previous 30 days. Prior consent to participate in GRAVITAS and not randomized by IVRS. History of gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months. Major noncardiac surgery within 6 weeks. Ischemic stroke within 6 weeks. Any history of hemorrhagic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Other bleeding diathesis, or considered by investigator to be at highrisk for bleeding on longterm clopidogrel therapy. Minor surgical procedures that require cessation of dual anti platelet therapy and result in significant bleeding are NOT eligible. Current or planned therapy with coumadin anticoagulation. Current or planned therapy with other thienopyridine class of ADP receptor inhibitors (e.g., prasugrel, ticlopidine), or the nonthienopyridine ticagrelor. Severe allergy to stainless steel, contrast dye, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or bivalirudin that cannot be adequately premedicated. Allergy to aspirin or clopidogrel. Current enrollment in an investigational drug or device study that has not reached the time period of the primary endpoint. Have received GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors eptifibatide or tirofiban within 24 hours before or during PCI or abciximab within 10 days before or during PCI. Thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count &lt; 100 K). Anemia (hematocrit &lt; 30%). Polycythemia (hematocrit &gt; 52%). Patients unwilling or unable to complete clinical followup for the duration of the study. PostPCI PCI with placement of at least one DES is not performed. Planned staged PCI in the next 6 months postprocedure. Unsuccessful PCI (postprocedure diameter stenosis &gt;30% with less than TIMI3 flow in any treated vessel). Patients with inhospital STEMI confirmed by ECG prior to randomization or those whom require a target vessel revascularization of the index lesion prior to randomization. Patients with acute stent thrombosis before Accumetrics VerifyNow tests. Administration of any GPIIb/IIIa during PCI procedure or prior to initial hospital discharge. Failure to meet clopidogrel requirements Major complication during or after PCI</criteria>
