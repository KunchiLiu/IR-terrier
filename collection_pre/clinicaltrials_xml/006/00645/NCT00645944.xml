	<brief_summary>The major goal of this project is to investigate established insomnia treatments in a schizophrenia population to see if the improved sleep leads to overall better quality of life. In addition, we hypothesize that the insomnia treatment may also lead to observed improvements in other symptoms associated with schizophrenia such as cognitive impairments, obesity, and negative symptoms.</brief_summary>
