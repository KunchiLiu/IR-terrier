	<brief_summary>CP-945,598 is eliminated following extensive metabolism. Decrease hepatic function can affect its elimination from the body via metabolism. This study will therefore compare the pharmacokinetics (time course of drug concentrations in the body), safety, and tolerability of CP-945,598 in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and healthy control subjects.</brief_summary>
