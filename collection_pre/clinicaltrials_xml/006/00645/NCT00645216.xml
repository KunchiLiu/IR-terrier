	<brief_summary>CP-945,598 is eliminated primarily by enzyme CYP3A. Grapefruit juice may affect the activity of CYP3A and alter the amount of CP-945,598 in the blood. This study will therefore compare the time course of drug concentrations in the body, safety and tolerability of CP-945,598 given with or without grapefruit juice in healthy obese/overweight subjects.</brief_summary>
