	<brief_summary>One complication of uveitis which is driven by an increase in VEGF is the formation of inflammatory ocular neovascularization (ION). Here, we analyze the therapeutic role of intravitreal bevacizumab in ION not responding to standard therapy (systemic and ocular corticosteroids and systemic immunosuppressants) in a multicenter retrospective study.The natural history of subfoveal choroidal new vessels histoplasmosis, multifocal choroiditis, Harada and other inflammatory chorioretinal disorders has been very guarded, but with this new approach, we hope to stop the visual loss in these relatively young patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravitreal Bevacizumab in Recalcitrant Inflammatory Ocular Neovascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Members of the American Society of Retinal specialists, the American Uveitis Society and the International Uveitis Society were invited to contribute their consecutive cases of ION not responding to standard therapy (corticosteroids (CST) 4 or immunosuppression) and treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents. Cases with concomitant or prior cystoid macular edema, diabetes mellitus, or age-related macular degeneration were excluded. Most of the patients had initially been treated in a stepwise fashion with high doses of oral CST, with or without intraocular or subtenon CST or immunosuppressive therapy (as monitored by a rheumatologist). All patients opted to intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment after detailed information about the limited experience, potential side effects and the off-label character of the drug. The risks and benefits of intravitreal therapy were discussed with the patients (or their guardians) who signed an informed consent. Primary outcome measure: Best corrected visual acuity measured as logMAR. Secondary outcome measures:macular thickness on OCT, and stoppage of leakage by IVFA.</detailed_description>
