	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use of topical myristyl nicotinate cream may stop skin cancer from forming. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and best way to give topical myristyl nicotinate cream on the skin of healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Myristyl Nicotinate Cream on the Skin of Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine if topical myristyl nicotinate (MN) is a safe, tolerable treatment in healthy volunteers. - To determine if topically administered MN cream is associated with any significant local or systemic toxicity in normal human subjects in a one-month period. OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms and serve as their own controls. - Arm I: Participants apply topical myristyl nicotinate to one forearm and topical placebo to the other forearm once daily for 4 weeks. - Arm II: Participants receive treatment as in arm I but on opposite forearms. All participants undergo blood collection for chemistry analysis (SMA-20 and CBC) at baseline and at 2 and 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
