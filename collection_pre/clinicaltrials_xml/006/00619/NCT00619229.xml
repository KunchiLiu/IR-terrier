	<brief_title>Alprostadil in Maculopathy Study (AIMS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Results of the planned interim analysis indicated that the number of originally planned patients were not sufficient to reach statistical significance in the primary end point. Instead of increasing the sample size accordingly, it was decided to terminate the study and plan future proceedings based on a careful analysis of the unblinded results.</detailed_description>
