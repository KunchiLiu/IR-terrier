	<criteria>Male and female patients aged 18.5 65/75 years (depending on the dose group). Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (ACR 1987 revised classification for criteria for RA) with a disease duration of at least 6 months prior to randomization. Active disease at screening and baseline evaluation (same evaluator) ) with more than 6 tender and 6 swollen joints of 28 examined (including any effused joint) and either a) Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation (ESR) ≥ 28 mm/hour, or b) CRP ≥ 6 mg/L. Patients should have failed at least 1 DMARD in the past, but should not be deemed "refractory to all therapies" Patients should have a current treatment regimen of ≥ 15 mg methotrexate/week and with the current dose stable for approximately 3 months. Patients were required to have an otherwise stable RA therapeutic regimen, consisting of either a stable dose of NSAIDs and/or a stable dose of oral corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent &lt; 10 mg daily) for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization. Previous treatment with antiTNFα antibody therapy (or other biological therapy) within appropriate timeframe (considering the half life of the compound) Patients who have received intraarticular or systemic corticosteroid injections having been required for treatment of acute RA flare (not being part of a regular therapeutic regimen) within four weeks prior to randomization OR require narcotic analgesics other than those accepted by the investigator for analgesia (e.g., codeine, tramadol, dextropropoxyphene) Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
