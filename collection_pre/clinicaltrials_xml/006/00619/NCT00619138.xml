	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare a stepped care model for the treatment of social phobia and panic disorder with standard psychological treatment. The stepped care model comprises three steps: short psycho-education, a 10 weeks Internet-based self-help program, 12 weeks individual cognitive-behavioural therapy. Patients are assessed at each step and taken out of the study if they show significant clinical improvement and follow for 12 months. Patients are randomized to either the stepped care model or standard psychological treatment, i.e. individual cognitive-behavioural therapy. All treatment components are manualized.</brief_summary>
