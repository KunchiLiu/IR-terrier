	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine and busulfan, before a donor peripheral stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil before and after the transplant may stop this from happening. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving donor peripheral stem cell transplant together with fludarabine and busulfan and to see how well it works in treating patients with hematologic cancers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donor Peripheral Stem Cell Transplant, Fludarabine, and Busulfan in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To assess the efficacy and toxicity of reduced-intensity allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with hematological malignancies treated with conditioning therapy comprising fludarabine phosphate and busulfan. - To evaluate progression-free survival and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen. - To determine donor chimerism. - To access the risk of acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: - Conditioning regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -6 and -5 and fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2. - Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSC): Patients undergo allogeneic PBSC on day 0. - Immunosuppressive therapy/graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients achieve100% donor T-cell chimerism on day 30 without disease recurrence, and cyclosporine A (CSA) IV continuously over 24 hours or orally every 12 hours on days -1 to 60 followed by a taper until day 100 and oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) once every 12 hours on days 1-40, in the absence of ≥ grade 2 GVHD. Patients with recurrent disease or &lt; 100% donor T-cell chimerism (on day 30) undergo a 12-day CSA and MMF taper followed by escalating doses of previously collected donor leukocyte infusion every 4 weeks until 100% donor T-cell chimerism or disease regression, in the absence of ≥ grade 2 GVHD. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>

The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
