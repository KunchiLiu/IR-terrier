	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that a SSRI plus quetiapine SR (Seroquel SR) will result in superior early (first 1-3 weeks of treatment) stabilization of panic symptoms in SSRI-resistant, comorbid Panic Disorder patients versus a SSRI plus placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Quetiapine SR (Seroquel SR) to Treat SSRI-Resistant, Comorbid Panic Disorder Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a single-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled (PLAC), randomized, parallel group (2 groups), 8-week, quetiapine extended release (XR) coadministration trial. SSRI resistance was determined either historically or prospectively. Patients were randomized if they remained moderately ill (CGI-S score ≥ 4). Change in the PDSS scale total score was the primary efficacy outcome measure. Responders were identified as those with a ≥50 % decrease from their baseline PDSS score. In the early weeks of therapy, XR was flexibly and gradually titrated from 50 to 400 mg/day. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept RCT did not support the efficacy of this treatment strategy for SSRI-resistant PD. Quetiapine XR was generally well-tolerated. Important limitations were the small sample size, and the relatively low average dose of quetiapine XR used.</detailed_description>
