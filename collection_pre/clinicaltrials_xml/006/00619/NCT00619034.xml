	<detailed_description>Disturbances in retinal perfusion is believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy. These disturbances may be due to changes in the basal diameter of retinal arterioles and to disturbances in the autoregulation of the diameter of these vessels when the blood pressure and the retinal metabolism changes. In vitro studies have shown that prostaglandins and carbonic anhydrases inhibitors are involved in the tone regulation of retinal arterioles, but it is unknown whether this finding is relevant in clinical practice. This can be tested in vivo by an retinal vessel analyzer measuring the dynamics of the retinal vessel diameter changes.</detailed_description>
