	<brief_title>Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents and Parents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adolescent depression is a significant public health problem, and it increases the risk of poor psychosocial outcomes in adolescence and adulthood. Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents (IPT-A) has been found to be an effective treatment for reducing adolescents' depressive symptoms and improving their global and social functioning. The purpose of the current study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of IPT-A when it is delivered with greater and more structured involvement of the parents in the treatment. Participants will receive 15 weeks of Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents and Parents (IPT-AP). Eight the therapy sessions are conducted with the adolescent individually, two are with the parent(s) individually, and five are conducted with the adolescent and parent(s) together. At the end of the 15 weeks, participants who have demonstrated at least a 50% reduction in depressive symptoms will participate in three booster sessions delivered on a monthly basis. All participants will be assessed at baseline, week 5, week 10, week 15 (post-treatment), and 3 months post-treatment to measure depressive symptoms, global and social functioning, and attitudes toward treatment.</detailed_description>
