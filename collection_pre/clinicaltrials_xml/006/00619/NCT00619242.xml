	<criteria>ECOG performance status 02 Life expectancy of greater than 12 months No prior history of esophageal surgery or endoscopic treatment of dysplasia No prior exposure to sorafenib Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents or any concomitant antineoplastic therapy, with the exception of androgen ablating agents (for patients with prior prostate cancer) Age 18 years. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below: hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL absolute neutrophil count: 1,500/L platelets: 100,000/L (greater than 35,000/L without transfusion for less than 1 X the institutional upper limit of normal) creatinine less than 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. A patient will be withdrawn from the study if any of the following events occur while on therapy: Interruption of scheduled therapy for greater than 7 days Intolerable adverse effects which are judged by the investigator to be either physically or psychologically detrimental to the patient Patient decision to discontinue treatment Pregnancy Patient noncompliance with therapy administration Grade 3 or 4 NCICTC toxicity attributable to sorafenib Treatment with other chemotherapeutic or investigational antineoplastic drugs Disease progression HIVpositive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with sorafenib.Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.</criteria>
