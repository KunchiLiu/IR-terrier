	<brief_title>A Study of Decitabine Given Subcutaneously to Adults With Low or Intermediate-1 Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized open-label Phase 2 efficacy and safety study of two (2) subcutaneous (SQ) dosing schedules of decitabine in subjects with Low or Intermediate 1 Risk MDS. This study will be conducted in up to 6 study centers in the United States. The primary efficacy outcome is the overall improvement rate. These two doses will be administered subcutaneously. The probability that one schedule is superior to the other will be estimated, and the level of toxicity for each schedule will also be evaluated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Each patient must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study: 1. Male or female patients age 18 years and older. 2. Patients must sign an institutional review board (IRB)approved informed consent form, and understand the investigational nature of this study and its potential hazards prior to initiation of any studyspecific procedures or treatment. 3. Must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02. 4. Adequate renal and hepatic function (creatinine &lt; 2 times upper limit of normal, total bilirubin of &lt; 2 times upper limit of normal, and AST and ALT ≤ 2 times upper limit of normal) unless proven to be related to disease infiltration. 5. Female patients need a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study drug administration (applies only if patient is of childbearing potential. Nonchildbearing is defined as ≥ 1 year postmenopausal or surgically sterilized). 6. Women of childbearing potential and men must use contraception. Men and women must continue birth control for the duration of the study. 7. Patients with Low or Intermediate1 Risk MDS by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) classification. Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: 1. Women who are pregnant or nursing. 2. Those who have received prior therapy with decitabine. 3. Prior therapy with azacitidine (Vidaza®). 4. Those who received growth factor support or lenalidomide in the 30 days prior to the first dose of decitabine. 5. Those who have received an investigational agent 30 days prior to the first dose of decitabine. 6. Patients with active, uncontrolled, systemic infection considered opportunistic, life threatening or clinically significant; or any severe, concurrent disease, which, in the judgment of the Investigator and after discussion with the Sponsor and Primary Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for study entry.</criteria>
