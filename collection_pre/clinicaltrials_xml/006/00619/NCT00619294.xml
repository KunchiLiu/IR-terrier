	<brief_summary>Non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD) frequently accounts for myocardial ischemia in women. Endothelial dysfunction is a pathogenic factor in coronary spastic angina (CSA). CSA is an important cause of NOCAD diagnosed invasively by coronary angiography (CAG). Digital reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) provides noninvasive evaluation of endothelial dysfunction. The investigators hypothesized that the fingertip RH-PAT could predict the presence of CSA in women.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Outline of methods: RH-PAT was measured in women with chest pain prior to CAG. Coronary spasm was diagnosed by intra-coronary acetylcholine (ACh) provocation test. Using Flow-Wire, we assessed coronary endothelial function by coronary blood flow increase in response to ACh (ACh-CBF) and coronary flow reserve was assessed by adenosine (Ad-CFR).</detailed_description>
