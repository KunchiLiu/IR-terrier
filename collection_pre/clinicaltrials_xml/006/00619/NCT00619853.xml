	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study was to compare unimanual training (CIMT) and bimanual training (HABIT) protocols aimed to improve ability of the involved hand in children with hemiplegia. Both protocols were conducted in an educational setting for 2 hours a day for 2 months, one-hour group session and one-hour individual therapy session conducted by occupational therapists or assistants. The children in the CIMT group practiced various tasks using their involved hand with the contralateral hand constrained with a mitt. The children at the HABIT group practiced various bimanual tasks without constraint. Twelve children (2 - 6.5 yrs.) participated in this study. The inclusion criterion included minimal extension movement of the involved wrist, and for the CIMT group, the ability to of tolerates the mitt. The children were matched in relation to cognitive level and MACS score and randomly divided into the two intervention groups. Each child's assessment included the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST), the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA), and the Blocks and Box for children above age 5 yrs old. Range of motion (ROM) was assessed using an electronic gonimeter, and muscle tone was recorded using surface EMG and the Tardiue scale. The Child Health Questioner (CHQ) was completed by the parents before, and 6 months after, the intervention. Children were assessed starting two month before, and two month after, the intervention.</brief_summary>
