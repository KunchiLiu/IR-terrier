	<brief_summary>This investigation is designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the 4.0-5.0mm AngioSculpt Scoring Balloon Catheter (AngioScore, Inc.) for femoropopliteal use in a controlled clinical investigation. The scoring balloon is a semi-compliant balloon encircled by 3 spiral struts with a nitinol scoring element, which theoretically provides targeted scoring of lesions, by concentrating the dilation force thus minimizing barotrauma, elastic recoil and uncontrolled dissection. This may improve the outcome of the intervention and reduce the number of stents required.</brief_summary>
