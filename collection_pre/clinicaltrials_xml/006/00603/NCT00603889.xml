	<brief_summary>Na-ASP-2 is a protein expressed during the larval stage of the N. americanus hookworm life cycle. In a clinical study in previously hookworm-infected adults in Brazil, this protein induced urticarial reactions (rash) in a subset of volunteers. This study will evaluate solutions of varying concentrations of the protein in both a skin prick-puncture and intradermal test that will eventually be used to screen volunteers living in hookworm endemic areas who are being considered as potential participants in vaccine trials, to reduce the potential of inducing allergic reactions in those vaccinated with the Na-ASP-2 Hookworm Vaccine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development of a Skin Test for the Na-ASP-2 Hookworm Antigen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Study site: George Washington University Medical Center - Number of participants: up to 15 - Study duration: up to 3 months; each participant will undergo a minimum of one screening visit and one study visit. - Each participant will have both skin prick-puncture and intradermal skin tests applied on the same study day. The prick-puncture and intradermal tests will be applied sequentially to the volar aspects of the participant's forearms: 1. Skin prick-puncture: four different concentrations of Na-ASP-2 solution (1, 10, 100, and 1000 μg/mL) will be applied simultaneously in duplicate, to the left forearm. 2. Intradermal: three different concentrations of Na-ASP-2 (10, 100, and 1000 μg/mL) will be injected simultaneously, in duplicate, to the right forearm. 3. Allergen diluent and histamine solutions will be utilized as the negative and positive controls, respectively, for both the skin prick-puncture and intradermal tests. 4. Participants will be observed in the study clinic for at least 30 minutes following application of the skin tests, and will be contacted via telephone 2 days following skin testing. 5. Sizes of the wheal and erythema reactions for each application will be recorded and graded in comparison to the histamine positive control reaction. - Each participant will have blood collected via venipuncture (a maximum of 25 mL) immediately prior to application of the skin tests, in order to measure antibodies (particularly IgG and IgE) to Na-ASP-2 using an ELISA procedure.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males or females between 18 and 45 years of age, inclusive. Good general health as determined by means of the screening procedure. Willingness to participate in the study as evidenced by signing the informed consent document. History of previous infection with hookworm. Prior extensive and continuous travel, work, or residence (&gt; 1 month) in a hookwormendemic region. Pregnancy as determined by a positive urine hCG test (if female). Evidence of clinically significant neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, rheumatologic, autoimmune, or renal disease by history or physical examination. Behavioral, cognitive, or psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the investigator affects the ability of the volunteer to understand and cooperate with the study protocol. Other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the safety or rights of a volunteer participating in the trial or would render the subject unable to comply with the protocol. Participation in an investigational vaccine or drug trial within 14 days of starting this study. Volunteer has had medical, occupational, or family problems as a result of alcohol or illicit drug use during the past 12 months. History of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. Known immunodeficiency syndrome. Use of corticosteroids (excluding topical or nasal) or immunosuppressive drugs within 30 days of starting this study. History of a surgical splenectomy. Extensive dermatitis precluding skin testing Current use of a beta blocker (oral or topical) or antihistamine medication. A volunteer may participate in the study if they agree to withhold use of an antihistamine for at least 5 days prior to application of the skin test. Use of a tricyclic antidepressant within the past month.</criteria>
