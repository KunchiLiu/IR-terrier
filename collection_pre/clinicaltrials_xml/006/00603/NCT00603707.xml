	<brief_summary>Our null hypothesis states that the two techniques (Sitzmarks radioopaque markers and SmartPill) are equivalent and is demonstrated if the study population shows a correlation of 0.7 or higher.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Whole Gut Transit Time Using the SmartPill Capsule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to measure total gastrointestinal transit time using SmartPill GI Monitoring System with pH.p Capsule and compare the transit time determined by capsule transit to the conventional radioopaque marker technique. Both techniques are simultaneously applied in normal and constipated adult populations.</detailed_description>
