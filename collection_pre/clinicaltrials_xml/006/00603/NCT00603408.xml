	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Cisplatin when given with radiation therapy prior to surgery is effective in improving response to treatment in breast cancer patients. Tumor, blood and bone marrow samples will be collected in this study and will also help researchers determine if cisplatin is able to change tumor DNA so it cannot multiply itself and create more tumor cells, and cause the tumor cells to die.</brief_summary>

Tumor classified as clinically stage T2, T3 or T4 with any N (NX, N1, N2, or N3). Tumor does not express the following biomarkers: estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, Her2/neu Adequate organ function defined as: Serum Creatinine &lt;= 1.5 x upper limit of institutional normal. ALT, AST, ALK Phos &lt;= 1.5 x upper limit of institutional normal. Bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x upper limit of institutional normal. Normal left ventricular function (LVEF &gt; 50%) by MUGA or ECHO.
