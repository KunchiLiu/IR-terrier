	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to find out how a nasal spray (fluticasone furoate), sometimes given to children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), works on certain cells within a child's adenoids. We hypothesize that intranasal steroids lead to an upregulation of T regulatory cells in the adenoid tissues of children with OSAS. This will result in a local reduction in inflammation and edema explaining the improvement in OSAS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective was to determine the effect of intranasal corticosteroid therapy on T-regulatory cells and other inflammatory cytokines in adenoid tissues in children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.Children were randomized to either no treatment or treatment with fluticasone furoate nasal spray, 55 Î¼g/nostril daily, for 2 weeks before adenotonsillectomy. Adenoid tissue was obtained at the time of the procedure.</detailed_description>
