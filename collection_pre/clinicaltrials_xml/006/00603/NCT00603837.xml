	<criteria>Participants in this study will be selected from the inborn population at University Hospital. Eligible patients will be selected from the group of babies with estimated gestational ages of 2428 weeks and &lt;1250g. Congenital anomalies with open lesions such as meningomyelocele, or omphaloceles Blistering skin conditions Resuscitation not performed secondary to infant being below limits of viability as assessed by the inhouse attending physician (specifically, according to current NRP recommendations): Where gestation, birth weight, and/or congenital anomalies are associated with almost certain early death, and unacceptably high morbidity is likely among the rare survivors, resuscitation is not indicated. Exceptions may be made based on parental desires. Newborns with confirmed gestation age of less than 24 weeks or birth weight less than 400 grams Anencephaly Confirmed Trisomy 13 or Trisomy 18 syndrome Meconium staining of amniotic fluid Birth assessment of gestational age &gt; 28 weeks or &gt;1250 grams Maternal temp &gt;38 degrees C around the time of delivery.</criteria>
