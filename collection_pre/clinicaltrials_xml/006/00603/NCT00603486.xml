	<brief_summary>The accuracy and/or performance of the GE DINAMAP noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitors may be improved with modifications in software and/or hardware monitoring techniques and/or accessories. When changes are being made to the GE Monitor, testing can be done to evaluate performance of the investigational devices during and/or after product development.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria Signed informed consent Ability to single or dual monitor NIBP, ECG, and/or SpO2, whether or not already being monitored for any or all of these parameters. Exclusion Criteria Any subject deemed too unstable, at the clinician's discretion, to participate in the study Any subject with a cardiac anomaly that would cause a disparity between aortic pressures and the periphery. Any subject who cannot tolerate, in the opinion of the clinician, multiple blood pressure measurements Known disease state or medical condition that A) compromises circulation to the extremity (ies), B) compromises musculoskeletal integrity, or C) otherwise contraindicates use of a NIBP cuff and/or SpO2 sensor on an extremity or ECG patches on skin Excessive movement or excitability causing false values or no determinations (SP10 accuracy study only)</criteria>
