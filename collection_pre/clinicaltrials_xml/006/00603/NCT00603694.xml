	<brief_summary>Neurocognitive impairment as a result of gamma knife radiosurgery has not been well studied and is poorly understood. Radiosurgery to the base of skull for the treatment of benign and malignant disorders may consequently impair memory function. There is a need to evaluate changes in memory function that may be associated with such exposures. In this pilot study, we will investigate changes in hippocampal-dependent memory function in 10 patients receiving a low SRS dose to the hippocampus. We will also investigate such changes in a no-dose control group and a high-dose control group. This study will provide preliminary estimates of variance in memory changes associated with radiation exposure, and will then permit us to design future studies with the appropriate sample size justification.</brief_summary>

We will attempt to estimate dose to hippocampus prior to enrollment using preplanning on diagnostic imaging to minimize exclusion of patients due to dose exposure &gt;0.5 Gy and &lt; 2Gy following baseline memory testing.
