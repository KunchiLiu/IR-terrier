	<criteria>Disease related: 1. Symptomatic multiple myeloma 2. Relapsed or progressive disease after at least one but no more than three prior therapeutic treatments or regimens for multiple myeloma 3. Prior therapeutic treatment regimens may have included bortezomib, lenalidomide, and/or thalidomide, among other agents. 4. If previously treated with lenalidomide or bortezomib, the subject must not have progressed during the first 3 months of treatment with the drug and must not have discontinued treatment due to lenalidomide intolerance (bortezomib intolerant subjects may enroll). 5. Measurable disease, as indicated by one or more of the following: Serum Mprotein ≥ 0.5 g/dL Urine BenceJones protein ≥ 200 mg/24 h If Serum Protein Electrophoresis is felt to be unreliable for routine Mprotein measurement (particularly for patients with Immunoglobulin (Ig)A multiple myeloma), then quantitative immunoglobulin levels can be accepted. 6. Prior to enrollment, sites must provide evidence of myeloma progression/relapse, with start and stop dates of the most recent treatment regimen, as well as best tumor response to all prior treatment regimens. Demographic 7. Males and females ≥ 18 years of age 8. Life expectancy of more than three months 9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 02 Laboratory 10. Adequate hepatic function, with bilirubin &lt; 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3 times ULN 11. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/mm³, hemoglobin ≥ 8 gm/dL, platelet count ≥ 50,000/ mm³ (≥ 30 × 10^9/L if myeloma involvement in the bone marrow is &gt; 50%) Screening ANC should be independent of granulocyte and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GCSF and GMCSF) support for at least 1 week and of pegylated GCSF for at least 2 weeks. Subjects may receive red blood cell (RBC) or platelet transfusions, if clinically indicated, in accordance with institutional guidelines Screening platelet count should be independent of platelet transfusions for at least 2 weeks 12. Calculated or measured creatinine clearance of ≥ 50 mL/minute, calculated using the formula of Cockcroft and Gault [(140 Age) x Mass (kg) / (72 x creatinine mg/dL)]; multiply result by 0.85 (if female). Other generally accepted calculation methods can be substituted. Ethical/Other 13. Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local, and institutional guidelines 14. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing 15. FCBP* must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test, with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 1014 days (US/RevAssist®) or 25 mIU/mL within 714 days (Canada/RevAidSM), prior to and again within 24 hours of starting lenalidomide and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control, including at least one highly effective method AND one additional effective method of birth control (contraception) AT THE SAME TIME, beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with lenalidomide, during therapy, during therapy delay, and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of lenalidomide therapy. If a hormonal method (birth control pills, injections, patch or implants) or intrauterine device (IUD) is not medically possible for the subject, the subject may use another highly effective method or two barrier methods AT THE SAME TIME. 16. Male subjects must agree to NEVER have unprotected sexual contact with a female who can become pregnant and must agree to either completely abstain from sexual contact with females who are pregnant or are able to become pregnant, or he must use a latex condom EVERY TIME he engages in any sexual contact with females who are pregnant or may become pregnant while he is taking lenalidomide and for 4 weeks after he stops taking the drug, even if he has had a successful vasectomy. The subject must agree to inform his physician if he has had unprotected sexual contact with a female who can become pregnant or if he thinks FOR ANY REASON, that his sexual partner may be pregnant. 17. Male subjects cannot donate semen or sperm while taking lenalidomide. 18. All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist (US) or RevAid (Canada) programs and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of Rev Assist/RevAid 19. Subjects must adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements and receive outpatient treatment and laboratory monitoring at the institute that administers the drug 20. Subjects must agree to take entericcoated aspirin 81325 mg orally daily, or if history of prior thrombotic disease or allergy to aspirin, must be fully anticoagulated with warfarin (INR 23) or be treated with fulldose, low molecular weight heparin, as if to treat deep venous thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism. Disease related 1. Subjects with nonsecretory or hyposecretory multiple myeloma, defined as &lt; 0.5 g/dL Mprotein in serum, &lt; 200 mg/24 hr Bence Jones protein in urine, or disease only measured by serum free light chain (FLC) 2. Subjects who never achieved at least a durable minimal response (MR, ≥ 25% reduction in Mprotein for at least 6 weeks) on any prior therapy 3. Corticosteroid therapy in a dose equivalent to dexamethasone ≥ 4 mg/day or prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day within 3 weeks prior to first dose 4. Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days of baseline 5. POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes) 6. Plasma cell leukemia 7. Waldenström's macroglobulinemia 8. Chemotherapy with approved or investigative anticancer therapeutics, including steroid therapy dose as defined above, within 3 weeks prior to first dose 9. Radiation therapy or immunotherapy within 4 weeks prior to first dose; localized radiation therapy within 1 week prior to first dose 10. Planned radiation therapy that occurs after the start of treatment 11. Participation in an investigational therapeutic study within 3 weeks or within 5 drug halflives (t1/2) prior to first dose, whichever time is greater. Concurrent conditions 12.
