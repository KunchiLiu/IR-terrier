	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of fondaparinux in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The primary objective is to ensure that patients with HIT who are treated with fondaparinux experience a prompt and complete recovery of their platelet count, and the secondary objective is to determine if any new blood clots are formed while receiving the fondaparinux and up to one month after study enrollment. This information will be compared to a historical control.</brief_summary>
