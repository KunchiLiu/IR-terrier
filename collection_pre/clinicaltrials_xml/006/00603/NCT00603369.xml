	<brief_summary>One subgroup of adolescents at particular risk for HIV is those with psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, those with histories of sexual abuse have been found to have riskier attitudes, poorer sexual communication skills, and less consistent condom use than non-abused peers. This study implemented and evaluated interventions for adolescents in intensive psychiatric treatment settings, particularly those with histories of sexual abuse. It is hypothesized that those participating in the intervention that addresses affect management and cognitive monitoring strategies will show fewer HIV-risk related behaviors and attitudes at posttest than peers in an information-based intervention.</brief_summary>
