	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Different Doses of 90Y-hPAM4 Combined With Gemcitabine in Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive a 4-week treatment cycle with once-weekly 30-minute gemcitabine infusions beginning one week prior to the first 90Y-hPAM4dose and continuing during the 3 consecutive weeks over which once weekly 90Y-hPAM4 doses are given. Depending on toxicity, patient cohorts will receive one of several possible 90Y and gemcitabine dose combinations. Post-treatment evaluations conducted until instituting another 90YhPAM4 treatment cycle, maintenance gemcitabine or for a maximum period of 12 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female patients, &gt;18 years of age, who are able to understand and give written informed consent. Histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Stage III (locally advanced, unresectable) or Stage IV (metastatic) disease, including patients who underwent surgery but had incomplete resections. Treatment naïve (no prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy or investigational agents for pancreatic cancer) Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 % (Appendix A). Expected survival &gt; 3 months. At least 4 weeks beyond major surgery and recovered from all acute toxicities At least 2 weeks beyond corticosteroids, except low doses (i.e., 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) to treat nausea or other illness such as rheumatoid arthritis Adequate hematology without ongoing transfusional support (hemoglobin &gt; 11 g/dL, ANC &gt; 2,000 per mm3, platelets &gt; 150,000 per mm3) Adequate renal and hepatic function (creatinine and bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X IULN, AST and ALT ≤ 2.0 X IULN) Otherwise, all toxicity at study entry &lt;Grade 1 by NCI CTC v3.0. Women who are pregnant or lactating. Women of childbearing potential and fertile men unwilling to use effective contraception during study until conclusion of 12week posttreatment evaluation period. Known metastatic disease to the central nervous system. Presence of bulky disease (defined as any single mass &gt;10 cm in its greatest dimension) Patients with &gt;Grade 2 anorexia, nausea or vomiting, and/or signs of intestinal obstruction. Prior radiation dose &gt;3,000 cGy to the liver, &gt;2,000 cGy to lungs and kidneys or prior external beam irradiation to a field that includes more than 30% of the red marrow. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix are not excluded, but patients with other prior malignancies must have had at least a 5year disease free interval. Patients known to be HIV positive, hepatitis B positive, or hepatitis C positive. Known history of active coronary artery disease, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure present within 6 months or cardiac arrhythmia requiring antiarrhythmia therapy. Known history of active COPD, or other moderatetosevere respiratory illness present within 6 months. Known autoimmune disease or presence of autoimmune phenomena (except rheumatoid arthritis requiring only low dose maintenance corticosteroids). Infection requiring intravenous antibiotic use within 1 week. Other concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the Investigator's opinion, may be likely to confound study interpretation or prevent completion of study procedures and followup examinations.</criteria>
