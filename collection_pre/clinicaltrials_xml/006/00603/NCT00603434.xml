	<brief_summary>This is a human inpatient clinical pharmacology study to assess potential interactions between intravenous (i.v.) methamphetamine infusion and oral osmotic release methylphenidate (OROS-MPH). The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of the OROS-MPH concurrent with i.v. d-methamphetamine infusions of 15 mg and 30 mg. Safety outcome measures include cardiovascular responses [heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and electrocardiograph (ECG) measurements], oral temperature, adverse events (AEs), and clinical laboratory analyses.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Be volunteers who meet DSMIV criteria for methamphetamine abuse or dependence determined using a MiniInternational Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and be nontreatment seeking at time of study and have a positive urine test for methamphetamine (greater than or = to 500 ng/mL) during screening. Be able to verbalize understanding of consent form, able to provide written informed consent, and verbalize willingness to complete study procedures. Have a negative urine test for methamphetamine and other drugs of abuse (opiates, cocaine, and benzodiazepines) after clinic intake before the first infusion session. Have a history and physical examination that demonstrate no clinically significant contraindication for participating in the study, in the judgment of the admitting physician and the site Principal Investigator Have vital signs as follows: resting heart rate between 45 and 100 bpm, systolic BP below 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP below 90 mm Hg. Have electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, HCO3) and hematocrit that is clinically normal (+/ 10% of laboratory limits). Have liver function tests (total bilirubin, ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase) less than three times the upper limit of normal. Have kidney function tests (creatinine and BUN) less than twice the upper limit of normal. Have an ECG performed that demonstrates sinus rhythm between 45 and 100 beats per minute (bpm), normal conduction, and no clinically significant arrhythmias. Be able to swallow whole tablets of OROSMPH due to the controlled release formulation. If female, have a negative pregnancy test and agree to use one of the following methods of birth control, or be postmenopausal, have had a hysterectomy or have been sterilized. Birth control must be in effect starting at least 7 days (14 days for hormonebased methods used alone) prior to clinic intake, and should extend at least until the last followup visit.
