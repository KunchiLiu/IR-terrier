	<brief_summary>This study will begin to define these critical determinants for patients undergoing procedures in the hybrid interventional cardiology/cardiac surgery suite. In future studies, the data obtained from this study will be used to prospectively stratify patients in terms of bleeding verses thrombotic risk to design studies to optimize anticoagulation and anti-platelet therapies in the hybrid setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of Platelet Surface α2β1 Integrin Expression as a Risk Factor in Thrombotic and/or Bleeding Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to test the association of DNA polymorphisms linked to the level of αβ1 integrin expression on platelets with clinical outcome in terms of bleeding or thrombotic complications. The association of polymorphisms in other genes such as GPVI, PAR-1, and COX-2, as well as PLA ½ status, will also be examined and considered in the context of other factors such as medications including IIb/IIIa inhibitors, anticoagulants, type of procedure, obesity smoking status, etc. Lower levels of platelet surface expression of the α2β1 integrin are associated with an increased risk of bleeding complications following hybrid procedures, especially when the low level of integrin expression is associated with other risk factors that may exacerbate bleeding such as vigorous anti-coagulation, aggressive anti-platelet therapy and other genetic risk factors that contribute to a hemorrhagic phenotype. Conversely, higher level expression of the α2β1 integrin is likely associated with a greater tendency to thrombotic complication that is again modified by other coexisting risk factors.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients will be recruited to the study who are to undergo elective hybrid procedures [percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) followed by minimally invasive coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or valve surgery]. Both male and females will be enrolled in this study. The age of the population is 1870 years old. No one ethnic group or gender will be targeted or excluded.</criteria>
