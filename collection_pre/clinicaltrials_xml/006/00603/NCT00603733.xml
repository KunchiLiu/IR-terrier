	<brief_title>Canadian Active &amp; Maintenance Modified Pentasa Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority trial comparing the efficacy and safety of a new modified oral extended release Pentasa速 (mesalamine) 500 mg tablet to the currently marketed Pentasa速 (mesalamine) 500 mg tablet in subjects with active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis treated with 4 g/day for 8 weeks and in maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in subjects treated with 2 g/day for 24 weeks. The study involves male or non-pregnant female subjects aged 18 to 75 years. Subjects were randomised on entry into the trial, and if they were in remission at the end of the 8-week Active Phase or the 4-week Run-in Phase, they were eligible for enrolment into the 24-week Maintenance Phase, remaining on the original randomised treatment.</detailed_description>
