	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To assess the effect of xaliproden hydrochloride (xaliproden) 1 mg per oral daily on the rate of complete resolution of peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) at 6 months, following randomization, after the completion of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer. Secondary objective: - To assess the effect of xaliproden on patient-reported outcomes using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity scale (FACT/GOG NTX-12 subscale). - To assess the effect of xaliproden on the rate of at least partial recovery of grade &gt; 2 PSN at 6 months - To assess the effects of xaliproden on the time to complete recovery from PSN - To evaluate the safety profile of xaliproden</brief_summary>

The addition of these medications (for the treatment of PSN) once the patient has consented is not allowed Concurrent treatment with any other experimental drugs Pregnant or breastfeeding women; Women of childbearing potential must be protected by effective contraceptive methods of birth control. Postmenopausal women must have been amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered as having nonchildbearing potential Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule. Those conditions should be assessed with the patient before registration in the trial.
