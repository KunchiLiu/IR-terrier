	<brief_summary>The Phase I/II study will be conducted as an open label, multiple center study of CS-7017, an experimental drug and paclitaxel chemotherapy in subjects with advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer. Biopsies will be obtained from patients with accessible tumor at baseline, two-weeks after the first CS-7017 dosage (prior to the start of combination therapy) and at the end of the first study cycle (week 3 of combination therapy), in order to evaluate the effects of the study drug alone and in combination with the chemotherapy agent on the tumor. Treatment will continue until disease progression or the development of intolerable toxicities.</brief_summary>
