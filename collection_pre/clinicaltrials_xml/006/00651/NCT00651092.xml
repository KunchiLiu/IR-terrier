	<brief_title>Inferior Submucosal Turbinectomy Versus Blunt Turbinectomy for Inferior Turbinate Hypertrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The two methods of nasal inferior turbinectomy are well popularized and in use for long periods of time. Endoscopic submucosal inferior turbinectomy is performed in our hospital and blunt turbinectomy is performed usually in privat clinics outside the hospital where there is no endoscopic equipment. We will examine both subjective (QOL questionaire) and objective parameters(rhinomanometry- a non invasive method to evaluate nasal airflow, saccharine test, nasal endoscopy) in our comparison of the outcome of these two methods.</detailed_description>
