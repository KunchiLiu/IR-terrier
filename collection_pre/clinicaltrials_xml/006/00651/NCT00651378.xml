	<brief_summary>This study assesses whether adding ezetimibe 10 mg/d to ongoing treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg/d is more effective than switching the subject to treatment with rosuvastatin 10 mg/d or doubling the dose of atorvastatin to 20 mg/d is more effective in achieving goal LDL-cholesterol of &lt;2.5 mmol/L. Treatment phase is 6 weeks.</brief_summary>

Consumption greater than 14 alcoholic drinks per week. (A drink is: a can of beer [1/2 pint or 250 ml], glass of wine, or single measure of spirits); Any condition or situation which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might have posed a risk to the subject or interfered with participation in the study; Body mass index (BMI) &gt;= 35 Kg/m^2 at Visit 2 (Screening); Women who were pregnant or nursing; Failure to observe the designated washout periods for any of the prohibited medications</criteria>
