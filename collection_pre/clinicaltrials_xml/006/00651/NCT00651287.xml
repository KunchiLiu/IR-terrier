	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate for the therapeutic goal (diastolic blood pressure (BP) less than 90 mmHg and systolic BP less than 140 mmHg) at Week 6 for quinapril 20 mg and at Week 12 for quinapril 20 mg, quinapril 40 mg, and quinapril 20 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg; and to determine the mean decrease in diastolic and systolic BP measurements and the change in heart rate at Week 6 and Week 12 compared with baseline.</brief_summary>
