	<brief_summary>The study was designed to assess whether 6 weeks of co-administration of ezetimibe and simvastatin is more effective than simvastatin monotherapy in allowing patients in the CHD risk strata of the NCEP III guidelines to achieve their LDL-C target goal of &lt;=3.0 mmol/L. As this study was to be conducted in Canada, the target LDL-C goal for patients with CHD, or type II diabetic patients &gt;30 years old with no CHD, was &lt;2.5 mmol/L.</brief_summary>
