	<criteria>Signed Informed Consent Form Histologically confirmed metastatic RCC that is predominantly clear cell Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST Age ≥ 18 years ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 No more than 1 prior targeted therapy (eg, sorafenib, sunitinib) (prior cytokine therapy allowed) No more than 2 prior systemic therapies Ability and capacity to comply with the study and followup procedures General Exclusion Criteria Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedures Life expectancy of &lt; 12 weeks Inadequate organ function, as evidenced by any of the following at screening: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1500/uL Platelet count ≤ 100 x 10^9/L Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) AST and/or ALT &gt; 2.5 x ULN for patients without evidence of liver metastases, or 5 x ULN for patients with documented liver metastases Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL Hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL (may be transfused or receive epoetin alfa to maintain or exceed this level) Active infection or fever &gt; 38.5°C within 3 days of starting treatment Women who are pregnant or breast feeding, Able to conceive and unwilling to practice an effective method of birth control. History of other malignancies within 5 years prior to Day 1 except for tumors with a negligible risk for metastasis or death, such as adequately controlled basal cell carcinoma, squamouscell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, earlystage bladder cancer, or lowgrade endometrial cancer Malignancies that have undergone a putative surgical cure (i.e., localized prostate cancer postprostatectomy) within 5 years prior to Day 1 may be discussed with the Principal Investigator. Any other medical conditions (including mental illness or substance abuse) deemed by the clinician to be likely to interfere with a patient's ability to provide informed consent, cooperate, or participate in the study, or to interfere with the interpretation of the results. Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned participation in an experimental drug study DiseaseSpecific Exclusion Criteria RCC with predominantly sarcomatoid features Radiotherapy for RCC within 28 days prior to Day 1, with the exception of singlefraction radiotherapy given for the indication of pain control Prior treatment with bevacizumab or any mTOR inhibitor (eg, temsirolimus, sirolimus, or everolimus) Current need for dialysis BevacizumabSpecific Exclusions Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;150 and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg on antihypertensive medications) Any prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to study enrollment History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to study enrollment Known CNS disease, except for treated brain metastasis. Treated brain metastases are defined as having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment and no ongoing requirement for dexamethasone, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT) during the screening period. Anticonvulsants (stable dose) are allowed. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), radiosurgery (RS; Gamma Knife, LINAC, or equivalent) or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Patients with CNS metastases treated by neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed within 3 months prior to Day 1 will be excluded. Significant vascular disease (eg, aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection) Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy that is not intentionally pharmacologicallyinduced Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to study enrollment or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of a vascular access device, within 7 days prior to study enrollment History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess within 6 months prior to study enrollment Serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture Proteinuria at screening as demonstrated by a urine protein: Creatinine (UPC) ratio ≥ 1.0. If UPC ratio ≥ 1.0, the patient must undergo a 24 hour urine collection which must demonstrate ≤ 1g of protein in 24 hours to be eligible. Known hypersensitivity to any component of bevacizumab RAD001Specific Exclusion Criteria Known hypersensitivity to any component of RAD001 Chronic treatment with systemic steroids or another immunosuppressive agent Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of RAD001 (eg, ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection) Severely impaired lung function (spirometry and DLCO &lt; 50% of normal and O2 saturation 88% or less at rest on room air) If O2 saturation is ≤ 88% at rest on screening, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) will be ordered to confirm normal pulmonary function and eligibility. Fasting total cholesterol &gt; 350 mg/dL Fasting triglyceride level &gt; 400 mg/dL or &gt;2.5 x ULN Fasting serum glucose &gt; 250 mg/dL Serum phosphorus &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Serum corrected calcium &lt; 8.0 mg/dL</criteria>
