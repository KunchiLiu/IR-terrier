	<brief_summary>Median nerve block is widely practised, avoiding general anaesthesia in a number of cases and producing excellent post-operative analgesia in orthopedic surgery. Even realised by experienced anaesthetists,a failure rate of 5-15% is noticed. The principal aim of the study is to observe the local anesthetic solution diffusion after a conventional median nerve block technique using neurostimulation. The secondary objective is to compare diffusion and of block efficacy..</brief_summary>
