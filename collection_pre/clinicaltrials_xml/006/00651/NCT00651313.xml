	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Lidocaine Vaginal Gel for Recurrent Dysmenorrhea (Painful Periods)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 10% (150 mg) lidocaine gel compared with placebo in reducing the severity and onset of primary dysmenorrhea in women with recurrent dysmenorrhea. The secondary objectives of this study are the following: - to assess the safety of 10% (150 mg) lidocaine gel compared with placebo - to evaluate electrocardiograms (ECGs) for potentially significant QT changes at approximate peak lidocaine plasma concentration after 4 days of dosing with 10% (150 mg) lidocaine gel.</detailed_description>

Unable, in the opinion of the Investigator, to comply fully with any of the study requirements. 2. Experiencing pelvic pain other than that thought to be associated with primary dysmenorrhea, such as chronic pelvic pain occurring at times other than exclusively during menses and/or dyspareunia. 3. Experiencing dysmenorrhea symptoms that are effects of or thought to be effects of (at least in part) secondary causes of dysmenorrhea, such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and/or currently symptomatic ovarian cysts. 4. Experienced dysmenorrhea that did not require, in the opinion of the subject, the use of analgesic medication during four of the previous six menstrual episodes. 5. Has dysmenorrhea refractory to treatment with commonly used analgesic medications for the treatment of menstrual pain (e.g., ibuprofen or naproxen sodium). 6. Use of any Class I antiarrhythmic drug. 7. Currently using contraceptive injection, implant, or extended cycle OC (hormonal contraceptive cycles consisting of 28 days or more of active hormones). 8. Pregnant or breastfeeding. 9. Participated in a clinical trial in the 30 days from the time of last dosing in the prior study to the time of providing consent for this study. 10. Previously randomized into this study. 11. A history of allergic hypersensitivity or significant intolerance (including angioedema, urticaria, bronchospasm, and rhinitis) related to treatment with any medications used in this study. 12. A history of past or ongoing clinically significant disease, illness, or disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes the subject unsuitable for study participation including active vaginal, vulvar, and cervical lesions. 13. Laboratory abnormalities that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could contraindicate study participation such as liver function tests &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (At the Investigator's discretion, laboratory tests may be repeated once for verification.) 14. A history of, within the past 4 years, or ongoing significant psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes the subject unsuitable for study participation. 15. A history of chronic analgesic or tranquilizer use or drug abuse including alcohol within the 6 months before providing consent for this study. 16. Regular use of any concomitant medications that might confound efficacy and/or safety assessments, in the opinion of the Investigator, including, but not limited to, the following: psychotropic drugs, antidepressants, sedativehypnotics, sedating antihistamines, or tranquilizers for 24 hours or five halflives prior to providing informed consent until 24 hours after the final treatment cycle. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and St. John's Wort are permitted for indications other than pain if the subject has been on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks before providing consent for this study and agrees to remain on a stable dose throughout the course of the study. 17. Unwilling to use only those medications that are allowed in the study for the treatment of their dysmenorrhea, i.e., study drug and rescue medication. 18.
