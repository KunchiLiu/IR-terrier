	<brief_summary>Children suffer from Cerebral Palsy that willing to participate in the study will be tested with well-established measuring techniques of Balance control using force plate before 2 month after BOTOX injection in the movement and Rehabilitation Laboratory at BGU. An automated algorithm will be used to extract standardized stabilogram-diffusion parameters from each of the COP data sets collected during quiet standing. These parameters include diffusion coefficients, critical displacement, critical time and scaling exponents for both lateral and anterior-posterior sway directions (Collins &amp; De Luca, 1993). Each of the Times (before 3 month and 6 month after the THA) in two task conditions (eyes closed and eyes close conditions). Participants will be required to stand on the platform 5 times for 30 s For each trial, they will be instructed to sway as little as possible. In addition Gait analysis will be also examined.</brief_summary>
