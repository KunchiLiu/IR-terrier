	<brief_summary>The metabolism of PF-00868554 is primarily mediated by CYP3A, and it is anticipated that hepatic impairment will modify PF-00868554 plasma concentrations. Hence, it is important to determine the impact of varying degrees of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety and toleration of 200 mg PF-00868554 administered as a single-dose.</brief_summary>
