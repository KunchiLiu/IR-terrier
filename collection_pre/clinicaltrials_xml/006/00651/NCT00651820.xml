Any dermatologic disease which may be aggravated or provoked by the wounding procedure 5. Dark skin pigmentation to a degree which is very likely to obscure the assessment of vascularization postwounding 6. At risk of keloid or hypertrophic scar formation 7. Scars, tattoos or deformities (i.e., contractures) on the inner aspect of the upper arm area where the wound will be placed 8. Any skin disorder which causes delayed healing 9. Disrupted lymphatic drainage of the arm to be studied, or previously diagnosed thoracic outlet syndrome 10.
