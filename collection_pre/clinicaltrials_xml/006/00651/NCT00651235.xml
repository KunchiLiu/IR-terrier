	<brief_title>A Randomized, Open-label, LOSARTAN Therapy on the Progression of Aortic Root Dilation in Patients With Marfan Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a multisystem connective tissue disorder of autosomal dominant inheritance1. The cardinal features are noted in the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal system. The most life-threatening complication of MFS is progressive aortic root dilation leading to aortic dissection or rupture. Losartan, an angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1) antagonist, is a drug already in clinical use for hypertension and type II diabetic nephropathy. A recent study showed that Losartan prevents aortic root dilation and lung problem in a mouse model of MFS. Therefore, the goals of this clinical trial are to examine the efficacy and safety of Losartan in patients with Marfan syndrome for aortic root dilation prevention.</detailed_description>
