	<brief_summary>The planned research will adapt an intervention of known efficacy to target a new outcome of significant importance to public health. Specifically the Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) procedures will be adapted, from reinforcing treatment entry, to reinforcing treatment retention and HIV risk behavior reduction in persons with opioid dependence who receive a Buprenorphine taper detoxification. The research plan includes three phases: 1) development of a manual guided therapy, 2) development of therapist training and fidelity measures and 3) a randomized pilot evaluation with 52 patients receiving either the new CRAFT treatment or treatment as usual.</brief_summary>
