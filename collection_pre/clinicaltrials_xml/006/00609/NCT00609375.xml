	<brief_summary>To determine the efficacy of the administration of 7 to 14 days of cefepime in a continuous infusion vs an intermittent (every 8 hours) administration, in adult patients hospitalized in Bogot√° with sepsis and bacteremia caused by gram negative bacilli. The outcome was the rate of clinical cure and microbiological cure after 7 and 14 days of initiation of therapy and rates of relapse after 28 days. Hypothesis: The administration of beta lactams in continuous infusion allows a clinical or microbiological cure greater than the intermittent administration.</brief_summary>
