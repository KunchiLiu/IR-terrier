	<brief_title>Effects of Cognitive Intervention for Older Adults With Memory Decline: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some older people experience memory loss that is worse than other people of their age, although they are not demented. This condition is known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Healthy older people can learn mnemonic strategies to improve their memory abilities. Can cognitive rehabilitation help people with MCI do better on mental tasks or maintain better functioning in everyday life? This study will evaluate the effects of two different rehabilitation programmes. Patients in the memory training group will learn mental strategies aimed at improving memory. Patients in the memory compensation group will learn to use external memory aids.</detailed_description>
