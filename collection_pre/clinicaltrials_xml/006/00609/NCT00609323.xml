	<brief_summary>Pliaglisâ„¢ (lidocaine and tetracaine) Cream 7%/7% is a topical local anesthetic cream that forms a pliable peel on the skin when exposed to air. When applied to intact skin, Pliaglis provides local dermal analgesia by the release of lidocaine and tetracaine from the peel into the skin. Pliaglis is currently approved in the United States for use on intact skin in adults to provide topical local analgesia for superficial dermatological procedures such as dermal filler injection, pulsed dye laser therapy, and facial laser resurfacing. This study will evaluate lidocaine and tetracaine cream 7%/7% for the treatment of pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).</brief_summary>
