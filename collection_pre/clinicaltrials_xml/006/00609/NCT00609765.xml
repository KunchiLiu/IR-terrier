	<brief_summary>Open label, single-arm phase II study of avastin combined with fluorouracil, doxorubicin and streptozocin administered in 28-day cycles. Treatment will continue until progression of disease, or until withdrawal due to toxicity, or up to a maximum of 12 cycles (48 weeks). In order to reduce the risk of cardiac toxicity, doxorubicin will be administered for a maximum of 8 cycles. If disease has not progressed after 12 cycles of treatment, avastin monotherapy will continue until disease progression or withdrawal due to toxicity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will need to come for 24 study visits in all. Most study visits will take about 2 hours. At some of these study visits, the doctor - Will do a physical exam - Will take blood for routine lab tests - Will do a urinalysis - Will administer study medication Some study visits may be longer because patient will have a CT scan or an MRI. At patient's last visit, they will have a CT scan or MRI. After treatment starts, patient will: - Have their blood pressure monitored with every dose of Avastin® (about every 2 weeks). - Have a history and physical with every chemotherapy cycle (about every 4 weeks). - Have their blood taken for routine blood tests with every chemotherapy cycle (about every 4 weeks). - Have a CT scan or MRI during every other cycle (about every 8 weeks). - Have a MUGA scan during every 4 cycles (about 16 weeks). - Have blood taken for tumor markers during every cycle only if their markers were high at baseline. - Patients will receive study medication to treat their cancer: - Fluorouracil on days 1 through 5 of each cycle through cycle 12 - Doxorubicin on day 1 of each cycle through cycle 8 - Streptozocin on days 1 through 5 of each cycle through cycle 12 - Avastin® on days 1 and 15 of each cycle through cycle 12</detailed_description>
