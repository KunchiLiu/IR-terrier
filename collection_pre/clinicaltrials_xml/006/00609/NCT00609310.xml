	<brief_summary>Prove the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with bioflavonoids will diminish the recurrence rate of colonic neoplasia, we will implement a clinical trial comparing bioflavonoids and placebo in a double blind randomized clinical trial. To use a standardised supplementation of bioflavonoids, a commercially available preparation (Flavo-NatinÂ®) will be used.</brief_summary>
