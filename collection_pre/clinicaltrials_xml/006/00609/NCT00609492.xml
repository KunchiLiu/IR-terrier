	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a booster dose of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals´ pneumococcal conjugate vaccine co-administered with a booster dose of DTPa-IPV/Hib (Infanrix-IPV/Hib) in preterm born children at the age of 16-18 months. This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number =NCT00390910 ). Subjects participating in this study should have received three doses of pneumococcal vaccine in the primary study. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes that their parents/guardians can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study. A male or female between, and including, 1618 months of age at the time of the booster vaccination. A male or female who previously participated in study 107737 and received three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject. Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period (active phase and extended safety followup), in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the booster dose of study vaccines, or planned use during the study period (active phase and 5 months extended safety followup). Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within 6 months prior to the booster dose of study vaccine. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol, during the period starting from one month (30 days) before the booster dose of study vaccines (Visit 1) and up to the followup visit (Visit 2). Previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b and/or Streptococcus pneumoniae other than the study vaccines from study 107737 History of or intercurrent diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b disease. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines. History of seizures or progressive neurological disease Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Febrile illness defined as oral, axillary or tympanic temperature &lt; 37.5°C / rectal temperature &lt; 38°C. A temperature greater than or equal to these cutoffs warrants deferral of the vaccination pending recovery of the subject. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition based on medical history and physical examination. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. Administration of immunoglobulins, with the exception of monoclonal antibodies against RSV, and/or any blood products within three months preceding the booster dose of study vaccines or planned administration during the active phase of the study.</criteria>
