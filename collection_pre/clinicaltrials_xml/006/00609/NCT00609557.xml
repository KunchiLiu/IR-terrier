	<brief_summary>This will be a single-blind, placebo-run-in trial. Subjects will be informed that they may receive duloxetine or placebo during the course of the trial. All subjects will, in fact, receive placebo for the first two weeks. All subjects will then be placed on 60-90mg per day of duloxetine. Primary outcome assessment will compare pain intensity at 2 weeks (after placebo) to that at 12 weeks (after 10 weeks of duloxetine treatment). Study Hypothesis: In subjects who continue to have activity-limiting osteoarthritis pain after treatment with acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, 60-90 mg Duloxetine per day over 10 weeks will provide significant additional pain relief over that achieved with placebo(&gt; 30% reduction after Duloxetine treatment).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 5080 Physician diagnosis of OA in hip, knee or spine. Significant activity limitation due to pain for at least one month on the Western Ontario and McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and average pain &gt;5/10 on Brief Pain Inventory despite adequate treatment with acetaminophen or NSAIDs. [This will identify an OA group with significant psychological distress and a desire for treatment.] Depression status is not restricted, but will be monitored with PRIMEMD interview and the SCL20. We anticipate depressive symptoms will be common in this population due to the above requirement for activity limitation.
