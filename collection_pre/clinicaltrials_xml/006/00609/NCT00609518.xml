	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy for patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Patients are given folic acid, vitamin B12 and steroids, both before and during treatment, to reduce the side effects associated with pemetrexed. The aim is whether it is possible to simplify the folic acid and steroid schedule without increasing toxicity.</brief_summary>
