	<brief_summary>Pioglitazone and insulin glargine are equally effective in achieving glycemic control in secondary drug failure of type 2 diabetes but the mechanisms of actions are different.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pioglitazone vs. Insulin Glargine in the Treatment of Secondary Drug Failure in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study was undertaken to assess differences in how insulin glargine vs. pioglitazone affect: - Beta-cell function as measured by proinsulin/insulin, homeostasis model assessment for insulin secretion (HOMA Î²-cell) and glucagon stimulated C-peptide test - Insulin sensitivity as measured by adiponectin, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulin tolerance test and - Surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease as measured by BNP, NT-pro BNP and plasma lipid profile as add-on therapy in patients with T2D and secondary drug failure. The patients' satisfaction with each treatment was also surveyed.</detailed_description>
