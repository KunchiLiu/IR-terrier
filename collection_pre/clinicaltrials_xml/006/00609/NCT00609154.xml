	<brief_summary>The gut hormone glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been shown to have important effects on maintaining the function and health of the insulin producing beta cells. This hormone is known to increase the production rate of new insulin as well as increase the release of insulin into the blood. We will measure the rate of new insulin production in subjects with Type 2 diabetes compared to non diabetic subjects. We hypothesize that subjects with Type 2 diabetes make less insulin in response to GLP-1 compared to non diabetic subjects.</brief_summary>
