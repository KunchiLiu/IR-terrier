	<brief_title>Albumin Use in Burn Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While albumin has been a part of burn resuscitation for many years, its use remains varied and controversial. The purpose of this study is to describe the current practices of albumin administration during the first 72 hours after a burn injury. Participating sites will collect data on patients with at least a 20% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) burn. Information will be recorded on type and extent of burn injury, basic demographic data, co-morbidities, outcomes and, for the first 72 hours post injury, if albumin was used and why, amount of resuscitation fluids and urine output, and use of vasopressors and diuretics. Each participating site will retrospectively review 20 charts of consecutive admissions with at least a 20% TBSA burn. In addition, each site will collect data prospectively on 20 more patients with 20% TBSA burns. Prospective data is requested in order to capture as close as possible to "real time" the reasons physicians choose to give albumin. No Protected Health Information (PHI) will be recorded. Data will be analyzed for patterns of albumin use and reasons for albumin administration.</detailed_description>
