	<brief_summary>Purpose: The purpose of this study is to provide tight blood sugar control using insulin given through the veins at the time of kidney transplantation and up to 3 days after surgery. After release from the hospital, the patient will control blood sugar with subcutaneous insulin injections or pills. With this approach, outcomes should improve for diabetic transplant patients such as longer life of the new kidney, fewer hospital readmissions, decreased associated infections, and other advantages. Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that intensive glycemic control will lead to better clinical and biochemical outcomes and improved long-term graft survival.</brief_summary>
