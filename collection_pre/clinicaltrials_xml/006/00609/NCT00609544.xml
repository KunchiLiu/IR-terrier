	<brief_summary>Anemia of inflammation is a common complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with CKD and anemia of inflammation also exhibit decreased response to erythropoietic agents, even in the presence of adequate iron stores. This decreased responsiveness is associated with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Rilonacept is being developed for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. This is a clinical research study to determine the safety and effectiveness of rilonacept for the treatment of anemia in inflamed patients with CKD who are not yet on dialysis.</brief_summary>
