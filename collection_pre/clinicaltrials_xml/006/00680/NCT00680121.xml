	<brief_summary>B1AS tests the hypothesis that increased vitamin B1 (thiamine) intake can repair brain systems damaged by alcohol and help people with alcohol problems control their alcohol use. A strong, man-made form of thiamine (Benfotiamine) is used to increase blood thiamine to much higher levels than can be achieved using normal vitamin supplements. Drinking patterns are examined over 6 months of continued supplement use. Men and women with a recent history of alcohol problems are eligible to participate.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>B1AS is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of the effectiveness of Benfotiamine at reducing abusive drinking patterns in individuals with recent alcohol problems. Subjects consume 4 tablets of Benfotiamine (600 mg) or placebo daily for 6 months. Monthly follow-ups track alcohol use and alcohol-related problems over the 6 months. Blood tests are also conducted to determine the frequency of an inherited abnormality in thiamine processing that may be related to the risk of developing alcoholism.</detailed_description>
