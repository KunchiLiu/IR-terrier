	<brief_title>Safety &amp; Efficacy of Peginesatide for Treatment of Anemia in Participants on Dialysis Not Receiving an ESA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia associated with chronic kidney disease is due to several factors, primarily the inability of the diseased kidneys to produce adequate amounts of endogenous erythropoietin. Ancillary factors include the shortened lifespan of red blood cells, iron and other nutritional deficiencies, infection, and inflammation. The presence and severity of anemia are related to the duration and extent of kidney failure. Anemia is associated with increased mortality, increased likelihood of hospitalization, reduced cognitive function, and increased left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) have been established as a treatment for anemia in chronic renal failure subjects, and have improved the management of anemia over alternatives such as transfusion. Peginesatide is a parenteral formulation developed for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Peginesatide binds to and activates the human erythropoietin receptor and stimulates erythropoiesis in human red cell precursors in a manner similar to other known erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Eligible participants were randomized in equal proportions to two peginesatide treatment regimens, in which participants received peginesatide once every 4 weeks, and one control, epoetin alfa, treatment regimen, in which participants received epoetin alfa three times per week. Total commitment time of this study was a 4 week screening period followed by a minimum of 7 months of treatment.</detailed_description>
