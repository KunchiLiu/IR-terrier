	<brief_title>Enhancing Support for Women With Type 2 Diabetes: Follow-Up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death and functional limitations among women in the U.S. Postmenopausal women with diabetes are at especially high risk of CHD, but CHD research with this population is very limited. This project addresses the poorly understood "natural history" of long-term maintenance of change in multiple behaviors (i.e., dietary, physical activity, social support, smoking cessation, and stress management) related to CHD risk, as well as the effects of theoretically important mediating variables on relapse and maintenance. The study is a continuation of a research project that has already demonstrated significant and consistent positive effects of a lifestyle change intervention on reduction of behavioral CHD risk factors. This research relies on a framework that synthesizes social-cognitive, social-ecologic, and goal-systems theories.</detailed_description>
