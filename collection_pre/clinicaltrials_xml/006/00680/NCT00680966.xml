	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is more effective to treat adolescents, with diagnoses of both depression and substance use disorder, with a treatment addressing the substance use first and then treating the depression or to first treat the depression and then treat the substance use or whether treating both disorders simultaneously is most effective. It is expected that treatment of both disorders at the same time will be the most effective.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequenced vs. Integrated Delivery of Treatment for Adolescent Depression and SUD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comorbidity is a well established aspect of adolescent psychopathology. The majority of adolescents entering treatment have more than one condition. This study will evaluate service delivery methods of integrating empirically supported interventions for depression and non-nicotine substance use disorders (SUD)in an effort to improve treatment engagement, response, and maintenance of gains. The two examined interventions are the Adolescent Coping With Depression course (ACWD) and Functional Family Therapy (FFT). This study will expand upon previous research by systematically treating both depression and SUD. Over a 5 year period, 180 adolescents with depression/SUD and their parents/guardians will be recruited in Oregon and New Mexico and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) FFT followed by ACWD, (b) ACWD followed by FFT, or (c) an intervention combining and augmenting FFT and ACWD (Integrated Treatment). Each treatment arm will consist of 24 sessions provided over 20 weeks. Participants will be assessed at intake, after the provision of 6, 12 (Mid-treatment), 18 and 24 (Post-treatment)treatment sessions, and at 6 and 12 month follow-ups.</detailed_description>
