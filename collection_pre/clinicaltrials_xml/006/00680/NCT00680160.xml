	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the absorption, systemic pharmacokinetics and accumulation in the nail of AN2690 during a 28 day period of daily application of a 7.5% solution of AN2690 to all 10 toenails of up to 25 otherwise healthy adult patients with onychomycosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Absorption and Systemic Study of AN2690 in Patients With Moderate to Severe Onychomycosis (ADME I)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For this study, the case definition of onychomycosis included moderate to severe distal subungual onychomycosis including subjects with evidence of subungual dermatophytoma or yellow spikes, lateral and proximal onychomycosis and severely dystrophic nail plates.
