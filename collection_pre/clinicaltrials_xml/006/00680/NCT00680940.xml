	<brief_title>A Study of Mycobacterium w in Combination With Paclitaxel Plus Cisplatin in Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 75% of all lung cancers. majority of patients of NSCLC patients are stage IIIA or IIIB patients are suitable for radiotherapy, which could not improve the survival rates of 5-10%. This study proposed Mycobacterium w (heat killed) in combination chemotherapy of Cisplatin and Paclitaxel along with radiotherapy for adjuvant therapy management of NSCLC in controlled clinical trial, which may prove the efficacy, better survival rate and quality of life.</detailed_description>
