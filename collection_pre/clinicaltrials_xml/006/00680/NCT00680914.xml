	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are: To demonstrate the immunogenicity in terms of antibody response following primary vaccination of Korean infants with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK 1024850A compared to Prevenar™ when co-administered with a Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine in children during the first 6 months of life. To evaluate the safety/reactogenicity in terms of solicited and unsolicited symptoms and serious adverse events following primary vaccination of Korean infants with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK 1024850A.</brief_summary>
