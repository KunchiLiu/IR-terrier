	<brief_summary>This study utilizes lactobacillus, or probiotics, delivered twice daily to the mouth and stomach, via feeding tube, in effort to determine whether the oral administration of a naturally occurring Lactobacillus species reduces the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia therefore reducing intensive care unit(ICU)complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lactobacillus GG in the Prophylaxis of Ventilator Associated Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term objective of this research is to determine the utility of altering the oral and gastric bacterial flora in mechanically ventilated patients in order to reduce intensive care unit (ICU)complications. Specifically, our goal is to determine whether the oral administration of a naturally occurring Lactobacillus species reduces the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). ICU admission is commonly accompanied by overgrowth of the natural gastrointestinal (GI) and oropharyngeal flor by pathogenic organisms. Patients requiring endotracheal intubation are predisposed to developing VAP, presumably via micro-aspiration of the altered oropharyngeal flora. By reducing VAP rates, we hope to improve ICU outcomes, minimize ICU expenses, and most importantly, decrease morbidity and mortality.</detailed_description>
