	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that NBI will have a high accuracy in predicting polyp histology real time during a colonoscopy by visualization of the surface mucosal and vascular patterns. Aim#1: To determine the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of NBI and standard white light colonoscopy for predicting polyp histology by evaluating the surface mucosal and vascular patterns during colonoscopy. Aim#2: To determine the inter-observer agreement between investigators for the recognition of various polyp patterns.</brief_summary>
