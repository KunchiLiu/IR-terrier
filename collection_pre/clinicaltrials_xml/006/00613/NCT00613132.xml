	<brief_summary>Primary objective To determine maximum tolerated dose &amp; dose limiting toxicity of imatinib mesylate &amp; RAD001 when combined w fixed doses of hydroxyurea among pts w recurrent GBM who are on &amp; not on enzyme-inducing anti-convulsants including pts not on anti-epileptic drugs Secondary objective To assess safety &amp; tolerability of imatinib mesylate in combo w RAD001 &amp; hydroxyurea in this population To characterize single-dose &amp; repeated-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of imatinib mesylate &amp; RAD001 combo therapy in this pt population. To assess antiangiogenic effects, pre- and post-treatment, of imatinib mesylate, RAD001 &amp; hydroxyurea combo therapy, using DCE-MRI to evaluate changes in extent of vascular permeability, perfusion &amp; relative tumor blood volume; to explore assessment of tumor cellularity &amp; tumor cell death by changes in DWI-MRI as quantitated by apparent diffusion coefficient maps.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph I Gleevec in Combo w RAD001 + Hydroxyurea for Pts w Recurrent MG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is open-label, single center, 1-arm ph I dose-escalation study of continuous, daily doses of imatinib mesylate &amp; RAD001 administered orally in combination w fixed doses of hydroxyurea in adult pts w recurrent or relapsing glioblastoma multiforme. Study format includes classical "3+3" dose escalation design to determine MTD &amp; DLT of imatinib mesylate + RAD001 when combined w hydroxyurea among GBM pts. Pts will be stratified based on whether they who are receiving EIACD &amp; each stratum will independently dose escalate. Additionally, study will characterize safety, tolerability, biologic activity, &amp; pharmacokinetic profile of this combo therapy.</detailed_description>
