	<brief_summary>Purpose: To study the effects of two different rehabilitation programs for people with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Hypothesis 1: Participants who received Activity Stratgey Training will report less pain and physical disability at 8-weeks and 6-months follow-up. Hypothesis 2: Participants who receive Activity Strategy Training will have a greater increase in physical activity as measured by a wrist-worn accelerometer. Hypothesis 3: Participants who receive Activity Stratgey Training will report greater improvements in health-related quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Plus Activity Strategy Training for Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are testing the effectiveness of a targeted intervention for older adults with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis (LE-OA) using an occupational therapy treatment approach to promote activity engagement. We believe that it is necessary to tailor this intervention to the specific needs of older adults with LE-OA. Based on the literature, exercise is a necessary component of an intervention for older adults with LE-OA. However, this should also be coupled with an Activity Strategy Training (AST) component designed to promote lifestyle changes and thus more lasting effects. The AST component is based on occupational therapy principles and will include behavioral and environmental strategies to increase activity engagement.</detailed_description>
