	<brief_title>Lidocaine and Pain Management in First Trimester Abortions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Investigators intend to conduct a randomized, patient-blinded control trial at Oregon Health and Science University and Planned Parenthood of the Columbia Willamette. Women will be approached about this study after they have made a decision to terminate the pregnancy. The women will be blinded and randomized into one of two study arms. Group 1: the investigator will apply pressure with the capped needle of the paracervical block at the cervical-vaginal reflexion at 4 and 8 o'clock. This will approximate the steps involved in a paracervical block without injecting the patient. Following this, the patient will receive a 5 milliliter intrauterine infusion of 4% lidocaine using a sterile 3mm Novak curette. The infusion will be placed slowly over 3 minutes. Group 2: a standard paracervical block (8 milliliter 1% lidocaine at 4 and 8 o'clock at the cervical-vaginal reflection) will be placed. Following this, a 3 mm Novak curette will be placed in the vagina and held to the external os of the cervix for 3 minutes. The curette will not be placed through the cervix and no infusion will be performed. This will approximate the steps involved in an intrauterine infusion without injecting the patient. During the procedure, women in both groups will be asked to rate their pain at various times using a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS).</detailed_description>
