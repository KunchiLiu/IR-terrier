	<brief_summary>Primary Objective To determine maximum tolerated dose &amp; dose limiting toxicity of Zactima when combined w standard dosing of imatinib mesylate &amp; hydroxyurea among pts w recurrent malignant glioma who are on &amp; not on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs Secondary Objectives To assess safety &amp; tolerability of Zactima + imatinib mesylate &amp; hydroxyurea To evaluate pharmacokinetics of Zactima among MG pts on &amp; not on enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) when combo w imatinib mesylate &amp; hydroxyurea To evaluate pharmacokinetics of imatinib mesylate among MG pts on &amp; not on EIAEDs when combo w Zactima &amp; hydroxyurea Exploratory Objective To evaluate for evidence of anti-tumor activity of study regimen among recurrent malignant glioma (RMG) pts including radiographic response rate, 6-month progression free survival (PFS) rate &amp; median PFS</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph I Zactima + Imatinib Mesylate &amp; Hydroxyurea for Pts w Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) angiogenic &amp; Phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor/Protein Kinase B (PI3K/AKT) mitogenic cascades are 2 upregulated cell signalling pathways in MG that contribute to several hallmark phenotypic features of these tumors. Regimen of Zactima + imatinib mesylate represents novel anti-glioma strategy because it targets 3 key mediators of dysregulated cell signalling involving VEGF &amp; PI3K-AKT pathways including VEGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) &amp; platelet derived growth factor(PDGFR). Furthermore by combining Zactima w imatinib mesylate, VEGF &amp; PI3-k/AKT pathways can potentially inhibit multiple mediators of each of these pathways. Regarding PI3-K/AKT signalling, regimen can inhibit activation of EGFR &amp; PDGFR. Regarding VEGF signalling, regimen has potential to inhibit 3 components of VEGFR directed angiogenesis. 1st, Zactima can directly inhibit VEGFR activation. 2nd, both Zactima &amp; imatinib mesylate can indirectly decrease activity of VEGF pathway by diminishing positive input from activated PI3-K/AKT signalling. 3rd, imatinib mesylate may inhibit PDGF-regulated pericyte maturation of tumor blood vessels. We have previously demonstrated that regimen of imatinib mesylate + hydroxyurea is active regimen among recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) pts. Furthermore this activity appears substantially better than that reported for imatinib mesylate alone. Although mechanism of enhanced activity for imatinib mesylate when combo w hydroxyurea is unclear, it is logical to build upon combo of imatinib mesylate + hydroxyurea in subsequent studies rather than imatinib mesylate alone. Current study will therefore determine MTD of Zactima when combo w standard doses of imatinib mesylate &amp; hydroxyurea among RMG pts. Ph II study will then be performed, incorporating maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Zactima + imatinib mesylate in order to evaluate anti-glioma potential of regimen.</detailed_description>
