	<brief_title>Endometrial Biopsy Instrument Comparison Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Is there a difference in pain perceived by patients undergoing endometrial biopsy via the Pipelle or Explora curette? Currently, the instrument selected for endometrial biopsy is solely dependent on provider preference. This study aims to elucidate advantages and/or disadvantages of the Pipelle versus the Explora curette in terms of pain perceived by the patient, adequacy of sample, and provider ease of use to better aid in the selection of the appropriate device.</detailed_description>
