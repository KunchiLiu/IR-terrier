	<brief_summary>Carperitide (alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide) improves systemic hemodynamics in patients with heart failure through a vasodilatory action, a natriuretic action, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and has been widely-used in Japan. However, a paucity of report is available on the effects of carperitide on short and long-term prognosis in patients with both cardiac and renal failure. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of carperitide therapy on short and long-term prognosis in patients with both cardiac and renal failure, in comparison with standard therapy.</brief_summary>
