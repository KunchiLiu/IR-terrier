	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to learn whether genetics plays a role in predicting response to a commonly used and FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved medication for lowering triglycerides and cholesterol. Our hypothesis: The pharmacogenetics of genes which affect drug metabolism (how the body handles the drug) and drug targets (how the drug acts on the body) influences how a person responds to the lipid lowering medication- fenofibrate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fenofibrate and Pharmacogenetic Impact in Dyslipidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We seek to screen over 200 subjects for select candidate genes to serve as a source of subjects which may participate in a genotype guided investigation as to the predictability of response based on genotype. Response endpoints relate to lipid parameters and other variables of interest to cardiovascular endpoints. Subjects with genotypes of interest would then be enrolled into a short term clinical trial evaluating their response to fenofibrate based on their genetic profile ascertained from the screening phase. We hope to evaluate ~50 subjects in the second phase.</detailed_description>
