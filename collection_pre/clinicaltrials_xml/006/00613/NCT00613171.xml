	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of STI571 for the treatment of fibrosis in patients with systemic sclerosis. Other purposes of the study are to investigate whether STI571 is effective in improving lung functions and other test results called biomarkers. Whether STI571 is well-absorbed in systemic sclerosis patients' gut will also be investigated by testing the drug level in the blood (pharmacokinetics).</brief_summary>
