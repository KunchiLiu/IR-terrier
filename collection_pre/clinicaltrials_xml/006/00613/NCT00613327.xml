	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Oxybutynin Chloride Oral Osmotic Therapeutic System (OROS) in Korean Overactive Bladder Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), prospective (study following participants forward in time) Phase 4 study of oxybutynin chloride OROS in participants with overactive bladder. The total study duration will be 12 weeks and will include following visits: Screening (Week -2), Baseline, Week 2, 4, 6 and 12. Participants will receive oxybutynin chloride OROS tablet at starting dose of 10 milligram (mg) orally once daily. The dose will be adjusted by 10 mg every 2 weeks up to first 6 weeks, based on the criteria for evaluation of optimal dose. The optimal dose obtained in first 6 weeks will be continued up to Week 12. Maximum allowed dose will be 30 mg per day. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by assessment of goal achievement (percentage of participants who show a score 4 or 5 in the Likert scale for treatment goal) at Week 12. Participants' safety will also be monitored at each visit.</detailed_description>
