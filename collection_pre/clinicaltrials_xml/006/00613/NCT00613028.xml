	<brief_summary>Primary objective To estimate 6-month progression free survival probability of pts w recurrent GBM treated w bev + either daily temozolomide/etoposide following progression on bev + irinotecan Secondary Objectives To evaluate safety &amp; tolerability of bev + either daily temozolomide/etoposide among pts w recurrent GBM who have progressed on bev + irinotecan To evaluate radiographic response, progression free survival &amp; overall survival of pts w recurrent GBM treated w bev + either daily temozolomide/etoposide following progression on bev + irinotecan</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph II Bev + Either Temozolomide/Etoposide for GBM Pts Who Have Failed Bev + Irinotecan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is exploratory, two-arm, phase II study designed to assess anti-tumor activity of bev + either daily temozolomide/etoposide among GBM pts w progressive disease following bev + irinotecan. About 48 participants w recurrent GBM will take part in this study. Approximately 24 participants will receive bev plus temozolomide &amp; approximately 24 will receive bev + etoposide. Pts must have confirmed diagnosis of GBM &amp; radiographic evidence of recurrence following prior therapy bev + irinotecan. 24 pts will be enrolled onto each arm of this single-stage study. If 4 or more of these 24 pts live 6/more months without disease progression, treatment regimen will be considered worthy of further investigation. Otherwise, treatment regimen will be determined not worthy of further investigation within pt population. Type I &amp; II error rates associated w testing are 0.030 &amp; 0.115 respectively. Management guidelines dose reduction/interruption for temo, etoposide, &amp; bev.</detailed_description>
