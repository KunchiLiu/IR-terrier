	<brief_title>Misoprostol With Intrauterine Device Insertion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators intend to conduct a randomized double blind study at Oregon Health and Science University and Planned Parenthood of the Columbia Willamette. Subjects will be approached only after deciding to get an intrauterine. When the participants return for intrauterine device placement, at 90 minutes prior to the procedure half will receive misoprostol and half will receive placebo. The subjects will be asked to rate their level of pain at specific points during the insertion. Providers will be asked to mark whether or not additional dilation was required as well as their perceived ease of intrauterine device placement.</detailed_description>
