	<brief_summary>In recent years, more and more people are having lung CT scans performed to screen for various cancers. Many of them have small abnormalities detected, called "nodules", which - for a variety of reasons - doctors are unable to biopsy. As a result, many patients have their CT scans repeated on a regular basis to see if their nodules grow. This process can last several years. Many patients experience significant anxiety during this process, when they are aware of a spot in the lung, but are not told any specific cause. Researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering have developed a new way to look at lung nodules in three dimensions. The purpose of this project is to see if any change in the nodules can be detected sooner by this method than by traditional CT scans.</brief_summary>
