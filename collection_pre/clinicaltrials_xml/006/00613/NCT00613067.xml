	<brief_summary>Amplitude changes of the N1 and the N1/P2 ERP component in response to different tone intensities have been suggested as a correlative of central serotonergic activity. A strong loudness dependence amplitude increase (strong intensity dependence) reflects low serotonergic neurotransmission and vice versa. Many researchers assumed that the brain serotonergic activity could influence treatment response of highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression and anxiety disorders. There are a couple of studies reporting associations of N1 amplitude intensity dependence with response to Citalopram (positive correlation) and Reboxetine (negative correlation) treatment in major depressive disorder patients. But so far there have been no reports about associations between ERP N1 and antidepressant response in GAD patients. So, it would be very interesting to explore the correlations between ERP N1 amplitude change and the Escitalopram treatment responsiveness in GAD patients.</brief_summary>
