	<brief_title>Intrauterine Lidocaine Infusion for Essure Sterilization Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We intend to conduct a randomized, blinded, and placebo- controlled clinical trial at Oregon Health and Science University and Planned Parenthood of the Columbia Willamette to determine if intrauterine lidocaine infusion will decrease the amount of pain subjects experience during and after Essure transcervical tubal sterilization. We plan to enroll women who have selected Essure as their method of tubal sterilization who will be randomized to one of two groups on the days of their procedures. Subjects in Group 1, the treatment group, will receive a standard paracervical block with lidocaine intrauterine infusion and subjects in Group 2, the control group, will receive a standard paracervical block with saline intrauterine infusion. The subjects will be asked to rate their pain on a 100 mm VAS at five points during the procedure and once thirty minutes following the procedure. Subjects will also be asked to rate their overall satisfaction with their care prior to leaving the recovery room.</detailed_description>
