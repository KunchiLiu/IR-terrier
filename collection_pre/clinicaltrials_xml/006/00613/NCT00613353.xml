Following objective measurement of activity, participants will complete self-report and objective activity data, as well as the relationship between sedentary activities and food cravings will be examined. It is hypothesized that minutes of sedentary behavior, especially time spent in television viewing, will be significantly correlated with total and specific food cravings.</brief_summary>
