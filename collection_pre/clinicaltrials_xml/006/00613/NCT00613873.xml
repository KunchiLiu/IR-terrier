	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer is a cancer in the colon or rectum. Routine screening can find it at an early stage, when it has a much higher chance of cure. Screening can also help to find polyps. These are mushroom shaped growths that could turn into cancer. A polyp can be removed before it turns into cancer. Even though screening can save lives, not enough people in the country are having it. This is especially true in Harlem. Harlem has a higher rate of deaths from this cancer than other places in the U.S. because too many people do not get screened. By the time a person has symptoms, the cancer may be at a late stage, when it is much harder to cure. We are doing this study to see if we can increase the number of people in Harlem who get screened. We plan to tell women about the screening when they have a mammogram or pap test. We will also ask them what they know and think about colorectal cancer. And, we will see if they get other members of their household to be screened.</brief_summary>
