	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the ability of EpanovaTM Soft Gelatin Capsules at a total daily dose of 4g (4x 1g capsules) to maintain remission (Crohn's Disease Activity Index CDAI &lt; 150) in CD patients in whom remission, stable for at least three months and no longer than one year, has been induced by corticosteroids, azathioprine/6-MP, methotrexate, 5-ASA or antibiotics. Secondary objectives are to assess the: efficacy of Epanova versus placebo by Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Investigator and Subject Global Ratings, employment status and use of CD related medical visits in subjects with CD in remission safety and tolerability of Epanova ability of Epanova to maintain the quality of life of CD patients in remission</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Male or female subject, age 17 or older; countryspecific age limitations will be followed 2. Diagnosis of Crohn's disease confirmed by radiological studies or endoscopy or surgical pathology within 36 months prior to randomisation 3. In remission for at least 3 months, but no longer than 12 months; remission being defined as meeting both of the two conditions: (1) clinically in remission with a CDAI of less than 150 and (2) off steroids and/or immunosuppressants for at least 3 months, if remission had been induced with such medications 1. Intolerance of omega3 fatty acids or known allergy to fish or fish products 2. Ongoing CD therapy with: 5ASA compounds, steroids, immune modifiers, systemic antibiotics, tube feeding, defined formula diets or parenteral nutrition 3. In 3 months prior to randomisation received: systemic steroid therapy, azathioprine, 6mercaptopurine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, probiotic products or preparations containing fish oil 4. In 12 months prior to randomisation received: biologicals e.g. enbrel, infliximab, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, thalidomide, other immune modifiers and/or investigational products 5. Chronic use of narcotics for pain control (opiates for diarrhoea are acceptable) 6. Documented short bowel syndrome, ostomy 7. Need for bowel surgery for CD, bowel obstruction or resection in past 3 months (a subject who had a bowel resection in the past must have had at least one relapse after the surgery) 8. Malignancy and/or clinically significant impairment in cardiac, liver or renal function, CNS, pulmonary, hematological, immunological, vascular and gastrointestinal disease in addition to CD 9. Known alcoholism or drug abuse 10. Any medical conditions which, in the investigator's opinion, may interfere with the evaluation of the trial medication 11. Any of the following laboratory abnormalities: White blood count &lt; 3 x 109/L Lymphocyte count &lt; 0.5 x 109/L Haemoglobin &lt; 80 g/L Platelet count &lt; 125 x 109/L or &gt; 800 x 109/L ALT or AST &gt; 2.0 times the upper limit of normal Alkaline Phosphatase &gt; 2.0 times the upper limit of normal Serum Creatinine &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal</criteria>
