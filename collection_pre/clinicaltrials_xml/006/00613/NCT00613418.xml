	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, single-arm trial; the primary objective is to assess the comparability of the performance of the IDev SUPERA® nitinol stent to a rate derived from a meta-analysis of studies on iliac stents approved by FDA for treating subjects with de novo or restenotic lesions in the common and/or external iliac arteries.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Subject is 18 years of age or older and of legal age of consent. 2. Subject has lifestyle limiting claudication or rest pain (RutherfordBecker scale 2, 3 or 4). 3. Subject has de novo or restenotic lesions in the common or external iliac artery. 4. Subject has single, bilateral or multiple target lesions that is (are) ≥ 50% stenosed by visual estimate. 5. The target lesion(s) can be successfully crossed with a guide wire and dilated. 6. The target segment of subject's lesion(s) is between 4 and 10 mm in diameter and less than 110 mm in length. 7. Subject has angiographic evidence of a patent femoral outflow artery in the target limb. 8. Subject has provided written informed consent. 9. Subject is able and willing to adhere to the required followup visits and testing through month 36. 10. Subject is able and willing to adhere to the required followup medication regimen 1. Presence of other nontarget arterial lesions requiring treatment within 30 days of the procedure. 2. The target lesion(s) has adjacent, acute thrombus. 3. The target lesion(s) is highly calcified or was previously treated with a stent. 4. Subject has a preexisting target iliac artery perforation or dissection of the target iliac artery prior to initiation of the IDev implant procedure. 5. Subject has an abdominal aortic aneurysm contiguous with the iliac artery target lesion. Subject has a preexisting aneurysm or dissection of the target iliac segment. 6. Subject with aortic or iliac aneurysm that is likely to require repair within the next 9 months. 7. Subject has a postsurgical stenosis and anastomotic suture treatments of the target vessel. 8. Subject has a vascular graft previously implanted in the native iliac vessel. 9. Subject has tissue loss, defined as RutherfordBecker classification category 5 or 6. 10. Subject is unable to accommodate ≥ 7 Fr cat 11. Subject has contrast agent hypersensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated, has a hypersensitivity to nickel, or has intolerance to antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic medications. 12. Subject has history of neutropenia (WBC &lt;3,000/mm3). 13. Subject has coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;80,000/ μL) that has not resolved or has required treatment in the past 6 months. 14. Subject has known bleeding or hypercoagulability disorder or significant anemia (Hb &lt; 8.0 g/dL) that cannot be corrected. 15. Subject has the following laboratory values: 1. international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.5, 2. serum creatinine level greater than 2.5 mg/dL. 16. Subject requires general anesthesia for the procedure. 17. Subject is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the study. 18. Subject has a comorbid illness that may result in a life expectancy of less than 1 year. 19. Subject is participating in an investigational study of a new drug, biologic or device at the time of study screening. NOTE: Subjects who are participating in the long term followup phase of a previously investigational and now FDAapproved product are not excluded by this criterion.</criteria>
