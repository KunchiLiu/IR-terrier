	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to investigate the bioequivalence of Genpharm's clarithromycin tablets following a single, oral 250 mg (1 x 250 mg) dose compared to the Biaxin速 filmtab速 (Abbott Laboratories USA) administered under fasted conditions. Thirty-four (34) healthy, light-, non- or ex-smoking subjects of at least 18 a years of age were randomized, in this four-period, two-treatment crossover bioequivalence study conducted by Eric Sicard, M.D. at Algorithme Pharma Inc. Montreal, Canada. Statistical analysis of the data reveals that 90% confidence intervals are within the acceptable bioequivalent range of 80% and 125% for the natural log transformed parameters AUCT, AUCI and Cmax. This study demonstrates that Genpharm's clarithromycin 250 mg tablets are bioequivalent to Biaxin速 filmtab速 250 mg tablets (Abbott Laboratories USA) administered under fasted conditions.</brief_summary>
