	<brief_title>To Determine if Diphenhydramine Works for Nasal Congestion at Two Different Doses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled into the placebo run-in phase of the study on Day -7 (prerandomization, Visit 1). Baseline symptom scores were established during this run-in phase. Subjects with moderate nasal congestion who took at least 80% of their study medication during the run-in phase were eligible for enrollment in the two-week double-blind phase of the study and were randomized on Day 1 (randomization, Visit 2). They were treated for two weeks with their assigned medication. The severity of signs/symptoms were evaluated by the subjects every morning and night and by the investigator at each visit on Day 7 and Day 14. In addition, the subject and investigator provided a global evaluation of response to treatment on Day 7 and Day 14. Safety was evaluated by adverse events reported during the study, vital signs, and the incidence of somnolence.</detailed_description>
