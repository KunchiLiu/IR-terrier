	<brief_title>A Safety and Tolerability Study of Zerenex (Ferric Citrate) in Patients With End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Zerenex™ (ferric citrate) as a treatment for hyperphosphatemia in patients with End-Stage Renal Disease. These patients will be switched to Zerenex™ from their current high dose of phosphate binder and, based on their serum phosphorus levels, will be titrated up from 3.4g/day of Zerenex™ to maximum tolerated and safe doses of Zerenex™. Doses will be adjusted weekly, based on serum phosphorus levels, with the maximum dose administered being approximately 12g/day.</detailed_description>
