	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if we can prevent Epstein Barr Virus lymphomas by the monthly administration of an (antibody) protein against B lymphocytes called Rituximab. Although this medicine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with other types of lymphomas, and has been used to treat a small number of patients with EBV lymphomas and other types of B-cell leukemias, it has not been approved to try and prevent EBV-lymphomas. Use of Rituximab to try to prevent EBV-lymphomas is therefore experimental.</brief_summary>
