	<brief_summary>EPOMI is a randomized, open-label, parallel phase II clinical study that will evaluate the effects of a single erythropoietin administration on infarct size and cardiac remodeling in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive conventional therapy and single infusion of 1000U/kg of epoetin beta or conventional therapy alone. Infarct size and cardiac remodeling parameters will be assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3-7 days of the randomization and repeated 3 months later.</brief_summary>
