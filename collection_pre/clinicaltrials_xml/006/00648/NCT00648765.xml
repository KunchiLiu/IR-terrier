History of using psychotropic agents within 12 months prior to the initial dose of study medication. 4. Diseases: 1. History of any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic disease. 2. Acute illness at the time of either the prestudy medical evaluation or dosing. 5. Abnormal and clinically significant laboratory test results: 1. Clinically significant deviation from the Guide to Clinically Relevant Abnormalities (See Part II ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS). 2. Abnormal and clinically relevant ECG tracing. 6. Donation or loss of a significant volume of blood or plasma (&gt; 450 mL) within 28 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 7.
