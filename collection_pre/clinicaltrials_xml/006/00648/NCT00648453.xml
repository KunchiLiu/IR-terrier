	<brief_summary>To determine whether in the laser Doppler flowmetric parameters characteristic of endothelial dysfunction at patients with clinically manifest atherosclerosis any change can be detected at plavix (clopidogrel) treatment. Laser Doppler /LD/ measurement combined with iontophoresis evaluates the effect of acetylcholine /ACh/ /endothelium dependent/ and sodium nitroprusside /NSP/ /endothelium independent/ on the microcirculation of the skin</brief_summary>
