This advice should be documented in the informed consent form. 3. Weight: At least 60 kg (132 lbs) for man and 48 kg (106 lbs) for women and all subjects within 15% of Ideal Body Weight (IBW), as referenced by the Table of ""Desirable Weights of Adults"" Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 1999 (See Part II ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS). 4. All subjects should be judged normal and healthy during a prestudy medical evaluation (physical examination, laboratory evaluation, 12lead ECG, hepatitis B and hepatitis C tests, HIV test, and urine drug screen including amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoid, cocaine, opiate screen, phencyclidine, and methadone) performed within 14 days of the initial dose of study medication. 1. Institutionalized subjects will not be used. 2 Social Habits: 1. Use of any tobacco products within 1 year of the start of the study. 2. Ingestion of any alcoholic, caffeine or xanthinecontaining food or beverage within the 48 hours prior to the initial dose of study medication. 3.

Use of any medication known to alter hepatic enzyme activity within 28 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 4. Diseases: a. History of any significant chronic disease and/or hepatitis. b. History of drug and/or alcohol abuse. c. Acute illness at the time of either the prestudy medical evaluation or dosing. d. Positive HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C test. e. Renal disease or renal dysfunction (as suggested by serum creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL (for males) and greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL (for females) or abnormal creatinine clearance). 5. Abnormal and clinically significant laboratory test results: 1. Clinically significant deviation from the Guide for Clinically Relevant Abnormalities (see Part II ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS). 2. Abnormal and clinically relevant ECG tracing. 6. Donation or loss of a significant volume of blood or plasma (&gt; 450 mL) within 28 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 7. Subjects who have received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 8.
