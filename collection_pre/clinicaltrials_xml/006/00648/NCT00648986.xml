	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Tazarotene (Tazorac) for the Treatment of Brittle Nails</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>"Brittle nails," referring to nails that chip, peel, or split excessively, occur in up to 30% of women and 15% of men, with highest prevalence among the elderly. Treatment of brittle nails involves restoration and maintenance of a normal degree of nail plate hydration by minimizing exposure to dehydrating chemicals and by use of moisturizers, such as alpha-hydroxy acids. Retinoids are vitamin A analogs that play a role in skin cell differentiation and proliferation. Tazarotene is a topical receptor-selective synthetic retinoid that normalizes epidermal differentiation and reduces the influx of inflammatory cells into the skin. In this single-center, open-label trial, subjects applied tazarotene to the nails twice daily for 24 weeks. Signs and symptoms were rated by the investigators and subjects during treatment and 12 weeks after discontinuation.</detailed_description>
