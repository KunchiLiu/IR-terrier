	<criteria>1. Age: 18 years and older 2. Sex: Male and/or nonpregnant, nonlactating female a. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (β‑HCG) pregnancy test performed within 21 days prior to the start of the study and on the evening prior to each dose administration. If dosing is scheduled on Sunday or Monday, serum may be collected for the HCG pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to dosing for each study period. An additional serum (β‑HCG) pregnancy test will be performed upon completion of the study. b. Women must practice abstinence or use an acceptable form of contraception throughout the duration of the study. No hormonal contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapies are permitted in this study. Acceptable forms of contraception include the following: 1) intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months prior to the start of the study and remaining in place during the study period, or 2) barrier methods containing or used in conjunction with a spermicidal agent, or 3) surgical sterilization c. Women will not be considered of childbearing potential if one of the following is reported and documented on the medical history: 1) postmenopausal with an absence of menses for at least one (1) year, or 2) bilateral oophorectomy with or without a hysterectomy and an absence of bleeding for at least 6 months, or 3) total hysterectomy d. During the course of the study, from study screen until study exit including the washout period, all men and women of childbearing potential must use a spermicide containing barrier method of contraception in addition to their current contraceptive method. This advice should be documented in the informed consent form. 3. At least 60 kg (132 lbs.) for men and 48 kg (106 lbs.) for women and all subjects within 15% of Ideal Body Weight (IBW), as referenced by the Table of "Desirable Weights of Adults" Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 1999 (See Part II ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS). 4. All subjects should be judged normal and healthy during a prestudy medical evaluation (physical examination, laboratory evaluation, hepatitis B and hepatitis C tests, HIV test, 12lead ECG, and urine drug screen including amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoid, cocaine, opiate screen, phencyclidine, and methadone) performed within 21 days of the initial dose of study medication. 1. Institutionalized subjects will not be used. 2. Social Habits: a. Use of any tobacco products within 1 year prior to dosing. b. Ingestion of any alcoholic, caffeine or xanthinecontaining food or beverage within the 48 hours prior to the initial dose of study medication. c.

Use of any prescription or overthecounter (OTC) medications within the 14 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. b. Use of any hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy within 3 months prior to study medication dosing. c.Use of any medication known to alter hepatic enzyme activity within 28 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 4. Diseases: a. History of any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, or neurologic disease. b. Acute illness at the time of either the prestudy medical evaluation or dosing. c. A positive HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C test. d. Renal disease or renal dysfunction (as suggested by serum creatinine levels ³ 1.5 mg/dL (for males) and ³ 1.4 mg/dL (for females) or abnormal creatinine clearance). 5. Abnormal and clinically significant laboratory test results: a. Clinically significant deviation from the Guide to Clinically Relevant Abnormalities (See Part II ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS). b. Abnormal and clinically relevant ECG tracing. 6. Donation or loss of a significant volume of blood or plasma (&gt; 450 mL) within 28 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 7. Subjects who have received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 8. Allergy or hypersensitivity to metformin hydrochloride, glipizide, sulfonylureas or any related products. 9.
