	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to find out if some people are more likely to get melanoma, a form of skin cancer, than others. People respond to the environment in different ways. Some may be born with genes that make them more likely to get this type of skin cancer. Genes are made up of DNA. DNA damage is one of the first steps in developing cancer. Each person has many ways to repair normal damage to their genes. Some people may have a lower level of this repair and that may make them more likely to get cancer. Some genes are important for DNA repair. The genes we want to test are thought to affect the rate at which DNA can be repaired. We also want to find out if sun habits are related to these levels of DNA repair or genetic mutations.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Cases will be patients 18 years or older with a histologically confirmed, second or multiple primary melanoma. These will be sequentially selected from subjects seen at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center or the Yale University Pigmented Lesion Clinic. Controls will be patients 18 years or older with a histologically confirmed first primary melanoma diagnosed no earlier than 12 months prior to the study start date. One control will be selected per case. These patients will be referred to the study by the Melanoma Disease Management Team at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center. Controls will be frequencymatched to cases on the basis of sex and age (within 10 year age groups). Healthy controls will be subjects 18 years or older recruited from the general population through random digit dialing. These subjects will have no history of melanoma. They will also be frequency matched to cases on the basis of sex and 10year age group. The subject must have a histologically confirmed malignant melanoma. Cases may have an in situ melanoma as the second primary. Melanoma Controls may have only one primary melanoma. Healthy controls should have no history of melanoma. The subject's physician consents to his/her patient's participation in the study (if the subject has a diagnosis of melanoma). The subject has consented, in writing, to participate in the study Karnofsky status less than 60 (see Appendix). This will be evaluated by the physician treating the subject for melanoma at the time permission is given for participation Patient had chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the last 6 weeks.</criteria>
