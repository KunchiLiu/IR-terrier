	<brief_title>An Extension Study Investigating the Efficacy and Safety of a Fast-Dissolving ("Melt") Formulation of Desmopressin for the Treatment of Nocturia in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FE992026 CS31 was a multicenter open-label extension study for patients who were enrolled in Study FE992026 CS29 (NCT00477490) and had completed at least Visit 3E in Part II of that study. The CS29 study was structured into 2 double-blind parts (Part I and Part II). In Part I, the initial 28-day treatment period, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment groups: placebo or desmopressin Melt 10 μg, 25 μg, 50 μg, or 100 μg. Immediately upon completion of Part I of the study, all participants on active treatment continued into Part II on the same treatment for approximately 1 to 6 months. Participants assigned to placebo in Part I were randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 active treatments in Part II, based on re-randomization predetermined at the initial randomization (to maintain the blind). Part II began at the final visit for Part I and continued until the database for Part I was locked. Therefore, treatment duration for Part II varied between 1 and 6 months, depending upon when the participant entered. Upon completion of Part II of CS29, participants were given the option to participate in the open-label extension study (CS31). During CS31, each participant assigned to the 10 μg dose was switched to a higher dose in an open-label manner among the remaining 3 higher doses.</detailed_description>
