	<brief_summary>Researchers have previously demonstrated loss of heterozygosity in a region on chromosome 18q, associated with osteogenic sarcomas in bone affected by Paget's disease. The loci used in this study are specifically described by those authors as showing loss of heterozygosity in 6 of 7 affected families.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>This is a familial study therefore the only inclusion/exclusion criteria would be that subjects must be a blood relative and over the age of 18. The subjects are proband and father along with unaffected blood relatives. Their peripheral blood will act as a control and provide information to delineate the inheritance from the father, as seen in the son. Not part of the family</criteria>
