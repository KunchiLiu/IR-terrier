	<brief_title>A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Manuka Honey for Oral Mucositis Due to Radiation Therapy for Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral mucositis is a common side-effect of radiation therapy for many head and neck cancers, and can have a very severe impact on quality of life and nutritional status. At least42% of patients treated for head and neck cancers will develop grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis. Although there have been positive trials, no study has had overwhelming data to strongly support any one agent in the prevention or treatment of oral mucositis. A comprehensive review of the literature done in 2004 found only benzydamine (a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent) to be beneficial as a palliative treatment for established mucositis. Management essentially consists of pain management, with topical and oral analgesics/anaesthetics and anti-inflammatory agents, and nutritional support, once mucositis is established. Despite the use of these agents, many patients still have severe mucositis, and there is great need for new treatments to reduce this distressing complication of cancer therapy. Currently, the only standard "treatment" consists of an oral rinse of warm water, salt, and baking soda 4 times a day. This is only to maintain oral hygiene and does not have any impact on the severity or duration of the mucositis itself. Topical fluoride is applied at bedtime to reduce the caries risk. Basic oral care (brushing and flossing as tolerated) is recommended to maintain general mucosal health and to reduce the impact of oral microbial flora. Study Objectives The primary objective of this study is to see if topical oral Manuka honey reduces the severity of mucositis in patients receiving radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. Secondary objectives are to assess the impact of any demonstrated improvement in mucositis on nutrition, symptom burden, quality of life, and radiotherapy treatment interruptions.</detailed_description>
