	<brief_title>Pilot Study on Laser Ablation of Symptomatic Benign Thyroid Masses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thyroid nodules are a very common clinical finding, with an estimated prevalence (based on palpation) ranging from 3% to 7% among the general population. With the widespread use of ultrasound (US), clinically unapparent thyroid nodule prevalence has dramatically increased with estimates at 20% to 76% in the general population. Moreover, 20% to 48% of patients with a single palpable thyroid nodule are found to have additional nodules when investigated by US. Laser ablation therapy offer potential for the thermal destruction of soft tissue structures. The ability to deliver large doses of energy via small flexible fiberoptics makes laser therapy ideally suited for percutaneous treatment of unwanted tissue masses. In this study we propose to treat symptomatic soft tissue thyroid masses in the head and neck region using a new FDA-cleard laser ablation system to safely and effectively debulk the tissue and therefore improve symptoms. Real time US monitoring will be performed of the ablation front to ensure complete treatment of the target lesion. All ablated regions will be followed by US with Doppler to document changes in size and vascularity. Local effects on thyroid function for thyroid mass treatment will be measured on follow-up.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically documented benign thyroid nodule, or cold thyroid nodule as documented by thyroid scan. Patient has been evaluated by endocrinology and endocrine surgery and has been deemed suitable candidate for procedure. The patient's nodule(s) size and number must be no larger than 5cm and a maximum of 3 nodules, respectively. All nodules must be greater than 1cm from the expected location of the recurrent laryngeal and vagus nerves determined under ultrasound. Required initial laboratory values: T3, T4. TSH, and Thyroglobulin (for treated metastatic lymph nodes) All patients must understand and sign a studyspecific informed consent. Thyroid mass in contact with trachea or esophagus. Uncontrolled coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis that cannot be corrected with FFP and platelets prior to procedure. (Platelets must be â‰¥ 70,000/ul.) Aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, antiplatelet medications, or warfarin must be discontinued prior to the procedure for a time period that is appropriate given the drug halflife and the drugs known antiplatelet activity (e.g. aspirin for 7 days and ibuprofen 24 hours). Low molecular weight heparin preparations must be discontinued 24 hours prior to procedure.</criteria>
