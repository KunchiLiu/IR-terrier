	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether using an additional 48 hours of oral naproxen, after other post-operative pain medications have been stopped, will be effective in reducing opiate pain medication requirements and contribute to improved pain management.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Naproxen for Acute Pain After Surgery: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, the Acute Pain Service (APS) is responsible for the immediate post-operative pain management of many surgical inpatients. While cared for by APS, the patient receives multimodal analgesia, including adjunctive medications (acetaminophen and naproxen/ketorolac) scheduled around the clock. When APS discontinues the epidural/pain pump, all adjunctive medications are discontinued and the patient is usually started on 'as needed' opiate or combination opiate (i.e. Tylenol#3) medications. On occasion, APS will write an order for an additional 48 hours of naproxen, but this practice has not been formally evaluated at this site. This randomized, placebo-controlled study proposes to evaluate this bridging strategy to see if regularly scheduled naproxen after discontinuation of other post-operative medications will affect the daily doses of opiate pain medications used, side effects of those opiate medications and pain scores of patients.</detailed_description>
