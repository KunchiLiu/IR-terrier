	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if DiaPep277 can effectively protect the internal production of insulin in patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, by stopping the immune destruction of insulin-producing beta-cells in the pancreas. DiaPep277 acts on the immune system and is expected to prevent further destruction of the beta-cells by stimulating regulatory responses, without causing immunological suppression.</brief_summary>
