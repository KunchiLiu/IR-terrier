	<brief_title>Study of the Large Diameter GORE EXCLUDER速 AAA Endoprosthesis in Abdominal Aneurysms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study was to estimate the safety of the 31 mm GORE EXCLUDER速 AAA Endoprosthesis as compared to open surgical repair when used in the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms. A secondary objective was to compare device performance of the original GORE EXCLUDER速 AAA Endoprosthesis to the 31mm EXCLUDER when used in the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms.</detailed_description>
