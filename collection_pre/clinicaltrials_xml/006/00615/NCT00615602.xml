	<brief_title>Six vs 12 Months of Trastuzumab With Docetaxel Following FEC as Adjuvant Treatment in N+ Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anthracycline-containing regimens are recommended as adjuvant treatment for women with node positive breast cancer. In at least three large randomized clinical trials the addition or sequential administration of a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) to an antracycline-based regimen resulted in superior clinical outcome for women with node positive early breast cancer. In two large randomized studies the dose dense administration with G-CSF support of anthracycline-based and paclitaxel combination was superior to the same regimen administered every three weeks without growth factors as adjuvant therapy in women with axillary node positive breast cancer. In one randomized trial, docetaxel was proved superior to paclitaxel in women with metastatic breast cancer. Trastuzumab (anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody) in combination with paclitaxel was superior to paclitaxel alone in women with metastatic breast cancer overexpressing HER2</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women with histologicallyconfirmed unilateral invasive ductal or lobular breast adenocarcinoma HER2/cneu over expression should be documented by either immunohistochemistry (score 3+) or FISH/CISH positivity. A score of 2+ by immunohistochemistry is acceptable only if FISH/CISH positive Within 60 days after the surgical excision of the primary tumor with tumorfree operation margins; at least 10 axillary lymph nodes have to be removed. Tumor involvement of at least one axillary lymph node (N0 with HER2/cneu over expression are also eligible) Absence of any clinical or radiological evidence of local or metastatic disease Premenopausal or postmenopausal women aged 1875 years old Adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count &gt;1500/mm3, platelet count &gt;100.000/mm3, hemoglobin &gt;10gr/mm3) Adequate liver (bilirubin &lt;1.0 times upper limit of normal and SGOT/SGPT &lt;2.5 times upper limit of normal) and renal function (creatinine &lt;1.5mg/dl) Adequate cardiac function (LVEF&gt;50%). Normal electrocardiogram and absence of significant heart disease Written informed consent Positive pregnancy test. Psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study compliance. Other concurrent uncontrolled illness. Prior or concurrent antineoplastic therapy e.g. hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biological agents. Previous history of other invasive malignancy other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer.</criteria>
