	<brief_summary>Clinical effect and tolerability of atorvastatin versus placebo in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension: double-blinded, randomised, prospective phase II study for 6 months with adjusted doses of Atorvastatin</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atorvastatin in Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PAH is characterized by dyspnea, fatigue, and lower extremity edema as a result of heart failure. Several research have proved that inflammation may participate in the pathogenesis of PAH. As atorvastatin inhibits inflammation and has beneficial effects on blood vessels in other types of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, atorvastatin may similarly benefit patients with PAH. Experimental data suggest that statins attenuates pulmonary hypertension in animal experiments. In addition, non-controlled clinical studies suggest that atorvastatin is effective and safe in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive 6 months of daily placebo tablets or daily atorvastatin in a double-blind fashion. The study will compare the safety and efficacy of placebo and atorvastatin.</detailed_description>
