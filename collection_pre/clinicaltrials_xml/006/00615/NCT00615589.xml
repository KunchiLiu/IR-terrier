	<brief_summary>Standard therapy for multiple myeloma (MM) usually includes an autologous bone marrow stem cell transplant - a procedure where the patient is treated with high dose chemotherapy and then their own (autologous) stem cells are transplanted back into their body. Patients with multiple myeloma and high risk genes, always relapse after an autologous transplant and often die within two years from the time of their transplant. A different type of transplant allogeneic) using donor cells, may work better for high-risk Multiple Myeloma, because the donor cells may help kill the lymphoid cancer cells. This study will investigate if a matched donor stem cell transplant using a newer, reduced toxicity, chemotherapy (Flu-Bu4) is a feasible option for patients with high risk, Multiple Myeloma.</brief_summary>
