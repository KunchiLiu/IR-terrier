	<brief_summary>Since 1980, the number of people in the United States diagnosed with asthma has increased dramatically. Studying what causes and triggers asthma is an important part of understanding and subsequently managing this disease. Although some have suggested that alcohol consumption may affect asthma, little is known about how consistent alcohol use affects the amount of inflammation present in the lungs and whether consistent alcohol use makes the airways more narrow and stiff. Participation in this study involves 2 visits in order to complete questionnaires, various pulmonary function tests, as well as the collection of blood, urine, and exhaled breath condensate specimens. This study includes optional genetic and bronchoscopy substudies.</brief_summary>
