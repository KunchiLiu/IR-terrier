	<brief_summary>Primary objective: - To evaluate activity of imatinib mesylate and hydroxyurea among patients with progressive/recurrent grade II low-grade glioma (LGG) as measured by 12-month progression free survival Secondary objectives: - To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival and objective response rate among patients with progressive/recurrent grade II LGG treated with imatinib mesylate plus hydroxyurea - To assess safety and tolerability of imatinib mesylate + hydroxyurea in this population</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Imatinib + Hydroxyurea in Treatment of Patients With Recurrent/Progressive Grade II Low-Grade Glioma (LGG)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, single stage, uncontrolled, non-randomized Phase II study of continuous, daily doses of imatinib mesylate &amp; hydroxyurea in adult patients with progressive/recurrent Grade II low-grade glioma (LGG). The treatment cycle is defined as imatinib mesylate &amp; hydroxyurea administered daily for 28 days for purpose of scheduling evaluations. All patients who receive 1 or more doses of either imatinib mesylate or hydroxyurea will be evaluable for toxicity, whereas all patients who receive a minimum of 14 consecutive days of study regimen will be evaluable for response. Patients who discontinue therapy prior to receiving 14 consecutive days of study regimen will be regarded as ineligible for evaluation of response and will be replaced.</detailed_description>
