	<brief_title>Far Forward Battlefield Telemedicine: Evaluation of Handheld Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific aims to meet to improve the survival of battlefield trauma are 1)validation of portable ultrasound for diagnosis of various medical and surgical emergencies, ie cardiac tamponade, intraabdominal hemorrhage, 2)Extension of our expertise in digital echocardiography and local telemedicine to support other centers in such procedures as TEE 3)development of wireless telemedicine systems for rapid relay of ultrasonic images from portable ultrasound system to a remote review station. 4)development of a precision guide for diagnostic and therapeutic percutaneous procedures using ultrasound guidance 5)combining wireless telemetry with the guided percutaneous access tool to permit remotely guided emergency procedures 6)augmenting this work(2D/echo) with 3D/echo.</detailed_description>
