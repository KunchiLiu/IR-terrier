	<criteria>Females aged ≥ 18 years Patients appropriate for palliative firstline, mono chemotherapy with capecitabine Histological or cytological confirmed, noninflammatory metastatic breast cancer Availability of paraffinembedded tumor tissue from the primary resection or biopsy of a metastatic lesion. HER2negative breast cancer Complete staging within 2 weeks prior to randomization (4 weeks for bone scan). Radiologically confirmed disease ECOG performance status of ≤ 2 Ability to understand and willingness to voluntarily sign and date a written informed consent form before screening Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 3 days before first study drug for women of childbearing potential. Use of effective contraception during the study and for 3 months after stopping study drug treatment. Normal organ and marrow function as defined by laboratory parameters (obtained within the screening period) within the following limits: neutrophils &gt;= 1.5 x 109/L; platelets &gt;= 100 x 109/L; hemoglobin &gt;= 9.0 g/dL (5.6 mmol/L). total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ALT &lt;= 2.5 x ULN (&lt; 5.0 x ULN for patients with liver metastases); serum creatinine &lt;= 2 x ULN, or calculated creatinine clearance &gt;45 mL/min according to Cockroft and Gault formula). Endocrine therapy completed within 2 weeks before the start of treatment (i.e. previous hormone therapy is allowed provided that there is a washout period of 2 weeks). Prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy for metastatic disease. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the start of treatment. Other anticancer treatment (e.g. hormones) within 2 weeks before the start of treatment. Treatment within 12 months with adjuvant 5FU containing chemotherapy (regarded as indicating 5FU resistance) and/or prior capecitabine therapy. Radiation therapy. Palliative radiation of stable, nontarget lesions more than 2 weeks before the start of treatment is allowed, provided patients have recovered from the radiation sideeffects. History of or radiological evidence of brain metastasis including previously treated, resected or asymptomatic brain lesions or leptomeningeal involvement. Active seizure disorder or history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic (TI) attack within the past 12 months. History of other malignancy within the last 3 years except for surgically cured nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ. Active cardiac disease e.g. unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction (MI) within the preceding 6 months. Any medical condition prohibiting standard imaging procedures Pregnant or breastfeeding. Any unrelated illness, e.g. active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, inflammation, medical condition or laboratory abnormalities, which in the judgment of the investigator might significantly affect patients' study participation. Any surgical or medical condition that might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of either study drug. Known hepatitis B/C or HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection.</criteria>
