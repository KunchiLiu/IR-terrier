	<brief_summary>Objective: To investigate whether patients undergoing aquatic physiotherapy in groups improve their functional capacity, by means of the distance covered in the six-minute walk test (6WT), and to compare this with a control group. Methods: Forty women that had not been practicing regular physical activity for one year were randomly allocated either to the Study Group (SG) to undergo an aquatic physiotherapy program in groups applied twice a week, including aerobic exercises, muscle strengthening and relaxation for 12 weeks, or to the Control Group (CG), which did not do any physical activity. Both groups maintained their treatment with medications. All patients underwent two evaluations: one at the start and the other after 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
