	<brief_summary>Fast track programs have been introduced in many surgical fields to minimize postoperative morbidity and mortality. Morbidity after elective open infrarenal aneurysm repair is as high as 30%, mortality ranges up to 10%. In terms of open infrarenal aneurysm repair no randomized controlled trials exist to introduce and evaluate such patient care programs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fast Track Management in Elective Open Infrarenal Aortic Aneurysm Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective randomization of patients admitted with infrarenal aortic aneurysm who undergo elective open repair in a "traditional" and "fast track" treatment arm. Main differences consist in preoperative bowel washout (none vs. 3L cleaning solution) and analgesia (patient controlled analgesia vs. patient controlled epidural analgesia: PCA vs. PCEA). Study endpoints are morbidity and mortality, need for postoperative mechanical ventilation and length of stay (LOS) on intensive care unit (ICU).</detailed_description>
