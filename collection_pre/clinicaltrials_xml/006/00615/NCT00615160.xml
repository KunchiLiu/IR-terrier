	<brief_summary>To evaluate the efficacy of PTK-ZK on metastatic melanoma either as a single agent treatment or in combination with standard chemotherapy according to RECIST criteria. Further to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PTK-ZK in patients with metastatic melanoma either as a single agent treatment or in combination with standard chemotherapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PTK/ZK in Disseminated Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PTK-ZK in the treatment of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma who do not qualify for surgical resection: - progressive locoregionary disease not to be controlled by surgical measures - distant metastasis other than brain metastasis not eligible for surgical resection or radiotherapy All patients will be treated with PTK-ZK 1250mg administered orally once a day for treatment cycles of 28 days. In case of unacceptable toxicity the dose can be reduced to 1000 mg and further on to 750 mg daily. Patients in Arm B additionally receive intravenous DTIC 850mg/m² on day 1 of each cycle. After informed consent is given by the patient a biopsy from a metastasis should be taken before the first intake of study medication and at the end of cycle 2 to specify markers of angiogenesis and MVD (Micro vessel density).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed nonresectable metastatic melanoma Stage III or IV (AJCC 2002) including patients with unknown primary melanoma, Progressive disease, defined as an increase of tumour volume according to RECIST criteria, within the last 6 months, Fulfilling the minimum RECIST requirements for evaluation of tumor response, At least two cutaneous or soft tissue lesions that can be biopsised prior to and after treatment, respectively, Able to undergo either contrastenhanced CT scan or contrastenhanced MRI scan for tumor assessment, Life expectancy greater than 3 months, ECOG performance status &lt;2, Age &gt; 18 years, Able to swallow and retain intact investigational drug tablets, Willingness and ability to adhere to the study requirements as outlined in the protocol, Agreement to use a highly effective method of birth control throughout the study period and 3 months thereafter for sexually active males and females of childbearing potential. Barrier contraceptives must be used throughout the trial. Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study. Able to provide informed consent. One or more previous systemic therapies for metastatic melanoma, excluding prior systemic therapy given for highrisk primary tumor, lymph node metastasis, or other regional (AJCC stage III) disease spread as postoperative adjuvant therapy. Anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, vaccines, immunotherapy, and hormone therapy) delivered within 4 weeks prior to the 1st dose of study drug, and 2 weeks prior for palliative "spot" radiotherapy to bone metastases), History of uveal melanoma, Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test 48 hours prior to administration of study treatment.

Myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months prior to randomization Acute or chronic liver disease (i.e., hepatitis, cirrhosis) Uncontrolled high blood pressure, history of labile hypertension, or history of poor compliance with an antihypertensive regimen Chronic renal disease, i.e. Creatinine &gt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR Proteinuria based on dip stick reading positive &gt; +1 OR if the dip stick result is +1, total urinary protein &gt; 500 mg and measured creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min from a 24hour urine collection Haemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL (patients may be transfused to achieve Hb &gt; 9 g/dL) Other uncontrolled concomitant condition, including but not limited to: ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled diabetes, seizure disorder Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, or other conditions that compromise the patient's ability to understand the patient information, to give informed consent, to comply with the trial protocol, or to complete the study Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, Prior enrollment into this study.</criteria>
