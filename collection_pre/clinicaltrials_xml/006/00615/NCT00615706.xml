	<brief_summary>In the United States there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people who are obese and in the number of people who have asthma. Both are considered serious public health concerns. Several studies have shown that becoming obese or overweight can increase the risk of developing asthma or can make asthma symptoms more severe and difficult to control. How obesity affects asthma is not fully understood. This research study will examine whether obesity affects the amount of inflammation that is present in the lungs of people with asthma, and will also examine whether obesity leads to narrow and stiff airways. Participation in this study involves 2 visits in order to complete questionnaires, various pulmonary function tests, as well as the collection of blood, urine, and exhaled breath condensate specimens. This research study includes optional genetic and bronchoscopy substudies.</brief_summary>
