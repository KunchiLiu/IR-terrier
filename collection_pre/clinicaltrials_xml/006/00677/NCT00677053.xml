	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of TAK-442 in Subjects With Acute Coronary Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute coronary syndrome, including myocardial infarction with or without ST-segment elevation and stable or unstable angina, is acknowledged to represent collectively a major global healthcare problem. Despite existing treatments, the rates of patient mortality, myocardial infarction and hospital readmissions during follow-up remain very high. Due to its critical role in propagating the blood coagulation cascade, activated factor X now is considered to be a major therapeutic target in the development of novel antithrombotic therapy by blocking thrombin generation and attenuating the formation of fibrin. Therefore, activated factor X inhibitors, exhibiting either indirect or direct modes of action, are among the novel agents under investigation in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome. This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of TAK-442 compared with placebo in post-acute coronary syndrome subjects who are also receiving standard antiplatelet and other cardiovascular therapy. Individuals who want to participate in this study will be required to provide written informed consent. Study participation is anticipated to be approximately 3.5 months. Multiple procedures will occur at each visit which may include fasting, blood collection, urine collection, physical examinations, electrocardiograms and bilateral venogram.</detailed_description>
