	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC, in order to evaluate the value of adjuvant chemotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients presented with non-keratinizing NPC and stage T3-4N1M0/TxN2-3M0 are randomly assigned to receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy (investigational arm)or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (control arm). Patients in both arms receive radical radiotherapy and cisplatin (40mg/m2 on day 1) weekly during radiotherapy. Patients in the investigational arm receive cisplatin (80mg/m2 on day 1) and fluorouracil (800mg/m2 on Day 1 to 5) every four weeks for three cycles after completion of radiotherapy. Patients are stratified according to the treatment centers. The primary end point was failure-free survival (FFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), distant failure-free survival (D-FFS), locoregional failure-free survival (LR-FFS), the initial response rates after treatments, toxic effects and treatment compliance. All efficacy analyses were conducted in the intention-to-treat population; the safety population included only patients who received their randomly assigned treatment.</detailed_description>
