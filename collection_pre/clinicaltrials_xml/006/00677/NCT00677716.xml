	<brief_summary>Cotara® is an experimental new treatment that links a radioactive isotope (iodine 131) to a targeted monoclonal antibody. This monoclonal antibody is designed to bind tumor cells and deliver radiation directly to the center of the tumor mass while minimizing effects on normal tissues. Cotara® thus literally destroys the tumor "from the inside out". This may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme, a malignant type of brain cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Confirmation Study of Cotara for the Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme at First Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To confirm the safety and tolerability of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of 131I-chTNT-1/B MAb given as a single interstitial infusion in patients with glioblastoma multiforme at first relapse. To estimate overall survival, progression free survival and proportion of patients alive at six months after treatment.</detailed_description>
