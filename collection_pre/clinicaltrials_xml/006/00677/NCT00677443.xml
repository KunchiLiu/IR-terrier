	<brief_summary>Primary objective : To compare the combination of S-1 and oxaliplatin(SOX) to the combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin(COX) therapy for advanced or metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Secondary objectives : 1. To evaluate and compare the efficacy (overall survival and response rate) in the two treatment groups. 2. To evaluate and compare the quality of life of the patients and safety profiles of the two treatment groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of S-1 and Oxaliplatin (SOX) Versus Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin (COX) in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The urgent need for new effective therapy with better safety profile for metastatic colorectal cancer patients and promising results observed so far in trials with S-1 combined with oxaliplatin in gastrointestinal cancer including colorectal cancer strongly warrants the comparison of S-1 combined with oxaliplatin to capecitabine combination with oxaliplatin acknowledged as a standard regimen in a first-line treatment for advanced colorectal cancer patients. - Recently, a Phase I study was completed, indicating recommended dose as S-1 100 mg/m2/day1-14 and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2/day1), repeated every 3 weeks. However, in the phase II study using the above recommended dose, delayed toxicities of thrombocytopenia and anemia were observed. These delayed toxicities were also reported in a phase II study using S-1 90 mg/m2/day plus oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2/day1 in advanced gastric cancer. At 2007 GI ASCO, the interim data of S-1(80 mg/m2/day1-14) plus oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2/day1) combination, repeated every 3 weeks, was presented, showing promising antitumor activity with favourable safety profile. Among 18 patients, there were only two patients with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and one with Grade 3 neutropenia. Response rate was 57.1 % and disease control rate was 92.9 %. Considering these results and Japanese data which showed that enhanced efficacy was not observed with S-1 over 90 mg/m2/day and oxaliplatin combination, S-1 80 mg/m2/day 1-14 and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2/D1, repeated every 3 weeks, will be tested in this study.</detailed_description>
