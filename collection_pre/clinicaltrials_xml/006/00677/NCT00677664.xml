	<brief_title>Effects of Copaxone in the Retinal Function in Diabetic Patients After Panphotocoagulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of Copaxone (Glatiramer acetate) injections in the nerve fiber layer thickness and retinal function in diabetic patients who underwent panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). Study Design: Double- Masked Randomized Clinical Trial. The follow up period estimated is 12 months after the last PRP section. Patients enrollment: Thirty patients with severe nonproliferative or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy and no previous laser treatment were enrolled. They were divided into two groups: "A" which received Copaxone or "B"which received mannitol (placebo) using a block randomization. Both drugs were offered by subcutaneous administration one week prior and in the three sections of PRP, one per week. All patients received and signed a written inform consent approved by the research ethics committee of UNIFESP. Chronogram: All patients received a full ophthalmic examination (best-corrected Log-Mar visual acuity, slit lamp examination, applanation tonometry, fundus biomicroscopy and indirect fundus examination); functional examination (Humphrey 24-2 SITA STANDARD visual field, Electroretingrams and FDT C-20 strategy visual field) and anatomic examination (Color digital photography and fluorescein angiography (FAG), GDX- VCC, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Heidelberg Retinal Tomography (HRT) before PRP and 1st,3rd,6th months and 1 year after laser, or whenever needed for clinical reasons.</detailed_description>
