	<brief_summary>The values of laboratory examinations which are useful for the diagnoses of appendicitis are white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte blood sedimentation rate (ESR). However up to date there is no laboratory marker for the pre-operative diagnosis of appendiceal perforation in acute appendicitis. Recently hyperbilirubinaemia has been associated with appendiceal perforation. Aim of this retrospective study is therefore to investigate if hyperbilirubinaemia has a diagnostic value for the pre-operative diagnosis of appendiceal perforation in patients with appendicitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Value of Hyperbilirubinaemia as a Predictive Factor for Appendiceal Perforation in Acute Appendicitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We identified 538 patients with histologically proved acute appendicitis who underwent laparoscopic or conventional appendicectomy between January, 2004 and December, 2007 in a surgical department of an academic teaching hospital. A retrospective multiple chart review of the medical records including laboratory values (bilirubin, CRP, white blood count) and histological results was conducted.</detailed_description>
