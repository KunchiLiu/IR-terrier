	<brief_summary>The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of iniparib (BSI-201/SAR240550) in patients with breast cancer gene-associated (BRCA) ovarian cancer. Up to 35 patients were to be treated using a Simon 2-stage optimal design, i.e. twelve were to be treated in a first stage, then if 2/12 patients responded to treatment as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST), 23 additional patients were be treated in the second stage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Arm Study of BSI-201 in Patients With BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 Associated Advanced Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants were treated for at least one 8-week cycle, with additional cycles as long as they had stable or responding disease (per RECIST criteria) and wished to remain on study. Participants had a final follow-up visit within 4 weeks following the last dose of iniparib, after which time they were contacted by study staff every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months thereafter to assess disease status and survival.</detailed_description>
