	<brief_title>Use of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to Study Brain Activation in Children With Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our first aim is to compare the brain areas activated rectal stimulation in boys and girls with IBS and healthy children. Our second aim is to compare the anatomic regions of the brain activated during rectal stimulation in pre and post-pubertal male and female subjects between 10-18 yrs of age.</detailed_description>
