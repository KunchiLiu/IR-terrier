	<brief_summary>This study assesses the intervention with antifibrotic agents, specifically interferon (IFN) to reduce the magnitude and duration of hypertrophic scar. Burn patients with hypertrophic scar are randomly assigned to either an intervention IFN group or a placebo control group by subcutaneous injection three times a week. Patients are assessed using cutometer, mexameter, standardized photography, urinalysis, blood work, tissue biopsies and the Vancouver Burn Scar Assessment (VBSA) which rates selected HTS based on color, vascularity, height, pliability, itchiness and pain sensitivity. Once on treatment patients are assessed monthly for the six month treatment period.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Burn patients being followed and treated in the Outpatient Burn Clinic with large areas of HTS are approached to participate in the study. Patients who agree to participate and who have signed an informed consent are entered into the trial. Pre-treatment evaluation and monthly examinations include: - standardized photographs of scar - scar volume - Vancouver Burn Scar Assessment (VBSA) - blood work (TGF-beta, histamine) - urine collection (histamine) - 6mm punch biopsy of HTS and adjacent normal skin (every two months) Patients are randomized to received with placebo or Intron A 1x106 IU a day for 7 days, then 3x106 IU 3 SC, three times a week for 23 weeks.</detailed_description>
