	<criteria>Patient is 40 years of age or older. If female, patient is either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy), or is of childbearing potential and practicing one of the following methods of birth control: condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm or intrauterine device (IUD) contraceptives (oral or parenteral) for three months prior to study drug administration),a vasectomized partner, total abstinence from sexual intercourse If patient is female and of childbearing potential, the results of a serum pregnancy test performed at Screening, prior to the first dose of adalimumab, must be negative. Patient has a diagnosis of OA of the index knee according to American College of Rheumatology criteria, including radiological evidence of OA (KellgrenLawrence grades 2 or 3). Patient has had continual pain for at least 6 months prior to inclusion in the study. This includes pain that has persisted despite conventional treatment, defined as any one of the following medications taken daily during the preceding month:acetaminophen (2 4 grams per day)maximum tolerated and recommended doses of an NSAID, acetaminophen/codeine combination (i.e. Tylenol No 2, 3, 4) taken at least 3 times daily Patient has had daily knee pain for the month preceding study enrolment. Patient has a summed pain score of 125400mm (visual analog scale) on the WOMAC pain subscale in the index (more symptomatic) knee. Patient has clinical evidence of a knee effusion in the index (more symptomatic) knee at Screening and Baseline. Subject has a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to constituents of Adalimumab. Patient has a history of proven systemic arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis. Patient has a concurrent medical or arthritic condition that could confound evaluation of the index joint e.g. posttraumatic or any secondary form of knee OA Patient has predominant patellofemoral disease</criteria>
