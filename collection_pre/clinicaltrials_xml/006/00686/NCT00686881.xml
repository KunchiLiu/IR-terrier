	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of peginterferon alfa-2b (PegIFN-2b) monotherapy administered at a dose of 0.5 ug/kg vs stronger neo minophagen C (SNMC) in participants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and liver fibrosis (Metavir fibrosis score of F2 and F3) who were previously treated with interferon. The trial will evaluate the effect of treatment on the progression of liver fibrosis, liver inflammation, and liver function. Treatment will be administered for up to 156 weeks with a 4-week follow-up.</brief_summary>
