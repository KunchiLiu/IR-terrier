	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 mcg/kg/week administered for 52 weeks (wk) in previously untreated participants coinfected with hepatitis virus B and D. After 52-week treatment and 52-week follow-up, the virologic, biochemical, and histological response will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
