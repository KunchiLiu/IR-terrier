	<brief_summary>This trial is part of a larger, longitudinal study of symptoms that occur in the breast surgical scar area and/or ipsilateral arm following breast cancer surgery. Women who develop pain in the breast scar area or ipsilateral arm will be randomized to a placebo patch or a lidocaine patch that they will wear on a daily basis for 12 weeks. We hypothesize that women who wear the lidocaine patch will report a decrease in pain and decreased interference with function compared to women who wear the placebo patch.</brief_summary>
