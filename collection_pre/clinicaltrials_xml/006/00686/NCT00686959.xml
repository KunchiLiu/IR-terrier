	<criteria>Participants must have Stage IIIA or IIIIB NSCLC of the nonsquamous type Participants must have measureable tumor lesions according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines or disease that can be evaluated on computerized tomography (CT) scan Participants must be physically mobile, take care of themselves and must be up and about and able to perform light activities, such as light housework or office work Participants must be 18 years of age or older Participants must have lost no more than 10% of their body weight in the previous 3 months Women must be sterile, postmenopausal, or on contraception, and men must be sterile or on contraception Participants' test results assessing the function of their blood forming tissue, kidneys, liver, and lungs must be satisfactory Participants with Stage IIIB NSCLC who have supraclavicular nodal involvement may be entered into this study. However, participants with cervical nodes are not permitted. The upper border of supraclavicular nodes must not extend above the upper border of the lateral end of the clavicle, extended medially. Participants cannot have other ongoing (uncontrolled) illnesses, including active infections, recent heart problems, or psychiatric illnesses Participants who are unable to take vitamins (including injections of vitamin B12) or oral cortisone medication Participants who have had a heart attack (myocardial infarction) or other cardiac issues within 6 months of the trial Participants who have received other investigational drugs within the last 30 days Participants who are unable to stop taking more than 1.3 grams of aspirin on a daily basis or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents Participants who have diseases considered for surgical treatment as part of their care plan, such as Pancoast or superior sulcus tumors Participants who had prior thoracic radiation. However, other prior radiotherapy is allowed. Participants must have recovered from the toxic effects of the treatment prior to study enrollment. Participants may not have received whole pelvis radiation or radiation to more than 25% of their bone marrow. Prior radiotherapy must have been completed at least 30 days prior to study treatment. Participants who have a radiation treatment plan that would expose more than 35% of the volume of their lung to 20 gray (Gy) or more of radiation Participants who have concurrent cancer from another primary site requiring treatment of any kind within the past 5 years. Exemptions to this will be permitted on a casebycase basis after prior approval by the Sponsor physician or designate if the investigator believes the participant's risk of recurrence and death is very low. Curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of any origin is allowed. Participants with recurrence of a previously resected lung cancer or who have a second primary lung cancer are ineligible.</criteria>
