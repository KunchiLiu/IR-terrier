	<brief_summary>Swimmers show the highest prevalence of asthma among elite athletes, certainly due to chlorine exposure. The consequences of a chronic exposure to chlorine compounds by swimmers and the mechanisms of asthme in this population are still poorly documented. Specific diagnostic criteria have been proposed by the International Olympic Committee - Medical Council (IOC-MC) and World anti-doping agency (WADA) to determine the presence of asthma in athletes. Using the more specific bronchial provocation tests, our aims are 1. to compare the prevalence of asthma in swimmers and control subjects 2. to analyze the Influence of chlorine exposure on bronchial inflammatory processes in swimmers versus control subjects 3. to study the time-course of changes in airway symptoms, responsiveness, inflammation and remodeling after cessation of training</brief_summary>
