	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to provide open-label vicriviroc to HIV treatment-experienced subjects who successfully completed 48 weeks of treatment on ACTG protocol A5211 (or who responded favorably to treatment but discontinued participation due to viral tropism shifts), and subjects who screened for ACTG A5211 and met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, but were unable to enroll due to protocol closure. Vicriviroc will be administered in combination with an optimized background antiviral regimen, chosen by the investigator based on results of genotype and phenotype testing, the subject's history of prior antiretroviral drug use, and drug toxicity. OBT must include at least 3 antiviral drugs (not including vicriviroc), 1 of which is a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor.</brief_summary>

Subjects must also be on a ritonavircontaining antiretroviral regimen at entry, and have acceptable hematologic and laboratory parameters. Female subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use 2 reliable methods of contraception, including a barrier method, and must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to dosing. History of seizure or drug use that increases risk of seizure, current use of CYP3A4 inducers, prior history of malignancy, active drug or alcohol use or dependence that would interfere with study requirements Females who are breastfeeding, pregnant, or plan to become pregnant Participation in a clinical trial with another investigational drug. Subjects with serious illness requiring systemic therapy and/or hospitalization must not begin VCV (if not already on VCV) until subject completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy for at least 14 days prior to enrollment.</criteria>
