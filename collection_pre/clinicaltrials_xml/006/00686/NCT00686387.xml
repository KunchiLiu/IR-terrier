	<detailed_description>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary Brain and Spinal Tumor in adults. It is nearly uniformly fatal, with a median survival of approximately one year, despite modern treatment modalities. Efforts to understand why some patients live longer or shorter than the average may provide insights into the biology of these neoplasms. For years, researchers have tried to identify independent predictors that could help in treatment planning. With the recent interest in molecular biology and molecular genetics, tumor markers are now being examined as potential predictors. A marker that could predict tumor response to therapy, the likelihood of recurrence, and survival would thus be quite useful.</detailed_description>
