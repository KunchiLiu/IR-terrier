	<brief_summary>Subjects will be given 3 infusions of infliximab according to the label at week 0, 2, and 6. Subjects will be followed for a maximum of 18 weeks or until relapse. This study will assess the ability of the Power Doppler Ultrasonography (PDUS) to be a reliable marker of enthesitis response and relapse in subjects treated with infliximab.</brief_summary>
