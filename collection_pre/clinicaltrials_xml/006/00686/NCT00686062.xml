	<brief_summary>This is a randomized study of an interactive, computerized descision-assisting tool for prenatal testing decision making (PT Tool) versus standard educational booklets distributed to all pregnant women by the State of California (control). We hypothesize that, compared to controls, women randomized to view PT Tool will have greater knowledge about prenatal testing and its potential outcomes and better risk comprehension, and that they will be more satisfied with the intervention and have lower decisional conflict.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Decision Assisting Tool for Prenatal Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will evaluate the tool in a randomized controlled trial among 500 patients receiving prenatal care at one of the obstetrics clinics and practices affiliated with the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), Kaiser San Francisco, or California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC). After completing a baseline questionnaire, participants will be randomized to view either a control or intervention group. Patients assigned to the control group will view the computerized version of the age-appropriate educational pamphlet concerning prenatal testing developed by the State of California. Patients assigned to the intervention group will use the computerized decision support tool/educational module which provides important background information about chromosomal abnormalities, and patient-tailored information about the advantages and limitations of diagnostic testing.</detailed_description>
