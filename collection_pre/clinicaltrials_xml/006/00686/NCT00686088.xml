	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the therapeutic activity of different concentrations of PRX302 at increasing volumes and/or number of deposits per gram of prostate. Therapeutic activity will be determined based on changes in PSA levels, PSA velocity, PSA doubling time and tumor burden following treatment.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Prostatic Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Completed a full course of radiation therapy for prostate cancer at least 2 years before enrollment. Biochemical failure at screening as determined by either the ASTRO or the Phoenix definitions. At least 5 available PSA readings after completion of radiation therapy and prior to screening. PSA level of not greater than 10 ng/mL. PSA doubling time of at least 9 months at screening. Biopsyproven recurrent localized prostate cancer. Tumor stage T1C to T2C. Prostate volume estimated at 40 mL or less as determined by TRUS. ECOG performance score 0 to 2. Serum testosterone of at least 1 ng/dL. Prior history of metastatic prostate cancer. Salvage external beam therapy and/or salvage brachytherapy prior to enrollment. Biological, immunological, chemotherapeutic treatment or cryotherapy after completing radiation. Androgen ablation therapy within 12 months prior to enrollment. Recurrence of prostate cancer within 18 months of definitive primary radiotherapy. Other medication for prostate cancer. Presence of active malignancy other than prostate cancer. Treatment with other investigational therapies within 12 months prior to enrolment. Presence of a chronic indwelling Foley catheter for obstructive uropathy. Previous transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), transurethral resection of the bladder neck, photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) or other resection surgery in the urinary tract. Previous treatment with PRX302. Any evidence of metastatic disease on bone scan, CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3 months prior to enrollment.</criteria>
