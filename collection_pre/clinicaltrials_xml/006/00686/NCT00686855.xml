	<brief_title>Topical Dexamethasone and Tacrolimus for the Treatment of Oral Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Because no one knows which study option is best, participants will be "randomized" into one of two study groups: topical dexamethasone or topical tacrolimus. - Participants will take the medication by mouth rinse four times a day for 5 minutes at a time. After rinsing they will spit out the medication and will not be able to eat or drink for 15 minutes. - Participants will also take anti-fungal medication (fluconazole) orally once a week. - After two weeks on study treatment, participants will have a blood drawn to monitor tacrolimus levels. - After the final treatment (4 weeks), participants will have the following tests and procedures: clinical examination; questionnaire; blood tests; oral culture; optional tissue biopsy.</detailed_description>
