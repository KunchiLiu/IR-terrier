	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity and Vaccine-like Viral Shedding of MEDI-534, Against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Parainfluenza Virus Type 3 (PIV3), in Healthy 6 to &lt;24 Month-old Children and in 2 Month-old Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1/2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of MEDI-534 at 10^5 or 10^6 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) in RSV and PIV3 seronegative children 6 to &lt;24 months of age and at dosages of 10^4, 10^5 or 10^6 TCID50 in unscreened infants 2 months of age.</detailed_description>
