	<brief_title>IT-Based Training in Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study settles in the field of primary prevention and aims to change lifestyle of patients with metabolic syndrome with a new combination of personal and IT-based training specially designed für obese people with risk factors. Procedures that are similar for all participants are summarized in a training program whereas individual aspects of physical activity like initial education and exercise tests are still performed by doctors and trainers. Before and after three months of training anthropometric parameters, laboratory and exercise capacity are examined and analyzed. The intervention group is characterized by a predetermined exercise program whereas the control group is allowed to practise without detailed instructions. The practicability and the effect on health status of the combined personal and IT-based training in the intervention group is compared with the independent training of the control group. After 6 months and again after 12 months the measurements are repeated to evaluate a lasting effect of the program.</detailed_description>
