	<brief_title>Hypothalamic Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Response to Nutrients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To measure fMRI signal change in hypothalamic and brainstem centers associated with control of food intake and energy expenditure in response to IV glucose, fructose, and saline. The fMRI response to these nutrients will then be compared in obese vs. lean subjects. Frequently timed blood samples will be obtained for measurement of nutrients (i.e., glucose) and blood levels of other factors (i.e., insulin, ghrelin, lactate) during these infusion protocols, and to test associations between these levels and the fMRI response.</detailed_description>
