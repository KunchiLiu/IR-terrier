	<brief_summary>To examine whether Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and Docosahexaenoic + Eicosapentaenoic Acids (DHA+EPA) supplementation in addition to National Cholesterol Education Program Step I Diet in Hypercholesterolemic Children increases Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) plasma levels in the 2 intervention groups versus placebo. Secondary outcome measure: effect of DHA and DHA+EPA supplementation on blood lipid profile</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Docosahexaenoic and Eicosapentaenoic Acids in Hypercholesterolemic Children Plus Diet on Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial 36 hypercholesterolemic children, 3-13 years of age, 19 males and 17 females were put on National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)Step-I diet and randomised into 3 groups to receive 500 mg/day of purified Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), Docosahexaenoic Acid plus Eicosapentaenoic Acid (DHA+EPA) mixture (228 + 208 mg/day respectively), or wheat germ oil as placebo. They underwent at baseline and after a 4 month treatment: EPA and DHA levels in total plasma and in phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesteryl esters; dietary habits by food frequency questionnaire; blood lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides levels)</detailed_description>
