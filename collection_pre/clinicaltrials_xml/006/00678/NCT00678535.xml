	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that addition of cetuximab to 1st-line treatment with capecitabine (Xeloda, X) and cisplatin (P) [XP] chemotherapy regimen has a clinically relevant benefit for subjects with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma including gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, in terms of progression free survival (PFS). Secondary objectives are to assess cetuximab plus XP versus XP alone with respect to overall survival, overall tumor response, quality of life (QoL) and safety.</brief_summary>
