	<brief_title>Pivotal Study for the FLAIR Endovascular Stent Graft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 227 patients were treated at 16 U.S. investigational sites to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the FLAIR™ Endovascular Stent Graft. This study compared the FLAIR™ Endovascular Stent Graft to balloon angioplasty in patients with stenoses at the venous anastomosis of a synthetic AV access graft.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Constriction, Pathologic</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Male or female patients between 18 to 90 years of age whose hemodialysis access was a synthetic AV access graft located in an arm. Angiographic evidence of one or more stenoses, 7 cm or less in length and greater than or equal to 50%, at the graftvein anastomosis of a synthetic AV access graft. The entire lesion must have been located within 7 cm of the anastomosis such that approximately 1 cm of the IMPRA/Bard Device must have extended into nondiseased vein and approximately 1 cm, but no more than 2 cm, of the IMPRA/Bard Device will be extended into nondiseased AV graft. Clinical evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis. Percutaneous endovascular therapy for the identified lesion was the best treatment choice in the opinion of the investigator. Patients must have been able to understand and provide informed consent. Patients whose synthetic AV access grafts had been implanted greater than 30 days and had undergone 1 or more successful hemodialysis sessions. During primary balloon angioplasty, full expansion of an appropriately sized angioplasty balloon, in the operator's judgment, must have been achieved. Concomitant disease (e.g., terminal cancer) or other medical condition that was likely to result in death of the patient within 6 months of the time of implantation. Stenoses that had a corresponding thrombosis treated within 7 days. The presence of a second lesion in the access circuit less than or equal to 3 cm from the edges of the primary lesion that was treated within 30 days or that was greater than or equal to 30%. Access circuit was defined as the area from the AV access graft arterial anastomosis to the superior vena cavaright atrial junction. The presence of a second lesion in the access circuit greater than 3 cm from the edges of the primary lesion that was greater than or equal to 30%. Second lesions that were greater than or equal to 30% must have been treated prior to patient inclusion to reduce the percent stenosis to less than 30%. Patients who were unwilling or unable to return for followup visits or patients with whom followup visits may have been unreliable. Patients who had a stent placed at the target lesion site. Patients with a blood coagulative disorder or sepsis. Patients in which the IMPRA/Bard Device would have been required to cross an angle (between the inflow vein and synthetic AV access graft) that was greater than 90 degrees. Patients in which the IMPRA/Bard Device would have been required to be deployed fully across the elbow joint, which is identified radiographically by a combination of the humeroulnar joint and the humeroradial joint. Patients with a contraindication to the use of contrast media. Patients whose AV access graft was infected. Patients who were currently or were scheduled to enroll in other investigations that conflicted with followup testing or confounds data in this trial. Procedural use of another investigational device. Patients who were pregnant.</criteria>
