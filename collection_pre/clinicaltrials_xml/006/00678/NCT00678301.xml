	<criteria>Male or female subjects between, and including 610 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination. Subjects for whom the investigator believes that their parent(s)/guardian(s) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study. Written or oral, signed or thumbprinted informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/guardian(s) of the child/ward. Where parent(s)/guardian(s) are illiterate, the consent form will be countersigned by a witness. Free of any known or suspected health problems (as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study), that would contraindicate the initiation of routine immunizations outside a clinical trial context. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of the study vaccines, or planned use during the study period. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product (pharmaceutical product or device). Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs since birth. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition based on medical history and physical examination. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period (Hepatitis B immunoglobulins at birth are allowed). Previous vaccination against, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b and/or Streptococcus pneumoniae. History of, or intercurrent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Streptococcus and Haemophilus influenzae type b disease. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines. History of any neurological disorders or seizures. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Study entry should be delayed until the illness has improved. Babies for which birth weight is &lt; 2 kilogram (if known) at Visit 1</criteria>
