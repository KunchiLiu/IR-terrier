	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cixutumumab and temsirolimus in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving cixutumumab together with temsirolimus may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability; and to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of IMC-A12 (cixutumumab) with temsirolimus in patients with or without biopsiable advanced cancers. II. To evaluate the biologic effect of each individual drug and this drug combination on expression/phosphorylation of potential markers of response in patients with biopsiable disease. III. To assess tumor metabolism by positron emission tomography (PET). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To report the clinical tumor response of this combination in a descriptive fashion. OUTLINE: DOSE ESCALATION PHASE: Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and cixutumumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After the MTD is determined, subsequent patients are enrolled into the MTD expansion cohort. MTD EXPANSION COHORT: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. GROUP A: Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 15 and 22 for course 1 and on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for all subsequent courses. Patients also receive cixutumumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. GROUP B: Patients receive cixutumumab IV over 60 minutes on days 15 and 22 for course 1 and on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for all subsequent courses. Patients also receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. GROUP C: Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes and cixutumumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days.</detailed_description>
