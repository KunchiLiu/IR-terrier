	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard approach for the treatment of gallbladder disease. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now performed as an outpatient procedure and it commonly requires the use of 4 separate small incisions. Single incision or single access trans-umbilical surgery may provide less pain, scarring and may improve patient's overall satisfaction. In this phase I trial we aim to evaluate the safety, feasibility and short-term outcomes of Single Incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy for the treatment of symptomatic cholelithiasis (gallstones).</detailed_description>
