	<brief_summary>Guidance issued by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends the use of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) 'Beating the Blues' (BtB) in treatment of depression. However CCBT has not been designed specifically for use by people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and may not be effective or appropriate for use by people with physical disabilities or cognitive symptoms. There would therefore be value in conducting a trial of the effectiveness of CCBT for depression in people with MS. The aim of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of a randomised control trial (RCT) of CCBT for depression in people with MS. The objective is to undertake a pilot RCT of comparison of CCBT with usual care including 3 month follow up to identify a realistic patient recruitment rate and provide reliable estimates of other parameters needed for designing a definitive RCT including the sample size. Other outcomes to be measured include estimates of the effect on depression and quality of life. Participants will be assessed as experiencing clinical levels of depression and be recruited from two participating MS Centres. The outcomes of the study will be (1) preliminary indication of the impact of CCBT on depression in MS; and, (2) a well researched protocol for a definitive RCT of the effectiveness of CCBT in treating depression in people with MS.</brief_summary>
