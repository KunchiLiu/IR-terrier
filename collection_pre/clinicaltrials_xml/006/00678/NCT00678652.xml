	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a vaccine based on outer membrane vesicles (NOMV) from genetically detoxified group B meningococcus is safe and effective for use as a vaccine. If so, the NOMV in this vaccine will be combined with NOMV from two other genetically modified strains as a potentially globally effective vaccine against group B meningococcus.</brief_summary>
