	<brief_summary>Tonsillectomy is associated with a significant decrease quality of life in children secondary to pain, which is worsened with swallowing. Previous studies in the pediatric population have demonstrated a significant decrease in post-operative pain/morbidity when administering pain reduction medications into the tonsillar fossa prior to removal. While these studies have shown great promise, no large randomized trial of the most promising medications has been conducted. Because of this, many otolaryngologists do not administer intra-operative medications aimed at reducing post-operative pain. The objective of the current study is to conduct a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial using a pre-tonsillectomy infiltration of the tonsillar fossa comparing three treatment regimens in reducing post-tonsillectomy morbidity (i.e. pain, poor oral intake): 1) Placebo (saline injection) 2) bupivacaine (0.5%) + lidocaine (1%), 3) bupivacaine (0.5%) + lidocaine (1%) + clonidine (25 Âµg).</brief_summary>
