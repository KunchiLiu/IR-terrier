	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether alerts independent of the ambulatory health record are more effective in eliciting physician responses and therefore have greater impact on HIV disease outcomes than traditional static alerts.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Provider Computer Alerts Designed to Improve Delivery of HIV Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will compare the effectiveness of standard and enhanced care alerts in HIV infected participants at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Participants will be a part of this study for 4 years or until they are no longer followed at Massachusetts General Hospital. Participants will be assigned randomly to one of two arms. Participants assigned to Arm 1 will receive standard care, involving standard provider alerts which will be posted on the participant's health record. Participants assigned to Arm 2 will receive enhanced care, involving improved functionality. Experimental informatics-based provider alerts and support systems will be used to develop a pilot system designed to optimize delivery of HIV clinical care. All participants will be monitored for new laboratory toxicities, suboptimal follow up, and virologic failure at their normally scheduled appointments.</detailed_description>
