	<brief_title>Histocompatibility Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A*2402 Restricted Peptide Vaccine Therapy in Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TTK has been identified as cancer specific molecules especially in breast cancer using genome-wide expression profile analysis by cDNA microarray technique. We have determined the HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptide derived from this molecule and identified that this peptide significantly induces the effective tumor specific CTL response in vitro and vivo. According to these findings, in this trial, we evaluate the safety, immunological and clinical response of that peptide. Patients will be vaccinated twice a week for 8 weeks. On each vaccination day, TTK-A24-567 peptide (1mg) mixed with Montanide ISA 51 will be administered by subcutaneous injection. Repeated cycles of vaccine will be administered until patients develop progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. In the phase I study, we evaluate the safety and tolerability of this peptide vaccine. In the following phase II study, we evaluate the immunological and clinical response of this vaccine therapy.</detailed_description>
