	<brief_title>Drug Treatment Validation of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Generalized Anxiety Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an exploratory study to evaluate the usefulness of fMRI as a biomarker to measure the response to a known, FDA approved marketed anxiolytic. As such, this is not a study testing safety and efficacy of an approved medicine; it is a study to evaluate the usefulness of fMRI (a non-significant risk device procedure) to correlate the clinical/behavioral effects of a marketed anxiolytic with brain activity assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. fMRI is a more direct measure of brain function than behavior, outcomes are quantitative and objective. As such, it may be more specific, i.e., may be more sensitive to drug effects or show them earlier than clinical endpoints and enable determination of efficacy in smaller or shorter studies than those required to show effects on clinical endpoints. Finally, imaging may allow differentiation of placebo responders from true drug responders.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female between 18 65 years of age, inclusive 2. In good general health (as determined by medical history, physical examination, laboratory assessments and ECG), especially no findings (including concomitant medications) that would constitute contraindications for treatment with alprazolam 3. DSMIV criteria for GAD (exception: at least 3 months of symptoms) 4. HAMA at screening &gt;/= 20 5. MADRS at screening &lt; 25 6. Prior medications washout: 2week medication washout prior to randomization for most psychotropic medications If prior history of fluoxetine use, this drug must have been discontinued at least 5 weeks before randomization 7. For females of nonchildbearing potential: either postmenopausal for the past year (confirmed by an FSH level greater than 40 mIU/mL unless the subject is receiving HRT), or surgically sterile (e.g., tubal ligation, hysterectomy) 8. Males and female subjects of childbearing potential may be included if using appropriate contraceptive methods: must use abstinence or two methods of contraception throughout the trial: should include one primary (e.g., systemic hormonal contraception, vasectomy of the male partner) AND one secondary barrier method (e.g., latex condoms, spermicide) OR a double barrier method (e.g., latex condom plus spermicide (foam, suppository, gel, cream)) may be used 9. GAD should be the clinically predominant disorder, as judged by the investigator, considering relative severity and impact on functioning 1. Axis I disorder other than stated above with the exception of the following permitted comorbidities: history of (within past 6 months) or current dysthymia current (within past 6 months) depressive episode with MADRS at baseline &lt; 25 history of major depression as long as no current depressive episode as defined above 2. Drug or alcohol dependence in the past 6 months 3. Positive urine toxicology (drugs of abuse as determined by clinician's assessment of positive urine test) 4. Active suicidal ideation (determined by clinician) 5. For females of childbearing potential: Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant or currently breastfeeding 6. Current use of betablockers or stimulants (e.g., Methylphenidate, dAmphetamine, modafinil, and illicit drugs like cocaine or 3,4methylenedioxyNmethylamphetamine [MDMA]) 7. Current regular use of antihistamines (except for inhalants which are permitted) 8. Current use of herbal medication for mood or anxiety disorders and unwillingness to discontinue use for the duration of the study 9. Current use of fluoxetine 10. Concomitant psychotropic medications including regular use of sleeping medications (also herbals) occasional use of sleeping medication, with the exception of benzodiazepines, is permitted as long as it is not taken the evening prior to a visit 11. Past intolerance (including allergic) to, or clear history of nonresponse to the study medication 12. Current smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes/day); habitual caffeine consumption of more than 400 mg/d (approximately 4 cups of coffee or equivalent) 13. BMI &gt; 32.5 kg/m2 14. Contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging based on a standard fMRI screening forms 15. Concurrent participation in an IRB approved investigational drug trial 16. Any other reason why, per clinician, the patient should not participate in this study (to be included in this assessment are all considerations, warnings, precautions as per current FDAapproved drug label for XanaxÂ®)</criteria>
