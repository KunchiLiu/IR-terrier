	<brief_summary>After conventional induction treatment with R-CHOP (Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone) the patients are randomized to: A: Consolidation with one dose of 90Y Ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin®) 0,4 mCi/Kg B: Maintenance with 375 mg/m2 of Rituximab every 8 weeks during 24 months</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ZAR2007: R-CHOP in Folicular Lymphoma Patients no Treated Previously. Consolidation With 90Y Ibritumomab Tiuxetan (Zevalin®) Versus Maintenance Treatment With Rituximab (MabThera®)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will evaluate the benefit of consolidation treatment with 90Y Ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin®) or maintenance with rituximab (MabThera®) in terms of progression free survival, after induction with chemotherapy and rituximab in folicular lymphoma patients no treated previously. The other aims are, evaluate the global survival, event free survival, time until next treatment, response rate after consolidation or maintenance treatment, quality of life, security of two branches and relation cost-efectivity</detailed_description>
