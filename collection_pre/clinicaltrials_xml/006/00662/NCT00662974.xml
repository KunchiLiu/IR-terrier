	<brief_summary>In this study we intend to randomly assign each parturient one of two commonly used oils to be applied during the second stage of labor, one of them containing vitamin E. We will verify if perineal massage increases the chances of delivering with an intact perineum comparing the two oils. As secondary objectives, we will evaluate the effects of perineal massage on specific tear location, the severity of perineal tears and the amount of suture material required for repair.</brief_summary>
