	<brief_title>Effect of Duration of Antibiotic Therapy on Recovery Following Tonsillectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial METHODS : All pediatric patients (under the age of 18) scheduled to undergo a tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy from an outpatient otolaryngology practice will be recruited for the study. Exclusion criteria include prior use of antibiotics 7 days before surgery, penicillin allergy or medical comorbidity necessitating antibiotic use. Preoperative demographic information will be obtained. Tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy will be performed by a single surgeon (JJ) using electrocautery. Patients will be randomized to receive either a 3- or 7-day course of amoxicillin. Parents will be asked to record the following information: analgesic use for the first 7 postoperative days, postoperative days the child initiated her usual diet and level of activity and medical treatment for oral hemorrhage or dehydration. Statistical analysis will be performed to determine a real difference between the two groups with regard to analgesic use, resumption to normal diet and activity, and incidence of oral hemorrhage or dehydration.</detailed_description>
