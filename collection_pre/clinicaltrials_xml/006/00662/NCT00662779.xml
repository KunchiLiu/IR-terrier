	<brief_summary>It is our primary hypothesis that pretreatment with arformoterol will provide superior protection against EIB in children with mild-moderate asthma compared to placebo added to the current asthma regimen. Our secondary hypothesis is that nebulized arformoterol has comparable protection against EIB compared to inhaled formoterol by dry powder inhaler.</brief_summary>
