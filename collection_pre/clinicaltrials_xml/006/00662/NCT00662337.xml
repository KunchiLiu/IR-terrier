	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Between Two Oral Formulations of Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects were required to observe a ten-hour fast and a one-hour fluid restriction prior to each dosing period. Subjects were randomized into one of two active treatment groups, received supervised dosing of their treatment with approximately eight ounces of water, and were required to maintain fluid restriction for one hour after treatment. Following the one-hour post-dose fluid restriction, subjects could drink water, but consumer no other food or fluids for four hours post-dose. Following a seven-day washout period, the comparison treatment was administered according to the same procedure as above.</detailed_description>
