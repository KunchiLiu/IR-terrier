	<criteria>Histologically or cytologicallyproven diagnosis of breast adenocarcinoma that is not amenable to surgery, radiation, or combined modality therapy with curative intent Measurable disease as per RECIST. Measurable lesions that have been previously irradiated will not be considered target lesions unless increase in size has been observed following completion of radiation therapy. Prior treatment with an anthracycline and a taxane in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic disease settings. Histology of inflammatory carcinoma with no other measurable disease. Patients with histology of inflammatory carcinoma are allowed on study if they have measurable disease. Brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningeal disease. Prior treatment with 5fluorouracil (5FU) and 5FU derivatives such as Furtulon (5'DFUR), Futraful/ Sunfural (tegafur), UFT/UFTE (tegafur/uracil), TS1 (tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil) or Mifurol (carmofur) in metastatic disease setting</criteria>
