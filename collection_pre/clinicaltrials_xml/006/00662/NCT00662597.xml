	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed nonsmall cell carcinoma of the lung. (Histological or cytological specimens must be collected via surgical biopsy, brushing, washing or core needle aspiration of a defined lesion. Sputum cytology is not acceptable.) 2. Newly diagnosed Stage IIIb disease (malignant pleural effusion or pericardial effusion that have been confirmed cytologically) or Stage IV disease 3. No prior systemic antineoplastic treatment for Stage IIIb/IV nonsmall cell carcinoma of the lung (Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy for earlier stage I/II NSCLC is allowed if 12 months or more prior to Baseline visit.) 4. Age ≥ 18 years old 5. WHO Performance Status of 01 6. Measurable or nonmeasurable disease per RECIST criteria (Posttext supplement 1) 7. Lab values within the range, as defined below, within 2 weeks of randomization: Absolute neutrophils count (ANC) &gt; 2.0 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 100 x109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN (≤ 120 micro mol/L) Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (≤ 25 micro mol/L) Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN if liver metastases) International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤ 1.5 x IULN (Sections 6.9.1 and 7.3.4.2) Electrolyte values (potassium, calcium, magnesium) within &gt; 1 x LLN and &lt; 1 x ULN. Patients with corrected electrolyte values are eligible. See Sections 6.8.1 and 7.3.4.3. Females of childbearing potential must have negative serum pregnancy test (confirmation of negative urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to initial dosing). 8. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks 9. Written informed consent obtained according to local guidelines 1. Patients having CNS metastases (Patients having any clinical signs of CNS metastases must have a CT or MRI of the brain performed to rule out CNS metastases in order to be eligible for study participation. Patients who have had brain metastases surgically removed or irradiated with no residual disease confirmed by imaging are allowed.). 2. Patients with a history of another primary malignancy ≤ 5 years, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ. 3. Radiotherapy ≤ 2 weeks prior to randomization. Patients must have recovered from all radiotherapyrelated toxicities. 4. Major surgery ≤ 4 weeks prior to randomization or minor surgery ≤ 2 weeks prior to randomization.(Major surgery is defined by the use of general anesthesia however, endoscopic examinations with diagnostic intent are not considered major surgery. Insertion of a vascular access device is exempt from this exclusion criteria. Patients must have recovered from all surgeryrelated complications. 5. Concurrent use of other investigational agents and patients who have received investigational agents ≤ 4 weeks prior to randomization 6. Prior exposure to TumorVDAs or other vascular targeting agents (antiVEGF, antiVEGF receptor agents, antiEGFR agents [bevacizumab, cetuximab, etc.]) 7. Pleural effusion that causes ≥ CTC grade 2 dyspnea 8. Patients with systolic BP &gt; 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP &gt;90 mm Hg 9. Patients with recent hemoptysis associated with NSCLC (&gt; 1 teaspoon in a single episode within 4 weeks) 10. Patients with any one of the following: Patients with long QT syndrome Patients with a Baseline 12lead ECG QTc of &gt; 450 msec per central evaluation Congestive heart failure (NY Heart Association class III or IV) Patients with a myocardial infarction within 12 months of study entry Unstable or poorly controlled angina pectoris, including Prinzmetal variant angina pectoris History of labile hypertension or poor compliance with antihypertensive regimen History of a sustained ventricular tachycardia Any history of ventricular fibrillation or Torsades de Pointes Right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock (bifasicular block) Bradycardia defined as heart rate &lt; 50 beats per minute 11. Concomitant use of drugs with a risk of causing Torsades de Pointes (See Table 63) 12. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to platinumcontaining drugs, taxanes, other drugs formulated in Cremophor EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil) or any known excipients of these drugs. 13. Peripheral sensory neuropathy with functional impairment (CTC grade 2 neuropathy, regardless of causality) 14. Pregnant or breast feeding females • Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/ml) 15. Women of child bearing potential or sexually active males, unwilling or unable to use the required highly effective method(s) of contraception for both sexes while receiving treatment and for at least 6 months after the discontinuation of study treatment. (Adequate forms of contraception include IUD, oral or depot contraceptive or the barrier method plus spermicide.) • Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions while taking paclitaxel and therefore are not considered effective contraceptive methods for this study when used as a single agent. Therefore, it is highly recommended that a concomitant barrier method be used with oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives. The investigator shall counsel the patient accordingly. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) 72 hours prior to administration of study treatment.

Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease (i.e. uncontrolled diabetes, chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection or active uncontrolled infection). 17. Significant neurologic or psychiatric disorder which could compromise participation in the study Patient unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
