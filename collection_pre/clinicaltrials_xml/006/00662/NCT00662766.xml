	<brief_title>Intervention With Black Currant Seed Press Residues in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Berry seeds are a by-product of berry fabrication (e. g. to juices or jam). In order to maintain their functionality and long life span, berry seeds need to contain cell stabilizing ingredients such as vitamins and polyphenols. Since it seems to be a valuable source of health beneficial substances in human nutrition, commercial use should be found. Therefore, seeds were pressed (seed press residue), ground and baked into bread for consumption. Black currant seed press residues are rich in tocopherols and also contain anthocyanins; both act as antioxidants. Additionally there is 50% fibre in the residue, soluble and insoluble fibre in equal shares.</detailed_description>
