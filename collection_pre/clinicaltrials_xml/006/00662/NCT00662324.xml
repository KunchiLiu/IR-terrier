	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop a Question Prompt List (QPL) about clinical trials for cancer patients and find out what cancer patients and their caregivers think of the QPL. A QPL is a list of questions patients might want to ask their doctors during their appointments. We will conduct three focus groups to talk about using QPL's as a new way to recruit patients like you to clinical trials. The three groups will be made of patients who have and have not participated in clinical trials, their caregivers and doctors. This study is also being done to learn about how the QPL affects the question asking behavior of patients during their appointments with doctors at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).</brief_summary>
