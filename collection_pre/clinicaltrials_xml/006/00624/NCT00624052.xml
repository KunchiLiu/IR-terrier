	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of the fixed dose combinations telmisartan 40mg/amlodipine 10mg (T40/A10) or telmisartan 80mg/amlodipine 10mg (T80/A10) during open-label treatment for at least six months. An additional objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of concomitant administration of either T40/A10 or T80/A10 with any other therapies commonly used in the treatment of hypertension. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving DBP control (defined as mean seated DBP &lt; 90 mmHg at trough i.e. approximately 24 hours after last dose of study treatment) at six months of treatment or at last trough observation during the treatment period (i.e. last trough observation carried forward).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>diagnosis of essential hypertension pregnancy, breastfeeding, unwilling to use effective contraception (if female of childbearing potential). development of any condition in the preceding trial that could be worsened by telmisartan 40mg/amlodipine 10mg (T40/A10) or telmisartan 80mg/amlodipine 10mg (T80/A10). discontinuation from the preceding trial. known or suspected secondary hypertension. mean seated systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;= 180 mmHg and/or mean seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;= 120 mmHg at any visit. any clinically significant hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment bilateral renal artery stenosis or renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or post postrenal transplant. clinically relevant hyperkalaemia. uncorrected volume or sodium depletion. primary aldosteronism. hereditary fructose or lactose intolerance. symptomatic congestive heart failure. patients who have previously experienced symptoms characteristic of angioedema during treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). any new drug or alcohol dependency since signing consent of the preceding trial. concurrent participation in another clinical trial or any investigational therapy since completing the preceding trial. hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, hemodynamically relevant stenosis of the aortic or mitral valve. known allergic hypersensitivity to any component of the formulations under investigation. [Includes known hypersensitivity to telmisartan or other ARBs or amlodipine or other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs).] noncompliance with study medication (defined as &lt;80% or &gt;120%) during the preceding trial. administration of ARBs or dihydropyridine CCBs (apart from trial medication). any other clinical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would not allow safe completion of the protocol and safe administration of telmisartan and amlodipine.</criteria>
