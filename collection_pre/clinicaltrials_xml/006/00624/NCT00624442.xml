Patient is considered to be in suitable health in the opinion of the investigator, as determined by: A prestudy physical examination with no clinical abnormalities which in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation in the study other than physical symptoms or signs consistent with stable heart failure An electrocardiogram (ECG) with no abnormalities in the opinion of the investigator that would impair assessment of stopping criteria 6. Patient has prestudy clinical laboratory findings that are within normal range, or if outside of the normal range, should not preclude participation in the study in the opinion of the investigator (see Exclusion Criteria, below, for exceptions) 7. Patient has a documented diagnosis of heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 40% 8. Patient has been on a stable dose of a beta blocker and an ACE (angiotensinconverting enzyme) inhibitor or an ARB (angiotensin II receptor blocker) for at least 4 weeks. If prescribed, diuretics must have been administered according to a consistent regimen for at least 4 weeks 9. Patient is currently in sinus rhythm 10. Patient has interpretable echocardiographic images on a screening echocardiogram Exclusion Criteria 1. Patient has been hospitalized for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or another cardiac indication within the last 6 weeks 2. Patient has a current history of alcohol use which in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation in the study 3. Patient has a current history of drug abuse 4. Patient has donated blood or blood products within 30 days prior to screening 5. Patient has Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Class III or IV angina 6.

Patient has a supine resting heart rate ≥ 100 beats per minute after 3 minutes rest 15. Patient has an Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) estimate of Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) ≤ 35 ml/min/1.73 m2 16. Patient has a potassium &lt; 3.5 mEq/L or &gt; 5.5 mEq/L 17. Patient has a sodium ≤ 133 mEq/L 18. Patient has a urea &gt; 15 mmole/L 19. Patient has a troponin I or T at screening that is detectable at the investigative site's clinical laboratory 20. Patient has a hemoglobin &lt; 11 gm/dL in males or &lt; 10 gm/dL in females 21. Patient has an alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) or total bilirubin (TBILI) &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal 22. Patient is, in the opinion of the investigator, not suitable to participate in the study 23. Patient has participated in any clinical study with an investigational drug within three months prior to the first day of dosing with the exception of coronary stent studies Patient has ever received CK1827452</criteria>
