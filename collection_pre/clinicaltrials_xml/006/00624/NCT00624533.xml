	<brief_title>Efficiency of GDS Method for Lumbar Stabilization for Non-Specific Low Back Pain in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain is one of the most frequent ailments in industrialized countries, with a lifetime prevalence of more than 70%. It is responsible for a major portion of work absenteeism and is actually among those conditions which generate the greatest expense due to health and labor costs. The Spanish National Health Service is a universal and free health care system. Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is a prevalent disorder, generating large health and social costs. There is considerable variation in LBP related clinical practice and a considerable number of clinical guidelines have been developed for the management of subacute and chronic LBP patients. Experience in Primary Care Centers of Madrid shows that physiotherapeutic intervention based on GDS Method for Articular and Muscular Chains is an efficient technique in the treatment of patients with diagnosis of non-specific low back pain compared with conventional physiotherapy treatment in Primary Care based on electrotherapy (TENS and microwave) Currently, no randomized studies examining the effects of this method for patients with subacute or chronic non-specific low back pain have been published.</detailed_description>
