	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the benefit of OMS103HP for Injection (OMS103HP) compared with vehicle irrigation solution for prevention of pain and pain relief in subjects undergoing meniscectomy. The pain relief is assessed based on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Pain Scores in the immediate 24-hour postoperative period and for seven days postoperatively.</brief_summary>

Subject expected to undergo any of the following procedures concurrent with meniscectomy: 1. Arthroscopic patellar tendon debridement 2. Patellar alignment 3. Lateral or retinacular release 4.
