	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to monitor the change in the health status of severe COPD patients after the initiation of Tiotropium therapy. This will be assessed by the physician`s global evaluation of the patient`s health status on a 8-point scale. This measure has been shown to correlate with a established standard measure of the patients health related quality of life. The primary analysis in this trial will only include patients not pre-treated with a long-acting beta-agonist to establish a clear efficacy signal in this patient population. As the reality of COPD treatment nowadays is poly-pharmacy, a secondary analysis will analyse patients who are pretreated with long-acting bronchodilators to put the changes in the health status in a likely real world context. In parallel to these evaluations of the health status, the lung function response of the patients will be assessed to gain an established objective measure of treatment response.</brief_summary>
