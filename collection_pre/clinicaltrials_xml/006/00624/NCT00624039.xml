	<brief_title>The Effect of Cataract Extraction on the Contractility of Ciliary Muscle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The functional changes in the ciliary body in presbyopia are not only important in a study of the mechanism for presbyopia but are also a key to various procedures or devices used to restore accommodation. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to quantify the in vivo accommodative changes in the aging ciliary muscle with and without a lens. We are going to evaluate the changes in the pilocarpine-induced contractility of the ciliary muscle in eyes with presbyopia before and after cataract extraction using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM).UBM will be performed with and without instilling 2 % pilocarpine, as well as before and 2 months after cataract extraction. Images of the ciliary body will be compared visually using Adobe Photoshop 7.0.</detailed_description>
