	<brief_summary>Descemet's stripping with endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) is a cornea-sparing transplant technique that replaces only the diseased endothelial cell layer of the patient's cornea. The DSEK technique requires lamellar dissection of the donor tissue prior to implantation in the patient's eye. The surgeon usually dissects the donor cornea with a microkeratome at the time of surgery. Recently some eye banks have begun to pre-cut the donor graft as an added service. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes with eye bank pre-cut and surgeon-dissected donor grafts for DSEK.</brief_summary>
