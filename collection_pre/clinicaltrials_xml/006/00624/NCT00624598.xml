	<brief_title>The Short-Term Effect of a Technology Driven Weight Control (SMART) Program for Obese Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Participant between the ages of 1865 years. 2. Participant with a BMI (Body Mass Index &gt; 30.0 kg/m2) 3. Have access and use email a minimum of 2days per week. 1. Participant is not pregnant or lactating: Weight loss is not recommended for pregnant women and extra energy requirements are essential for fetal development (Butte, Wong, Treuth, Ellis, &amp; O'Brian Smith, 2004; Durnin, 1991). 2. Participant is not currently participating in any structured/selfhelp weight loss program. The elimination of individuals actively participating in a current weight loss program will reduce the potential of a carryover effect from these weight loss modalities (FifeShaw, 2006). 3. Participant has not attempted weight loss in the past 3 months. Same as number two.</criteria>
