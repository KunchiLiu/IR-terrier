	<brief_summary>This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the extension phase up to 48-50 months post booster vaccination, to assess long-term antibody persistence in children at around 30, 42 and 66 months of age, who received previously 4 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number = 00307554).

Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products less than 6 months prior to blood sampling. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition since the end of the 107046 study, based on medical history and physical examination.</criteria>
