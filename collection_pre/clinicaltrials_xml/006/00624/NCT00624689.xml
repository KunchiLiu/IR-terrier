	<brief_summary>Formula-fed infants differ from breast-fed infants in the growth pattern, risk for obesity and cardiovascular diseases, neurological development and morbidity in infections. The investigators' hypothesis is that a modified formula with reduced energy and protein content and enrichment with Milk Fat Globule Membrane (MFGM) containing bioactive proteins and phospholipids will reduce the difference between formula-fed and breast-fed infants.</brief_summary>
