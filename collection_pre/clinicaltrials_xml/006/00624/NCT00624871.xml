	<brief_summary>Oxygen radicals and inflammation are important causes for brain injury in neonates following perinatal asphyxia. Animal studies demonstrated potential benefits to the brain when using both of vitamin C and ibuprofen. The efficacy of these 2 drugs when combined in protecting the human brain has not been studied. We aimed in this study to test the hypothesis that a combination of anti-oxidants (vitamin C) and anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen) drugs can decrease the brain injury in perinatal asphyxia and improve outcomes when given to infants immediately after birth.</brief_summary>
