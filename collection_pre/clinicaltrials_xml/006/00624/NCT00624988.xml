	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigation is to determine the effect of lower limb vibration therapy on bone density in the tibia in patients with spinal cord injury. The second purpose is to assess the neuromuscular junction variability at the motor units of the tibialis anterior muscle after a sequence of lower limb vibration therapy</brief_summary>
