	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is that western lifestyle, with sedentary behaviors and caloric excess promote a chronic, subacute inflammatory state that participates in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. We will evaluate the effects of targeting inflammation using the anti-inflammatory drug salsalate, compared to placebo, on coronary artery plaque volume assessed by multi-detector computed tomographic angiography (MDCTA). The TINSAL-CVD study is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, 2 arm, clinical trial. The purpose of the study is to compare the effect of salsalate or placebo on sub-acute inflammation and coronary plaque, in people with cardiovascular disease. Participants are randomized to active intervention (salsalate) or placebo interventions for a period of 30 months. The primary endpoint is change in plaque volume in the coronary arteries assessed by MDCTA from baseline to 30 months.</brief_summary>
