	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Tubefeeding may help maintain good nutrition and lessen weight loss in younger patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well tube feedings work in younger patients receiving chemotherapy for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or high-risk solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Enteral Tube Feedings in Children Receiving Chemo for AML/MDS &amp; High Risk Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the feasibility and acceptance of undertaking early enteral tube feedings in children receiving induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes, primary cancers of the central nervous system, or high-risk solid tumors. Secondary - To determine the safety of proactive enteral nutrition in these patients. - To evaluate the effect of enteral nutrition on nutritional status in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients have a small (6 or 8 French) nasogastral feeding tube or enterostomy tube inserted after diagnosis. PeptamenÂ® AF tube feeding is administered via the enteral tube. Tube feedings are started as a continuous drip using an enteral feeding pump with a subsequent steady daily rate increase. Patients receive enteral feeding during courses 1-4 of chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
