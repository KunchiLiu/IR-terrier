	<brief_summary>To evaluate the impact of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) on beta-cell function, insulin sensitivity, incretin function, postprandial secretion of incretin hormones (glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)) in morbidly obese patients and to describe the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the amelioration of glucose homeostasis during long-term weight loss.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Morbid obesity represents a serious health issue in Western countries, with a rising incidence and a strong association with increased mortality and serious co-morbidities, such as diabetes. Surgical interventions, such as laparoscopic gastric banding have been developed with the aim of providing a laparoscopic placed device that is safe and effective in generating substantial weight loss. By investigation of the incretin effect, the secretion of GIP and GLP-1, the insulin response and sensitivity and the beta-cell responsiveness to glucose in 10 obese patients without type 2 diabetes before and after laparoscopic gastric banding the aim of this project is describe the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the amelioration of glucose homeostasis during long-term weight loss.</detailed_description>
