	<brief_summary>Currently there are 2 popular stress reduction courses that are widely used in the US. Although they use somewhat similar techniques, it is currently unknown whether or not they work the same way, or if they are similarly effective at reducing stress. The study will directly compare these 2 courses. Participants will undergo approximately 4-5 hours of testing before and after each 8-week course.</brief_summary>
