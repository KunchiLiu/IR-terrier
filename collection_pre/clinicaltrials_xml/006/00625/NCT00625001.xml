	<brief_summary>Turner Syndrome (TS) is associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis. Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk of fractures are present in many younger and middle-aged women with TS. The objective is therefore to describe longitudinal changes in BMD in TS. The study is an observational follow-up study. Examinations at baseline, after 5 and 10 years. Bone mineral density is measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and bone turnover by bone markers. Main Outcome Measures: Bone mineral density (BMD; grams/ square centimetre) were measured at lumbar spine, hip and the non-dominant forearm.</brief_summary>
