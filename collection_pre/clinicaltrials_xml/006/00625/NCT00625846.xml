	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in treating patients with advanced thyroid cancer. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by stopping blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Advanced Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish the safety and efficacy of GW786034 (pazopanib hydrochloride) as a therapeutic in patients afflicted with differentiated, medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancers. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assessment of the impact of therapy with GW786034 on serum/plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. II. To explore the potential relationship between changes in thyroglobulin levels and tumor response in patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer known to be thyroglobulin antibody negative. OUTLINE: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months or until 3 years after registration.</detailed_description>

1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (if there is reason to believe that the patient has Gilbert's Syndrome, the bilirubin can be fractionated; if the fractionated bilirubin is consistent with Gilbert's Syndrome and there is no other possible explanation for the elevated indirect bilirubin, the patient may be eligible for the study if and only if the direct bilirubin is =&lt; 1.5 X institutional ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) =&lt; 2.5 X institutional ULN Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 X ULN Proteinuria =&lt; 1+ on urinalysis (may recheck) International normalized ratio (INR) =&lt; 1.2 X the ULN Blood pressure (BP) &lt; 140 mmHg (systolic) and &lt; 90 mmHg (diastolic); initiation or adjustment of BP medication is permitted prior to registration provided that the average of three BP readings at a visit prior to registration is &lt; 140/90 mmHg Objective evidence of tumor progression in the 6 month period prior to GW786034 initiation as assessed by: Unequivocal progression of objectively measured disease on successive appropriate imaging (e.g. CT scan); in cases of uncertainty of tumor progression, the Principal Investigator of the study will be available to assist in decisions Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test =&lt; 7 days prior to registration; NOTE: women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; effective contraception is required for all fertile participants in the trial Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Willingness to comply with the requirement of the study Willingness to donate blood for correlative marker studies; (only applicable to sites within the United States) Anaplastic, differentiated, medullary: a total of &gt; 2 prior therapeutic regimens (this total includes cytotoxic plus noncytotoxic regimens); Note: enrollment of anaplastic, differentiated, and medullary patients who have had zero, one or two prior therapeutic regimens (cytotoxic plus noncytotoxic regimens) is allowed provided therapy ceased &gt; 21 days prior to registration; NOTE: the Principal Investigator of the study should be contacted in the event of uncertainty related patient eligibility based upon prior therapies Disease that is measurable by physical examination only Any of the following: Radiotherapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to registration Major surgery =&lt; 4 weeks prior to registration Radiotherapy to &gt;= 25% of bone marrow Concurrent therapy with octreotide unless tumor progression on this therapy has been demonstrated Any other ongoing investigational agents History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to GW786034 (pazopanib) or other agents used in the study &gt; +1 proteinuria (&lt; 30 mg/dL) on two consecutive dipstick or other urine assessments taken at least 1 week apart; NOTE: (in cases where questions arise related to disparate proteinuria measurements, the study Principal Investivator [PI] should be consulted for assistance in determining patient study eligibility) Corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation (defined as a QTc interval &gt;= 480 msecs) or other significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (e.g. frequent ventricular ectopy, evidence of ongoing myocardial ischemia); NOTE: the Principal Investigator of the study should be contacted in the event of uncertainty related patient eligibility based upon ECG changes Receiving cytochrome P450 (CYP) interactive concomitant medications; certain medications that act through the CYP450 system are specifically prohibited in patients receiving GW786034 (pazopanib) because in vitro data indicate that the agent has the potential to interact with the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9) and cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4); certain other agents should be used with caution Any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their ability to swallow and retain GSK786034 (pazopanib) Any of the following conditions: Serious or nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, active diverticulitis, intraabdominal abscess or gastrointestinal tract bleeding =&lt;

6 months) suicidal ideation Known active and/or untreated brain metastases and/or brain metastases requiring ongoing therapy (e.g. corticosteroids); NOTE: (because of the poor prognosis often associated with brain metastases and because of the potential risk of bleeding in active brain metastases associated with multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, patients with active and/or untreated brain metastases and/or those with brain metastases requiring ongoing therapy e.g. corticosteroids are excluded from trial enrollment; enrollment will, however, be permitted in cases of patients with longstanding treated and inactive brain metastases not requiring ongoing therapy, providing that stability of brain metastases has been demonstrated for a period of 3 months or greater as assessed by intracranial imaging and providing that there is no indication of increased vascularity of the treated metastases by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging conducted =&lt; 14 days prior to registration; when questions arise related to these criteria, the PI of the trial, Dr. Keith Bible, should be contacted for assistance on eligibility) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would or might reasonably be expected to limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant women; NOTE: (breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with GW786034/pazopanib) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy; NOTE: (appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated) Receiving any medications or substances known to affect or with the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of GW786034 (pazopanib);
