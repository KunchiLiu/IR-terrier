	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effects of deep rTMS using the novel H-coil on the motor, affective and cognitive deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to establish its safety in this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repetitive Transcranial Stimulation (r-TMS) Treatment for Patients With Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study rational:We anticipate that reaching deeper brain layers and larger volume of activation with the novel H-coil may induce significantly better therapeutic effects in patients with PD and will pave the way for establishing a novel and effective treatment for this disorder. Design:A prospective, double blind sham-controled study. No. of centers:1 One: Tel-Hashomer Medical Center, affiliated to Sackler school of Medicine, Tel -Aviv University, Israel. Study Population:Forty patients with idiopathic PD, Hoehn and Yahr stages II to IV, on stable antiparkinsonian therapy, with partial response. Study Duration:Two years</detailed_description>
