	<brief_summary>Current standard of the diagnosis and monitoring of PHNT requiring combination of invasive and non-invasive tests. The goal of the study is to correlate data from CT scans, echocardiograms, right heart catheterization, PFTs, sleep studies, and perfusion scans. The ultimate goal is to determine patterns of the PAH disease processes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study Of CT Scans and Echo Parameters in Patients With PAH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of our study is to correlate data from various non-invasive tests such as commuted tomography (CT) imaging, echocardiogram, Pulmonary Function Tests, and other laboratory tests along with hemodynamic measurements from Right Heart Catheterizations in these ILD patients with Pulmonary Hypertension, as well as all other pulmonary hypertension. The ultimate goal is to determine patterns of the PAH disease processes, as well as define optimal diagnostic modalities including in-hospital verses outpatient studies.</detailed_description>
