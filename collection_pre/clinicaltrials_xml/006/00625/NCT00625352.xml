	<brief_summary>Cares for elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) become one of the common clinical practices oncologist are now facing. So, we need to seek adequate regimens for them. Gemcitabine is well known to be one of active third generation agents in terms of both efficacy and tolerability. Gemcitabine alone have been recommended as first line treatment for elderly NSCLC patients, especially in the aspect of tolerability. However, gemcitabine alone is suggested to be suboptimal to control their disease. Therefore, we plan to make an optimal regimen containing gemcitabine for the elderly patients.</brief_summary>
