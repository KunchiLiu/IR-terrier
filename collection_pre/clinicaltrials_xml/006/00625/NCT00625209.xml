	<brief_title>Activated Protein C and Corticosteroids for Human Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Septic shock still places a burden in the healthcare system round around the world. In the early 20ties, clinical trials suggested potential benefits from activated protein C in severe sepsis and of corticosteroids when given to adults with refractory shock. More recent studies suggested that patients with moderate sepsis or septic shock may not benefit from either activated protein C or corticosteroids. Therefore, current international guidelines suggest that physicians may consider using these drugs in the more severe cases of sepsis. The main risk associated with the use of activated protein C is bleeding and the main risk associated with the use of steroids is superinfection. It is paramount that a new adequately powered trial explores the benefit/risk ratio of these two drugs and of their combination in a population of adult patients with septic shock. After the withdrawal of Xigris in October 2011, the study was suspended and restarted in June 2012 to investigate the benefit to risk ratio of corticosteroids.</detailed_description>
