	<brief_summary>As the population's life expectancy increases, fractures among the elderly in El Salvador are also increasing. There is currently limited data specific to the incidence and cause of fractures in the elderly within developing countries, such as El Salvador. The problem of inadequate knowledge pertaining to bone health and osteoporosis among the elderly is contributing to this aging population's health issues. The purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence, prevalence, and risk factors effecting elderly patients admitted for fractures at the Hospital Zacamil in San Salvador, El Salvador. The study will also assess the current knowledge in two distinct populations on bone health and osteoporosis. The first population will be the patients over the age of 45 that present to Hospital Zacamil with acute fractures and are consulted by the department of orthopedics. The second population will consist of students at the Evangelical University over the age of 18 in non-medial track studies. All individuals will have to accept the invitation to participate in the study. In addition, educational materials will be developed on the prevention of fractures for medical professionals and for the elderly in El Salvador. The study objectives will determine incidence and prevalence of elderly fractures of patients over the age of 45 at Hospital Zacamil. Secondly, the study will look at demographic information, prevalent causes of fractures, treatment of the fractures, morbidity and mortality, and any complications that may arise in the fracture patients prior to their discharge from the hospital. Thirdly, the study will seek out the current level of knowledge on bone health, osteoporosis, and fracture prevention in the young, educated Salvadorians and patients over the age of 45 at Hospital Zacamil. Fourthly, the study will address the benefits of the information gained by use of educational materials with the patients and doctors of El Salvador. Hypothesis One: Fractures of the elderly at Hospital Zacamil are significantly associated with occurring at the hip, wrist, and vertebra in comparison to other fracture locations.</brief_summary>
