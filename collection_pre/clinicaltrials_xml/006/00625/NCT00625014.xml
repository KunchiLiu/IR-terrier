	<brief_summary>We hypothesized that short-term treatment with haloperidol induces insulin resistance through a mechanistic route that is independent of weight gain. We therefore treated healthy non-obese men with haloperidol for 8 days, and studied the impact of these intervention on glucose and lipid metabolism by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, isotope dilution technology and indirect calorimetry.</brief_summary>
