	<brief_summary>We hypothesized that short-term treatment with AP drugs induces insulin resistance through a mechanistic route that is independent of weight gain and that atypical drugs exert stronger effects than typical compounds in this respect. We therefore treated healthy non-obese men with olanzapine (atypical AP) or haloperidol (typical AP) for 8 days, and studied the impact of these interventions on glucose and lipid metabolism by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, isotope dilution technology and indirect calorimetry.</brief_summary>
