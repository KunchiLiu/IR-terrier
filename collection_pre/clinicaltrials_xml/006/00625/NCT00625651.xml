	<brief_summary>This phase 1/2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AMG 655 when combined with mFOLFOX6 and bevacizumab compared with mFOLFOX6 and bevacizumab alone in subjects with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). The clinical benefit of AMG 655 in combination with mFOLFOX6 and bevacizumab will be measured by progression-free survival, objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, and overall survival. This study is also designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 655 in combination with mFOLFOX6 and bevacizumab and to evaluate anti-AMG 655 antibody formation and the pharmacokinetics of AMG 655.</brief_summary>
