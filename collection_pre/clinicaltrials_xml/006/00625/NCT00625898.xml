	<brief_title>BETH Study: Treatment of HER2 Positive Breast Cancer With Chemotherapy Plus Trastuzumab vs Chemotherapy Plus Trastuzumab Plus Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III, randomized, open-label trial will determine whether the regimens of chemotherapy plus trastuzumab plus bevacizumab improve invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) relative to the regimens of chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. Secondary aims include determining whether the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy plus trastuzumab will improve disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), recurrence-free interval (RFI), and distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI). The benefit of adding bevacizumab for IDFS, DFS, OS, RFI, and DRFI will also be evaluated for each of the two chemotherapy regimens. The cardiac and non-cardiac toxicities of each of the regimens will also be evaluated. Following local determination that the tumor is HER2-positive for gene amplification by in situ hybridization or is IHC 2+ or 3+, a tumor sample must be submitted for HER2 testing by a designated central laboratory. If central testing confirms that the tumor is HER2-positive (either positive by FISH or IHC 3+) and all other eligibility criteria have been met, the patient will be randomized to a regimen of chemotherapy and trastuzumab with or without bevacizumab. Patients in the trial will be enrolled in one of two chemotherapy regimen cohorts. One cohort will receive 6 cycles of docetaxel/carboplatin plus trastuzumab (TCH) with or without bevacizumab; the other cohort will receive 3 cycles of docetaxel plus trastuzumab given with or without bevacizumab followed by 3 cycles of 5-Fluorouracil, Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide (TH-FEC). With both regimens, patients will continue trastuzumab with or without bevacizumab following chemotherapy to complete 1 year of targeted therapy. Following completion of chemotherapy, patients will also receive adjuvant radiotherapy and endocrine therapy as clinically indicated. The trial will be conducted by investigators affiliated with the Cancer International Research Group (CIRG) and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP). CIRG and NSABP investigators will only enroll patients in the TCH regimen cohort. Additional investigators, referred to in the protocol as Independent Investigators, will enroll patients in both the TCH regimen or the TH-FEC regimen cohort depending on institutional preference for the one regimen that will be used by that institution for the duration of the trial. Patients will be given the option of allowing their tumor samples to be used for the BETH translational research and correlative science studies. Also, patients will be asked to consent to the submission of blood and serum samples at scheduled time points during the study. LVEF assessments will be performed before study entry and then at scheduled time points during therapy and at 18, 36, and 60 months following randomization. The planned sample size for the trial is 3,000 patients randomized in the faster accruing cohort and a minimum of 3,500 patients overall.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Life expectancy of at least 10 years, excluding their diagnosis of breast cancer. Women who have had breast reconstruction utilizing tissue expanders must be in agreement with delaying surgery to replace the tissue expanders with permanent implants until 3 months following the last dose of bevacizumab Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective nonhormonal method of contraception (for example condoms, some intrauterine devices, diaphragms, vasectomized partner, or abstinence) during therapy and for at least 6 months after the last dose of bevacizumab and/or trastuzumab. Submission of tumor samples from the breast surgery for central HER2 testing is required for all patients prior to enrollment in the BETH Trial Signed and dated IRB/ECapproved consent ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 The tumor must be unilateral invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination. The breast cancer must be HER2positive based on test results as follows: Local testing (if available) should demonstrate that the tumor is IHC 2+ or 3+ or is considered to be HER2positive for gene amplification by FISH, CISH, or other in situ hybridization (ISH) method. If local ISH test results are considered equivocal, the tumor can be submitted for central HER2 testing. (If local testing is not possible, the tumor can be submitted for central HER2 testing.) Central testing (a requirement for ALL patients) must demonstrate that the tumor is HER2positive which is defined as FISHpositive and/or IHC 3+. All of the following staging criteria (according to the 6th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual) must be met: By pathologic evaluation, primary tumor must be pT13; By pathologic evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be pN0, pN1 (pN1mi, pN1a, pN1b, pN1c), pN2a, pN3a, or pN3b. If pN0, at least one of the following criteria must be met: Pathologic tumor size &gt; 2.0 cm; ER negative and PgR negative; Histologic and/or nuclear grade 2 (intermediate) or 3 (high); or Age &lt; 35 years Patients must have undergone either a total mastectomy or breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy). For patients who undergo lumpectomy, the margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as determined by the local pathologist. If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after reexcision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS] are eligible without additional resection.) For patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible. Patients must have completed one of the following procedures for evaluation of pathologic nodal status: Sentinel lymphadenectomy followed by removal of additional nonsentinel lymph nodes if the sentinel node (SN) is positive; Sentinel lymphadenectomy alone if pathologic nodal staging based on sentinel lymphadenectomy is pN0, pN1mi or pN1b; or Axillary lymphadenectomy without SN isolation procedure. The interval between the last surgery for breast cancer (treatment or staging) and randomization must be at least 28 days but no more than 84 days. Patients must have ER analysis performed on the primary tumor prior to randomization. If ER analysis is negative, then PgR analysis must also be performed. The most recent postoperative blood counts, performed within 6 weeks prior to randomization, must meet the following criteria: ANC must be greater than or equal to 1200/mm3; Platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3; and Hemoglobin must be greater than or equal to 10 g/dL. The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met based on the results of the most recent postoperative tests performed within 6 weeks prior to randomization: total bilirubin must be less than or equal to upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab unless the patient has a bilirubin elevation &gt; ULN to 1.5 x ULN due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and AST must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab. Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be &gt; the ULN. Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase &gt; ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, PET scan, or PETCT scan performed within 3 months prior to randomization) does not demonstrate metastatic disease and the requirements for evidence of adequate hepatic function are met. Patients with alkaline phosphatase that is &gt; ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan,PET scan, or PETCT scan (performed within 3 months prior to randomization) does not demonstrate metastatic disease. The following criteria for renal function must be met based on the results of the most recent postoperative tests performed within 6 weeks prior to randomization: Serum creatinine must be less than or equal to ULN for the lab. Measured or calculated creatinine clearance must be &gt; 60 mL/min. A urine sample must be tested for protein by determination of the urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio or by urine dipstick. UPC ratio must be less than 1.0. Urine dipstick must indicate 01+ protein. If dipstick reading is greater than or equal to 2+, determine the UPC ratio, which must be less than 1.0, or collect a 24hour urine specimen, which must demonstrate &lt; 1.0 g of protein per 24 hours.
