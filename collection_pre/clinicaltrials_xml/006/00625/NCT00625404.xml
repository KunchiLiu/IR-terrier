	<brief_summary>This Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled HIV-negative women from 4 sites in 3 countries (Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa). The study's purpose was to investigate the safety and effectiveness of a once-daily Truvada® pill (compared with placebo) in preventing HIV among HIV-uninfected women at risk of becoming infected through sexual intercourse. The study population included HIV-antibody-negative women between the ages of 18-35 who were at risk of HIV acquisition through sexual intercourse. Each participant was randomized to take either a daily single oral tablet of Truvada®, which is a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine (FTC; 200 mg) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF; 300 mg), or an identical placebo. After enrollment, each participant was followed every four weeks. All participants were followed for an additional eight weeks after study drug was stopped. Incidence rates of HIV infection were compared between the two groups (active drug and placebo) using the intent-to-treat principle.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled HIV-negative women from 4 sites in 3 countries (Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa). The study's purpose was to investigate the safety and effectiveness of a once-daily Truvada® pill (compared with placebo) in preventing HIV among HIV-uninfected women at risk of becoming infected through sexual intercourse. The study population included HIV-antibody-negative women between the ages of 18-35 who were at risk of HIV acquisition through sexual intercourse. Each participant was randomized to take either a daily single oral tablet of Truvada®, which is a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine (FTC; 200 mg) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF; 300 mg), or an identical placebo. All participants received risk reduction counseling and condoms. Women had to be using a study-approved effective non-barrier contraceptive method at the time of enrollment and were asked to do so for the whole period they were on study drug. They received contraceptive counseling throughout the study. Any diagnosed, treatable sexually transmitted infection was treated free of charge. After enrollment, each participant was followed every four weeks. All participants were followed for an additional eight weeks after study drug was stopped. Participants at risk for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) flare were followed every four weeks for 12 weeks after stopping study product. Participants who acquired HIV infection during the study stopped taking the study drug at the time of HIV diagnosis, and will be followed for 52 weeks post diagnosis and were referred for care and treatment. Participants who became pregnant stopped taking the study drug but continued follow-up visits. Incidence rates of HIV infection were compared between the two groups (active drug and placebo) using the intent-to-treat principle.</detailed_description>
