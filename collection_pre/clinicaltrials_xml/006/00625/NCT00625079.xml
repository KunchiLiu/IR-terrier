	<brief_summary>Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) in the setting of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis(IPF)is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in the peri-lung transplant(LT) setting. Currently there is no significant data to support the use of pulmonary vasodilators for PAH in the setting of interstitial lung disease such as IPF. The majority of IPF patients have PAH either at rest or during exercise. The study hypothesis is that sildenafil may improve morbidity and mortality in the peri-LT setting in both IPF cohorts with either resting or exercise PAH.</brief_summary>
