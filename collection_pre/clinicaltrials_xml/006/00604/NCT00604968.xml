In case of liver metastases, ALAT and/or ASAT &lt;= 5 x upper normal limit. Adequate bone marrow function, ie: Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L; Neutrophils &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L; White Blood Cell (WBC) &gt;= 3.0 x 10^9/L; Hemoglobin &gt; 90 g/L. Life expectancy &gt;= 12 weeks. Patients having received oral and written information and having provided written informed consent. Patients will not be enrolled if any of the following conditions apply. Previous chemotherapy for metastatic disease. (The patient may have received previous endocrine therapy or singledrug Herceptin. Intrapleural or intrapericardial Novantrone is allowed.) Recurrence &lt;= 12 months after adjuvant anthracyclinecontaining treatment and/or prior doxorubicin &gt; 300 mg/m^2 or epirubicin &gt; 540 mg/m^2. Myocardial infarction within 6 months of planned inclusion. Symptomatic brain metastases. Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) positivity eligible for treatment with trastuzumab, or estrogen receptor (ER) positivity eligible for hormonal therapy. Allergy to anthracyclines. Uncontrolled infection. Other not radically treated malignancy. Other disease or condition contraindicating treatment or not allowing followup.</criteria>
