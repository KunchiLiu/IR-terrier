	<brief_summary>The present study intends to investigate the use of fractional doses of sanofi pasteur's IMOVAX Polio injected intradermally. The primary objective will be to demonstrate the non-inferiority of fractional doses of IMOVAX Polio administered intradermally versus full doses of IMOVAX Polio administered intramuscularly, in terms of seroprotection rates (polio types 1, 2 and 3) one month after the three-dose primary vaccination administered at 6-10-14 weeks of age.</brief_summary>
