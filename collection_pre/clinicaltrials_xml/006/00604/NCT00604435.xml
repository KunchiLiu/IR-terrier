	<brief_summary>This study was designed to determine the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant docetaxel and epirubicin (DE) with or without human recombinant endostatin (endostar) for breast cancer patients. The hypothesis of this protocol is that a combined angiogenesis inhibiting therapy to chemotherapy could further enhance the cytotoxic activity in breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is an open labelled, prospective, randomized, phase II clinical trial. A total of 60 patients with core-biopsy confirmed breast cancer, stage ⅡA to ⅢC, and to be treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy are eligible for entry into this study. Patients will be allocated randomly to two groups to receive either 3 cycles of neoadjuvant DE and endostar or 3 cycles of neoadjuvant DE. All cases receive mammography, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning pre- and post-neoadjuvant therapy, and then undergo surgical resection. The primary endpoint is clinical/pathological response. The secondary endpoint is (1) the safety and tolerability of the regimens, (2) the role of mammography, CEUS, MRA and PET for response evaluation, and (3) angiogenic profile and biological information involved in tumor response.</detailed_description>
