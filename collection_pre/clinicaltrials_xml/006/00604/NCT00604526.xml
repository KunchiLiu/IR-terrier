	<brief_summary>High dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy is a form of radiation treatment using temporary radioactive seeds. This is done by placing very tiny catheters or tubes into the prostate and then inserting temporary radioactive seeds, called Iridium 192, through these catheters. HDR brachytherapy gives precise radiation to the prostate with less radiation given to the normal tissues near the prostate. For patients who have been treated with external beam radiation to the prostate before, HDR brachytherapy can give radiation again to the prostate without exposing the normal tissues around the prostate to significantly more radiation. This may be safer than giving external beam radiation again. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of high dose rate temporary brachytherapy (HDR) for prostate cancer that has come back after external beam radiation. We want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the treatment has on you and your recurrent prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
