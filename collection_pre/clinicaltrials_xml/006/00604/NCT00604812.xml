	<brief_summary>A study to assess the safety, tolerability, and single dose pharmacokinetics of a marketed drug in pediatric subjects with migraines. After completion of a portion of the study (Panels A and B), a regulatory agency issued an amended request that the 12-17 year old age group studied should include a similar number of male and female subjects. Therefore, the study was amended to add an additional panel of subjects (Panel C) to ensure gender balance specifically in this age group.</brief_summary>
