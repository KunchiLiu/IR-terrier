	<brief_summary>A Descending Thoracic Aneurysm is a bulge in the aorta. The aorta is a large blood vessel that carries blood away from your heart to organs in the rest of your body. Your aneurysm is caused by a weakening in the artery wall. If left untreated, this bulge may continue to grow larger and may ultimately rupture (break open) or extend in size to seriously affect other major arteries in the area. In this Research Study a device will be placed inside your aorta to block the weakened part of the artery wall from the circulatory system. Information will be collected on the performance for the device for 5 years.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Talent Captivia Inclusion Criteria 1. Patient is at least 18 years of age. 2. Patient is a surgical or nonsurgical candidate 3. Patient has a: 1. Fusiform focal TAA AND / OR 2. Focal saccular TAA or penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer. 4. Subject's anatomy must meet all of the following anatomical criteria: 1. iliac/femoral access vessel morphology that is compatible with vascular access techniques, devices, and/or accessories 2. nonaneurysmal aortic diameter in the range of 1842mm; and 3. nonaneurysmal aortic proximal and distal neck lengths =/&gt;20mm 5. Thoracic aortic lesion is confirmed, at a minimum, by diagnostic contrast enhanced computerized tomography (CTA) with optional 3D reconstruction, and/or contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (MRA) obtained within the previous three (3) months prior to the implant procedure. 6. Subject or subject's legal representative understands and has signed an Informed Consent approved by the Sponsor and by the IRB for this study. 7. Patient must be able and willing to undergo followup imaging and examinations postoperatively up to 6 months. Talent Captivia Exclusion Criteria 1. Planned placement of the COVERED (top edge of fabric) portion of the stent graft requires implant to occur in zones 0 or 1 2. Pregnant female 3. Patient has a connective tissue disease (e.g Marfan's syndrome, medial degeneration). 4. Patient has a mycotic aneurysm or is suspected of having systemic infection. 5. Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis, coagulopathy, or refuses blood transfusions. 6. Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or device clinical trial that would interfere with the Talent Captivia protocol endpoints or followup. 7. The patient has known allergy or intolerance to the device components. 8. The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to anticoagulants or contrast media, which is not amenable to pretreatment. 9. The patient has another medical condition, which may cause them to be noncompliant with the protocol, confound the data interpretation, or limited life expectancy of less than 6 months.</criteria>
