	<brief_summary>A growing body of evidence suggests hyperglycemia is associated with adverse outcomes in patients with and without diabetes. Observational studies document an association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcomes in cardiothoracic surgery, elective surgery, myocardial infarction, stroke. Randomized studies indicate glycemic control is associated with improved outcomes in diabetic patients with critically illness. Hyperglycemia is a recognized and common complication of patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Few studies in the literature have looked into the impact of TPN-associated inhospital complications and mortality. Accordingly, this study aims to evaluate the impact of hyperglycemia on clinical outcome (infections, systemic sepsis, cardiac complications, acute renal failure, length of stay, and mortality) in patients receiving TPN. We will perform a retrospective chart review of all patients treated with TPN from 1/01/06 to 12/31/06 at Grady Memorial Hospital. We hypothesize that patients receiving TPN who develop hyperglycemia experience higher morbidity (infections, systemic sepsis, cardiac complications, acute renal failure, length of stay) and mortality compared to TPN patients with euglycemia. The results of this study will help us to formulate a prospective randomized clinical trial on the management of TPN-associated hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients. This study aims to evaluate the impact of hyperglycemia on clinical outcome (infections, systemic sepsis, cardiac complications, acute renal failure, length of stay, in hospital mortality) in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition. We will perform a retrospective chart review of all patients admitted to the hospital receiving TPN from 1/01/06 to 12/31/06 at Grady Memorial Hospital. The results of this study will help us to formulate a prospective randomized clinical trial on the management of TPN-associated hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients.</brief_summary>
