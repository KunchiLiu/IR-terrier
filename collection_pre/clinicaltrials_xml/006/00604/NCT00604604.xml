	<detailed_description>Many new mothers from diverse cultures experience postpartum depression (PPD), a serious form of maternal morbidity with well documented health consequences for the mother, child, and family. While the cause of PPD remains unclear, research consistently demonstrates the importance of psychosocial variables. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of peer (mother-to-mother) support on the prevention of PPD among mothers identified as high-risk. Public health nurses using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) screened mothers who were less than 2 weeks postpartum in the regions of Toronto, Peel, Halton, York, Windsor, Sudbury, and Ottawa. Eligible and consenting mothers were randomized to either a control group (usual postpartum care) or experimental group (usual postpartum care plus telephone-based support from an experienced mother who has participated in a 4-hour training session). Diverse study outcomes, including depressive symptomatology and health service utilization, were assessed at 12 and 24 weeks postpartum. The results from this trial will make substantive contributions in six areas: (1) develop the body of knowledge concerning the effectiveness of peer support in the prevention of PPD among at-risk mothers; (2) advance our understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of using peer volunteers as a complementary form of health care; (3) provide an economic evaluation of a peer support intervention; (4) offer a detailed analysis of peer support interactions including supportive functions provided, types of relationships developed, and health benefits perceived; (5) investigate the utility of screening at-risk mothers using the EPDS in general public health nursing practice; and (6) present valuable information regarding PPD among a multicultural Canadian population.</detailed_description>
