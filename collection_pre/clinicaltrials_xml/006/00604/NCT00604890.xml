	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of pharmaceutical compound (API 31510) topical cream topically applied to superficial basal cell carcinomas to obtain preliminary efficacy data for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinomas by API 31510 topical cream. The study population will include one hundred and sixty (160) otherwise healthy male or female adults with one or more histologically confirmed superficial basal cell carcinoma lesions. One target lesion with an area of less than one inch will be designated for study treatment.</brief_summary>
