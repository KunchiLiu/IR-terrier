	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study was to evaluate how effective the combination of Carboplatin, Bevacizumab (Avastin™) and, Pemetrexed (Alimta™) is in the treatment of patients with Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM). A combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed is considered standard for this disease and typically off protocol patients would receive cisplatin or carboplatin and pemetrexed as standard of care. The planned length of the study (first patient screened to last patient enrolled) was 24 months. The planned length of the entire study (enrollment period + the treatment period + a follow-up period of at least 12 months) was 36 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin, Bevacizumab and Pemetrexed in the First-Line Treatment of Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a planned Phase I/II dose escalation study. Patients were enrolled in a cohort of 3. Eligible patients with unresectable pleural mesothelioma received frontline treatment consisting of carboplatin AUC 5, bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, and pemetrexed 500 mg/m^2 every 21 days (Tier-1). Dose escalation continued to achieve a target dosage using carboplatin AUC 6 (Tier-2). After a maximum of 6 treatment cycles, non-progressing patients received maintenance therapy with bevacizumab and pemetrexed every 21 days to complete 1-year total treatment duration.</detailed_description>

Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Patient must have adequate renal function with a serum creatinine level of less than 1.5 mg/dl and patient should have a calculated creatinine clearance of more than 40ml/min. Patient must have adequate hepatic function with a serum bilirubin level of less that 3mg/dl, and an alkaline phosphatase, ALT and AST of less than five times the upper limit of normal Patient must also have evidence of adequate bone marrow function with an absolute neutrophil count of more than 1500 cells per deciliter and a platelet count of more than 100,000 per deciliter. Patients must be more than 28 days since prior open biopsy; more than 7 days since prior fineneedle aspiration; more than 7 days since prior core biopsy; more than 28 days since prior surgery. Patients must be able to take dexamethasone, folic acid, and vitamin B12 supplementation. All patients must sign informed consent that will detail the investigational nature of the study in accordance with the institutional and federal guidelines. Patients with clinically significant pleural effusions or ascites (symptomatic or detectable by clinical exam) should have their effusions drained prior to enrollment on the clinical trial. Patients with hypercalcemia (corrected calcium of more than 11 mg/dl) will be excluded. Patients with history of hemoptysis, haematemesis, coagulopathy or thrombosis will be excluded. Patients requiring anticoagulation for any reason will be excluded. History of palliative radiation therapy within 2 weeks Blood pressure of &gt;160/100 mmHg, despite adequate antihypertensive use.
