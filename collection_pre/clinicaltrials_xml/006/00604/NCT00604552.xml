	<brief_summary>The aorta is a large blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart to the organs in the rest of the body. An aneurysm is a weakening in the artery wall that will become a bulge in the aorta. If left untreated, this bulge may continue to grow larger and may rupture (break open) with fatal consequences. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening lesion that has been treated in recent year via endovascular repair. The purpose of this study is to monitor the long term performance of the AneuRx Stent Graft Systems.</brief_summary>
