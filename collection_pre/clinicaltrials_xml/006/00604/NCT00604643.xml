	<brief_summary>An evaluation of the TALENT Aortic Cuff in patients with existing AneuRx stent grafts who have experienced sub-optimal stent graft outcomes and are not deemed suitable candidates for treatment with an AneuRx Aortic Cuff.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Talent Aortic Cuff Stent Graft System Compassionate Use Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this registry is to provide an endovascular means of treatment for those patients experiencing a sub-optimal outcome related to the implanted AneuRx bifurcated stent graft and who are not deemed suitable candidates for treatment with an AneuRx Aortic Cuff. A sub-optimal outcome is defined as either a Type I or Type III endoleak and/or an inadequate seal zone (&lt; 1 cm). For Registry purposes, a Type III endoleak will be defined as a proximal modular endoleak.</detailed_description>
