	<brief_summary>This modular Program will first confirm the safety and efficacy of Paromomycin IM Injection when given to an expanded population in the outpatient setting in experienced VL centers and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of an expanded access model of providing Paromomycin IM Injection to progressively more resource-constrained clinics in Bihar, India.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expand Access/Assess Safety and Efficacy of Paromomycin IM Injection for the Treatment of Visceral Leishmaniasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Safe, effective, and affordable treatments for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) that are widely available to the poorest population of rural India where the disease is endemic are urgently needed. Resistance to antimonials, which have historically been the first line of treatment for VL in Bihar and adjoining states, is a major problem. Other available treatments are limited by their high cost, toxicity, or contraindications in certain populations. Paromomycin IM Injection was approved for the treatment of VL in August 2006 by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI). The study is designed to establish a Phase 4 Access Program in a modular, stepwise fashion (Modules 1 to 3). The study will first confirm the safety and efficacy of Paromomycin IM Injection in an expanded VL population treated as an outpatient in experienced centers (Module 1); and then progressively extend the network of treatment facilities, the number and reach of the trained staff, and the implementation of the requisite logistics systems to rural Bihar (Modules 2 and 3). An expanded network of healthcare workers will be trained and supervised to make a preliminary diagnosis of VL; to make appropriate referrals to confirm the diagnosis of VL; to treat with Paromomycin IM Injection; and to assess patient safety and clinical response on an outpatient basis.</detailed_description>
