	<brief_title>Quality of Life, Recombinant TSH (Thyrogen) and Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with a thyroid follicular or papillary cancer referred to radioiodine treatment in oncological department . The patients after thyroidectomy will be treated with Liothyronine and this treatment will be paused 10 days before radioiodine. As a routine these patients will be re-evaluated with iodine uptake 4 months later. The patients will be randomised to either T3 pause related to the first radioiodine treatment and Thyrogen injection (recombinant TSH) related to the second treatment/uptake - or Thyrogen related to the first treatment and T3 pause related to the second treatment /uptake. All medication given in the 10 days period right before radioiodine treatment/uptake will be delivered to the patients and marked with a protocol number. In the period with T3 pause the patients will be given placebo tablets and an injection of saline (instead of Thyrogen) before treatment/uptake at the similar time as given the Thyrogen injection. A nurse otherwise not involved in the study will give the injection. Patients will be evaluated by VAS, SF-36, and Eortc QLC30 (version 2.0) before radioiodine treatment and 3 weeks after treatment.</detailed_description>
