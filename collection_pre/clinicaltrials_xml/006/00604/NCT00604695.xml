	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to gather preliminary data regarding the angiographic efficacy of the administration of low-dose adjunctive intracoronary (IC) tenecteplase during balloon angioplasty for heart attacks. We hypothesize that low-dose IC tenecteplase will enhance the breakdown of blood clots at the site of the culprit lesion leading to reduced damage to the heart muscle.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety/Efficacy Study of Intra-coronary Tenecteplase During Balloon Angioplasty to Treat Heart Attacks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to gather preliminary data regarding the angiographic efficacy of the administration of low-dose adjunctive intracoronary (IC) tenecteplase during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Efficacy will be assessed by measurements of both the angiographic characteristics of the culprit lesion as well as by measurements of epicardial flow and myocardial perfusion in the territory of the infarct-related artery. This study will also evaluate the safety of administering low-dose IC tenecteplase to subjects undergoing primary PCI for STEMI treated with standard therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors). Safety endpoints include the incidence of death, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), abrupt vessel closure, subacute stent thrombosis, and TIMI major and minor bleeding events. Prompt reperfusion therapy with primary PCI in patients with STEMI improves clinical outcomes through salvage of myocardial tissue. The proposed pilot trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive low-dose IC tenecteplase in conjunction with standard medical therapy during primary PCI for STEMI. We hypothesized that low-dose IC tenecteplase will enhance fibrinolysis at the site of the culprit lesion leading to reduced microvascular dysfunction. As reduced dose tenecteplase will be injected directly into the coronary artery increasing local concentration of the drug with minor systemic effects, an improved safety profile is also expected from this mode of administration.</detailed_description>
