	<brief_summary>estimate the sensitivity of the HMP test in identifying visual field functional defects in subjects with CNV secondary to AMD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensitivity of the Home Macular Perimeter (HMP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HMP device is intended to aid patients in identifying their visual abnormalities and in addition to their own symptoms or Amsler grid use and aid in their prompt referral to eye care professional examination so clinical diagnosis can be made. As such the goal of the clinical plan is to demonstrate that patients who have CNV do demonstrate visual field abnormalities when tested with the HMP</detailed_description>
