	<brief_summary>The first few weeks after leaving the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) can be a difficult transition time for caregivers of a previously hospitalized infant. To help ease this stressful period, doctors and nurses give caregivers a large amount of information prior to their infant leaving the NCIU. How much caregivers remember about medications, follow-up appointments, and general well-child care has not been studied. Caregivers who choose to participate will receive a phone call 2-7 days after discharge where they will be asked questions pertaining to the information that was discussed with them at the time of discharge. The purpose of the study is to determine how much information caregivers retain after leaving the NICU.</brief_summary>
