	<brief_summary>An investigator initiated study exploring VTE prophylaxis at the time of hospital discharge.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retrospective Study to Review Patients at Risk for VTE at Hospital Discharge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It appears likely that many patients will remain at risk for VTE at the time of hospital discharge. These risks will go unrecognized, and discharge prophylaxis orders will not be prescribed. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a retrospective review of approximately 2,500 patients at Brigham and Women's Hospital at risk for VTE at the time of hospital discharge to determine what proportion received VTE prophylaxis. We will correlate the implementation of discharge VTE prophylaxis with the occurrence of symptomatic DVT and pulmonary embolism within 90 days of hospital discharge. We will also conduct a substudy of this patient population to determine adherence to VTE prophylaxis among hospitalized patients.</detailed_description>
