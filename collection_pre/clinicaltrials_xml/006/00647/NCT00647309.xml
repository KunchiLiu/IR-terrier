	<brief_summary>Elevated troponin is powerful and independent adverse prognostic marker in patient with ACS. However, non specific (non cardiac) troponin elevation is a common finding among hospitalized patients and worse prognosis too. The aim of this study is examine the prevalence of incidental cardiac troponin rise in a group of patient aged 65 and over admitted to geriatric department with hip fracture, and influence of troponin elevation on outcomes like ACS, death, motor and cognitive function.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>data collection will include epidemiological data (age, gender, living arrangement, basic functional status, fracture date, surgery date, surgery type, length of stay) as well as previous comorbidities. in addition, routine blood tests and baseline ECG will be recorded. troponin levels will be studied within 24 hours from admission, and 24 hours following surgery. in case of elevated troponin levels, ECG will be repeated, and echocardiography together with a cardiologist evaluation will be carried out. data regarding in-hospital complications, motor and cognitive function (by FIM scale) and lab will be recorded. after discharge. followup will be recorded every 3 months, up to 1 year period, recoding the above mentioned data.</detailed_description>
