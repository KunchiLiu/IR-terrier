	<criteria>Persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), AF persistence for &gt; 7 days but &lt; 1 year Total AF history &lt; 2 years Written informed consent of the patient Age ≥18 years Female patients are sterilised or postmenopausal or apply an adequate method for contraception (Pearl index &lt;1%) and have a negative pregnancy test (ßHCG) and do not breastfeed/nurse. Hemodynamic instability or symptoms not allowing cardioversion to be delayed for 3 weeks Myocardial infarction within the last 3 months Heart failure NYHA class III IV Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as a systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95 mm Hg (antihypertensive treatment is allowed). Pretreatment with an aldosterone antagonist or other potassium sparing diuretics Instable angina pectoris Use of Digitalis Use of class I or class III antiarrhythmic drugs (must be stopped at least 5 halflife before) Contraindication or hypersensitivity to ßblockers Open heart surgery within the last 3 months Pregnancy Acute and reversible illnesses Acute and chronic infection Alcohol or drug abuse or a severe progressive extracardiac disease Untreated manifest and latent hyper or hypothyroidism or &lt; 3 months peripheral euthyroidism (normal fT3) Moderate to severe renal insufficiency (Creatinine clearance less than 50 ml/min) Patients with liver cirrhosis (ChildPugh class C) Coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. Itraconazole, Ketoconazole, Ritonavir, Nelfinavir, Clarithromycin, Telithromycin and Nephazodon) Hypersensitivity against Eplerenone and/or one of the other components of the tablet (see Fachinformation) Serum potassium &gt; 5 mmol/l Patients unlikely to comply with the protocol</criteria>
