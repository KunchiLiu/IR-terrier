	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy during and after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving radiation therapy during and after lumpectomy and to see how well it works in treating women with stage I or stage II breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy During and After Lumpectomy in Treating Women With Stage I or Stage II Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the feasibility and acute tolerability of intraoperative electron radiotherapy (IOERT) and external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) after lumpectomy in women with stage I or II breast cancer treated with breast conservation therapy. - To determine the local tumor control and distant tumor control rates in these patients. - To determine the long-term side effects and cosmetic outcome of IOERT to the tumor bed and EBRT after lumpectomy in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard lumpectomy. Patients with negative lymph nodes undergo intraoperative electron radiotherapy to the tumor bed. Beginning 2-8 weeks after surgery, patients undergo whole breast external beam radiotherapy once daily for 24-27 fractions. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 8 years.</detailed_description>
