	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of exercise during pregnancy upon maternal metabolism, including weight gain, fat distribution, and levels of glucose and cholesterol. We will also conduct a pilot study to examine the feasibility of studying the health of infants born to women in this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Physical Activity on Metabolic Syndrome in Pregnancy &amp; Fetal Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity and overweight have become important public health problems in the United States, and measures are urgently needed to address these issues. For many women, pregnancy is a time of excessive weight gain and decreases in physical fitness, both of which may be followed by postpartum weight retention. Women who develop hypertension or diabetes mellitus during pregnancy are at higher risk for development of these disorders in the future. Because of the implications of pregnancy-related weight gain and the metabolic changes during pregnancy for future maternal health, interventions to maintain or improve fitness during pregnancy may have important downstream health effects. In addition, maternal metabolic parameters and the intra-uterine environment have important implications for neonatal outcomes and subsequent child health. This study will provide data about the effects of an intervention to increase vigorous physical activity during pregnancy on short-term maternal and fetal outcomes.</detailed_description>
