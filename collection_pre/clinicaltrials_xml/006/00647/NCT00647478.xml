	<brief_summary>The aim is to assess the relationship between levels of IGF-I system components and cognitive status in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), in elderly subjects with normal cognitive function, and in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>System-IGF-1 Pathway and Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AD is the most common cause of dementia. During aging, decline of biological brain functions due to a number of genetic and environmental factors facilitates the onset of AD. MCI includes prodromal AD. The identification of the risk factors for AD must be a priority in order to define the best therapeutic approach. Recent data support the notion that IGF-I pathway accounts for neuronal protection, with a dual effect, on both brain AÎ² peptide and tau protein. This large, multicenter, prospective, observational, cross-sectional population-based study in 3 parallel groups (200 participants per group) is aimed to assess differences between IGF-I and IGFBP3 circulating levels and polymorphisms in AD patients and control elderly subjects, and in MCI patients.</detailed_description>
