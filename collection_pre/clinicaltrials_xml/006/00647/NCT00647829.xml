	<brief_summary>The study was performed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety, and tolerability of valdecoxib 20 mg twice daily (BID), valdecoxib 40 mg once daily (QD), and placebo in patients with moderately to severely painful symptomatic sore throat over a 24-hour period. In addition, the study was to validate a new scale and criteria for measuring pain in sore throat and evaluate the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and past sore throat pain on pain score and efficacy of analgesics. The study also examined what type of medications are commonly used for sore throat and whether this information has relevance to analgesic efficacy.</brief_summary>
