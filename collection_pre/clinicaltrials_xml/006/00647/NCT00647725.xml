	<brief_summary>Painless labor is an essential part in woman's health care. Labor analgesia in the active phrase is in popular use currently. However, parturients are still haunted by the labor delivery pain in the latent phrase up to 7-8 hours, especially for the nulliparas. Therefore, we hypothesized that labor analgesia in the latent phrase of the first delivery stage would provide superior health care for laboring women. In addition, such analgesia technique would not prolong the time of uterine dilation and labor delivering.</brief_summary>
