	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to estimate the usefulness of QuantiFERON TB Gold In-Tube® and T-SPOT.TB® for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis in HIV infected antiretroviral naive patients: 80 originated from low TB prevalence countries, without any active TB; 80 HIV infected antiretroviral naïve patients originated from high TB prevalence countries, without any active TB, 40 HIV infected patients with active TB and 40 HIV negative patients with active TB.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to estimate the usefulness of QuantiFERON TB Gold In-Tube and T-SPOT.TB for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis in this population. Concordance between TST, QuantiFERON TB Gold and T-SPOT.TB will be assessed in patients with different risks of TB, in a transversal study. This study will include 240 patients during 2 years: 80 HIV infected antiretroviral naïve patients originated from low TB prevalence countries, without any active TB (40 patients with CD4 cell count &gt; 350/mm3, 40 with CD4 &lt; 350/mm3), 80 HIV infected antiretroviral naïve patients originated from high TB prevalence countries, without any active TB, 40 HIV infected patients with active TB and 40 HIV negative patients with active TB. TST and the 2 blood interferon gamma assay will be compared according to the level of risk. The improvement of latent TB diagnosis in HIV infected patients may lead to the initiation of TB prophylaxis and decrease the incidence of this life threatening disease.</detailed_description>
