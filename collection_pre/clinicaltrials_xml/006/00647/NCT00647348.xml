	<criteria>Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and at randomisation have entered the secondary progressive stage. Steady progression rather than relapse must be the major cause of increasing disability in the preceding 2 years. Progression can be evident from either an increase of at least one point on the EDSS or clinical documentation of increasing disability. EDSS 4.0 6.5 inclusive Women of childbearing age will be required to use appropriate methods of contraception to avoid the unlikely teratogenic effects of simvastatin. Able to give written informed consent 18 65 years Unable to give informed consent Primary progressive MS Those that have experienced a relapse or have been treated with steroids (both i.v. and oral) within 3 months of the screening visit. These patients may undergo a further screening visit once the 3 month window has expired and may be included if no steroid treatment has been administered in the intervening period. Patient is already taking or is anticipated to be taking a statin. Any medications that unfavourably interact with statins: fibrates, nicotinic acid, cyclosporine, azole antifungal preparations, macrolideantibiotics, protease inhibitors, nefazodone, verapamil, amiodarone, large amounts of grapefruit juice or alcohol abuse. The use of immunosuppressants (e.g. azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporine) or disease modifying treatments (avonex, rebif, betaferon, glatiramer) within the previous 6 months. The use of mitoxantrone if treated within the last 12 months. If the patient has ever been treated with alemtuzumab. If screening levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or creatine kinase (CK) are three times the upper limit of normal patients should be excluded. Patient unable to tolerate baseline scan or scan not of adequate quality for analysis (e.g. too much movement artefact). If a female patient is pregnant or breast feeding</criteria>
