Docetaxel and carboplatin will be given on day 1 of every three week cycle. Patients will take Sorafenib twice a day on the 1st day of treatment and continue to take the medication every day until progression of disease, prohibitive toxicity, or patient withdrawal from the study. Chemotherapy courses will repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for a total of four cycles.</brief_summary>
