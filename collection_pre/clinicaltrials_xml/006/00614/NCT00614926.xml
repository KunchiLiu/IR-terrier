	<brief_title>Modafinil for Treatment of Fatigue in ALS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ALS is an untreatable, progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease whose etiology is unknown and whose course is relatively rapid (median survival 3 years after diagnosis). Palliative care, including symptom management, can contribute greatly to improved quality of life. In this context, alleviation of fatigue can help maintain function, extend the duration of time when employment is feasible for those still working, and can enable patients to more fully participate in and enjoy social and recreational activities. Given the prevalence of fatigue in this population, identification of effective treatment is a meaningful goal.</detailed_description>
