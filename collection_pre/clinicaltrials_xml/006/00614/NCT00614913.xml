	<brief_title>Proton Beam Therapy for Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of primary cancer of the liver that is being diagnosed in the U.S. population with increasing frequency. While surgery is the first line of treatment, many patients are not eligible for surgical removal. Current non-surgical treatments for HCC are not fully effective and can have substantial side-effects. This study utilizes a type of radiation treatment called proton beam that can deliver high doses of radiotherapy to tumors within the liver while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. The treatment is non-invasive and is given on an out-patient basis over a three week coarse. The study will evaluate the effectiveness and side-effects of this therapy by tracking patient's outcomes following treatment.</detailed_description>
