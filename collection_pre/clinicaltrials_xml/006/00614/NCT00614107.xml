	<brief_summary>A form of irregular heart rate called, Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a major clinical problem. It afflicts about 2 million Americans and is the single largest heart related cause of stroke. However, despite 120 years of speculation and research, the mechanisms that cause AF are poorly understood. Acute AF is also the most common irregular heart rate after open-heart surgery in patients. This is seen in as many as 30% of such patients and often results in a longer hospital stay. In this study we would like to study the pattern of atrial fibrosis (scar tissue in the heart) and an associated blood marker (a protein called pro-collagen-1) in those patients concurrently having open heart surgery.</brief_summary>
