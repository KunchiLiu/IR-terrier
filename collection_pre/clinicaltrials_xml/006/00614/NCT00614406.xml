	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that the use of a prostaglandin inhibitor will result in premature luteolysis (ovulation failure) in women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of a Prostaglandin Inhibitor on Ovulation and the Menstrual Cycle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently available methods of emergency contraception (EC) only work during a very narrow time period prior to the hormonal trigger for ovulation or the release of an egg. Women having unprotected sex outside this window receive no benefits from this emergency therapy. Prostaglandins are critical before, during, and after ovulation, thus their inhibition may cause an EC effect that works over a longer time period. We wanted to determine if celecoxib might work as an EC with a wider window of action.</detailed_description>
