	<brief_title>Novel Topical Treatment of Hand Dermatitis (Eczema)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hand dermatitis was chosen for investigation due to high incidence and typical symmetrical involvement that allows for right/left treatment comparisons. Hand dermatitis is also important due to its implication on healthcare workers in particular, where frequent hand washing and chronic occlusion from gloving, provide a route for skin sensitization to natural rubber latex proteins increase the risk of colonization of microorganisms on the skin, and thereby increase the likelihood of contact dermatitis. This feasibility study will be performed to evaluate the efficacy of PVDF coatings in treating chronic hand dermatitis.</detailed_description>
