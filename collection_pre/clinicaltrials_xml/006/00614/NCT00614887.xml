	<brief_summary>Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) may cause damage to the hypotalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) thus disturbing the hormonal response of these structures. The aim of our study is to characterize the function of HPA-axis acutely and over time up to three months in patients with SAH.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypothalamo-, Pituitary-, Adrenal Axis Dysfunction in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypotalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis may be affected in SAH by temporary or permanent damage to the hypothalamus and/or pituitary gland. Also surgery or endovascular treatment of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm may affect the hormonal response of the HPA-axis. Some data suggest a high incidence of delayed endocrine abnormalities in patients with SAH but only little data exists on the acute endocrine abnormalities in this disease. We will study the pituitary-adrenal hormone levels in patients with acute aneurysmal SAH and patients admitted for elective cranial aneurysm surgery will serve as a control population. We will use serum free cortisol calculation and total cortisol measurements as well as adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test in assessing the responsiveness of the adrenal gland to exogenous ACTH. The hormone levels will be measured repeatedly during the first seven days after SAH and once at three months.</detailed_description>
