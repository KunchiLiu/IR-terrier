	<brief_summary>This 3 arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of PEGASYS + entecavir combination therapy in treatment-naive patients with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B. Patients will be randomized to receive 1)PEGASYS 180 micrograms s.c./week for 48 weeks, 2)PEGASYS 180 micrograms s.c./week for 48 weeks + entecavir 0.5mg p.o. once daily from week 13 to week 36 or 3) entecavir 0.5mg p.o. once daily for 24 weeks + PEGASYS 180 micrograms s.c./week from week 21 to 68.
