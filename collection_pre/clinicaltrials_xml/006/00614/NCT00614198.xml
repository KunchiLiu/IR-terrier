	<brief_summary>A growing body of research indicates that dietary intervention excluding foods containing the proteins, gluten and casein, from the diet of children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have a positive effect on behaviour and developmental outcome. In this single-blind, randomised-controlled, matched-pair adaptive trial, we introduced a gluten- and casein-free (GFCF) diet to a group of pre-pubescent children diagnosed with ASD concurrently with an abnormal urinary profile. Following random allocation to a diet or non- diet group, stage 1 of the study saw an intervention group follow the GFCF diet for eight months initially - progressing to 12 months if required. A non-diet control group continued with a normal diet. Assuming significant changes for the dietary group on the various outcome measures of behaviour and development, stage 2 of the study saw both groups assigned to GFCF dietary intervention for a further 12 months when outcome measures were again assessed at study end.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligibility criteria: diagnosis of autism, no co-morbid diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome, epilepsy or tuberous sclerosis, aged between 4-10y11m. Experimental hypothesis: children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on a GFCF diet would show a significantly improved group developmental outcome in the medium- and long-term with regards to core autism and/or secondary symptoms. Main outcome measures: change in scores of dietary participants on one or more measures against predefined statistical thresholds as evidence of improvement, alongside changes to intra- and inter-group scores at study endpoint. Main outcome measures ascertained by: Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), Gillam Autism Rating Scale (GARS), Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales (VABS), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder - IV (ADHD-IV) scales.</detailed_description>
