	<brief_summary>This study will compare Eustachian tube function (ETF) testing in adults with intact tympanic membranes (TM) using a pressure chamber to that obtained using standard methods requiring a non-intact TM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eustachian Tube Testing in a Pressure Chamber -- Validation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to introduce new test methods and protocols to our laboratory for better clinical characterization of Eustachian tube function in ears with intact TM's. These test will be done in a pressure-chamber and will use previously published and newly developed methods. Participation will require a minimum of 5 visits to the ENT Research Center, 1 for myringotomy (putting a small hole in the eardrum) and 4 for ETF testing. Hearing testing will be done at entry and exit; otoscopy (looking at the ears) and tympanometry (a test done with an earplug and varying pressures in the ear canal) are done at every visit.</detailed_description>
