	<brief_summary>Objective: The overall objective is to investigate whether a steroid free immunosuppressive regimen is as safe and effective as a steroid containing regimen following pediatric liver transplantation and whether it promotes tolerance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Trial of Pediatric Liver Transplantation Without Steroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3.2 Research question Is it possible to avoid the use of corticosteroids in pediatric liver transplantation? 3.3 Trial objectives This will be a pilot study to i) investigate to what degree a steroid free immunosuppressive regimen is as safe and effective as a steroid containing regimen following pediatric liver transplantation ii) investigate the effect of a steroid free immunosuppressive regimen on lymphocyte function and donor-specific immune responsiveness following pediatric liver transplantation iii) investigate the effect of a steroid free immunosuppressive regimen on expression of tissue markers of tolerance following pediatric liver transplantation It is hoped that this pilot study will be used to develop a definitive multicentre study of a steroid free regimen.</detailed_description>
