	<criteria>Male subjects aged between 18 and 50 years inclusive. Body mass index within the range 1929.9kg/m2 (inclusive), with weight range of 50 kg100 kg (inclusive). Healthy (defined as individuals who are free from significant nasal, cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, haematological, malignancy, endocrine, neurological and psychiatric disease as determined by history, physical examination and screening investigations). Nonsmoking status as verified by urinary cotinine levels below 500 ng/mL cotinine at the screening visit. This can include exsmokers who have given up smoking for &gt;1 year. Normal nasal examination as per Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) assessment No significant ECG abnormalities and QTc (B) &lt;450 msec. The subject is able and willing to give written informed consent to take part in the study and is available to complete all study measurements. Male subjects must agree to abstain from or use a condom during sexual intercourse with female partners of childbearing potential, to prevent either pregnancy in the female partner or the possible exposure of a pregnant or lactating female to the investigational product from the male subject's semen. In addition, female partners of male subjects must use a reliable contraceptive method listed in the protocol, or they must refrain from sexual intercourse from the first dose of study medication until 84 days after the last dose. As a result of the medical interview, physical examination or screening investigations, the Investigator or appropriately qualified designee considers the subject unfit for the study. The subject has a history of drug or any other allergy, which, in the opinion of the Investigator or appropriately qualified designee, contraindicates their participation, including known or suspected personal history or family history of adverse reactions or hypersensitivity to anti histamines The subject has participated in a study with a new molecular entity during the previous 3 months or any other study during the previous 2 months. The subject regularly, or on average, drinks more than 21 units of alcohol a week or more than an average intake of 3 units per day. The subject is currently taking regular (or a course of) medication, prescribed (including all betaagonists) or not (including over the counter medication or herbal remedies such as St Johns Wort). Paracetamol is an exception and will be permitted at daily doses of up to 4g following the first dose of investigational product. The subject has tested positive for hepatitis C antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen. The subject has tested positive for HIV. The subject has a positive drugs of abuse and alcohol test. Donation during the study would result in &gt;500mL of blood being donated over a 56 day period Subjects with structural nasal abnormalities frequent nose bleeds, Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (PAR) and Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (SAR) unless subjects with SAR are asymptomatic and it is outside of the pollen season Subjects who are unable to comply with study procedures Subject is the Investigator or any subinvestigator, research assistant, pharmacist, study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of the study Vulnerable subjects (eg. persons kept in detention)</criteria>
