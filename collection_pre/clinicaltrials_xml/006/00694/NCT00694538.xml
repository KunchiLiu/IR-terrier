	<brief_title>Efficacy of Interferential Laser Therapy in Shoulder Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The spatiotemporal superposition of two independent and opposite beams of laser generates a constructive interference pattern that increases the therapeutic effects in the irradiated tissue. Patients diagnosed of shoulder pain from different musculoskeletal disorders will received conventional or interferential laser therapy. This is a comparative, randomized and double - blind clinical study. Two identical equipments of near infrared laser therapy will be used. Number of sessions: 15. Frequency of the sessions: daily. Irradiation technique: manual, contact and punctual.Pain will be evaluated by visual analog scale (VAS) at rest and during analytical shoulder movements (abduction, adduction, internal rotation, external rotation, flexion, extension) and by means of a pain and disability index (SPADI). Evaluations will take place at pre and post treatment.</detailed_description>
