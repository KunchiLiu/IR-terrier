	<brief_summary>This study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of rabies vaccine and Japanese encephalitis vaccine in toddlers. All children developed adequate immune responses. Rabies vaccination with PCECV did not interfere with the antibody response to Japanese encephalitis vaccine. The rabies vaccine PCECV and Japanese encephalitis vaccine are safe and immunogenic when administered concomitantly to toddlers.</brief_summary>
