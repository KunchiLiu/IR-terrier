	<brief_title>Vinorelbine Metronomic Plus Bevacizumab as Salvage Therapy for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Continuous administration of oral vinorelbine, given three times a week (metronomic) is feasible and exceptionally well tolerated at doses up to 50 mg. Early results show activity against refractory tumors and provide evidence towards clinical proof of efficacy for metronomic chemotherapy. Recently, initial therapy of metastatic breast cancer with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab demonstrated prolonged progression-free survival, as compared with paclitaxel alone.</detailed_description>
