	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Autologous Endothelial Progenitor Cell CD 133 for Therapeutic Angiogenesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PROGENITOR trial is a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter controlled trial including patients with Canadian cardiovascular society angina classification (CCS): II-IV and ischemic zones by SPECT but without any option for revascularization. Primary endpoint was to assess the safety and feasibility of transendocardial injection of selected CD133+cells. All patients were treated for 4-days with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and underwent apheresis. CD133+ cells were selected with CliniMacs system and were injected transendocardially guided by the NOGA XP system.</detailed_description>
