	<brief_summary>This pilot study will investigate the efficacy of SAM-e for the treatment of recurrent abdominal pain in children. This will be an open-labeled study and all participants will receive SAM-e therapy. Given that SAM-e has been demonstrated to improve symptoms of depression and pain with minimal side effects as compared to other antidepressant therapy, we hypothesize that SAM-e will reduce pain symptoms among children with recurrent abdominal pain.</brief_summary>
