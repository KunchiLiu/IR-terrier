	<brief_summary>We hypothesized that weekly intramuscular injections of 17 hydroxyprogesterone caproate(17P) will reduce the number spontaneous preterm births prior to 35 weeks gestation when compared to cerclage therapy. The purpose of this study was to compare medical therapy with 17P to surgical therapy with transvaginal cerclage in patients with an ultrasound diagnosed short cervix and funnel in the mid-trimester.</brief_summary>
