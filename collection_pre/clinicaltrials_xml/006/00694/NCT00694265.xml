	<brief_summary>In wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) the sonographically measured largest cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve is increased. We compared the changes in largest CSA in wrists undergoing surgical decompression and wrists undergoing conservative treatment of CTS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: In wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) the sonographically measured largest cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve is increased. We compared the changes in largest CSA in wrists undergoing surgical decompression and wrists undergoing conservative treatment of CTS. Methods: Prospective cohort study in 55 consecutive patients with 78 wrists with established CTS, including 60 wrists with surgical decompression and 18 wrists with conservative treatment. A sonographic examination was scheduled before and at 4 months after initiation of treatment. Changes in CSA between wrists with surgical and wrists with conservative treatment were compared using linear regression models.</detailed_description>
