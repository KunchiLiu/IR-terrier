	<criteria>1. Informed Consent obtained &amp; signed: Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 2. Disease characteristics: Patients with BCG refractory superficial transitional cell carcinoma, refractory carcinoma in situ, multiple unresected T1 and Ta high grade. BCGrefractory STCC is defined as when there is failure to achieve diseasefree state at six months after initiation of BCG therapy either as primary or repeat therapy or recurrence of tumor within three months of completion of adequate induction or maintenance therapy or adequate retreatment. . 3. Patient Characteristics: Age: 18 completed years and above Performance status: ECOG 02 Life expectancy: At least 24 weeks Hematopoietic:Hemoglobin â‰¥ 9.0 g/dL Comorbidity No patient who has eczema will be allowed to participate in this study. Patients who are immunocompromised will not be enrolled. Patients with severe hepatic dysfunctions or with evidence of Cirrhosis will not be enrolled. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus will not be enrolled in the study. Note: The effects of Investigational product on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Patients who have had cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to entering the study. Intractable urinary tract infection. No patient who has eczema should be allowed to participate in this study. Patients who are immunocompromised should not be enrolled. Patients with severe hepatic dysfunctions or evidence of Cirrhosis should not be enrolled. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to agents used in the study. Pregnant women or nursing women are excluded from this study because agents used in the study have potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is known potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with investigational agent, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with investigational product. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Previous splenectomy Clinically significant active infection Patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.</criteria>
