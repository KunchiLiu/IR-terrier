	<brief_title>Choice Of Optimal Strategy For Bifurcation Lesions With Normal Side Branch</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among the bifurcation type, bifurcation lesion without significant side branch stenosis (&lt;50%) usually did not require side branch stenting, but owing to several putative mechanism including dissection, thrombosis formation, embolization of plaque debris, ostial compromise by displaced stent strut, and snow plow effect, the side branch might be compromised. In this situation, the strategy to achieve optimal results has not been reported. Recently, FFR study showed that most jailed side branch (vessel size &gt;2.0 mm. DS&gt;50%) after main branch stenting did not have functional significance. We compared strategies with or without routine kissing balloon dilatation for less than 50% stenosis after simple DES crossing for bifurcation lesions (bifurcation type 1.1.0, 1.0.0, and 0.1.0 according to Medina classification) with serial change of FFR measurement.</detailed_description>
