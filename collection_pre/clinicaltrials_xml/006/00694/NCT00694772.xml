	<brief_summary>Removal of the adenoid and tonsils, known as an adenotonsillectomy (AT) is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in North America. The two most prevalent indications for this procedure in children are recurrent bacterial tonsillitis and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is a common childhood condition that is characterized by upper airway obstruction, disturbed sleep and disrupted normal respiratory gas exchange. In the majority of children with OSA, overgrowth of the adenoid and tonsils is the primary underlying aetiology, making tissue removal via AT the standard of care. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two different surgical techniques, electrocautery-tonsillectomy and coblation-tonsillotomy, in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children.</brief_summary>
