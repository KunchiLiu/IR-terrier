	<brief_title>A Phase II Multi-centre, Extension Study to Investigate the Long Term Safety of ONO-2506PO in Patients Diagnosed With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an extension study which consists of two phases: Double-blind phase; Patients will continue to take blinded study medication, as allocated in study ONO-2506POE014 by the central randomization system, in the presence of stable standard Riluzole therapy, until un-blinding of the study results. Open label phase; Patients who were allocated to ONO-2506PO in the ONO-2506POE014 study will be offered entry into the open label phase of ONO-2506POE015 study and will continue to take 1200 mg of ONO-2506PO for the duration of their participation in the study, in the presence of stable standard Riluzole therapy. Patients who were allocated to placebo in ONO-2506POE014 study will be withdrawn from ONO-2506POE015 study, but will continue to be followed up by their site with standard care.</detailed_description>
