	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to find out how well cetuximab works in treating NSCLC in patients who have been previously treated with a class of drug called tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Cetuximab is a protein that is designed to block a substance in cancer cells called "epidermal growth factor receptor" or EGFR. EGFR helps cancer cells grow.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab as Therapy for Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Who Have Received Prior Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants on this study will receive cetuximab by infusion intravenously once per week and may continue to receive weekly cetuximab infusions until their disease progresses or they experience unacceptable side effects. - The following will be performed every 4 weeks while they are receiving study treatments: Physical examination; performance status; and blood work. A CT scan of the chest and upper abdomen will be performed every 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
