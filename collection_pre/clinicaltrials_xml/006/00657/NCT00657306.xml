	<brief_summary>Relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) is an well known condition in patients with septic shock. Liver failure (including chronic liver failure)and sepsis are both characterized by hyperdynamic circulatory failure (with low arterial pressure) and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Hydrocortisone has been shown to have a beneficial effect on clinical outcome. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of RAI in the different settings of ascites in cirrhosis and the usefulness of hydrocortisone in this context.</brief_summary>
