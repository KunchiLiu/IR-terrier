	<brief_title>Preemptive Strike With Bortezomib in Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma have led to improved remission rates, the risk for serious relapse is very high. The drug Bortezomib has been highly effective for treatment of the disease in an advanced stage such as post-transplant relapse. Due to the need of maintenance therapies, it is necessary to look to certain drugs that may prolong remission and increase the quality of life. Bortezomib, when taken at the beginning of remission, may prove to be a beneficial maintenance drug for the management of multiple myeloma.</detailed_description>
