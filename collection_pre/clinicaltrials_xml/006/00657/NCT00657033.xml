A) Previous or current medical conditions: Any unstable medical, psychiatric, or substance abuse disorder that in the opinion of the Investigator is likely to affect the subject's ability to complete the study or precludes the subject's participation in the study. Presence of penile anatomical abnormalities (e.g. penile fibrosis or Peyronie's disease) which, in the Investigator's opinion, would significantly impair erectile function. Primary hypoactive sexual desire. Spinal cord injury. History of surgical prostatectomy (excluding TURP). Retinitis pigmentosa. Unstable angina pectoris.

Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation/flutter at screening (ventricular response rate &amp;#8805; 100 bpm). Severe chronic or acute liver disease, history of moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Clinically significant chronic haematological disease which may lead to priapism such as sickle cell anemia and leukemia. Bleeding disorder. Significant active peptic ulcer disease. Resting hypotension (a resting systolic blood pressure of &lt; 90 mm Hg) or hypertension (a resting systolic blood pressure &gt; 170 mm Hg or a resting diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mm Hg). History of malignancy within the past 5 years (other than squamous or basal cell skin cancer). NYHA Class III and IV heart failure. History of positive test for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C. Symptomatic postural hypotension within 6 months of visit 1.

Subjects who have received any investigational drug (including placebo) within 30 days of Visit 1. Use of any treatment for ED within 7 days of visit 1 or during the study, including oral medications, vacuum devices, constrictive devices, injections or urethral suppositories. Subjects who are taking alpha blockers C) Abnormal laboratory values: Subjects who have a serum total testosterone level more than 25% below the ageadjusted lower limit of normal according to the range of the testing laboratory. Subjects with a serum creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dl. Elevation of AST and/or ALT &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal. Diabetic subjects with an HbA1c&gt;12%. D) Other Subjects age 65 or older who in the judgment of the investigator can not be started on a 10 mg dose Subjects with a history of unresponsiveness to any PDE 5 Inhibitor treatment due to lack of efficacy or significant side effects leading to discontinuation of the PDE 5 Inhibitor treatment. Subjects unwilling to cease use of vacuum devices, intracavernosal injections, ViagraÂ® or other therapy for ED during the study. Unwillingness of the subject or his partner to make 4 attempts at sexual intercourse on four separate days during the untreated baseline period.
