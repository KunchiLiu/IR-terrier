	<brief_summary>A multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the short-term and long-term efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in reducing proteinuria and preserving renal function in patients with IgAN who have pre-treated (and continue to be treated) with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), compared to the corticosteroids.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) in Patients With IgA Nephropathy (IgAN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are four phases of study for each subject. Phase 1 the screening phase. During this phase each potential subject will be evaluated to determine if he/she is eligible for the study. Phase 2 the ARB lead-in phase will last for three months. Phase 3 the intervention phase. Each subject will be randomly received 12 months treatment with the study drugs (MMF, prednisone or MMF plus prednisone) Phase 4 following-up phase. All the patients will be followed by 3 years after study drug stopped.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Willingness to sign an informed consent Age:14~60 years, regardless of gender Clinical evaluation and renal biopsy diagnostic for IgAN, excluded secondary IgAN. Renal histological criteria should be defined by Lee's glomerular grading system. 1 g/day &lt;= proteinuria &lt; 3.5 g/day, or UPr/Cr ratio ≥ 0.6 (male) or ≥ 0.8 (female) when taking ARB eGFR ≥ 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 Inability or unwillingness to sign the informed consent Inability or unwillingness to meet the scheme demands raised by the investigators Rapidly progressive nephritic syndrome and acute renal failure, including rapidly progressive IgAN ( IgAN with rapid decline in renal function characterized histologically by necrotizing vasculitis and crescent formation≥30%) necessitating the use of other immunosuppressive agents. Secondary IgAN such as systemic lupus erythematosus, HenochSchonlein purpuric nephritis and hepatitis B associated nephritis est GFR &lt; 40 mL/min/1.73m2 Malignant hypertension that is difficult to be controlled by oral drugs Cirrhosis, chronic active liver disease. History of significant gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. severe chronic diarrhea or active peptic ulcer disease.) Any Active systemic infection or history of serious infection within one month of entry or known infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. Other major organ system disease (e.g. serious cardiovascular diseases including congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma requiring oral steroid treatment or central nervous system diseases) Malignant tumors (except fully cured basal cell carcinoma) Absolute neutrophil count ＜ 1500／mm3, absolute platelet count ＜75000／mm3 or hematocrit (Hct) &lt;28% (anemic subjects may be reevaluated after the anemia has been treated.) Known allergy, contraindication or intolerance to the MMF, corticosteroids or ACEI/ARB. Pregnancy or breast feeding at the time of entry or unwillingness to comply with measures for contraception Current exposure to MMF or azathioprine. In case of current treatment with oral steroid or ACEI/ARB, entry is permitted after corticosteroids or ACEI/ARB are stopped for 2 weeks. Current or recent (within 30 days) exposure to any other investigational drugs</criteria>
