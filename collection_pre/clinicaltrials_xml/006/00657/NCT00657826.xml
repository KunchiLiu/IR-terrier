	<brief_summary>The initial clinical investigation titled "ATS 3f(r) Aortic Bioprosthesis Model 1000 Study," was a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center study designed to evaluate the the safety and effectiveness obtained from 800 patient years using a common clinical protocol. Twenty-three (23) sites internationally and in the United States combined enrolled 405 patients. The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ATS 3f(r) Aortic Bioprosthesis Model 1000 equine pericardial prosthesis in a a patient population undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement of his / her native aortic valve, or replacement of a failed prosthesis with or without concomitant procedures. Addendum: After receiving PMA approval in October of 2008 of the 21mm-29mm sizes, this IDE was expanded to comply with the conditions set forth in the approval notice. Study Protocol S2001 Rev. E is a continuation of the original protocol, but is only enrolling subjects who require a 19mm ATS 3f(r) Aortic Bioprosthesis, Model 1000 and is described as "A multi-center, non-randomized trial, designed to obtain 800 patient years. Each enrolled patient will be followed for a minimum one year and annually thereafter until size 19mm product approval or study cessation. Preoperative, discharge or 30 days (which ever comes last), 3-6 month, and annual follow-up data are required.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patients for whom ATS Medical, Inc., ATS 3f(r) Aortic Bioprosthesis Model 1000 is intended are those patients whose prognosis without surgery for replacement of the diseased natural valve or previous implanted prosthetic valve is unacceptably poor in terms of survival, quality of life, or both, in the opinion of the attending physicians. For this special subset of patients, there are a number of widely accepted prosthetic heart valves in use.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>This patient requires isolated aortic valve replacement with or without concomitant procedures such as coronary artery bypass or another valve reconstruction. (The three remaining valves must be of native tissue). This patient is sufficiently ill to warrant replacement of his/her diseased natural or prosthetic valve, based on standard cardiovascular diagnostic workups. This patient is in satisfactory condition, based on the physical exam and investigator's experience, to be an average or better operative risk, (i.e., likely to survive one year postoperatively). This patient is geographically stable and willing to return to the implant center for followup visits. This patient has been adequately informed and consents to his/her participation in the clinical study, and of what will be required of him/her, in order to comply with the protocol. This patient is twenty (20) or less than twenty years of age. This patient has a noncardiac major or progressive disease, which in the investigator's experience produces an unacceptable increased risk to the patient, or results in a life expectancy of less than 12 months. This patient is an intravenous drug and/or alcohol abuser. This female patient is pregnant (urine HCG test result positive), or lactating. This patient presents with active endocarditis. This patient presents with congenital bicuspid aortic anatomy. This patient has a previously implanted prosthetic valve that is not being replaced by a study valve. This patient requires mitral, tricuspid or pulmonic valve replacement. This patient is participating in concomitant research studies of investigational products. This patient will not agree to return to the implant center for the required number of followup visits or is geographically unavailable for followup.</criteria>
