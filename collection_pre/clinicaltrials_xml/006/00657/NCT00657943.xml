	<brief_summary>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients (T2DM) have an increased mortality rate due to macrovascular disease. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of an 18-month treatment with metformin versus placebo in combination with one of three insulin analogue regimens following a treat-to-target principle. The primary outcome measure is change in wall thickness of the carotic arteries(CIMT)measured by ultrasound. A total of 900 patients with T2DM and HbA1c above 7.5% will be included.</brief_summary>
