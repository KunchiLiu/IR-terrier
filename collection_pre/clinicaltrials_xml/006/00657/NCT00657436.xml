	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is the evaluation of multiple biomarkers related to acute coronary syndromes, including myeloid-related protein 8/14 (MRP 8/14), along with established clinical markers, for early diagnosis and risk stratification in patients presenting with acute chest pain at the emergency department. Study hypothesis: MRP 8/14, alone or together with other established or new biomarkers, increases the earliness, sensitivity, and specificity of diagnosing acute coronary syndromes.</brief_summary>
