	<brief_summary>This project investigates the effect of ACE-inhibition on cellular metabolism by gene expression profiling of human muscle tissue, obtained by biopsy prior to and after ramipril intake. This should contribute to our understanding of the pathomechanisms involved in diabetes and the clinical effect of ACE-inhibition on patients with diabetes/metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
