	<brief_summary>The only curative option for pancreatic cancer patients is surgery, but the patients within 20% of them are possible for a radical surgery. Accordingly, concurrent chemo-radiation therapy is generally used for palliation of unresectable pancreatic cancer patients. So far, the use of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was the traditional method of chemotherapy. However, these days, oral anti-cancer medicine, capecitabine(Xeloda®), was developed and considered as an alternative medicine of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Furthermore, according to the recent results of clinical trials, the clinical use of capecitabine(Xeloda®) with radiation therapy was proved to be very effective and safe. The purpose of this trial is to improve the therapeutic effects by using proton therapy and chemotherapy concurrently.</brief_summary>
