	<brief_title>Evaluation of KX2-391 in Patients With Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this first in human study is to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of KX2-391 in patients with solid tumors and lymphoma, who are refractory to conventional cancer treatments. In addition, pharmacodynamics will be evaluated using biomarkers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in tissue biopsy samples.</detailed_description>
