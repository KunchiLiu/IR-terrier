	<brief_title>Predictive Objective Parameters for Outcome of the Treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective observational descriptive study conducted from May 2002 to November 2005 at a single tertiary urban teaching University Uro-gynecological Department. 65 patients affected by stress or mixed urinary incontinence (stress component clinically predominant), defined according to International Continence Society guidelines, associated or not with urethral hypermobility underwent surgery which consisted of a fusion-welded, non-woven, non-knitted polypropylene tape (Obtape® Mentor-Porges). Preoperative MUCP and VLPP, stratified as ≤ or &gt; 40 cmH20 and ≤ or &gt; 60 cmH2O respectively, were separately or in combination correlated with primary (continence status: dry or wet) and secondary outcome variables (QoL questionnaires).</detailed_description>
