	<brief_summary>Patients will be randomized to lifestyle changes alone or lifestyle changes associated with iron depletion. Iron depletion will be achieved by removing 350 cc of blood every 10-15 days according to baseline hemoglobin values and venesection tolerance, until ferritin &lt; 30 ng/ml and transferrin saturation &lt; 25%. Weekly phlebotomies will be allowed for carriers of the C282Y HFE mutation. Smaller phlebotomies (250 cc) will be allowed for carriers of beta-thalassaemia trait. Maintenance phlebotomies (as much as required) will then be instituted to keep iron stores depleted (ferritin &lt; 50 ng/ml and transferrin saturation &lt; 25%, MCV &lt;85 fl). Before starting treatment, patients will undergo ECG, and in the presence of hyperglycemia or hypertension also echocardiography (see exclusion criteria). Change in diabetes medication dosage or start of new therapy will be allowed for HbA1C values &lt;6% or ≥ 7%. According to accepted criteria, previously untreated patients should be treated with metformin. If possible, newly diagnosed hypertension should be treated with Ace-inhibitors.</brief_summary>
