	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine is more effective when given together with or without capecitabine in treating patients with biliary cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving gemcitabine together with capecitabine to see how well it works compared with giving gemcitabine alone in treating patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic biliary cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine With or Without Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced, Unresectable, or Metastatic Biliary Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To compare overall survival (OS) rates in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic biliary tree cancer treated with combined gemcitabine hydrochloride and capecitabine vs. gemcitabine hydrochloride alone. Secondary - To compare progression-free survival (PFS) in this patient group. - To compare response rates (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) in this patient group. - To compare stable disease (SD) rates in this patient group. - To compare rate of disease control (CR, PR and SD) in this patient group. - To estimate and compare response duration in this patient group. - To compare the effects of these treatments on measures of quality of life in this patient group using the EORTC QLQ-C30. - To compare the nature, severity and frequency of toxicities between the two arms. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumour type (cholangiocarcinoma vs. gallbladder or biliary unknown), ECOG performance status (0-1 vs. 2), extent of disease (locally advanced vs. metastatic), and treatment center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I (Gemcitabine hydrochloride and capecitabine): Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 8 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II (Gemcitabine hydrochloride alone): Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at 12 weeks after randomization and 4 weeks after completion of study treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically proven adenocarcinoma of the biliary tree (intra and extrahepatic biliary ducts or gallbladder) Locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic disease Patients with pathologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with biliary primary with clinical documentation of gallbladder or biliary tree involvement and no evidence of another primary adenocarcinoma are eligible Must have evidence of disease but measurable disease is not required Chest xray and/or CT scan of the chest, CT scan or MRI of the abdomen, and other radiological examination to document all disease sites have been done within 28 days prior to randomization No repeat scan needed if a negative scan was performed within 35 days prior to randomization Patients who have only one site of disease located inside a previous radiotherapy field are eligible Lesions within a previous radiotherapy field may be considered measurable if documented ≥ 20% increase in size If the lesion size increase has not been documented since the completion of radiotherapy, and the lesion is still present (i.e. not CR), the lesion is considered evaluable for this trial Patients with biliary duct obstruction are eligible provided all of the following criteria are met: Treatable, clinically relevant obstruction Obstruction has been relieved by internal endoscopic drainage/stenting, palliative bypass surgery or percutaneous drainage prior to trial entry No ampullary carcinomas (i.e., arising from the ampulla of Vater) No central nervous system (CNS) metastases, including active, progressive brain or leptomeningeal metastases Patients with focal neurological symptoms must have had a CT scan to rule out CNS metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: ECOG performance status 02 Minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks Able (i.e. sufficiently fluent) and willing to complete the quality of life questionnaires in one of the validated languages Must be able to swallow and retain oral medication Hemoglobin &gt; 90 g/L Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm³ Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ Total bilirubin &lt; 3 times upper limit of normal(ULN) AST and/or ALT ≤ 5 times ULN Liver function tests stable and &lt; 3 times ULN Serum creatinine &lt; 160 µmol/L OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients and their partners must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry, throughout the study, and for a period of 4 weeks after cessation of protocol therapy Patients must be accessible for treatment and followup No known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency No known hypersensitivity to gemcitabine or capecitabine No other active medical condition which would render the protocol treatment dangerous or impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol therapy, including, but not limited to, any of the following: Unstable angina Uncontrolled arrhythmia Heart failure No other condition (e.g. psychological, geographical, etc.) that does not permit compliance with the protocol No other malignancies except adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated insitu cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of disease for &gt; 5 years PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease unless used in the following circumstances: Fluorouracil or gemcitabine given concurrently with radiotherapy as a radiosensitizer, completed more than 3 months prior to randomization Fluorouracil given as adjuvant treatment following surgery, completed at least 1 year prior to randomization No major surgery within 4 weeks of randomization No prior treatment with another investigational agent within 2 weeks of randomization At least 4 weeks from randomization since completion of prior radiotherapy and recovered Patients may be randomized within the required 4 weeks if short course (&lt; 5 fractions) of nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy was given Concurrent palliative radiation to a known site of bone metastasis allowed provided that the criteria for disease progression are otherwise not met No other concurrent anticancer therapy (cytotoxic, biological/immunotherapy or radiotherapy other than for known bone metastases as specified above) No other concurrent investigational drug therapy</criteria>
