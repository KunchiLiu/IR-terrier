	<brief_summary>Stage 1 is a patient-masked, dose-escalation, safety evaluation of brimonidine intravitreal implant. Patients will receive implant in one eye and "sham" treatment (meaning no treatment) in the fellow eye. Stage 2 will begin after 1 month of safety has been evaluated for Stage 1. Stage 2 is a randomized, double-masked, dose-response, sham-controlled evaluation of the safety and efficacy of brimonidine intravitreal implant in patients with geographic atrophy from age-related macular degeneration. Patients will be followed for up to 2 years.</brief_summary>
