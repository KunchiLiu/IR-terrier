	<brief_title>Panitumumab in Children With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, multi-center, single arm, dose-ranging, clinical study. Panitumumab will be administered by intravenous infusion to 4-6 patients per cohort. Three planned cohorts, stratified by age, will be studied at 100% of the recommended panitumumab dose for each treatment schedule as defined in adults. Enrollment will start with a 2.5 mg/kg once weekly administration to the 12 to &lt; 18 year old patients. Upon demonstration of sufficient safety additional cohorts will open; a 2.5 mg/kg once weekly administration to the 1 to &lt; 12 year old patients and a 6.0 mg/kg once every two weeks to the 12 to &lt; 18 year old patients. The decision to advance to the next cohort will be based on observance of ≤ 33% incidence of a dose limiting toxicity during the evaluation period. Subsequent cohorts of 6.0 mg/kg once every two weeks to the 1 to &lt; 12 year old patients and 9.0 mg/kg once every three weeks to both age groups will open once sufficient safety in each cohort is determined. Participants may stay on study treatment until disease progression.</detailed_description>
