	<brief_summary>The objective of this research study is to determine the safety and feasibility of chelation therapy with deferoxamine for patients with iron overload who are receiving a stem cell transplant. Patients who have iron overload prior to stem cell transplantation may have more toxicity from the transplantation procedure, and thus may benefit from an attempt at iron chelation pre- and peri-transplantation. In this study we are examining the use of deferoxamine starting 2 weeks to 3 months prior to transplantation and continuing through the preparative regimen.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>18 years of age or older Histologically confirmed acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome Planned allogeneic stem cell transplantation with myeloablative conditioning regimen; the planned date of transplantation must be at least 4 weeks from time of enrollment Severe iron overload as defined by BOTH: Ferritin greater than 1000ng/ml (at the time of donor availability) and Liver iron content estimated greater than or equal to 5mg/g dry weight by MRI (at the time of donor availability) Patients with a history of prior autologous transplantation will be eligible for this study Contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Creatinine &gt;2.0mg/dl or creatinine clearance &lt;50ml/min Active uncontrolled bacterial or fungal infection History of mucormycosis Preexisting clinically apparent retinal neuropathy. If patients have clinically apparent visual loss at the time of screening, they will be excluded if either they have known retinal neuropathy or if this cannot be excluded by further testing Preexisting clinically apparent sensorineural hearing loss. If patients have auditory loss at the time of screening, they will be excluded if either they have known sensorineural hearing loss, or if this cannot be excluded by further testing Pregnancy or inability or unwillingness to use contraception during the time of the study Lactating patients Inability to provide informed consent</criteria>
