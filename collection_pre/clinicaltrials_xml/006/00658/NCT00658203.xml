	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare clinical benefits of the cardiac resynchronisation (CRT) achieved by the PEA optimised pacing configuration and a CRT optimised by standard clinical procedure. PEA optimised configuration (PEA-CRT) is obtained, during patient's follow-up, using the Peak Endocardial Acceleration sensor features onboard the device.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective, multicentre, controlled and randomised clinical investigation, with two single-blinded arms. The objective of the study is to compare the clinical benefits of Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT) optimised by automatic PEA sensor features (PEA-CRT), with those obtained by standard optimisation procedure (STD-CRT). The patient candidate for inclusion in the study has a severe chronic Heart Failure, indicated for the implantation of a Biventricular pacing system according to updated ESC guidelines (2005). All patients included in the study will be followed-up for 1 year; patient's follow-ups are scheduled during hospitalisation, at one month, 3 months, 6 months and one year after implantation.</detailed_description>
