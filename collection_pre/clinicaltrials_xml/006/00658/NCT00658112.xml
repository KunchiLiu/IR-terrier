	<brief_title>Measuring Adherence in Subjects With Acne Vulgaris in a Clinic Population Subtitle: Topical Benzoyl Peroxide for Acne</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We give subjects topical benzoyl peroxide, a standard first line acne treatment, in a container that records when the container is opened and closed. Subjects will simply be asked to "return in six weeks to see how well benzoyl peroxide works for them." Subjects initially will not be told that they are participating in a formal study. When they return with their medication, we will seek their informed consent to participate in the study. Verbal consent will be obtained at the beginning of the study. There will be no written consent obtained until the end of the study. By doing this, subjects will not be aware that adherence is being measured. Subjects will not be aware that they are participating in a study. Only if they consent would we then collect the medication container and monitor and retrieve the adherence data. If they do not consent, we will not have collected any research data on them except baseline acne severity measures which may have been collected anyway as part of their clinic treatment.</detailed_description>
