	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of ARQ 197 Amorphous and Crystalline Polymorphs A and B in Normal Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a bioequivalence study designed to compare three solid states of ARQ 197 in normal healthy volunteers using a randomized crossover design. The primary objective is to obtain pharmacokinetic data to assess bioequivalence among three solid states of ARQ 197: amorphous, crystalline polymorph A and crystalline polymorph B.</detailed_description>
