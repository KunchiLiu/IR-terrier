	<brief_title>Rehabilitation Program for Cognitive Deficits in Ugandan Children After Cerebral Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral malaria affects several children in sub-Saharan Africa leaving some survivors with cognitive problems especially in attention and memory. There are currently no tested interventions for such deficits resulting from infectious diseases like malaria or other causes. Providing such interventions will go a long way in helping these children achieve their full potential.</detailed_description>
