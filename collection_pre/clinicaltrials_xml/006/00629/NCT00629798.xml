	<brief_summary>This study will see if the researchers can lower that risk by giving the patient Palifermin. This drug helps protect the lining of the mouth, throat, and stomach. These areas typically get sores or ulcers while the blood cell counts are very low. The patient can get infections in or from these sores. Palifermin might also help the immune system recover faster. It is currently approved for patients who receive their own stem cells. That is called an autologous transplant. This study will test the use of Palifermin for T-cell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplants.</brief_summary>
