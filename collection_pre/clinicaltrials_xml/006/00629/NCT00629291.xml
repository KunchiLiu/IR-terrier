	<brief_summary>Sickle cell anemia and Sickle cell β thalassemia patients require multiple transfusions in order to avoid chronic anemia sequel. This regimen entails intrinsic deleterious effects, the majority of which are related to iron deposition in the reticuloendothelial system. Thus, iron is deposited in hepatic, myocardial and endocrine glands tissues. Tools available for iron load evaluation include serum ferrtin levels, liver biopsy and echocardiography, all are non specific. The purpose of this work is to compare iron overload in the liver, heart and pancreas in Sickle cell anemia and Sickle cell β thalassemia patients using T2* MRI sequences.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell anemia and Sickle cell β thalassemia patients recieving multiple transfusions are exposed to the effects of iron deposition in the reticuloendothelial system, including cardiac muscle, liver and pancreas. Tools available for iron load evaluation include serum ferrtin levels, liver biopsy and echocardiography, all are non specific. The purpose of this work is to compare iron overload in the liver, heart and pancreas in Sickle cell anemia and Sickle cell β thalassemia patients using T2* MRI sequences. Patients and Methods: 27 Sickle cell anemia and 28 Sickle cell β thalassemia will undergo transthoracic echocardiography, cardiac MRI using T2* sequences and clinical and laboratory evaluation for iron overload including ferritin levels and oral glucose tolerance test</detailed_description>
