	<brief_summary>It is not unusual for several children operated for severe adenoid hyperthrophy causing breathing problems to have otitis media with effusion simultaneously. It is unknown whether adenoidectomy, myringotomy and tubes insertion is superior to adenoidectomy and myringotomy alone in terms of otitis media related quality of life and recurrence of otitis media several months after the operation. For this purpose a randomized trial is conducted including children operated for adenoid hyperthrophy and whose otitis media with effusion had caused minimal or no symptoms so far</brief_summary>

	<criteria>children operated for their adenoid hyperthrophy with an adenoid size of 3 (measured in a scale of 13 intraoperatively or from lateral neck xray) and otitis media with effusion causing an average airbone gap of greater than 20db. Children should be otherwise healthy with an ASA score of I and between 312 years old of age other health problems especially related with the condition eg cleft palate</criteria>
