	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Levetiracetam and pregabalin are drugs that treat seizures. It is not yet known which drug is more effective in treating seizures caused by primary brain tumors. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well levetiracetam or pregabalin work in treating seizures in patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for primary brain tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Levetiracetam or Pregabalin in Treating Seizures in Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy and/or Radiation Therapy For Primary Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the safety and efficacy of antiepileptic drug monotherapy comprising levetiracetam or pregabalin in treating seizures in patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for primary brain tumors. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive levetiracetam. - Arm II: Patients receive pregabalin. Patients are followed at 2 weeks, 2 months, 6 months, and then at 1 year.</detailed_description>
