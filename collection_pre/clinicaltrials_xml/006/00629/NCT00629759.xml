	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and/or the maximum feasible dose (MFD), as well as to evaluate the safety of JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) injected within hepatic carcinoma tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Recombinant Vaccinia Virus to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of a Transdermal Injection Within the Tumor of Patients With Primary or Metastatic Hepatic Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are treated with JX-594 once every three weeks until progression at the site(s) of injection or until the patient has received a maximum of 4 treatments; four additional cycles can be administered to patients with an objective response of the injected tumor(s) (i.e. 8 total treatments possible). Study dose levels are 1e8 pfu, 3e8 pfu, 1e9 pfu and 3e9 pfu per treatment. Standard Phase I dose-escalation guidelines are used, with 2-6 patients enrolled per cohort (3 if no dose-limiting toxicities are reported).</detailed_description>
