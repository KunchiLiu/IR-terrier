	<brief_summary>The prevalence of obesity and asthma has increased in recent decades. We investigated the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and lung function, and also tried to determine if asthma prevalence differs between obese and non-obese children. We propose this cross-sectional, retrospective analysis to figure out whether the BMI is associated with elevated prevalence of asthma, and how their lung function changes in different BMI groups.</brief_summary>
