	<brief_summary>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes different disease spectrum ranging from minimal progressive liver disease to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Evidence indicates that host genetic factor may play a role in determining disease progression. It is known that many cytokine polymorphisms affect disease progressin via increasing hepatic fibrosis that are key factors in progressing liver injury. By combinations of fibrosis-relating gene polymorphisms, this study aims to identify patients with high risk for progressive liver disease. These patients need intensive therapy to decrease morbidity and mortality of chronic HCV-related liver disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Polymorphisms of Fibrosis-Relating Genes on Outcome of HCV-Related Chronic Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Determination of the following fibrosis-relating gene polymorphisms in HCV-related chronic liver disease and HCC will be performed: TNF-α , TNF-β, Factor V Leiden, TGF-β1, PDGF-B gene, Angiotensinogen (AT),Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST).</detailed_description>
