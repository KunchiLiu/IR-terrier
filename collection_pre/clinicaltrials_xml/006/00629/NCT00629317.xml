	<brief_title>Trial of Methyl Aminolevulinate Plus Aktilite in Facial Photodamage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It has been demonstrated that photodamage leads to wrinkles, mottled pigmentation, lentigines, telangiectasias, and textural changes, but more importantly, it can also lead to pre-cancerous conditions with the development of actinic keratosis (AK). The majority of photorejuvenation or photodamaged published studies have used 5-Amino-Levulinic acid (5-ALA) as a photosensitizer, and either a blue light or an Intense Pulsed Light source with a 70%-95% global facial skin improvement. The molecular mechanism of such improvement is unknown, but activation of a non-specific immune response in addition to increased fibrosis and new collagen formation, have both been suggested. Methyl Aminolevulinate ( MAL) is another marketed photosensitizer mainly utilized in Europe. Lipophilicity, higher penetration depth and tumor selectivity has been advocated for MAL compared to 5-ALA. However, its effect in photodamaged skin has not been well documented. The aim of the study is to determine the efficacy of MAL + Aktilite (PDT) in facial photodamage. Study Type: Interventional Study Design: Randomized, double-Blind, placebo-controlled trial. Official Title: A randomized, double-Blind, placebo-controlled trial of Methyl Aminolevulinate + Aktilite in patients with facial photodamage.</detailed_description>
