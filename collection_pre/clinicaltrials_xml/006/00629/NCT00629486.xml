	<brief_title>Genetic Polymorphisms of Interleukin-1B and TNF-A and HBV-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis B virus (HBV)infection is the major risk factor for chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Host immunogenetic factors contribute to HBV-associated liver damage and/or carcinogenesis. Variant cytokine alleles, including tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α)and interleukin-1β(IL-1β), might contribute to interindividual difference in inflammatory responses and account for heterogeneous disease outcome of infectious disease. By detecting polymorphisms of IL-1β and TNF-α,this study aims to find the effects of cytokine gene polymorphisms(and their interaction) on susceptibility and severity of HBV-related HCC.</detailed_description>
