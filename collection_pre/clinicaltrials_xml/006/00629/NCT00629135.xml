	<brief_summary>The study is contemplating the antibiotic therapy of intraabdominal abscesses. These abscesses are a serious problem in surgical practice. Associated pathophysiologic effects as for example peritonitis may become life threatening or may lead to extended periods of morbidity with prolonged hospitalization. The objective of the sudy is to evaluate whether the combination of Moxifloxacin and Metronidazole is equivalent to Piperacillin / Tazobactam with regard to clinical outcome and eradication of aerobe and anaerobe pathogens in patients with intra-abdominal abscesses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Moxifloxacin Plus Metronidazole Versus Piperacillin/Tazobactam for the Treatment of Patients With Intra-abdominal Abscesses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is an interventional prospective, comparative, open-label, randomised single-centre study. Adult patients with intra-abdominal abscesses matching the criteria to be included will be enrolled in the study and randomised into one of the Groups: 1. Moxifloxacin 400 mg, administered intravenously once daily in combination with Metronidazole 500 mg, administered two times daily intravenously, followed by an oral medication with Moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily and Metronidazole 500 mg twice daily. 2. Piperacillin / Tazobactam 4,5 g administered intravenously three times daily. Primary study endpoints: Clinical success / failure rate at the Test-of-Cure visit. Secondary study endpoints: -Bacteriological response at TOC, -Clinical + Bacteriological response at End-of-Treatment-visit, - Course of disease on the basis of clinical and laboratory parameters, -Time to discharge from hospitals, -Duration of hospitalization post-operatively, - safety and tolerability of the study medication, -cost effectiveness of treatment regimes.</detailed_description>
