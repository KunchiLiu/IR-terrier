	<brief_title>Clinical Study of Solifenacin Succinate in Patients With Bladder Symptoms Due to Spinal Cord Injury or Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A clinical study to compare the efficacy and safety of solifenacin succinate in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity. In this randomized, double blind, double dummy study solifenacin will be compared to placebo and an active comparator, oxybutynin hydrochloride. Patients will be randomized to one of four treatment arms; solifenacin 10mg, solifenacin 5mg, placebo or oxybutynin 15mg. Patients will be assessed over a four week treatment period.</detailed_description>
