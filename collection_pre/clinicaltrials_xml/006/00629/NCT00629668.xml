	<brief_summary>The prognosis of Hepatitis B virus (HBV)infection varies from minimal progressive liver disease to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Both viral and host genetic factors contribute to disease severity. Cytokine gene polymorphism has been regarded affecting prognosis of disease. By detecting HBV genotyping and tumor necrosis factor-alpha polymorphism, this study aime to assess their effects and interaction on disease severity of HBV-related chronic liver disease and HCC.</brief_summary>
