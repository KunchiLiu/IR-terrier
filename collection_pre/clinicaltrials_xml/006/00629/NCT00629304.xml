	<brief_summary>TELEDIAB-1 is a national, multicenter, controlled, randomised trial. The Primary objective of the TELEDIAB-1 study is to demonstrate that the PDA-FIT system (PDA-Phone and/or telemonitoring) is able to improve metabolic control of chronically uncontrolled type 1 diabetic patients, despite intensive insulin therapy (multiple daily injections with basal-bolus insulin or insulin pump), as compared with conventional care. Main judgment criteria: comparison of HbA1c means between the 3 groups at 6 months</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary Objectives : 1. To assess the improvement of blood glucose control and quality of life in patients using the PDA-FIT system 2. To assess the improvement in diabetes care provided by the use of the PDA-FIT system 3. Satisfaction of patients and physicians towards the PDA-FIT system</detailed_description>
