	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate whether the atypical antipsychotic and mixed 5-HT2/D2 antagonist sertindole modulates or improves both subcortical and cortical information processing in schizophrenic patients who had not or insufficiently responded to previous antipsychotic medication. This goal shall be accomplished by investigating the effect of sertindole of both prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle (PPI) and P50 suppression of auditory evoked potentials in schizophrenic patients. These effects shall be compared to the effect of risperidone and shall also be compared to untreated healthy controls.</brief_summary>
