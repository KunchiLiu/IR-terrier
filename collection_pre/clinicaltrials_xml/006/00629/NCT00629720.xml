	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 2 doses of alfuzosin (given as a solution or tablets depending on age) in children and adolescents 2 to 16 years of age with elevated detrusor Leak Point Pressure (LPP) (â‰¥40 cm H2O) of neuropathic etiology stratified into 2 age groups (2 to 7 years and 8 to 16 years). The secondary objectives are to investigate the safety and tolerability of the 2 dose regimens and to determine the effect of the 2 dose regimens on detrusor LPP.</brief_summary>
