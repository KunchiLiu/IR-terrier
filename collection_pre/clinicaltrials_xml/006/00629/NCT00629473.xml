	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1 clinical trial examining the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of escalating doses of the proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052 in patients with advanced malignancies including solid tumors, lymphomas, leukemias and multiple myeloma. By inhibiting proteasomes NPI-0052 prevents the breakdown of proteins involved in signal transduction, which blocks growth and survival in cancer cells.</brief_summary>
