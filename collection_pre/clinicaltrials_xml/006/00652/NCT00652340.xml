	<brief_summary>This study will compare the anti-tumor efficacy of apricoxib and erlotinib with placebo and erlotinib as measured by time to disease progression to test the hypothesis that down regulation of COX-2 and EGFR pathways in patients with up-regulated COX-2 expression in tumor will have a clinical benefit compared with erlotinib alone.</brief_summary>
