	<brief_summary>This studies investigates the hypothesis that bedside ultrasound is as accurate as plain x-rays for diagnosing clavicle fractures in children in a pediatric emergency department. Children with shoulder injuries are enrolled and receive both an ultrasound imaging (experimental) and x-rays (standard-of-care) to see if ultrasound has the same (or better)accuracy, with less cost, time, and radiation.</brief_summary>
