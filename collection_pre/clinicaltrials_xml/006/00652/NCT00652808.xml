	<brief_summary>This study was performed to demonstrate that treatment with valdecoxib 10 mg daily (QD) was at least as effective as with naproxen 500 mg twice daily (BID), a standard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), when taken for 6 weeks in Korean subjects with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Secondary objectives were to assess the overall safety and tolerability of valdecoxib 10 mg QD taken for 6 weeks in Korean subjects with symptomatic OA of the knee.</brief_summary>
