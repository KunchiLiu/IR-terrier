	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate three things. The first being whether azacitidine is absorbed in the body at the same rate or proportion for different concentrations. The second is to determine the effect renal impairment has or does not have on the absorption of azacitidine. The third is to determine if azacitidine is safe and well tolerated in patients with renal function impairment.</brief_summary>
