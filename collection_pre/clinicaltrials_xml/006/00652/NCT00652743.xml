	<brief_summary>Today, the leading contender for the next influenza pandemic is H5N1, a strain of avian virus found primarily in domestic and wild birds. Experts warn that the next influenza pandemic is imminent and could be severe. Prevention and control will depend on the rapid production and worldwide distribution of specific pandemic vaccines. Candidate 'pandemic-like' vaccines must be developed and tested in clinical trials to determine the best formulation and vaccination schedule. The purpose of this study is to assess the immune response of a candidate pandemic vaccine. The protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the secondary phase of this study. The objectives and outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number = 00449670).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who completed participation in primary phase of this study. Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study. Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. If the subject is female, she must be of nonchildbearing potential or be postmenopausal; if of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for two months after completion of the vaccination series. Administration of any licensed vaccines within 4 weeks prior to enrolment in this study. Planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol: 4 weeks prior to any visit or within 30 days after vaccination. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first visit or planned use during the study Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, or autoimmune diseases such as Guillain Barre Syndrome, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). History of hypersensitivity to vaccines. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. Acute clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests. Serious chronic disease including any medically significant chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, neurological, psychiatric or metabolic disorder, as determined by medical history and physical examination. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first visit or planned use during the study. Pregnant or lactating women. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days prior to the first visit, or planned use during the study period. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participation in the study.</criteria>
