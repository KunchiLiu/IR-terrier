	<brief_summary>The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of Magnevist (SH L 451 A) at doses of 0.1 mmol/kg and 0.2 mmol/kg in contrast-enhanced 3D-Magnetic Resonance Angiography in three regions (abdominal, femoral, and leg regions) for visualization of arteries, evaluating 179 not assessable: caused by contrast media in the evaluation of structural abnormalities. Magnevist (SH L 451 A) was administered intravenously in a crossover design in patients with arterial disease in the abdominal to leg regions. The safety of the 0.2 mmol/kg dose was also assessed.</brief_summary>
