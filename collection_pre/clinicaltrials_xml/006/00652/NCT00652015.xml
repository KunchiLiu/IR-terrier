	<brief_summary>In-Stent-Thrombosis is a rare but serious complication after implantation of stents during PTCA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of the In-stent-thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this prospective, open, not-randomized, controlled single-center pilot study 80 patients having had an in-stent-thrombosis (40 sub-acute thromboses (SAT), 40 late thromboses (LT)) and a control group of 80 patients having not developed a thrombosis will be compared. The aim of this study is the establishment of diagnostic markers vor prediction of SAT (detection of CD39- and CD73-activity, respectively)and of LT (EPC-number and function, respectively) correspondingly aiming at the early identification of patients with high risk for developing an in-stent-thrombosis.</detailed_description>
