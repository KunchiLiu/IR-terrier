	<brief_summary>In the UK, staging of lung cancer is time consuming (taking on average more than 3 weeks), costly and inaccurate in up to 20% of cases. The investigators wish to determine whether using the newer techniques of endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) improves lung cancer staging. The investigators' hypothesis is that EUS (endoscopic ultrasound) or EBUS (endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspirate) as a first test after CT scan in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer will result in a reduction in the time from first outpatient appointment to treatment decision, a reduction in the total number of scans and investigative operations, fewer outpatient attendances and a reduction in healthcare costs.</brief_summary>
