	<brief_summary>The aim of the investigation was to assess whether routine use of the modified Ritgen´s maneuver decreases the risk of anal sphincter injury at delivery, compared with simple manual protection of the perineum.Ritgen´s maneuver means that the fetal chin is reached for between the anus and the coccyx and pulled anteriorly, while using the fingers of the other hand on the fetal occiput to control speed of delivery and keep flexion of the fetal neck.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ritgens Maneuver for the Prevention of Anal Sphincter Tears at Delivery: A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This application is made retroactively - the study was performed during December 1st, 1999 to July 31st, 2001, at Lund University Hospital and Helsingborg Hospital. Primigravid women in the area were informed about the study at the maternity care centers, receiving written information in gestational week 36. Eligible for the study were women with singleton pregnancy and a fetus in cephalic presentation, admitted for labor, rupture of the membranes or induction after 37 completed gestational weeks. Primigravid women received written information about the study at the maternal health care centers, and eligible women were asked for consent at admission in labor. Randomization was done at the beginning of the second stage of labor (at full cervical dilatation), in each unit by a telephone call from the delivering midwife to the other department, where randomization lists with numbers for allocation were kept. In women allocated to Ritgen´s maneuver, the protocol stated that the delivery of the fetal head should be managed by this maneuver, i.e. lifting the fetal chin anteriorly, using the fingers of one hand placed between the anus and the coccyx, and thereby extending the fetal neck, whereas the other hand should be placed on the fetal occiput to control the pace of the expulsion of the fetal head. The technique for Ritgen´s maneuver was standardized, and midwives that were unfamiliar with the procedure were instructed by senior colleagues before the trial. In the other study group, the protocol entailed our standard care. The standard practice at delivery was using one hand to apply pressure against the perineum, and the other hand on the fetal occiput to control the expulsion of the fetal head, and only to use Ritgen´s maneuver in case of labor arrest or abnormal fetal heart rate pattern when the fetal head was at the pelvic floor.</detailed_description>
