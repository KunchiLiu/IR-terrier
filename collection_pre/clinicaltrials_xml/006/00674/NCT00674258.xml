	<brief_title>Histocompatibility Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A*2402 Restricted Peptide Vaccine Therapy in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>URLC10,TTK and KOC1 has been identified as cancer specific molecules especially in non small cell lung cancer using genome-wide expression profile analysis by cDNA microarray technique. We have determined the HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides derived from these molecules and identified that these peptides significantly induce the effective tumor specific CTL response in vitro and vivo. According to these findings, in this trial, we evaluate the safety, immunological and clinical response of those peptides. Patients will be vaccinated twice a week for 8 weeks. On each vaccination day, the URLC10-177 peptide(1mg), TTK-567 peptide(1mg) and KOC1-508 peptide(1mg) mixed with Montanide ISA 51 will be administered by subcutaneous injection. Repeated cycles of vaccine will be administered until patients develop progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. In the phase I study, we evaluate the safety and tolerability of these peptide vaccine. In the following phase II study, we evaluate the immunological and clinical response of this vaccine therapy.</detailed_description>
