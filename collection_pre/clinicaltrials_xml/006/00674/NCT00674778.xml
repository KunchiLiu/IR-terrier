	<brief_summary>Previous randomised studies showed that radial artery catheterisation for percutaneous cardiovascular procedures has a superior safety profile than femoral access, however the confirmation of these benefits in the real world by a large, specific, observational study is still lacking. We endeavoured to assess the access site-related outcomes of any percutaneous cardiovascular procedure by designing a prospective registry monitoring a consecutive sample of patients in a short period of time at nine Roman hospitals reflecting the contemporary state of health care.</brief_summary>
