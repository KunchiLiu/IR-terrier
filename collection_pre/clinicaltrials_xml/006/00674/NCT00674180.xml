	<brief_summary>This study will involve secondary data analysis for a study done by Wylie-Rosett et al. in 2001 that evaluated the costs and effects of incremental components of a weight-loss program. Data analysis will involve cross-sectional and predictive analyses and may include: regression analyses to determine predictors of weight loss and cardiovascular risk, correlations between weight reduction strategies and biological indices, and interactions between biomarkers of inflammation and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. This data will also be available for economic modeling.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will involve secondary data analysis for a study done by Wylie-Rosett et al. in 2001. Using a 3-arm, 12-month randomized clinical trial, Wylie-Rosett et al. evaluated the costs and effects of incremental components of a weight-loss program. The study included 588 individuals (BMI&gt; 25 kg/m2) in a freestanding health maintenance organization and achieved an 81% completion rate. The intervention used a cognitive behavioral approach for tailoring lifestyle modification goals. The incremental levels of interventions included a) a workbook alone, b) the addition of computerized tailoring using onsite computer kiosks with touch screen monitors, and c) the addition of both computers and staff consultations. For the increasing levels of intervention intensity, the mean 12-month weight losses were 2.2, 4.7, and 7.4 pounds, with the respective cost per participant being $12.33, $41.99, and $133.74. The decreases in mean BMIs for these respective intervention levels were 0.4, 0.9, and 1.2. All groups reported a decrease in energy and fat intake and an increase in blocks walked (p&lt;.01). Intervention variables that correlated with weight loss included more computer logons, achieving computer-selected goals, more self-monitoring, increased walking, and decreased energy and fat intake, as well as higher attendance in staff consultation group sessions for that treatment condition. Weight loss correlated with decreases in fasting glucose and blood pressure. Wylie-Rosett et al. (2001) concluded that, in a weight-loss program, computers can facilitate selecting behavioral change goals. More frequent usage resulted in greater weight loss, and staff counseling to augment the computer intervention achieved the most weight loss. The purpose of this study will be secondary analysis of the data collected in the original MODELS study.</detailed_description>
