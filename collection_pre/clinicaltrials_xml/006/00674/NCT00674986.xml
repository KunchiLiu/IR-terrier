	<brief_summary>This randomized, parallel group study will determine whether the use of episodic, intensive glucose monitoring via the Accu-Chek 360 view blood glucose analysis system has a positive effect on overall glycemic control. Patients will be randomized into either the 'usual care' group, or the 'interventional group' supplemented with the Accu-Chek 360 view blood glucose analysis system. The effect of each treatment regimen on glycemic control will be assessed by measurement of change in baseline HbA1c values at 12 months. The anticipated time on study treatment is 1 year, and the target sample size is 504 individuals.</brief_summary>
