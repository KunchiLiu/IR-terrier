	<brief_summary>The muscular dystrophies (MD) are a group of more than 30 neuromuscular disorders that are characterized by progressive skeletal muscle weakness, defects in muscle proteins and the death of muscle cells and tissue. This study will investigate the use of far infrared radiation for managing muscular dystrophies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Using Far Infrared Radiation to Manage Muscular Dystrophies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observations from our research studies indicate that, far infrared rays provide energy to the body, improve the autonomic functions of the nervous system, restore the functions of the endocrine system, strengthen the immune system, improve blood circulation and increase the level of oxygen in the cells and promote the regeneration of muscle cells, nerves and brain cells. It is hereby postulated that irradiation using far infrared, with wavelength between 5 to 20 microns, of the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the whole body could prevent, control, manage or possibly cure these neuromuscular disorders.</detailed_description>
