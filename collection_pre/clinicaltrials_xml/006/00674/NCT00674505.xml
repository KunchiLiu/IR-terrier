	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 85 years. 2. Subject or subject's legal representative have been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to participate and has signed an IRB approved consent form. 3. Subject understands the duration of the study and it's follow up visit requirements. 4. Unilateral or bilateral atherosclerotic de novo renal artery stenosis (RAS) associated with any or all of the following: 1. SBP &gt;140 despite ≥3 antihypertensive medications 2. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) ≥30≤70 cc/min calculated using the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula 3. Recurrent episodes of decompensated heart failure 4. Recurrent episodes of "flash" pulmonary edema Angiographic Inclusion Criteria 1. ≥70% &lt;100% renal artery stenosis (by visual estimate) involving unilateral, bilateral renal arteries or solitary renal artery. 2. Renal poletopole length &gt;7cm. 3. Lesion ≤15 mm from the aortoostial junction. 4. Renal artery reference lumen diameter ≥3.5 ≤7 mm for FiberNet placement. Clinical Exclusion Criteria 1. Estimated life expectancy &lt;12 months. 2. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt;30 cc/min. 3. Renal poletopole length &lt;7cm on side of diseased kidney. 4. No history of transplanted kidneys or polycystic kidney disease. 5. Uncontrolled hypercoagulability. 6. Known allergies or sensitivities to heparin, aspirin, other anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapies, nitinol and stainless steel. 7. Known allergy to contrast media that cannot adequately be premedicated prior to study procedure. 8. Patient refuses possible temporary or permanent hemodialysis. 9. Refuses possible surgery for repair of access site or renal artery. 10. Known severe coronary or carotid disease likely to require surgical treatment after enrollment or during followup period. 11. Uncompensated congestive heart failure. 12. Current enrollment in any investigational study wherein patient participation has not been completed. 13. Cardiovascular surgical or cardiovascular interventional procedures (including, but not limited to, aortic, renal, cardiac, carotid, femoropopliteal, and below the knee) within 30 days prior to enrollment in this study. 14. Planned or predicted cardiovascular surgical or interventional procedures outside of the affected renal artery (including, but not limited to, aortic, renal, cardiac, carotid, contralateral femoropopliteal, and contralateral below the knee) within 30 days after entry into this study and prior to completion of the 30 day followup. 15. Pregnancy, breastfeeding or plans to become pregnant in female of child bearing potential. 16. Any patient who in the opinion of the investigator would not be a good candidate for enrollment. Angiographic Exclusion Criteria 1. Early bifurcation of the main renal artery preventing complete embolic protection of the kidney with the FiberNet. 2. Fibromuscular Dysplasia. 3. Presence of thrombus at the lesion site. 4. Nonostial atherosclerosis (lesion &gt;15mm from the renal ostium). 5. Subintimal guidewire placement resulting in dissection of the renal artery or aorta, or perforation of the renal artery or aorta prior to deployment of the device. 6. Severe calcification likely to prevent the passage of the device.</criteria>
