	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis (abbreviated MS) is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system (CNS), leading to demyelination. This study will investigate the use of far infrared radiation for MS control, management and treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Far Infrared Irradiation for Managing and Treating Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MS a demyelinating disease, is any disease of the nervous system in which the myelin sheath of neurons is damaged. This impairs the conduction of signals in the affected nerves, causing impairment in sensation, movement, cognition, or other functions depending on which nerves are involved. MS affects the areas of the brain and spinal cord known as the white matter. White matter cells carry signals between the grey matter areas, where the processing is done, and the rest of the body. More specifically, MS destroys oligodendrocytes which are the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer, known as the myelin sheath, which helps the neurons carry electrical signals. Observations from our research studies indicate that, far infrared rays provide energy to the body, improve the autonomic functions of the nervous system, restore the functions of the endocrine system, strengthen the immune system, improve blood circulation and increase the level of oxygen in the cells and promote the regeneration of muscle cells, nerves and brain cells. It is hereby postulated that irradiation using far infrared, with wavelength between 5 to 20 microns, of the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the whole body could prevent, control, manage or possibly lead to complete rehabilitation of people who have MS.</detailed_description>
