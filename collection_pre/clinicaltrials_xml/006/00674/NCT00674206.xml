	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial of Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin for Triple Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, participants will receive gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, drugs that have been in use for a long time. Gemcitabine is a treatment that is an effective therapy currently available to patients with this type and stage of breast cancer. Frequently, in cancer therapy, combinations of drugs prove more effective as treatment than the same drugs used alone. The combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin has not been tested in patients with triple negative breast cancer. It is hoped that the addition of oxaliplatin may cause your tumor to stop growing or possible your tumor may shrink. This assessment will be basd on measuring changes in the size of your tumor.</detailed_description>

Patients with stable CNS disease, who have undergone radiotherapy at least 4 weeks prior to the planned first protocol treatment and who have been on a stable dose of corticosteroids for 3 weeks are eligible for the trial History of prior malignancy within the past 5 years except for curatively treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or localized prostate cancer with a current PSA of &lt; 1.0 mg/dL on 2 successive evaluations at least 3 months apart, with the most recent evaluation within 4 weeks of entry Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of oxaliplatin or gemcitabine. Patients who have received gemcitabine or platinbased chemotherapy in the past. Patients who have received chemotherapy within 28 days of the first scheduled day of protocol treatment. Patients who received radiotherapy to more than 25% of their bone marrow; or patients who received any radiotherapy within 4 weeks of entry Patients who are receiving concurrent investigational therapy or who have received investigational therapy within 28 days of the first scheduled day of protocol treatment (investigational therapy is defined as treatment for which there is currently no regulatory authority approved indication) Peripheral neuropathy Grade 2 Patients who are pregnant or lactating Any other medical condition, including mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign informed consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interfere with the interpretation of the results.
