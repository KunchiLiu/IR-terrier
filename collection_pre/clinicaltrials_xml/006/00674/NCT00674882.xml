	<brief_title>Protocol For Collecting Long-Term Follow-Up Data On Recipients of Bone Marrow and Blood Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this protocol is to provide ongoing data collection and review of long-term outcome and late effects in a large cohort of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell recipients. Central coordination of clinical and psychosocial late effects monitoring and reporting can facilitate timely communication about life-threatening or unanticipated clinical outcomes as well as significant psychological, social and behavioral sequelae effects on the recipient and their family members. The resultant data may enable researchers in their development of current clinical and psychosocial studies, as well as monitoring predisposed survivors who may benefit from preventive or corrective interventions. Physicians and researchers may be able to learn how to identify these problems earlier, to take better care of these problems, or to implement preventive measures for future transplant recipients</detailed_description>
