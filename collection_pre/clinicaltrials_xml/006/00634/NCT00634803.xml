	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Integrated Treatment for Pain and Opioid Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to develop a novel manualized intervention using tailored cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) and buprenorphine medication to effectively treat the co-occurring disorders of non-malignant pain and opioid dependence (POD). Specific Aims: 1. To conduct a pre-pilot phase with 16 patients with POD receiving buprenorphine maintenance treatment (BMT). In the pre-pilot phase, we will also explore the effects of different daily buprenorphine dosages on pain and opiate use. 2. To conduct a pilot randomized, clinical trial to obtain data regarding the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy (compared to Physician Management(PM) only) of manual-guided CBT or Educational Counseling (EC) for patients with POD treated with BMT (N=75).</detailed_description>
