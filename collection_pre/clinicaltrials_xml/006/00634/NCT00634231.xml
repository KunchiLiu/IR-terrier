	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the administration of AdV-tk followed by valacyclovir in children with malignant glioma, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), as well as recurrent ependymomas in combination with radiation therapy. The primary objective is to determine if this approach is safe and can be effectively delivered without disturbing standard therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study of AdV-tk + Prodrug Therapy in Combination With Radiation Therapy for Pediatric Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an Open label, Phase I, dose escalation study. Patients will receive an injection of AdV-tk into the tumor or tumor bed during the surgical procedure followed by 14 days of anti-herpetic prodrug, valacyclovir, starting 1-3 days after vector injection. Standard radiotherapy will begin 3-7 days after AdV-tK injection. Standard chemotherapy may begin after completion of valacyclovir at the discretion of the treating physician and family. Two dose levels of AdV-tk will be evaluated with a fixed dose of valacyclovir.</detailed_description>
