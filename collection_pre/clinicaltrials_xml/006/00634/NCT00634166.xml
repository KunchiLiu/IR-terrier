	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of treatment with Sulfamylon® solution as the initial topical moist dressing over meshed autografts following the initial graft procedure on preventing graft loss in a prospective cohort of subjects versus a historical control group in a non-inferiority trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation of the Effects of Topical Therapy With Sulfamylon® For 5% Topical Solution on Autograft Healing in Subjects With Thermal Injuries Requiring Meshed Autografts: A Comparison to a Historical Control Group</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, non-inferiority, multi-center, historically controlled, open label study that will evaluate the effects of topical therapy with Sulfamylon® For 5% Topical Solution on autograft healing in subjects with thermal injuries requiring meshed autografts against a similar historic control population in which Sulfamylon® For 5% Topical Solution or mafenide acetate or other mafenide salt forms were not used. Prospective subjects meeting the entrance criteria will receive Sulfamylon® solution as topical antimicrobial treatment on moist dressings following initial meshed autograft procedure (Day 1). Sulfamylon® solution will be used every 6-8 hours, or as needed, to keep the dressing moist. The graft will be evaluated on Days 5-7, Days 12-14 and Days 18-21, unless the subject is discharged, dies, or experiences graft loss / regrafting of the initial meshed autograft prior to Assessment 4 (Days 18-21).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In order for prospective subjects to be eligible for entry into the study: Subjects must have thermal injuries of 2060% TBSA requiring at least one meshed autograft on the chest, abdomen, or proximal upper and lower extremities following surgical excision of the burn injury. Refer to Supplement 20.3.2: Lund Browder charts Subjects may be male or female, 3 months of age or older Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test upon admission and agree to avoid pregnancy throughout the course of the study. Since this population is hospitalized for the duration of the study, an agreement of sexual abstinence is appropriate for this trial. Those subjects who do not wish to commit to sexual abstinence for the duration of this study must agree to avoid pregnancy by using a medically supervised method of contraception (such as hormonal contraception in conjunction with a vaginal spermicide or a tubal ligation at least 3 months prior to study entry) Subjects must be willing and able to provide written informed consent. If subjects are unable to provide written informed consent, then the subject's legally acceptable representative may provide written informed consent in accordance with the IRB/IEC, and federal, state and local regulations. Prospective subjects will be excluded from the study for the following reasons: Nonthermal burn injuries Inhalation injuries resulting in a PaO2 /FIO2 ratio &lt; 300 mmHg on more than one arterial blood gas in the first 48 hours postadmission Females who are currently pregnant or breast feeding, or who intend to become pregnant during the course of the study Subjects with acute renal failure Subjects with known systemic allergy to sulfonamides or to sulfurcontaining medication Time interval between burn injury and excision and grafting is greater than 7 days Grafting procedures that are conducted and/or evaluated on an outpatient basis Inability to use a meshed autograft as part of the initial grafting procedure Inability to use SS5% as the only initial prophylactic topical antimicrobial therapy on meshed autografts Thermal burn injuries less than 20% or greater than 60% TBSA Subjects who are participating in any other clinical studies involving any investigational product, or who have participated in such a study within the previous 30 days Subjects with known glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency</criteria>
