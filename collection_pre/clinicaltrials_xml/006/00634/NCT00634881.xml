	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of alemtuzumab in treating patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alemtuzumab in Treating Patients With B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the safest dose of alemtuzumab as consolidation therapy in patients in second remission after fludarabine phosphate alone; fludarabine phosphate and cyclophosphamide; fludarabine phosphate, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab; bendamustine hydrochloride alone; or bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab. - To determine the frequency of cytomegalovirus reactivations or infections during or after alemtuzumab treatment. - To determine which dose of alemtuzumab is efficient to eliminate minimal residual disease in peripheral blood and bone marrow (i.e., to turn a clinical partial remission into a clinical complete remission [CR], to turn a flow cytometry-positive CR into a flow cytometry-negative CR, or to turn a PCR-positive CR into a PCR-negative CR). - To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of alemtuzumab. - To compare the pharmacokinetic profile between intravenous versus subcutaneous administration of alemtuzumab. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of alemtuzumab. - Group 1: Patients receive escalating doses of alemtuzumab IV over 2 hours once weekly for 8 weeks until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. - Group 2: Patients receive escalating doses of alemtuzumab subcutaneously once weekly for 8 weeks, beginning with the MTD determined in group 1 until a second MTD is determined. Patients undergo bone marrow and blood sample collection periodically for laboratory and pharmacokinetic studies. Samples are analyzed for minimal residual disease and T-cell subsets (i.e., CD4 and CD8) via quantitative-PCR analysis and flow cytometry and cytomegalovirus antigens via PCR. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.</detailed_description>
