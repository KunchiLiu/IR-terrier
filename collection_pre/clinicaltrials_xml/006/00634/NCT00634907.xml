	<brief_summary>Several human genes affect how medications are metabolized by the body. It is believed that knowledge of variations of these genes can help health care providers better manage an anticoagulation medicine called warfarin (Coumadin®)and as a result decrease patient problems with bleeding or the development of blood clots. This study is designed to evaluate if genetic testing can improve warfarin initiation better than usual care.</brief_summary>
