	<brief_summary>This is a cross-sectional study of symptom burden and clinical management. A subset of patients who have attended the Primary Care (PC) office with reflux symptoms during a retrospective period of 4 months (Index Visit) are invited to complete health survey questionnaires and partake in a subject-physician/study nurse interview (Visit 1), in order to assess the type, intensity and frequency of GERD symptoms at both visits and describe the treatment provided. Additionally, the impact of GERD on subjects' life, productivity and willingness to pay for GERD symptom relief will be explored. This design will give a "real-life" clinical practice picture in a representative population of PC doctors and subjects.</brief_summary>
