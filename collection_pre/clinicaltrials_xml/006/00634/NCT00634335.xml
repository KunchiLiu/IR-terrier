	<brief_title>Echocardiographic Characteristics of High Endurance Israeli Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adaptive cardiac changes, such as enlargement of left ventricle mass and enlargement of left ventricular wall was observed in athletes. The physiological limit of remodeling changes in accordance to sex, type of activity, intensity of activity, genetics and race. Although many studies were conducted on this subject, it is still impossible to predict if an athlete from a certain sport will develop cardiac changes and their what will those changes characteristics will be. Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death among young athletes, this is because of high physical activity in the presence of a hidden heart disease, therefore there is much debate about the needed screening tests for athletes. In Israel, there is only one study in this subject that showed no significant cardiac changes in Olympic athletes of various types of sports. the study didn't focused on high endurance sport athletes such as professional bicyclists although cardiac endurance is a main factor in cardiac changes.</detailed_description>
