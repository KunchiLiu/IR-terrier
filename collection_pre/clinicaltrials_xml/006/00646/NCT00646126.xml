	<brief_summary>The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum remains at sub-patent level throughout the dry season in areas of seasonal malaria transmission. Targeting this parasite reservoir before the transmission season could be a good strategy for malaria control. We are conducting a randomized double blind placebo controlled mass drug administration trial in eight village to clear the dry season low level parasitaemia with an ultimate aim of controlling malaria in eastern Sudan.</brief_summary>
