	<brief_summary>The study is a prospective field evaluation to assess the therapeutic value of the CPAP/autoCPAP Sandman in 24 new diagnosed Obstructive Sleep Apneic patients. Precisely, the study was designed to : - evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the CPAP/autoCPAP Sandman device in improving sleep quality and normalozing respiratory events - determine the sensitivity and specificity of the device in adequately detecting respiratroy events - compare effective pressure Peff determined by the device and during manual titration - compare the impact of the two-speed descent pressure algorithm</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During the study, each patient underwent one night of full polysomnography with two consecutives therapeutic sequences during the same night, after randomization of the passage order: - autotitrating pressure phase: sleep parameters and respiratory events vs results of the polysomnographic registration, - manual titration phase: concordance between events respiratory analyzed on the polysomnographic recordings and the events detected by the CPAP / auto-CPAP.</detailed_description>
