	<brief_title>A-Part® Gel as Adhesion Prophylaxis After Major Abdominal Surgery Versus a Non-treated Group</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: • first assessment of the safety of applying A-Part® Gel as adhesion prophylaxis after major abdominal surgery by specific observation of two major complications of abdominal surgery (wound healing impairment, and/or postoperative peritonitis) in comparison to a control group. Secondary Objectives: - To further evaluate the safety of A-Part® Gel by comparing the incidences of adverse events between the treatment groups (with special attention to anastomosis leakage) - To explore the efficacy of A-Part® Gel in reducing post-surgical adhesions after median laparotomy</detailed_description>
