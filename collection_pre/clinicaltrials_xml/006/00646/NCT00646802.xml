	<brief_summary>Eligible patients will be informed and asked to enroll in the study at hospital admission. A transvaginal ultrasound examination will be performed to determine cervical length. If an eligible woman accepts to participate, patient will be randomized to one of the study arms assigned in a double blind basis. Patient will receive the medication (vaginal capsule of progesterone or placebo). The patient will administer herself one vaginal capsule in a daily basis since gestational age of 36 weeks and 6 days as the primary endpoint is to demonstrate that the use of a maintenance treatment with vaginal progesterone is able to reduce the incidence of preterm birth before 34.0 and 37.0 gestational weeks. After delivery, perinatal and neonatal data will be collected.</brief_summary>
