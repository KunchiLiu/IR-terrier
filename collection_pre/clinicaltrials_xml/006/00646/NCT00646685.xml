	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to empirically determine whether one of 2 surgical techniques commonly used for bile duct reconstruction during living donor liver transplantation results in fewer biliary complications. Also, this study may identify patient group(s) that particularly benefit from a particular technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Duct-to-duct vs Roux-en-y Hepaticojejunostomy for Biliary Reconstruction in Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of biliary complications (bile leaks and strictures) following duct-to-duct and roux-en-y biliary reconstruction during right lobe living donor liver transplantation. Biliary complications are much more common with right lobe living donor liver grafts than with whole organ grafts and are considered a major limitation of this surgery. Two surgical techniques are currently used for biliary reconstruction and each has its advantages/disadvantages. However, it is unclear which technique leads to fewer biliary complications. Retrospective studies which examine biliary complication rates may be hampered by such factors as a surgeon's bias or inexperience with a particular technique. Therefore a prospective randomized trial is needed.</detailed_description>
