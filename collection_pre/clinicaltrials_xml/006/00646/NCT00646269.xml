	<brief_title>Efficacy Assessment of Three Non Pharmacological Therapies in Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ETNA3 is a multicentric randomised clinical trial conducted in France to evaluate the impact of non pharmacological treatments on the progression rate of dementia: Three non pharmacological treatments are being studied: cognitive training therapy, reminiscence therapy and a "made-to-measure" program. Nearly 40 "Memory Clinics" are participating. 800 patients suffering Alzheimer's Disease in the mild to moderate stage of the disease will be included. For each therapy, a standard intervention protocol has been defined. The main objective is to determine whether any or several of these non pharmacological treatments can delay the severe stage of dementia during a 2-year follow-up. The secondary outcomes assess cognitive abilities, functional abilities in activities of daily living, behavioural disturbance, apathy, quality of life, depression, caregiver burden and resource utilization</detailed_description>
