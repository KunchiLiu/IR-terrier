	<brief_summary>Depression is a wide spread illness. Depression contributes most significantly to national health care costs. While the number and types of treatments used for depression have expanded over the years, even with an increased range of options, the response rate, defined as the number of subjects who have a 50% reduction in depressive symptoms, is estimated to be around 65%. This randomized clinical trial will examine the frequency of treatment with ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression TRD without psychosis. It will compare two modes of the ketamine treatment; every other day ketamine, versus two active and four placebo treatments over the period of 12 days.</brief_summary>
