Also excluded are skin infections resulting from animal bites Patients with a complicated skin and skin structure infection as judged by the Investigator Infections that can be treated by surgical incision alone according to the judgment of the Investigator Treatment with the following antiinfective agents prior to study drug administration: systemic antibiotic within 7 days; azithromycin within 14 days; a longacting injectable antibiotic within 30 days Any infection which requires the use of a concomitant antimicrobial agent, in addition to study drug Concomitant topical therapy at the infection site for the period within 48 hours prior to study drug administration through TOC A chronic or underlying skin condition at the site of infection or infections involving prosthetic materials A wound secondary to burn injury or acne vulgaris Any infection site that requires: intraoperative surgical debridement; excision of infected area Documented or suspected bacteremia Fungal infection involving the nail bed or scalp at the primary uSSSI site Significant peripheral vascular disease An abscess at an anatomical location where the incidence of anaerobic pathogen involvement is increased Patient receiving a daily dose of &gt; 15 mg of systemic prednisone or equivalent, for &gt; 10 days within the period starting 14 days prior to study drug administration or anticipated through TOC Patient with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Medical history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to linezolid according to the judgment of the Investigator Patients receiving serotonergic agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) Patients who have severe liver disease History of pheochromocytoma, untreated hyperthyroidism, untreated or uncontrolled hypertension, carcinoid syndrome Evidence of uncontrolled, clinically significant (according to the judgment of the Investigator) cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic, gastrointestinal, neurological, or endocrine disease; malignancy or psychiatric disorder Current evidence of deep vein thrombosis or superficial thrombophlebitis Experienced a recent clinically significant coagulopathy Evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression Patient who previously enrolled in this study Patient who has previously enrolled in any other clinical trial within 4 weeks of enrollment through TOC. Treatment with an investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration Patient residing in a chronic care facility Any underlying condition or disease state that would interfere with the completion of the study procedures and evaluation of the absorption of study drug</criteria>
