	<brief_summary>We intend to take a nasal swab from each pediatric pre-operative patient in our out-clinic with the intention of looking for a connection between positive operative incisions and a positive nasal swab. The patients will be in the out-patient clinic for a few hours, and will be examined post-operatively after one week. Those with positive nasal swabs will be advised to apply a nasal cream (Mupirocin)in their noses for one week. Our hypothesis is that there is a correlation between positive nasal swabs and positive incision infections.</brief_summary>
