	<brief_summary>In an era of delayed fertility plans, there is an increasing need for a reliable method to predict ovarian reserve and responsiveness. The current tests include serum FSH, Inhibin B, Mullerian inhibiting factor (MIF) and ultrasonographic measures such as ovarian volume and number of antral follicles are non-specific and with questionable reliability. The biochemical tests represent the function of production of androgens, as a predictor of ovarian reserve, has not been tested yet. Working hypothesis and aims: testing the prognostic capability of hCG stimulating test of theca cells for estimating the ovarian reserve, and by that to calculate better the chance for IVF cycle success</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) Test: A Novel Method to Evaluate the Ovarian Reserve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>20 women &gt;40 years old and 20 women &lt;35 years old, attended to our IVF unit were included in the study. Another 20 other young women (&lt;35 years) with poor response in previous IVF cycles will be participate. All participants received a single hCG 10000 IU injection on cycle day 2-4. Hormone levels of LH, FSH, E2, P, Testosterone, Androstendione and 17-OHP were taken prior to the injection and on days 1, 3 and 7 afterwards. hCG induced hormone levels will be compared with IVF results</detailed_description>
