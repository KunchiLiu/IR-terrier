	<brief_summary>The study evaluates the safety and efficacy of Cotransplantation of Islet and Mesenchymal Stem Cell in Type 1 Diabetic Patients. The researchers hypothesize that additional Mesenchymal Stem Cell infusion can benefit the promising clinical islet transplantation through the following mechanisms: protection of islet from inflammatory damage, immunological modulation, engraftment promotion, thus decrease or eliminate the need of exogenous insulin and improve Î²-cell function.</brief_summary>
