	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized trial to study one-year outcomes of the Wingspan system for the treatment of Chinese patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic severe intracranial stenosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wingspan Stenting for Symptomatic Severe Stenosis of Intracranial Atherosclerosis Registry in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will enroll 200 Chinese patients with atherosclerotic intracranial stenosis of 70% to 99% that causes a recent ischemic neurologic event. The Winspan stenting following undersized Gateway balloon angioplasty will be performed at experienced centers (at least 10 cases' experiences of using the Wingspan system to treat the patients with intracranial stenosis for each center). The primary endpoint of the study, independently evaluated by neurologists, is any stroke or death within 30 days, plus ischemic stroke in the stented artery territory between 31 day and 1 year.</detailed_description>
