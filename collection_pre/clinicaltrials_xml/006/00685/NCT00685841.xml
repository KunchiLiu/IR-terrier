	<detailed_description>This study is a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group study of adult subjects with a primary clinical diagnosis of COPD. Approximately 800 subjects were to be randomized in this study. Study participation consisted of a total of eight (8) study visits over approximately four (4) months for each subject. This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.</detailed_description>

If there is no chest xray taken less than or equal to 3 months prior to study start, or if recent results are unavailable for review, a chest xray will be performed. Subject must be able to complete all study questionnaires and logs reliably. Exclusion Criteria Female subject who is pregnant or lactating. Subject who has participated in an investigational drug study within 30 days prior to study start, or who is currently participating in another investigational drug study. Subject whose schedule or travel prevents the completion of all required visits. Subject who is scheduled for inpatient hospitalization, including elective surgery (in patient or outpatient) during the trial. Subject with lifethreatening/unstable respiratory status, including upper or lower respiratory tract infection, within the previous 30 days prior to study start. Subject with a known history of asthma or any chronic respiratory disease (including a current history of sleep apnea) other than COPD (chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema). Subject with a history of cancer except nonmelanomatous skin cancer. Subjects with a history of cancer that is considered surgically cured and without a recurrence within the past 10 years may participate in the study. History of hematologic/lymphatic malignancy treated with chemotherapy or radiation is not allowed. Subject with a history of lung resection of more than one full lobe. Subject who requires continuous supplemental oxygen therapy (unless subject resides at elevation greater than or equal to 4,000 feet). Subject who has had a change in dose or type of any medications for COPD within 14 days prior to the screening visit. Subject with a known sensitivity to (R,R)formoterol, ipratropium, salmeterol or albuterol or any of the excipients contained in any of these formulations. Subject with a history of substance abuse or drug abuse within 12 months of study start, or with a positive urine drug screen at study start.
