	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Androgen blockade therapy may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Zoledronic acid may help relieve some of the symptoms caused by bone metastasis. It is not yet known whether androgen-blockade therapy is more effective with or without zoledronic acid in treating patients with prostate cancer that has spread to the bone. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying androgen-blockade therapy given together with zoledronic acid to see how well it works compared with androgen-blockade therapy alone in treating patients with prostate cancer and bone metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Androgen Blockade Therapy With or Without Zoledronic Acid in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer and Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the time to treatment failure in prostatic cancer patients with metastatic bone disease receiving maximum androgen-blockade therapy with vs without zoledronic acid. - Evaluate the time to first skeletal-related events in these patients. - Evaluate the overall survival of these patients. - Evaluate the extent of disease on bone scan in these patients. - Evaluate the pain scale and FACES pain-rating scale in these patients. - Evaluate the safety of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive maximum androgen-blockade therapy and zoledronic acid for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive maximum androgen-blockade therapy for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
