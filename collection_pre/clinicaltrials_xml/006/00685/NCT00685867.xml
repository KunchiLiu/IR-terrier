	<brief_summary>The study is a two-arm controlled multi-centre trial of two strategies to reduce nosocomial MRSA transmission and infection among surgical patients. Enrolment and primary analyses will be performed at the hospital level. A total of ten adult surgical departments with at least 3 surgical subspecialties each will participate in the study. Sites of the study are located in 9 countries (UK, France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Serbia, Greece and Israel). The primary objective is to determine the effect of an early MRSA detection &amp; decolonization &amp; isolation strategy compared to an enhanced standard control strategy on healthcare-associated MRSA isolation rates among surgical patients at risk of MRSA carriage, who are hospitalized for at least 24 hours.</brief_summary>
