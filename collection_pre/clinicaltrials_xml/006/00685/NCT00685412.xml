	<brief_summary>DNA vaccines, which are small pieces of DNA also known as plasmids, have several advantages over traditional vaccines such as live attenuated virus and recombinant protein-based vaccines. DNA vaccines appear to be well tolerated in humans. Therefore, we have developed our DNA vaccine, VGX-3100, to include plasmids targeting E6 and E7 proteins of both HPV subtypes 16 and 18. We have chosen to deliver our candidate vaccines via electroporation (EP) using the CELLECTRA™ constant current device to deliver a small electric charge following intramuscular (IM) injection, since animal studies have shown that this delivery method increases the immune response to our DNA vaccine leading to a decrease in the size of tumors caused by HPV 16 and 18. The vaccine is proposed to be given to patients with a history of CIN 2 and 3 that have been treated by surgery. We will determine which dose the DNA vaccine will be the best tolerated and elicit the strongest immune response.</brief_summary>
