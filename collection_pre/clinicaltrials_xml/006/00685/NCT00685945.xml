	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if giving isosorbide,a drug that is used to treat chest pain, affects blood vessel release of an anti-clotting factor.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To test the hypothesis that the administration of the NO donor isosorbide dinitrate,but not the phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil, will attenuate stimulated vascular t-PA release whereas both agents will improve glucose uptake.</detailed_description>
