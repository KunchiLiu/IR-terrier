	<brief_summary>Background: To identify characteristic morphological changes of the retina, their change over time and the association with visual function after combined photodynamic therapy (PDT) and intravitreal triamcinolone (IVTA). Methods: In this retrospective study, 40 patients (40 eyes) were treated with PDT and same day IVTA. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography (FA) and evaluation of distance visual acuity (VA) were performed. Main outcome measures were the anatomical changes within intra- and subretinal compartments and their detailed analysis and grading.</brief_summary>
