	<brief_summary>This is a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OPC-67683 in the treatment of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) for 56 days. In addition to an optimized background regimen (OBR).patients will receive will be randomized to: - 100 mg OPC-67683 BID - 200 mg OPC-67683 BID - placebo BID After 56 days subjects will complete their OBR.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Placebo-controlled, Phase 2 Trial to Evaluate OPC 67683 in Patients With Pulmonary Sputum Culture-positive, Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis (TB)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi center, randomized, double-blinded, stratified, placebo-controlled clinical trial in three parallel groups. Patients will be randomized to one of the following three treatment groups: - Optimized Background Regimen (OBR) plus 100 mg OPC-67683 twice daily - OBR plus 200 mg OPC-67683 twice daily - OBR plus placebo twice daily The three treatment groups will comprise approximately 140 patients each (male or female). The trial will consist of the following periods: - Pre-treatment Period (Visits 1 to 3 [Day -9 to Day -1]) - Treatment Period (Visits 4 to 59 [Days 1 to 56]) - Post-treatment Period (Visits 60 to 64 [Days 57 to 84]) Enrolled patients (those accepted into the screening period of the trial who signed an informed consent form) will be stratified at randomization by extent of pulmonary TB; an equal number of patients with and without cavities visible in the lung fields on baseline chest radiograph will be allocated to each treatment group. A total of 430 male or female patients aged 18 to 64 years, inclusive, with pulmonary, sputum culture-positive MDR TB (TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin) or with sputum smears positive for acid fast bacilli (AFB) and a positive rapid test for rifampicin resistance on direct sputum within 60 days prior to the expected date of enrollment. Patients with positive AFB smears and a positive rapid rifampicin resistance test will be enrolled as presumptively culture positive and withdrawn as ineligible if they are confirmed to not have sputum culture positive MDR TB.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Provide written, informed consent prior to all trialrelated procedures Male and female patients aged between 18 and 64 years, inclusive. Either mycobacterial culture of sputum positive for growth of M. tuberculosis or sputum smear positive for acid fast bacilli within 60 days prior to the expected date of enrollment. Patient with TB caused by isolates of M. tuberculosis complex confirmed to be resistant to treatment with isoniazid and rifampicin, or with positive rapid test for rifampicin resistance on direct sputum positive for acid fast bacilli within 60 days prior to the expected date of enrollment. Findings on chest radiograph consistent with TB. Able to produce sputum for mycobacterial culture. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test and agree to use a highly effective method of birth control (for example, two of the following precautions: tubal ligation, vaginal diaphragm, intrauterine device, oral contraceptives, contraceptive implant, combined hormonal patch, combined injectable contraceptive or depotmedroxyprogesterone acetate) throughout the participation in the trial and for 22 weeks after last dose (to cover duration of ovulation). Male patients must agree to use an adequate method of contraception (double barrier) throughout the participation in the trial and for 30weeks after last dose (to cover duration of spermatogenesis). A history of allergy to any nitroimidazoles or nitroimidazole derivates at any time. Use of the medications in Section 4.1 of the protocol including: use of amiodarone at any time during the previous 12 months, use of other antiarrhythmics for the previous 30 days, and use of certain other medications, including certain antidepressants, antihistamines, and macrolides, for the previous 14 days. Any current serious concomitant conditions or renal impairment characterized by serum creatinine levels â‰¥265 micromol/L or hepatic impairment characterized by ALT and/or aspartate transferase (AST) levels 3 times the upper limit of the laboratory reference range. Current clinically relevant changes in the ECG such as any atrioventricular (AV) block, prolongation of the QRS complex over 120 milliseconds (in both male and female patients), or of either the QTcF or QTcB interval over 430 milliseconds in male patients and 450 milliseconds in female patients. Current clinically relevant cardiovascular disorder such as heart failure, coronary heart disease, hypertension, arrhythmia, tachyarrhythmia or status after myocardial infarction. For patients with HIV infection, CD4 cell count &lt; 350/mm3 or on treatment with antiretroviral medication for HIV infection. Karnofsky score &lt; 60%. Any diseases or conditions in which the use of nitroimidazoles or nitroimidazole derivates is contraindicated. Evidence of clinically significant metabolic, gastrointestinal, neurological, psychiatric or endocrine diseases, malignancy, or other abnormalities (other than the indication being studied). Known or suspected alcohol abuse, that is, abuse sufficient enough to compromise the safety or cooperation of the patient in the opinion of the investigator. Administered an IMP within 1 month prior to Visit 1 (Screening [Days 9 to 3]). Pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to conceive or father a child within the timeframe described in the informed consent form. Recent use of methadone, benzodiazepines, cocaine, amphetamine/metamphetamine, tetrahydrocannabinol, barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants, and opiates as determined by a urine drug screen unless evidence is provided that the positive drug screen is the result of authorized medications products prescribed by a physician for a non abuse related indication. Any disorder that in the judgment of the investigator makes the subject not a good candidate for the trial or may prevent the patient from reliably participating in the entire course of the trial.</criteria>
