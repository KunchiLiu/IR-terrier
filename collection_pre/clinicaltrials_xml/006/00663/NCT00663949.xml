	<brief_summary>Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of ESRD and has a great impact on mortality and morbidity of diabetic patients. Despite renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitors in diabetic patients they can not hinder the progression of renal disease completely. Pentoxifylline as a TNFa blocker may hinder progression of diabetic nephropathy in combination of captopril.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of the Effect of Captopril Versus Combination of Captopril and Pentoxifylline on Reducing Proteinuria in Type 2 Diabetic Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of ESRD and has a great impact on mortality and morbidity of diabetic patients. Despite renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitors in diabetic patients they can not hinder the progression of renal disease completely. TNFa is a cytokine that is a target for medical therapy in diabetic nephropathy. In this study the effect of captopril on overt diabetic nephropathy compared to effect of combination of captopril and an antiTNFa drug ( pentoxifylline).</detailed_description>
