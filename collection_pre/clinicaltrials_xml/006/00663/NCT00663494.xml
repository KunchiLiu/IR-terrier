	<detailed_description>Myocardial fibrosis is observed in failing hearts and parallel to the progression of chronic heart failure (CHF) and myocardial remodeling. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are considered markers of fibrosis. Recently, circulating MMPs can be measured and are elevated in patients with CHF. However, MMPs it is still unclear whether MMPs are produced in failing hearts. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the production of MMP in failing hearts.</detailed_description>
