	<brief_title>VAS-2 Vasectomy With the Vax-X</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Vas-X works by stripping the lining of the vas deferens, the tube that sperm pass through during ejaculation. It is used in a way very similar to routine vasectomy, however, in a routine vasectomy, the vas is burned with an electrical device. With the Vas-X, there is no burning. The investigators are testing the Vas-X to determine whether it will offer a better way of performing a vasectomy. The investigators will conduct this study at the University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle.</detailed_description>
