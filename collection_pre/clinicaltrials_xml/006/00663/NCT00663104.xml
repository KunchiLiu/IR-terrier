	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare the effect of a progressive, periodized exercise training designed to impact bone, CHD-risk-factors and menopausal complaints versus the combined effect of exercise and "phytoestrogen" (cimicifuga racemosa; CR). After randomization, 84 females 1-3 year postmenopausal with no medication or illness affecting bone metabolism exercise over 12 months (EG; 42 with, 42 without CR), 42 women serve as wellness-control. Three group training sessions/week will be performed in the EG. Both groups will be individually supplemented with calcium and Vit-D (cholecalciferol).</brief_summary>
