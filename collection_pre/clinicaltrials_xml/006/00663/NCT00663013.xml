	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to study the effects of virtual reality (VR) on patients' pain perception during burn wound care. Such variables include psychiatric diagnosis and standard pain coping (i.e. pain catastophizer vs. non-pain catastrophizer).Aims: The investigators intend to evaluate the use of virtual reality in pain distraction for burn patients undergoing burn wound care. To that end our aims are: 1) To determine if pain perception will be less during the portion of the procedure in which the patient is immersed in the VR session in comparison to the portion of wound care which will occur without VR immersion. 2) To determine if anticipatory anxiety will be less for the portion of wound care that includes the virtual reality in comparison to the portion without virtual reality. 3) To determine if current psychiatric diagnosis, especially acute stress disorder and depression, is related to higher pain perception and greater decrease in pain with the virtual reality distraction. 4) To determine if being a "pain catastrophizer" is related to higher pain perception and greater benefits from the</brief_summary>
