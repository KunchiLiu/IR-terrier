	<brief_title>ORAL T-6: Oral Androgens in Man-6</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an 2-3 month open-label, two week pharmacokinetic study of two novel formulations of oral testosterone (T), in normal men whose endogenous T production has been temporarily suppressed by the administration of the potent GnRH antagonist Acyline. We will be determining the relative pharmacokinetics of six different oral formulations of T in both rapid and slow release compared to the immediate release preparation studied previously by our group.</detailed_description>
