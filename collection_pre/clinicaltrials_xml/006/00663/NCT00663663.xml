	<brief_summary>Treatments teaching people how to manage pain have been used to treat chronic pain in the general population. The purpose of this study is to see if these treatments delivered over the telephone can benefit persons with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or an acquired amputation. Specifically, we want to determine if these treatments can help reduce the negative consequences that pain often causes in terms of a person's mood, daily activities, and enjoyment of life. We are also interested in finding out if these treatments decrease a person's pain.</brief_summary>
