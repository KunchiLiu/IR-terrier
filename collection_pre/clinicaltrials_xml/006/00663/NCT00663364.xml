	<brief_summary>Dry skin is a physiological condition and is characterized in contrast to greasy skin by roughness, desquamation and lack of brightness of the skin surface. Subjectively, feelings of tension, burning and itching can occur. Dry skin needs special care due to its structural and functional characteristics.We monitor an application test the Dermatocosmetics Oilatum Physiogel AI Lotion and Physiogel Lotion. This is to be accomplished with patients having dry skin. The influence on the roughness of skin, desquamation, feeling of tingle, burning and itching should be documented. If sleep quality is disturbed by tingle or itch, this will be monitored, too.</brief_summary>
