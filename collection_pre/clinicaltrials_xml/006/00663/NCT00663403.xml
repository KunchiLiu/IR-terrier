	<brief_summary>Daptomycin is an antibiotic that is affective against many strains of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. This antibiotic would be appropriate for use in the intensive care unit (ICU) considering the severity of illness and high risk for infection within this hospital environment. While in the ICU, patients may develop acute renal failure. Approximately 75% of ICU patients who develop acute renal failure will require some form of renal replacement therapy until their kidneys recover. Continuous hemodialysis is becoming one of the most common forms of dialysis in the ICU as it is a gentle type of dialysis provided over longer periods of time. The current data demonstrating the ability of continuous hemodialysis to remove daptomycin from the body is derived from in-vitro trials. The purpose of this trial is to determine the extent of daptomycin removal from critically ill patients receiving continuous hemodialysis. Findings from this trial will be used to develop new dosing recommendations for daptomycin in continuous hemodialysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Daptomycin in Critically Ill Patients Receiving Continuous Venovenous Hemodialysis (CVVHD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Daptomycin is a FDA approved antibiotic. This pharmacokinetic trial will monitor daptomycin drug concentrations during continuous hemodialysis. The daptomycin concentration profiles developed from this study will assist in developing a dose recommendation that will result in daptomycin levels that are safe and within therapeutic ranges, as previously identified, in critically ill patients with acute renal failure treated with continuous hemodialysis.</detailed_description>
