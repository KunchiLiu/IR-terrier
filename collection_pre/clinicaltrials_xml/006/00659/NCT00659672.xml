	<brief_title>Effect of Whey Protein on Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several lines of evidence suggest that consumption of dairy foods, and specifically whey protein, may reduce blood pressure. This proposed study is designed investigate the effect of whey protein compared to another protein source. Since blood pressure is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease, if there is clear evidence that whey protein reduces blood pressure, dietary recommendations may be made regarding whey protein intake. However, dietary recommendations to consume whey protein as a means to improve health status must be science-based. Results from this study will provide a scientific basis for dietary recommendations regarding whey protein intake.</detailed_description>

Use of vitamin and mineral supplements or antacids containing magnesium or calcium.
