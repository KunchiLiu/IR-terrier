	<brief_summary>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY This study will explore the use of multi-site NIRS monitoring during tilt table testing, combining somatic and cerebral saturations data with hemodynamic data to establish the non-invasive assessment of global cardiac output distribution trends. HYPOTHESIS / SPECIFIC AIMS Study Aims: To evaluate the utility of multi-site NIRS monitoring in the cardiovascular hemodynamic assessment of children and adolescents during tilt table testing by establishing a non-invasive method to predict cardiac output maldistribution with the use of two-site NIRS monitoring in children and adolescents with syncope.</brief_summary>
