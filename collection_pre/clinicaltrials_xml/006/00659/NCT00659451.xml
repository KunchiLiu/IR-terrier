	<brief_summary>The anthypertensive treatment with Losartan may have benefits beyond blood pressure reduction on myocardial structure and function in hypertensive diabetic patients. We will evaluate the effect of losartan treatment on structural characteristics of myocardium in hypertensive diabetic patients: 1. left ventricular mass, intraventricular septal thickness, fractional shortening. 2. myocardial qualitative alteration and heterogeneity of myocardial tissue that describes myocardial texture and echodensity, related to collagen deposition; myocardial qualitative alteration will be evaluate by ultrasonic myocardial integrated backscatter signals (IBS) both as peak end diastolic signal intensity and as cardiac cyclic variation 3. alteration of diastolic function as studied by Doppler flow velocities across the mitral valve (Pulse Wave Doppler) and pulse wave Tissue Doppler Imaging parameters 4. aortic strain and distensibility (that is in relation with LVH) 5. epicardial adipose tissue measurement (this parameter is related to the visceral fat and may be an easy method to indicate patients with high cardiovascular risk).</brief_summary>
