	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radioactive drugs, such as iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), may carry radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells. A bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplant using stem cells from the patient may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by I 131 MIBG. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of iodine I 131 MIBG followed by a stem cell transplant in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>N2007-01: Ultratrace™ Iobenguane I 131 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory High-Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To establish the maximum tolerated dose of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (^131I-MIBG) in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma. Secondary - To describe toxicity following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma. - To estimate radiation absorbed doses to measurable lesions and to a standard set of normal organs following a 0.1 mCi/kg [3.7 MBq/kg] (minimum dose of 1.0 mCi [37 MBq] but not to exceed 5.0 mCi [185 MBq]) intravenous administration of ^131I-MIBG in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma. - To describe, within the confines of a phase IIa trial, objective tumor response following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma. - To explore dose-response following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma. - To explore quality of life assessment following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma. OUTLINE: - Dosimetry: Patients receive a dosimetric dose of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (^131I-MIBG) IV over 1-3 minutes. Patients then undergo 2 or 3 MIBG scans within 5 days of the dosimetry dose to assess biodistribution and tumor uptake. Patients with normal tumor uptake and biodistribution proceed to treatment. - Treatment: Within 1-4 weeks of the dosimetric dose, patients with normal tumor uptake and biodistribution receive a therapeutic dose of ^131I-MIBG IV over 1 hour on day 0 and undergo MIBG scan on day 7. Patients then proceed to autologous stem cell infusion. - Autologous stem cell infusion: Patients receive an infusion of autologous stem cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow on day 14. Patients with an ANC of &lt; 500/µl at any point after autologous stem cell infusion receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously once daily until ANC is &gt; 2,000/µl. Patients complete a quality of life questionnaire at baseline and then at day 60. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at day 60 and periodically thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must be at least one year and no more than 30 years of age when registered on this study. Patients must have high risk neuroblastoma and either have tumor left after treatment started at diagnosis or have had the tumor grow back (relapsed) after getting some treatment Patients must an MIBG scan done and it must be positive for neuroblastoma. Patients must have a PBSC or bone marrow stem cell product available that meets study criteria. If they don't already have stem cells frozen away then they must be able to have a stem cell pheresis done to collect the necessary amount of stem cells for study entry and these stem cells must meet study criteria. Patients must have adequate heart, lung, liver, kidney and bone marrow function. They have had a stem cell transplant using another person as the stem cell donor. (You can still be in the study if a previous transplant used your own stem cells) They have other medical problems that could get much worse if they had this treatment. They are on dialysis for badly working kidneys or have other kidney problems. They are pregnant or breast feeding. They have tumor in the brain or spinal cord that is seen on a CT or MRI scan one month before starting treatment They had total body radiation or radiation to the entire belly. They have a known allergy to MIBG, iodine or SSKI. They can't cooperate with the special precautions that are needed during UltratraceTM MIBG treatment or with other safety monitoring requirements of the study..</criteria>
