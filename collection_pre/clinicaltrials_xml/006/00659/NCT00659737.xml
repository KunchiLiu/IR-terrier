	<brief_summary>Recent evidence suggests multiple drug therapy is superior to single agents. The study compares the incidence of nausea, vomiting, need for rescue medication, prolonged PACU time, and unplanned hospital admission in patients with high risk for PONV treated with oral aprepitant with or without transdermal scopolamine preoperatively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Oral Aprepitant and Transdermal Scopolamine for Preventing Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a serious problem complicating surgery. PONV has an overall incidence of 30% and a 70% incidence in high-risk patients. PONV yields unplanned hospital admission, pulmonary aspiration, esophageal rupture, electrolyte abnormalities, dehydration, and delayed discharge from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Additional use of resources costs the health care industry hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Patient satisfaction is greatly improved when PONV is prevented.4 PONV etiology is multifactorial and the treatment is multimodal.</detailed_description>
