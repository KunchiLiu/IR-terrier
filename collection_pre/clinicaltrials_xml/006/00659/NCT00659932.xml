	<brief_title>Dealing With Anxiety: A Cognitive Behavioural Program for Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Having co-morbid anxiety or depression makes it difficult to carry out the activities for diabetes selfcare. Psychological interventions have been shown to result in improvements in HbA1C and depression. Reports on psychosocial outcomes are conflicting and there are no studies of quality of life. Our diabetes outpatient population has a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression compared to the general public and this led to the development of a group CBT intervention designed to reduce anxiety as a co-morbidity of diabetes.</detailed_description>
