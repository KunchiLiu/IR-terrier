	<brief_summary>Patients with diabetes treated with insulin often gain weight, which may deter patients from adhering to insulin treatment. Detemir is one type of long acting insulin approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in people with diabetes. It is similar to other long acting insulins (Neutral Protein Hagedorn [NPH], glargine) except that it has been associated with less weight gain compared to other types of insulin. The reasons for this are still unclear. One possibility is that detemir insulin acts differently than do other insulins in affecting how diabetic patients eat meals. The purpose of this study is to determine whether appetite and calories eaten during a meal are affected by the type of insulin used to treat diabetes. This is a pilot study which means we are gathering preliminary information to determine if a larger study can be done.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Detemir Compared to Insulin Glargine: Appetite and Calories Consumed in Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin detemir is a neutral, soluble long acting insulin analog with weight neutral properties. In limited studies, it has been shown to result in less weight gain in type 1 and type 2 diabetics compared with other long acting insulin formations. A possible mechanism for its weight neutrality is the fatty acid chain that may allow for improved central nervous system activity and effects on satiety. The primary objective of this study is to determine if patients with type 1 diabetes consume fewer calories when allowed to eat to satiety while treated with insulin detemir compared to insulin glargine. Secondary objectives are 1) subject responses on validated satiety scales and food diaries, 2) bioelectrical impedance analysis, 3) resting energy expenditure on indirect calorimetry/metabolic cart measurement, and 4) centrally acting mediators of satiety measured in the serum (Peptide YY [PYY], ghrelin, leptin).</detailed_description>
