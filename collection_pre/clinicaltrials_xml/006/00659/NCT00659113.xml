	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as S-1 and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy together with more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving S-1 and cisplatin together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage IIA, stage III, or stage IVA esophageal cancer that can be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S-1, Cisplatin, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IIA, Stage III, or Stage IVA Esophageal Cancer That Can Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate response rate in patients with stage IIA-IVA resectable esophageal cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy comprising S-1, cisplatin, and radiotherapy. Secondary - To evaluate overall survival of these patients. - To evaluate progression-free survival of these patients. - To evaluate toxicity in these patients. - To correlate initial squamous cell carcinoma antigen and C-reactive protein with response and survival in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral S-1 twice weekly, cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1, and undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week in weeks 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses. Tumor tissue samples are collected by esophagoscopy with biopsy and brushings for analysis of initial squamous cell carcinoma antigen and C-reactive protein correlation with response and survival. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 6 months.</detailed_description>
