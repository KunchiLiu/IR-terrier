	<brief_summary>The investigation is a randomized, double-blind, placebo involved and multi-center clinical trial. All subjects are assigned to 4 groups, including 3mg, 6mg, 12mg per day and placebo group. Each group includes 25 subjects, who have hepatic-cellular carcinoma accompanied with branch vein thrombosis. They receive investigational drug 40 days after resection surgery. Each cycle lasts 4 to 6 days with an interval of 29 days in all 6 cycles.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase ⅡStudy of Tyroserleutide for Injection in Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients who have signed the Informed Consent Form and are eligible for the entry criteria will be randomly assigned to either the TYROSERLEUTIDE treatment group or the placebo group. No matter which group the subject is assigned, he/she would receive chemotherapy treatment through the portal vein pump which was transplanted during the carcinoma section surgery 40 days before the randomization. - Participants will be given either TYROSERLEUTIDE or placebo through intravenous injection with an interval of 29 days, during which the participant will not take any investigational drug or any other anti-tumor treatment as well. On the day just next to the completion of each cycle of research treatment which usually lasts for 3-5 days, the participant will receive medical inspection so as to observe and ensure drug safety. - Participants will continue to receive investigational drug for 6 cycles until being detected with recurrence or metastasis of tumor or experiencing any serious side effects. - A CT scan or MRI scan will be performed for each participant to exclude the recurrence or metastasis of tumor and assess the effects of treatment once before the initiation of each new cycle.</detailed_description>
