	<brief_title>PK Study of Tacrolimus and Cyclosporine When Co-Administered With Adefovir Dipivoxil in Post-Liver Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multi-center, phase 2, open-label, sequential-cohort, drug interaction study. Cohort 1 subjects (tacrolimus and adefovir dipivoxil) were enrolled first. Based on the findings in Cohort 1, a decision was made on whether to enroll subjects in Cohort 2 (cyclosporine and adefovir dipivoxil)(i.e., if no interaction was observed in Cohort 1, Cohort 2 subjects would not be enrolled). Since no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed in Cohort 1, Cohort 2 was not enrolled.</detailed_description>
