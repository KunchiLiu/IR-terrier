	<brief_summary>Premenopausal women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are frequently treated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy can affect the ovaries, and the effects can range from temporary loss of menstrual periods to permanent menopause. It is difficult to predict how an individual's ovarian function will be affected by chemotherapy. There are a number of hormones which can be measured in the blood which are related to fertility and ovarian function. The levels of these hormones may change with chemotherapy, and may relate to the effect of chemotherapy on the ovaries. In this study, we plan to enroll 28 women ranging in age from 25 to 50 who are diagnosed with breast cancer and will be treated with chemotherapy. We will check blood levels of the hormones before, immediately after, and 1 year after treatment with chemotherapy. We will only be checking these blood tests for this study; the type of chemotherapy given will be up to the patient and her oncologist. We will also ask some questions about factors that can influence the levels of these hormones, such as number of children, age of menopause of other family members, and smoking history. The results from this study will be used to help us develop future studies looking at changes in ovarian function with chemotherapy, and the effects of other breast cancer therapies, such as endocrine therapy, on the ovaries.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Observational Study to Assess Changes in Biochemical Parameters of Ovarian Reserve With Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Subjects must be women with a histologically confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast (stage I, II, or III) with no evidence of metastatic disease. Patients must be planning to receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients may receive concurrent trastuzumab as indicated. If a patient has not yet undergone final surgical resection, it must be highly likely (but is not required to be definite) that the patient will be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients must have: Reached their 25th birthday and not yet reached their 51st birthday at the time of study enrollment, AND Had menses within 3 months prior to starting chemotherapy Patients must not have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for any oncologic, rheumatologic, or dermatologic condition. Patients must not have had prior bilateral oophorectomy or pelvic radiation, and must not have had prior hysterectomy ECOG performance status 0 2 Pregnant or nursing women may not participate. Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective nonhormonal contraceptive method, such as condoms, tubal ligation, nonhormonal intrauterine device, partner sterilization, and abstinence during chemotherapy. All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and given written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.</criteria>
