	<criteria>Select Male or female patients 18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of Ph+ CMLCP and CCyR Patients treated with an imatinib dose of 400 mg qd (at least 6 consecutive months for Group 1 patients) A suboptimal molecular response to imatinib defined as: Group 1: Treated with 1 year of imatinib, CCyR but no MMR (BcrAbl levels &gt;0.1%IS); Group 2: No specific duration of imatinib required, achieved CCyR but has &gt;1 log increase in BcrAbl transcript levels Adequate end organ function Select Prior accelerated phase or blast crisis CML Patients achieving prior CCyR on imatinib who lost cytogenetic response prior to entering study Previously documented T315I mutations Prior therapy with any other tyrosine kinase inhibitor except imatinib Patients with contraindications to receiving nilotinib, including concomitant medications</criteria>
