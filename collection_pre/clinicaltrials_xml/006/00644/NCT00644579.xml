	<brief_summary>As many as 85 % of renal transplant patients may suffer from viral warts with a high degree of treatment resistance. Promising results of hLAC (human lactalbumin complex with lipid) point to a beneficial effect without noticeable side effects of bLAC (bovine lactalbumin complex with lipid). The aim of first clinical trial with bLAC is to show proof of concept in treatment of cutaneous wart lesions on hands and/or feet after local administration of bLAC in two dose groups to immune suppressed, kidney transplanted patients.</brief_summary>
