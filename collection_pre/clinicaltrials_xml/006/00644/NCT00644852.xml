	<detailed_description>This is an Observational, retrospective study on the use of Risperidone long-acting injectable. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the characteristics, clinical responses, and safety issues of patients receiving long-term treatment of Risperidone. Patient outcomes will be evaluated based on pre-existing risk or disease factors and past medication use. Data will be collected from medical charts and other available medical records from one year prior to risperidone treatment until discontinuation of risperidone long acting injectable. The study will compare the number of days hospitalized for reasons relating to psychosis before and after treatment with risperidone long-acting injectable. Information about past use of anti-psychotic medications will be collected. The occurrence and frequency of adverse events [Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms (EPS) - the abnormal body movements sometimes associated with antipsychotic medications, body weight changes, drowsiness, sexual problems] and the dose or change in dose of Risperidone long-acting injectable will also be collected. The study will also investigate the relapse rate and the hospitalization rate before and after treatment. It is a chart review type of study.
