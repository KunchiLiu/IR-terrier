	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the addition of capsules containing soluble fibre complex emulsified with medium chain triglycerides and taken before with meals will lead to a significant amount of weight loss, reduced glycemic volatility and diminished cardio metabolic risk factors in overweight and obese individuals when compared to a placebo control. We believe that those participants taking 3-6 capsules per day of the treatment capsules over a 14 week period will loose a significant amount of weight compared to the placebo group.</brief_summary>
