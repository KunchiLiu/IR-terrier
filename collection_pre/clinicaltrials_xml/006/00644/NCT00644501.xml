	<brief_summary>The study is an open-label extension study, offering patients who participated and completed previous study 901 to continue treatment with DiaPep277 and clinical follow-up, for 2 additional years. The expectation is first to demonstrate that extended treatment with DiaPep277 is safe and second to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of treatment. Only patients who completed the previous 2-year study and still have beta-cell function above a threshold level will be eligible for this extension study.</brief_summary>
