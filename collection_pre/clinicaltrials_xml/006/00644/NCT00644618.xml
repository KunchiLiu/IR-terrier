	<brief_summary>For patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer, the combined use of external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and systemic chemotherapy of 5-FU has been widely recognized as the most effective chemoradiotherapy approach.But most patients succumb to local recurrence and metastasis after treatment, and the prognosis remains poor On the basis of the development and superiority of the interstitial brachytherapy and the radiosensitizing effect of gemcitabine, we performed a clinical study to explore the interaction of improved I-125 brachytherapy and gemcitabine and compare the regimen to the standard gemcitabine treatment specifically in patients with non-metastatic, unresectable pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
