	<brief_summary>Background and objective: To determine the efficacy of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and its effects upon intubation rate and mortality in ARDS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation and Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: This study was performed in the respiratory intensive care unit (ICU) at a university hospital. 20 patients who achieved the diagnostic criteria for ARDS were included. The patients were prospectively allocated into two groups: a standard therapy group and a NPPV group. Invasive mechanical ventilation indications had been determined before the study. Invasive ventilation was applied to those who in need of intubation, while those given intubation received a standard medical treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The following criteria indicated immediate intubation was needed: 1. Apne or respiratory pauses with loss of consciousness or gasping for breath or imminent respiratory arrest. 2. Inability to increase the patient's PaO2 to more than 40 mmHg and SpO2 to more than 80% with a FiO2&gt;0.6. 3. Inability to increase the patient's pH levels above 7.35, and development of blurred consciousness and confusion (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;9) due to respiratory acidosis despite all the support given. 4. Instability of the patient's hemodynamic parameters (such as systolic blood pressure &lt;80 mmHg or heart rate &lt;50 beats/minute lasting &gt;1 hour despite fluid resuscitation). Contraindications for NPPV include: 1. The need for urgent intubation. 2. The need for frequent aspiration due to excessive secretions (more frequent than 15 min.). 3. Inability of the patient to adapt himself / herself to the device or unwillingness to undergo NPPV.</criteria>
