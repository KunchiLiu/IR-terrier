	<brief_summary>This is a research study of how a cholesterol medication known as fenofibrate works differently in people with different genetic backgrounds. "Genetics" refers to certain things that are passed to a person by their parents, such as eye color or hair color. Genetic differences lead to people having different eye and hair color. There are also genetic differences in a protein called liver X receptor-alpha (LXRA), which may be important in predicting the response to fenofibrate.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a double blind crossover study of fenofibrate vs. placebo in healthy volunteers. The null hypothesis is that over a four week period, fenofibrate (160mg/day orally) is equivalent to placebo in terms of relative changes in cytokines ENA-78 and MCP-1 over a four week periods, separated by a four week washout. ENA-78 is a marker of inflammation. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCL5 for more details.</detailed_description>
