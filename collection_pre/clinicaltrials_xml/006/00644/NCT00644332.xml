	<brief_summary>According to the American Heart Association (AHA) 2011 update of heart disease and stroke statistics, more than 9 million adult patients in the United States (US) have angina. This update also notes that a study of 4 national cross-sectional health examination studies found that, among Americans 40 to 74 years of age, the age-adjusted prevalence of angina was higher among women than men. Per ACC/AHA guidelines, the goal of antianginal therapy is the complete or near complete elimination of anginal chest pain and a return to normal activities and functional capacity. However, evaluating angina and responses to antianginal therapy is often not straightforward. This is particularly true of female patients with angina. Because angina and response to antianginal therapy may differ in men and women, an instrument designed specifically to address symptomatology in women with angina could enhance our understanding and characterization of angina and responses to therapy in this population. The current study will evaluate the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of the newly developed Women's Ischemia Symptom Questionnaire (WISQ) based on changes in angina symptomatology in a female angina population treated with ranolazine, compared with the widely used Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ).</brief_summary>
