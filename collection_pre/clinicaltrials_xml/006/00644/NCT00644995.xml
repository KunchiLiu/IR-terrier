	<brief_title>Effectiveness of The Step Up Wellness Program for People With Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of the Step Up Wellness Program among people with depression who also are physically inactive and smoke cigarettes. Participation in this study will last 6 months. All participants will complete a baseline survey and then be assigned randomly to receive the Step Up Wellness Program or usual care for 3 months. Participants in the Step Up program will receive weekly phone calls from a study health coach. During these calls, the coach will discuss ways to improve and manage mood, increase physical activity, and prepare to quit smoking. Participants will also be given materials to review and homework assignments between calls. Participants in the usual care group will receive standard care which includes referrals for treatment of depression and nicotine dependence, as well as self-help information on physical activity. All participants will be surveyed at 4 and 6 months post-enrollment. Participants will also provide qualitative feedback on the program.</detailed_description>
