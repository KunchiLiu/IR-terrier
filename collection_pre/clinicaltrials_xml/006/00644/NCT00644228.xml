	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and bortezomib to see how well it works compared to dexamethasone and lenalidomide alone in treating patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the cancer. It is not yet known whether lenalidomide and dexamethasone is more effective with or without bortezomib in treating multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone With or Without Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma treated with lenalidomide plus low dose dexamethasone versus bortezomib plus lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess response using the new international response criteria. II. To bank specimens for future translational medicine research. III. Follow patients to assess overall survival and other long-term outcomes stratified by intent to transplant at progression. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate custom and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms in correlation with biology, prognosis and outcome for both treatment regimens combined; to verify the findings recently obtained with the custom Bank on a Cure program (BOAC) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip on Total Therapy 2 (TT2) data with respect to bone disease in the cooperative group setting. II. To use baseline gene expression profiling as a tool to evaluate the biology, prognostic and risk factors, and response to therapy for both treatment regimens combined. To validate John Shaughnessy's 70 gene risk model developed for Total Therapy 2 (TT2) in the cooperative group setting. OUTLINE: INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive dexamethasone orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive dexamethasone PO QD on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12; lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-14; and bortezomib intravenously (IV) over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In both arms, patients who intend to undergo transplantation at relapse undergo peripheral blood stem cell collection, preferably after course 2. MAINTENANCE THERAPY: After the completion of at least 4 courses (Arm I) or at least 6 courses (Arm II) of induction therapy, patients receive maintenance therapy comprising dexamethasone PO QD on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 6 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with measurable disease; patients with nonsecretory multiple myeloma (MM) based upon standard Mcomponent criteria (i.e., measurable serum/urine Mcomponent) are not eligible for this study; exception: patients with nonsecretory MM will be eligible only if the baseline serum Freelite is elevated (Note that serum Freelite must be drawn; serum light chains are not acceptable); all tests for establishing baseline disease status must be completed within 28 days prior to registration and documented on the baseline and followup tumor assessment form for multiple myeloma Patients must have received no prior chemotherapy for this disease; patients must have received no prior radiotherapy to a large area of the pelvis (more than half of the pelvis); prior steroid treatment is allowed provided treatment was not more than 2 weeks in duration; patients must not have received any prior treatment with bortezomib or lenalidomide Patients must have a Zubrod performance status (PS) of 0 3; NOTE: patients with PS 3 are eligible only if it is documented by the treating physician that the patient's multiple myeloma is the central cause of his/her disability; patients who have a PS of 3 due to other concurrent medical conditions are not eligible for this trial Platelet count &gt;= 80 x 10^3/mcL; must be obtained within 28 days prior to registration; exception: patients with biopsyproven heavymarrow involvement, as defined by having at least 30% marrow cellularity, with &gt; 50% of the cells being malignant plasma cells (documented marrow results required); in this case, although there are no required lower limits of normal for the blood counts, the treating physician must use his/her medical judgment as to the appropriateness of this study therapy for these patients Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1 x 10^3/mcL; must be obtained within 28 days prior to registration; exception: patients with biopsyproven heavymarrow involvement, as defined by having at least 30% marrow cellularity, with &gt; 50% of the cells being malignant plasma cells (documented marrow results required); in this case, although there are no required lower limits of normal for the blood counts, the treating physician must use his/her medical judgment as to the appropriateness of this study therapy for these patients Hemoglobin (including patients who have been either transfused or treated with erythropoietin [EPO]) &gt;= 9 g/dL; must be obtained within 28 days prior to registration; exception: patients with biopsyproven heavymarrow involvement, as defined by having at least 30% marrow cellularity, with &gt; 50% of the cells being malignant plasma cells (documented marrow results required); in this case, although there are no required lower limits of normal for the blood counts, the treating physician must use his/her medical judgment as to the appropriateness of this study therapy for these patients Patients must be offered participation in the Myeloma Specimen Repository for banking and future research; with the patient's consent, bone marrow aspirates and serum specimens will be submitted to the Myeloma Specimen Repository for additional testing and banking (including SNP testing); patient consent must be obtained before specimens may be submitted Patients must have baseline skeletal survey to include lateral skull, anteriorposterior (AP) pelvis and posterioranterior (PA) chest within 28 days prior to registration Institutions must submit a local cytogenetics report and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis report obtained prior to enrollment to S0777;

if these exact probes are not available locally, it is acceptable to submit results using local protocol; this must be noted on the prestudy form; NOTE: it is not required that the results of the FISH analysis be known prior to registration, only that preregistration specimens be drawn and sent for analysis prior to registration, and the FISH analysis report be submitted Patients with pathologic fractures, pneumonia at diagnosis or symptomatic hyperviscosity must have these conditions attended to prior to registration (i.e., intramedullary rod, I.V. antibiotics, plasmapheresis) Patients must have a calculated or measured creatinine clearance &gt;
