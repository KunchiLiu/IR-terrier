	<brief_title>Wheeze Detection in Adults During Dynamic Bronchial Situations Measured by PulmoTrack® 2010 With WIM-PC™ Technologies Recording</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma is defined by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guideline as a 'Chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The asthma guideline states that inflammation causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness and chest tightness that are associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction. Wheeze quantification by lung sounds analysis methods is objective, non invasive and has been shown to correlate with clinical status in asthma and bronchiolitis. The recording procedure is simple, requiring only the attachment of 4 ECG-size sensors to the chest wall. A 30-second recording is often adequate to obtain good quality data, where wheezes are detected and counted with high degree of accuracy. Karmel Sonix Ltd has developed the PulmoTrack® 2010 with WIM-PC™ Technologies device, indicated for acoustic pulmonary function measurement that quantifies the presence of wheezing. This study was designed in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using the PulmoTrack® 2010 with WIM-PC™ Technologies device for wheeze detection during dynamic bronchial situations in asthmatic adults.</detailed_description>
