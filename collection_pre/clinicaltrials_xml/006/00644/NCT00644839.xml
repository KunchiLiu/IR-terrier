	<brief_summary>Experiment in the test tube indicated that CP-945,598 becomes less soluble with increase of pH (less acidity). Changes in stomach acid levels may affect the solubility of CP-945,598, therefore, alters its availability in the blood. Omeprazole decreases acid levels in stomach. This study will compare the time course of drug concentrations in the body, safety, and tolerability of CP-945,598 given with and without omeprazole.</brief_summary>
