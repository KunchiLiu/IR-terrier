	<brief_summary>To evaluate the effect of three doses of oral sildenafil (20, 40 and 80 mg three times a day [TID]) on exercise capacity, as measured by the 6-Minute Walk test, as well as the safety and tolerability, after 12 weeks of treatment in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension who are aged 18 years and over. To investigate the plasma concentration-effect relationship and to determine the population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters.</brief_summary>
