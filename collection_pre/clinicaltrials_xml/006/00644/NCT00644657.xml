	<brief_summary>This study will explore the effect of clopidogrel on coated-platelets in patients who are given a loading dose before diagnostic catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention. We hypothesis that clopidogrel will reduce the percentage of platelets that are coated and therefore more hypercoagulable.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Clopidogrel on Coated-Platelets in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Platelet activity will be determined by light transmission aggregometry at baseline, after a 300 mg dose of clopidogrel and after the catheterization and/or angioplasty procedure. The change in the percentage of platelets that are coated platelets will be determined.</detailed_description>
