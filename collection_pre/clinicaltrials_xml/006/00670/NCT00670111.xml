	<brief_title>Restoration of Chronotropic Competence in Heart Failure Patients With Normal Ejection Fraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RESET is a multicenter trial that will assess the effect of pacing in heart failure patients with a normal ejection fraction (or diastolic heart failure). The purpose of the RESET study is to evaluate the effect of pacing on exercise capacity and quality of life in this heart failure population.</detailed_description>
