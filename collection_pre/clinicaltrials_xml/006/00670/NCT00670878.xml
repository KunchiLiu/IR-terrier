	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter randomized controlled, Phase III study comparing the disease free survival after randomisation in patients treated with 3 cycles of Epirubicin-Fluorouracil-Cyclophosphamide (FEC)-chemotherapy, followed by 3 cycles of Docetaxel (D)-chemotherapy versus 3 cycles of Epirubicin-Fluorouracil- Cyclophosphamide (FEC), followed by 3 cycles of Gemcitabine-Docetaxel(DG)- chemotherapy. Patients will be required to have HER2-neu positive disease and histopathological proof of axillary lymph node metastases (pN1-3) or high risk node negative, defined as: pT&gt;=2 or histopathological grade 3, or age &lt;= 35 or negative hormone receptor', but are not allowed to have evidence of distant disease. Patients will have to be entered into the study no later than 6 weeks after complete resection of the primary tumor. No other antineoplastic treatment other than surgical treatment, the defined cytotoxic and endocrine treatment and radiotherapy will be allowed prior to study entry and during the course of the study.</brief_summary>
