	<brief_summary>This randomized trial compared the effectiveness of a three session pharmacist-delivered group program for smoking versus one 5 to 10 minute standard care session delivered over the telephone on 7-day point prevalence quit rates. Participants in both groups were offered their choice of bupropion IR or nicotine patch at no cost. At 6 months after the established quit date, self-reported cessation was biochemically verified using tests for urinary cotinine.</brief_summary>
