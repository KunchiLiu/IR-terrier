	<brief_summary>HIV infected patients exposed to Hepatitis B virus are more susceptible to develop a chronic and severe liver disease, with a major risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. However, immune response to standard Hepatitis B vaccination is decreased in HIV-infected patients, compared to non HIV-infected individuals, and, in case of response, its durability has to be carefully followed up. This study compares the efficacy of two strategies of revaccination in HIV-infected patients who didn't respond to previous hepatitis B vaccination. Failure is defined by two conditions: non response to the primary immunization (2 to 4 single-dose injections received before the screening visit) and failure to a single 20 µg boost before being included in the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Two Strategies of Vaccination Against Hepatitis B in HIV-infected Patients Non Responding to Primary Immunization (B-BOOST)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comparison of 2 revaccination strategies in randomized HIV-infected patients with T CD4 cell count above 200/mm3 Intervention: 1. Arm A: GenHevac-B® 20μg IM at M0, M1, M6 2. Arm B: GenHevac-B® 40μg IM at M0, M1, M6</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIV1 infection T CD4 cell count number above 200 /mm3 History of 2 to 4 injections of Hepatitis B vaccine, at any time in the past No history of Hepatitis B vaccination with a doubledose schedule No response to Hepatitis B vaccination: serology Hepatitis B negative (AgHBs, AbHBs and AbHBc negative) the previous twelve months and at the screening visit AbHBs titers below 10 IU/ml four weeks after the boost of GenhevacB® 20μg preceding the randomization unchanged ARV treatment for the last 2 months for patients who are receiving ARV at the screening visit Undetectable HIV RNA for the last 6 months and ongoing ARV for any patients with T CD4 cell level below 350/mm3 HIV1 plasma load below 100 000 copies per ml for patients without ARV Negative pregnancy test at the screening visit, and immediately before the GenhevacB® 20 µg boost injection preceding the randomization Acute cytolysis in the last 3 months with transaminases equal or above 5 times the upper limit of normal for HIVHCV coinfected patients, or transaminases equal or above 2 times the upper limit of normal for non coinfected patients Any vaccine received during the month preceding the inclusion History of hypersensitivity to any component of GenHevacB acute opportunistic infection treated the month before the screening visit Severe and acute pyretic infection or unexplained fever the week before inclusion Hemopathy or solidorgan cancer Prothrombin factor equal or below 50% and/or platelets equal or below 50 000 per mm3 Immunosuppressive treatment or general corticotherapy (equal or above 0,5 mg per kg per day during at least 7 days) in the last 6 months before the screening visit Immunomodulating treatment (interferon, interleukine2,…) in the last 6 months before the screening visit Splenectomy Decompensated cirrhosis (Child Pugh B or C) Renal failure (creatinine clearance below 50 ml/mn) Other severe immunocompromised condition not related to HIV infection (solidorgan transplantation, chemotherapy in the last 6 months,….)
