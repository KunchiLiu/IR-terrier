	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate the effect of omalizumab on the number of tissue eosinophils and other markers of airway inflammation and remodeling, including thickness of the lamina reticularis, in moderate to severe asthmatics with persistent symptoms and evidence of airway inflammation despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta-agonists. This study will also investigate the correlation between systemic and pulmonary inflammation, and the correlation between clinical outcomes and changes within the tissue, to assist in the future identification of patients with tissue eosinophilia and their response to treatment, without the need for invasive bronchoscopy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients 1875 years of age with moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma receiving a high dose inhaled corticosteroid (≥800µg per day BDP or equivalent) and a regular long acting betaagonist for at least 3 months prior to screening With a body weight between 20 and 150kg and a serum total IgE level of 30 to 700 IU/mL With ≥2% eosinophilia in induced sputum at screening With postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥60% predicted With a positive skin prick test (diameter of wheal ≥ 3 mm) or RAST test to at least one perennial aeroallergen (eg. dust mite, cat/dog dander, cockroaches), documented within the past 2 years or demonstrated at Visit 1, to which the patient will be exposed on a regular basis (most days) for the duration of the study. Patients who've had an asthma exacerbation during the 4 weeks prior to randomization Current smokers, stopped smoking within the last 12 months or have a smoking history of &gt;10 pack years History of severe allergy to food or drugs Previous treatment with omalizumab Any patient considered to be unsuitable to bronchoscopy, according to the judgment of the investigator Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria applied.</criteria>
