	<brief_summary>To investigate if the use of autologous bone graft around the anchor-peg glenoid prosthesis correlates with bony apposition on computed tomography scans, decreased radiolucent lines and component loosening, and functional outcomes. We hypothesize that by utilizing autologous bone graft from the resected humeral head, placed around the anchor peg glenoid prosthesis at implantation, there is a low incidence of glenoid loosening. We suggest that the absence of radiolucent lines correlated with excellent shoulder function.</brief_summary>
