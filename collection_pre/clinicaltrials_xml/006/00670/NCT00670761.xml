	<brief_summary>This randomized study will examine the efficacy, safety and acceptability of misoprostol for treatment of incomplete abortion. Women diagnosed with incomplete abortion will be randomized to receive one of the following regimens: In Tanzania and Mozambique: 1. 600 mcg of oral misoprostol in one dose, or 2. Standard surgical treatment (MVA) In Moldova and Madagascar: 1. 600 mcg of oral misoprostol in one dose, or 2. 400 mcg of sublingual misoprostol in one dose. In Burkina Faso and Vietnam: 1. 400 mcg of sublingual misoprostol in one dose. We hypothesize that treatment of incomplete abortion with either 400 mcg sublingual misoprostol, 600 mcg oral misoprostol or MVA are equally effective in evacuating the uterus.</brief_summary>
