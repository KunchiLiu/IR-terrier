	<brief_summary>Patients will receive 2mg/kg/day IV daily administration of AmBisome® over 30-60 minutes as a reaction to signs/symptoms and positive Candida culture</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CRITIC - Treatment of Candidemia and Invasive Candidiasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be enrolled to receive intravenously AmBisome® at 2 mg/kg/day for a maximum of 4 weeks. Treatment will be discontinued in case of failure, adverse events precluding treatment or success. In case of success AmBisome® at 2 mg/kg/day should be administered for at least 5 days after the complete resolution of all clinical findings of an active infection or for at least 8 days after the last positive blood culture or culture from a normally sterile site. It is not recommended to declare failure (and therefore change treatment) before giving at least 5 days of antifungal therapy. Failures in patients given less than 5 days of treatment should be well documented (e.g. persistent positive cultures despite catheter removal, clinical deterioration in absence of any explanation other than the fungal infection). Follow-up evaluations will be conducted at 2 and 4 weeks after the end of AmBisome® therapy. At end of treatment (time point for success or failure) patients may be shifted to oral (not intravenous) antifungals at the discretion of the local investigator, once a complete response has been achieved, if secondary prophylaxis is deemed necessary.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients admitted to ICU for all medical reasons that meet the inclusion criteria Males or non pregnant females (women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at baseline). Subjects who are 14 years old or older. Subjects with at least one positive blood culture isolation of a Candida spp. from a specimen or from a normally sterile site (including abdominal catheters), drawn within 96 hours prior to study entry. Subjects who have clinical evidence of infection AT SOME TIME WITHIN 48 HOURS PRIOR TO ENROLLMENT, including AT LEAST ONE of the following: 1. temperature&gt; 38°C on 2 occasions at least 4 hours apart or one determination greater than 38.5°C (internal, at oesophagus, tympani or bladder levels). 2. systolic blood pressure &lt; 90, or a &gt;30 mm Hg decrease in systolic BP from the subject's normal baseline. 3.

Subjects with moderate or severe liver disease defined as any one or more of the following: * Alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, or total bilirubin greater than 5 times the ULN (upper limit of normal) Subjects with a severe renal impairment defined by a serum creatinine of more than 2.5 mg/dL. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Subjects who are unlikely to survive more than 24 hours. Subjects who previously participated in this study. Subjects who have received within the two weeks before study entry, are receiving or likely to receive any investigational drug (unlicensed new chemical entity).</criteria>
