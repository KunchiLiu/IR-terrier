	<brief_title>Effects of Hydration to Prevent Contrast Induced Nephropathy in PCI for ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are at high risk for CIN because of hemodynamic instability of the patient, inability to prevent the phenomenon (hydration) and the possible exposure to high volume of contrast media. Recent reports have shown incidence of CIN up to 19% in this population and a related increase of in-hospital mortality. Merten e coll. (JAMA 2004) reported that sodium bicarbonate infusion before and after contrast exposure in patients with chronic renal failure and without myocardial infarction (AMI) is more effective than sodium chloride in preventing CIN. Up to date there is no evidence of any effective prophylactic measures in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. The aim of the study is to test the efficacy of low versus high volume hydration and the efficacy of two different solutions (sodium chloride versus sodium bicarbonate) in preventing CIN in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI. The infusion of the randomized solution will start just after randomization and after determination of baseline serum creatinine. Determination of serum creatinine will be repeated at 24, 48 and 72 hours after randomization. Creatinine clearance will be calculated with Cockroft-Gault formula and MDRD.</detailed_description>
