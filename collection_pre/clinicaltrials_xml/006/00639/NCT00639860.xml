	<brief_title>Evaluation of OSSIX-Plus Resorbable Collagen Membranes for Alveolar Ridge Preservation Following Exodontia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reduction in alveolar ridge height and width may prohibit optimal implant placement, and often compromises the esthetic and functional result. Alveolar ridge preservation has been evaluated in many studies. A variety of bone grafting materials and barrier membranes have been studied for their ability to enhance bone formation in damaged alveolar ridges, and to evaluate their bone healing and bone-forming capacity in extraction sockets. However, the newly developed resorbable collagen membrane OSSIX-Plus has not been evaluated for this purpose. This study is designed to test the ability of OSSIX-Plus (OraPharma Inc., Warminster, Pennsylvania) in promoting optimal bone healing following exodontia. We hypothesize that use of OSSIX-Plus will result in preservation of the height, width and density of the residual alveolar ridge following tooth extraction.</detailed_description>
