	<brief_summary>The study hypothesizes that rate of thromboembolic complications of the On-X prosthesis is reduced as compared to the SJM prosthesis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized On-X Versus SJM Evaluation Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a multi-centre, randomized trial that will sequentially enroll up to 500 eligible patients in each group from up to 10 participating study centres internationally to test the hypothesis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. The patient requires an isolated mitral or isolated aortic valve replacement. (Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass and / or concomitant repair of mitral or tricuspid valves are eligible.) 2. The patient is a candidate for receipt of a mechanical heart valve. 3. The patient (or legal guardian) has signed a studyspecific informed consent form agreeing to the randomization, data collection and followup requirements. 4. The patient can be having a reoperative procedure, so long as the previous prosthetic valve is explanted and the patient does not become a double valve implantation patient. 1. The patient is not a candidate to receive a mechanical heart valve. 2. The patient already has a prosthetic valve other than the valve(s) being replaced at this time. 3. The patient requires a tricuspid valve replacement. 4. The patient is enrolled in another investigative study or trial.</criteria>
