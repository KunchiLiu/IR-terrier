	<brief_summary>The administration of néfopam after initial treatment by kétoproféne, could obtain, in patients remaining pain and classically need morphine, analgesia at least the same as morphine alone. The use of néfopam second line after ketoprofen could reducing (or even eliminating) the need for morphine (and its side effects), allowing a reduction in the length of stay of patients in the emergency unit. The main objective is to show that the addition of a néfopam initial treatment with the kétoproféne, reduces, in patients with ureteral calculi, the percentage of patients requiring the use of a treatment by morphine. The secondary objective is to reduce the side effects caused by the morphine, shorten the time to install the appropriate level of analgesia while reducing the risk of failure of the titration morphine, reduce the time spent on titration of morphine and reduce the length of stay patient intake in emergency unit.</brief_summary>
