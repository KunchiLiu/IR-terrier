	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether age at introduction of gluten-containing cereals (e.g. wheat) plays a role in influencing the risk of celiac disease (CD) development in infants with a first-degree relative affected by CD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk of Celiac Disease and Age at Gluten Introduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We undertook a prospective study to establish the incidence of CD autoimmunity related to the timing of gluten exposure in at-risk infants. Infants at family risk for CD (at least one first-degree relative affected) are enrolled in this prospective, multicentre, intervention study conducted in Italy. Infants are randomly assigned to introduce gluten at either 4-6 or 12 months (groups A and B, respectively) and then enter a follow-up period of 5 years. Duration of breastfeeding and types of formulas, adherence to the dietary plan, amount of gluten administered, and clinical data are collected by phone or direct interview at 4, 7, 9, and 12 months of age. HLA (Human Leucocyte Antigene) status and CD serology (anti-transglutaminase and other autoantibodies) are tested at 15, 24, 36 and 60 months of age.</detailed_description>
