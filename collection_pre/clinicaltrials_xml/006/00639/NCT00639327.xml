	<brief_title>Second Line Chemotherapy for S-1 Refractory Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer (AGC) in the US is Cisplatin/5-FU (CF) or docetaxel/CF (DCF), is in Europe epirubicin/CF (ECF) or epirubicin/oxaliplatin/ capecitabine (EOX). Until 2006, there was no evidence of standard chemotherapy for AGC in Japan. In 2007, by the results of JCOG9912 trial (5-FU alone vs. CPT-11/CDDP vs S-1) and SPIRITS trial (S-1 alone vs. S-1/CDDP), S-1/CDDP is regarded as a new standard regimen in Japan. In 2008, by the results of TOP-002 trial (s-1 alone vs. S-1/CPT-11), S-1/CPT-11 could not show the superiority to S-1 alone. One of the other phase III trials, JACCRO GC-03 trial (S-1 alone vs. S-1/docetaxel, NCT00287768) is now ongoing. However, the position of CPT-11 in the treatment of AGC will be regarded as a second-line. In Japan there is a controversy for the treatment of S-1 refractory gastric cancer. The controversy is continuing S-1 (like FOLFOX to FOLFIRI) or not as a second-line. After the successful adjuvant S-1 results (ACTS-GC trial), the same problem will occur in the patients who are recurrent from adjuvant S-1. Then, we conducted a phase II/III trial of CPT-11 with or without S-1 in the treatment of first-line S-1 refractory AGC.</detailed_description>
