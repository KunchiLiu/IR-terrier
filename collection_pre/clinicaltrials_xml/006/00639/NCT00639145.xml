	<detailed_description>Although the use of HAART in pregnancy has significantly reduced rates of vertical transmission of HIV-1, some questions remain regarding the safety of these therapies and their potential impact on the uninfected infant. The overall goal of the project is to establish a voluntary exposure-registry and perform observational surveillance on HIV - positive pregnant women who are exposed to antiretroviral products during the prenatal period, in order to evaluate the outcome of the pregnancy and safety of the products in HIV-positive pregnant women, and their infants.</detailed_description>
