	<brief_summary>This research project is supported by a multicentric network of collaborators whose goal is to assess the efficacy of transplanting allogenic pancreas islets to restore insulin secretion in patients with type 1, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with kidney transplantation and to improve their metabolic control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transplantation of Pancreatic Islets in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Functional Kidney Graft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective is to demonstrate the beneficial effect of islet allotransplantation in patients with type 1 diabetes with no endogenous insulin secretion, and with a functional kidney graft. The other objectives are to evaluate the conditions for the efficacy of islet cell transplantation, to assess the improvement in quality of life and the cost of the islet cell transplantation.</detailed_description>
