	<brief_summary>This study will examine the effect of red yeast rice extract compared to pravastatin on muscle related complaints in individuals with high cholesterol who have previously been unable to tolerate statin medications due to muscle pain. The study will determine whether red yeast is associated with a lower level of muscle related complaints compared to pravastatin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety of Red Yeast Rice for High Cholesterol in Individuals With Statin Intolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>20 million Americans are actively treated with statins at an annual cost of 16 billion dollars. Statins are effective therapeutic agents for reducing LDL cholesterol and have documented effectiveness. However, a significant subset of patients (5-18%), cannot tolerate lipid lowering statin therapy due to intolerable muscle-related symptoms characterized by muscle pain and/or weakness. These symptoms affect quality of life and lead to poor adherence. Patients may seek alternative therapies to manage hypercholesterolemia if they have been intolerant of statin therapy. One commonly used alternative treatment option is the Chinese herb red yeast rice extract. Several small studies performed in China, have suggested this treatment is efficacious and well tolerated. In the U.S. red yeast rice is sold over the counter a dietary supplement. The objective of this study is to critically examine the safety and efficacy of the Chinese herb red yeast rice as an alternative lipid lowering therapy, in a statin intolerant population. This objective will be operationalized by a double-blind randomized trial, comparing the effect of red yeast rice extract, to that of pravastatin on the level of myalgia in subjects with a prior history of statin-induced myalgias. The specific aims include: 1. Determine the relative rates of withdrawal from treatment in subjects receiving red yeast rice compared to pravastatin. 2. Determine if red yeast rice is associated with a lower level of muscle pain (myalgia) symptoms compared to pravastatin as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory, a validated pain questionnaire. 3. Determine if red yeast rice is associated with a lower level of muscle weakness compared to pravastatin as measured by a dynamometry, a validated muscle strength testing method.</detailed_description>
