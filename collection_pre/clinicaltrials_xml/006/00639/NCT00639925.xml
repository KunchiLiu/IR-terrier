	<detailed_description>Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 and 2 (VEGFR1 andVEGFR2) are essential targets to tumor angiogenesis, and we identified that peptides derived from these receptors significantly induce the effective tumor specific CTL response in vitro and in vivo. According to these findings, in this trial, we evaluate the safety, tolerability and immune response of these peptide emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 in combination with gemcitabine</detailed_description>
