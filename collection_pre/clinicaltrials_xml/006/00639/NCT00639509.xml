	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well IMC-A12 works in treating patients with advanced liver cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as IMC-A12, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IMC-A12 in Treating Patients With Advanced Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with anti-IGF-1R recombinant monoclonal antibody IMC-A12. II. To determine the best overall response rate in patients treated with this drug. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the median overall survival of patients treated with this drug. II. To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and adverse events profile of this drug in these patients. III. To perform a subgroup analysis to compare PFS of patients with advanced HCC who are hepatitis B positive/hepatitis C negative versus patients who are hepatitis B negative/hepatitis C positive treated with this drug. IV. To store pre-therapy paraffin embedded tumor tissue for future tissue-based correlative studies. V. To evaluate tumor necrotic areas using a new volumetric method of assessing non-viable tumor as a correlate for response. VI. To prospectively validate and compare the CLIP and the GDETCH staging systems and additional prognostic factors. OUTLINE: Patients receive anti-IGF-1R recombinant monoclonal antibody IMC-A12 IV over 1 hour once weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo serum sample collection at baseline for future tissue-based correlative studies. Previously collected paraffin embedded tumor tissue samples are also stored for future correlative studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for at least 1 year.</detailed_description>
