	<brief_summary>Studies in animals have found that allopurinol can markedly improve fructose induced metabolic syndrome. In this study we test the hypothesis that allopurinol may lower BP, reduce triglycerides, and improve metabolic parameters in subjects placed on a high fructose diet.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Allopurinol on Insulin Resistance and Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 male subjects, age 40 to 65 years of age, will be placed on a 3500kcal (55% carbohydrates containing 200 g fructose) for 2 weeks. Half will receive allopurinol mg/day (randomized). At the end of 2 weeks we measure a variety of parameters including fasting glucose and insulin levels (with calculation of HOMA index), serum lipids (including triglycerides and LDL/HDL cholesterol), sitting blood pressure, serum uric acid, weight, and various other measurements (C reactive protein, adiponectin and leptin levels, and urate redox products). Primary endpoint is insulin resistance. Secondary endpoints are blood pressure, lipids, uric acid, weight.</detailed_description>
