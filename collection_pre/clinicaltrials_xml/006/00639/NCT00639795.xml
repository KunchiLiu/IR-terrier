	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare: 1. The degree of systemic postoperative inflammation (cytokine measurement) with the degree of post-operative pain 2. The degree of pain and nausea and 3. The pre and post operative pulmonary functions following Video Assisted Thorascopic Surgery (VATS) performed under general anesthesia with the addition of intra-operative single-injection paravertebral blockade vs general anesthesia with a sham intra-operative paravertebral nerve blockade</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Enrolled subjects scheduled to undergo video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS) will be randomized to receive either paravertebral block or placebo(adhesive bandage applied at the site). - All patients will undergo a standardized general anesthetic regimen. - Human biological specimens will be collected preoperatively, postoperatively (in the PACU) at the first morning blood draw of POD 1, POD 2, POD 3, and POD 10-14 (follow-up visit at surgeons office)and analyzed for CRP, Cortisol &amp; inflammatory markers (IL-1beta,IL-2,IL-4,IL-5,IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,INF-gamma, TNF-alpha) - Pulmonary functions (FEV1/FEV6) will be performed in the pre-op holding area prior to sedation and post-operatively on the morning of post-op day 1. - Pain levels will be assessed with the Wong-Baker Faces and Visual Analog Scale pre-operatively in the PACU and hourly for a total of 6 hours and then every 8 hrs.and with patient self-report in diary after discharge. - Pain levels will be assessed with the McGill-Melzack Pain Questionnaire pre-operatively, the evening of POD1-POD3 and by patient self-report in diary after discharge. - Nausea assessments will occur at arrival on floor and every 8 hours thereafter until discharge. - Narcotic requirements will be collected daily in the hospital and by patient self report in diary thereafter.</detailed_description>
