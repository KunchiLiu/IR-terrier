	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study of Liposomal Paclitaxel With/Without Capecitabine in Patients With Advanced Gastric Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics of a new formulation of taxane (liposomal paclitaxel) have never been studied in Chinese cancer patients, either alone or with capecitabine .This clinical trial is designed to find out the MTD and pharmacokinetics of liposomal paclitaxel with a beginning dose of 175mg/m2 with/without Capecitabine in Chinese patients with advanced gastric carcinoma.</detailed_description>
