	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is that brain injury patients have alterations of the respiratory system related to intraabdominal pressure. Furthermore application of moderate levels of PEEP may improve respiratory function in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Respiratory Mechanics in Brain Injured Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We investigate the mechanical properties of the respiratory system, partitioned into its lung and chest wall components, the functional residual capacity, the gas-exchange and alveolar recruitment in brain injured patients. The measurements will be performed under sedation at different levels of PEEP. The following groups will be included: a) control patients withot lung injury and brain injury; b) brain injured patients without lung injury within the first 72 hours; c) brain injured patients without lung injury after 72 hours; d) brain injured patients with lung injury. Brain injury was defined as primary or secondary. Respiratory functional data will be related to intra-abdominal pressure.</detailed_description>
