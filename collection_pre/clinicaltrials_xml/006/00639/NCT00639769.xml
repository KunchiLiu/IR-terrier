	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: To determine if CPT-11 given together with cisplatin is effective in treating recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the efficacy of irinotecan hydrochloride and cisplatin in patients with local-regionally recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. - Evaluate the toxicity of irinotecan hydrochloride and cisplatin in these patients. - Determine the palliative effect of irinotecan hydrochloride and cisplatin on head and neck cancer symptoms using the Vanderbilt Cancer Center (VICC) Head and Neck Cancer Symptom Survey. OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes and cisplatin IV on days 1, 8, 22, and 29. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients complete the Vanderbilt Cancer Center (VICC) Head and Neck Cancer Symptom Survey at baseline, before each course, at the completion of study therapy, and then at each follow-up visit. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 weeks for 1 year and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
