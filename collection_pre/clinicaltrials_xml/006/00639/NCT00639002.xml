	<detailed_description>The protocol was originally designed as a Simon two stage but after it was determined that the initial 13 patients enrolled did not meet the definition of a 'responder' according to the International Uniform Response Criteria for multiple myeloma the protocol was amended to allow patients who had disease progression at any time or stable disease for 3 cycles and did not meet a withdrawal criterion or had withdrawn consent to have 40 mg of dexamethasone added to their dose of ruxolitinib.</detailed_description>
