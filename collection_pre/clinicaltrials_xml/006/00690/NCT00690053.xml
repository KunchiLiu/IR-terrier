	<brief_summary>Non invasive imaging of hypoxia with the aid of PET-scans could help to select the patients having a hypoxic tumour who could be treated with specific anti-hypoxic treatments such as bio-reductive drugs or hypoxic radio-sensitizers. Several 2-nitroimidazoles to which the compound to be tested, HX-4, belongs, labelled with Fluor-18 have already been used in patients. However, bad image quality and unpredictable kinetics limit their use. In extensive pre-clinical models, the combination of HX-4 labelled with Fluor-18 is a promising non-toxic new probe to determine hypoxia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Imaging of [18F]HX4 With Positron-Emission-Tomography (PET)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the toxicity of the hypoxia PET-tracer [18F]-HX4 in cancer patients in two dose-steps: - Step 1 (3-6 patients): a single dose of maximum 6 mCi (222 MBq) dose of [18F]HX4 (which contains a maximum of 15 μg HX-4) via a bolus IV injection. - Step 2 (3-6 patients): a single dose of maximum 12 mCi (444 MBq) dose of [18F]HX4 (which contains a maximum of 27 μg HX-4) via a bolus IV injection.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Histological or cytological confirmed solid tumour, primary or secondary stage IV and/ or tumours with no curative treatment options. Normal white blood cell count and neutrophils Normal platelet count No anaemia requiring blood transfusion or erythropoietin Adequate hepatic function: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for the institution; ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN for the institution). Calculated Creatinin clearance at least 60 ml/min No administration of Fluor18 in the previous 24 hours Capable of complying with study procedures</criteria>
