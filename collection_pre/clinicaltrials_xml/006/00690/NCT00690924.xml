	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Calcitriol may prevent lung cancer in patients with metaplasia or dysplasia of the lungs. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of calcitriol in preventing lung cancer in current smokers and former smokers at high risk of lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcitriol in Preventing Lung Cancer in Smokers and Former Smokers at High Risk of Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To establish the safety of calcitriol in patients at high risk of lung cancer. - To determine the dose-limiting toxicities of calcitriol in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral calcitriol on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks for 3 months in absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo blood collection periodically for pharmacokinetic and molecular analysis. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
