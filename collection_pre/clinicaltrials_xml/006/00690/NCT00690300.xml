	<brief_title>Docetaxel Plus Oxaliplatin as Therapy in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For years Fluorouracil was the established treatment for pancreatic cancer with median survival times up to 8 months. Since 1997 Gemcitabine is also a standard therapy with in comparison to Fluorouracil a significant better clinical benefit. But after progression of the disease under a palliative first-line therapy there is no established second line therapy for pancreatic cancer. So the purpose of this study is to test the combination of Oxaliplatin and Docetaxel in patients with metastatic or locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after failure of a palliative first line therapy to get a reasonable second line concept.</detailed_description>
