	<brief_summary>Adult volunteers were skin tested with 1.27 ug spherule-derived coccidioidin. The skin test antigen was evaluated in three different populations of adult volunteers to determine the safety and efficacy of the product in the assessment of delayed-type hypersensitivity to Coccidioides immitis. Induration greater than or equal to 5 mm after 48 hours was considered positive for exposure to C. immitis.</brief_summary>
