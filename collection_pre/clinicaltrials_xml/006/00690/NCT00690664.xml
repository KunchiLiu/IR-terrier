	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to better understand African American hair and scalp, its biologic appearance and how this relates to African Americans' perceptions of their hair and scalp health. Since most hair studies have looked at Caucasian hair and scalp, we will use a population of Caucasian subjects for comparison in evaluating various hair and scalp parameters.</brief_summary>
