	<brief_title>High-fidelity Simulation in Health Care Education</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High-fidelity simulation has many advantages in medical education. Simulation-based critical care training is especially valuable due to error-prone work settings and the high cost of patient adverse events. This study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of implementing the high-fidelity simulation in critical care training, and the feasibility of high-fidelity simulation as an evaluation tool.</detailed_description>
