	<brief_summary>The purpose is to determine if an intracameral solution of 0.2% tropicamide and 2% phenylephrine can dilate the pupil for cataract surgery as well as pre-operative topical 1% tropicamide and 5% phenylephrine. We will be looking at two separate groups of patients, those with and those without pseudoexfoliation syndrome. We will be looking at how each method affects the size of the pupil at the beginning and at the end of cataract surgery. In addittion, we will look at what effect the two different methods have on blood pressure and heart rate in the pre-operative, peri-operative and post-operative periods.</brief_summary>
