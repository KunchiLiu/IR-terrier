	<brief_summary>Primary objective: Efficacy of pioglitazone (45 mg/day) as add-on therapy to standard therapy with riluzole in patients with ALS compared to placebo in terms of survival (mortality defined exclusively as death). This is a prospective, multicentre, randomised, stratified, parallel-group, double-blind trial comparing placebo with 45 mg pioglitazone as add-on therapy to 100 mg riluzole in ALS in 220 enrolled patients. For entry, the El Escorial Criteria for diagnosis will be used. The duration of treatment will be 18 months. The primary endpoint will be subjected to a confirmatory analyses. Secondary variables will be incidence of tracheotomy or non-invasive ventilation, ALS Functional Rating Scale, Quality of life and safety variables.</brief_summary>
