	<brief_title>A Multicenter, Active and Placebo-controlled Study of Enteric Coated Sevelamer in Patients With Mild to Moderate Hypercholesteremia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, single blind, active and placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study. Two groups of ECS consisting of 3 and 6 tablets/day (n=30), two placebo groups of 3 and 6 tablets/day (n=15 each) and one active control group of colesevelam 6 tablets/day (n=30). The study is being conducted solely in India and there will be a total of 6-8 sites. The safety parameters are: - Serious adverse events SAEs - Treatment and non-treatment emergent AEs - Physical exams and vital signs - Clinical safety laboratories The efficacy parameters include a fasting lipid profile: - Low density lipoproteins (LDL) - Total cholesterol - High density lipoproteins (HDL) - Triglycerides</detailed_description>
