	<brief_title>PROCHYMAL® (Human Adult Stem Cells) for the Treatment of Recently Diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus refers to disorders in which the body has trouble controlling its blood glucose levels. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), which is being studied in this trial, is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's own immune system attacks and destroys the cells that make insulin. These cells are called beta cells. As beta cells are destroyed, less insulin can be made. This causes blood sugar levels to increase above normal and can cause life-threatening hypo- and hyper-glycemic reactions. For this reason, people with type 1 diabetes must take insulin to help control their blood sugar levels. Over time, poorly controlled diabetes can lead to a variety of serious health conditions, including heart disease, stroke, blindness, amputations, kidney disease, and nerve damage. Insulin is the primary method of controlling diabetes by regulating blood glucose levels, but it may not reverse or prevent disease progression. The active ingredient in ROCHYMAL® is adult human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs have been shown to interact with the immune cells in the body, reducing inflammation and assisting in tissue repair. This study will help determine whether MSCs can protect normal pancreatic tissue from autoimmune attack and repair damaged pancreatic tissue, leading to an increase in insulin production and decrease in circulating blood glucose. The characteristics and biologic activity of PROCHYMAL®, along with a good safety profile in human trials to date, suggest that PROCHYMAL® may be a good candidate for addressing Type 1 Diabetes.</detailed_description>
