	<brief_summary>Force enhancement (FE) describes the phenomenon of strength potentialization of a muscle cell or the complete muscle during and after active extension compared to the strength of an isometric contraction with same muscle length. The underlying physiological mechanism of this phenomenon is not completely known today. In vitro trials indicate that the interaction of an active and a passive component on the cellular level are responsible for the higher strength measurements. So far FE could be shown in vitro and in vivo on muscle fibers and small human muscles. Further research is needed for verification of the existence of FE in voluntary motor activity in everyday life. In order to approach this objective the investigators will scrutinize the functionality of the deliberately activated musculus (m) quadriceps femoris during and after active extension on the basis of in vivo studies.</brief_summary>
