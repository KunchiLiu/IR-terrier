	<brief_summary>This social science study hypothesizes that convicted felony drug offenders in Nebraska who participated in Specialized Substance Abuse Supervision (SSAS) as part of their probation or parole showed significantly better outcomes (specifically, less recidivism) at six months post-entrance to SSAS compared to those who did not participate in SSAS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Specialized Substance Abuse Supervision (SSAS) Versus Non-SSAS Recidivism Rates Among Nebraska Felony Drug Offenders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since March 2006, Specialized Substance Abuse Supervision (SSAS) has been available at five sites in Nebraska as an enhancement of probation and parole for felony drug offenders whose scores on initial screening instruments warrant such placement. SSAS enhancements to traditional probation and parole include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in groups; use of incentives; positive reinforcement; and motivational interviewing. Records of probationers and parolees who participated in SSAS starting anytime between March 1, 2006 and February 28, 2007 were studied to assess recidivism rates. Recidivism for this study is defined as "an arrest and conviction on a new charge while on probation or parole." The records of a matched control group of non-SSAS probationers and parolees who entered probation or parole during the same time period with similar drug felony offenses and similar screening scores were also studied. Control group was also matched, as much as possible, with similar age group, demographic data, rural/urban residence, and level of felony offense. Investigators performed a statistical analysis to determine recidivism rates at six months post-entrance to SSAS (and for the control group, at six months post-entrance to probation or parole).</detailed_description>
