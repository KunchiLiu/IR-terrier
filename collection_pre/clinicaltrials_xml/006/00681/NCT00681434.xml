	<brief_summary>This randomized, single-blind study compares the effectiveness of bilateral training to unilateral training for individuals with moderate hemiparesis. We hypothesize that bilateral training will be superior to unilateral in the proximal extremity but not the distal one.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bilateral Training Versus Unilateral Training in Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upper extremity hemiparesis is the most common post-stroke disability. Longitudinal studies have indicated that 30 to 66 percent of stroke survivors do not have full arm function six months post-stroke. Bilateral arm training has been investigated as a potential rehabilitation intervention for individuals not eligible for constraint induced movement therapy. This training study included 24 hours of treatment over eight weeks. The protocol consisted of reaching activities with rhythmic auditory cueing emphasizing the proximal arm. Subjects assigned to the bilateral group performed bilateral symmetrical activities while subjects in the unilateral group performed the same activity with the affected arm only. The Motor Assessment Scale-Upper Limb Item and the Motor Status Scale are used as primary outcome measures. The Reaching Performance Scale and strength measures are secondary outcome measures. Assessments are administered pre-/ and post-training by a blind rater.</detailed_description>
