	<brief_summary>To verify the number of metastatic brain tumors detected in contrast-enhanced MRI, which is the primary variable, increases after an additional dose of Magnevist (SH L 451A) comparing images after an initial dose (0.1 mmol/kg) with those after an additional dose (0.1 mmol/kg, a total dose of 0.2 mmol/kg) intra-individually in patients with metastatic brain tumors. Safety was also to be assessed.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Brain Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients who are confirmed to have 15 metastatic brain tumor by the latest contrastenhanced cerebral CT or contrastenhanced cerebral MRI, and the lesion(s) have not been treated by surgery or by stereotactic radiosurgery. Patients who are scheduled to receive another contrast medium for MRI (except for oral agents) or iodine contrast medium (except for oral agents), or to undergo surgical procedures during the period from the day before administration of Magnevist (SH L 451A) to examination of safety on the following day. Patients who underwent or are scheduled to undergo radiotherapy during the period from 14 days before administration of Magnevist (SH L 451A) to examination of safety on the following day. Patients who were treated or are scheduled to be treated with anticancer agents (except for treatment only by the oral agents of the fixed dose continuously from 28 days or more before administration of Magnevist (SH L 451A)) during the period from 28 days before administration of Magnevist (SH L 451A) to examination of safety on the following day.</criteria>
