	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to assess which method of lanreotide Autogel administration patients with neuroendocrine tumours prefer - self/partner administrations or healthcare provided administrations. The study will also assess if self/partner administration can be performed without loss of efficacy and with a preserved safety profile. The impact of self/partner administration on resource utilisation and costs will be studied. In addition, we will also assess the healthcare provider's experience of the two administration practices.</brief_summary>
