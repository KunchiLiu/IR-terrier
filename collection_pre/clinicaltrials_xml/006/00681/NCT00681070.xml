	<brief_title>Cosmetic Outcomes of Absorbable Versus Non-absorbable Sutures in Pediatric Facial Lacerations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard method of repair for facial lacerations is to close such wounds with non-absorbable sutures. Recently, topical skin adhesives such as n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate have been used more frequently as these have been shown to be a faster and less painful way to close superficial facial lacerations. However, lacerations that are deeper, gaping or occurring along lines of excessive tension, such as the chin, still need sutures for repair. Non-absorbable sutures have to be taken out at 4-7 days. This involves another physician visit, parental absence from work, and children who need to be taken out of school or daycare for a simple suture removal. In Part Iof the study, we were able to demonstrate non-inferiority of absorbable sutures to nylon sutures. However, we purposely removed all remaining absorbable sutures on the 5-7 day follow-up visit. In Part II, we will allow the absorbable sutures to dissolve on their own. We will again assess long term cosmetic outcomes, as well parental satisfaction, and short and long-term complication rates at 3 months.</detailed_description>
