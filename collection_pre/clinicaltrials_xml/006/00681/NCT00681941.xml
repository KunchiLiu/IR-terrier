	<brief_summary>Approximately 45 hyperphosphatemic CKD patients not on dialysis will be entered into this study at approximately 20 sites within Europe and 5-10 in Australia. The purpose of this study is to determine if sevelamer carbonate tablets dosed three times a day (TID) is an effective treatment for the control of serum phosphorous levels in hyperphosphatemic CKD patients not on dialysis. Total length of participation is approximately 14 weeks.</brief_summary>
