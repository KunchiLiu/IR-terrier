	<brief_summary>Human serum eye drops have been successfully used in the treatment of severe ocular surface disorders and the enhancement of corneal wound healing. Umbilical cord serum is also proven to be effective in treatment of dry eye and persistent corneal epithelial defects. However, there are limited studies comparing the corneal epithelial wound healing promoting effects between these two blood derived products. The purpose of this study is to test the corneal epithelial wound healing promoting effects between auto serum and human cord blood serum. Primary cultured bovine corneal epithelial cells were used as the model to investigate wound healing, cell proliferation and migration by means of scratch corneal wound healing assay evaluation, MTS assay and Boyden chamber migration assay in response to human serum and umbilical cord serum. The concentrations of EGF, TGF-Î²1, and fibronectin were also compared between human serum and umbilical cord serum with ELISA kits.</brief_summary>
