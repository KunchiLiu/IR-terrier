	<detailed_description>Periodontitis is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases and a frequent cause of tooth loss. Accumulation of subgingival dental biofilm in susceptible individuals is associated with an inflammatory host response characterized by the production of Matrix Metalloproteinases, reduction in collagen synthesis, increase in cytokine gene expression, and apoptosis of gingival fibroblasts. Finally, inflammation leads to destruction of periodontal ligament, alveolar bone resorption, and chronic periodontitis. Periodontitis is associated with increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and acute phase reactants. Multiple case-control and cohort studies have suggested that periodontitis is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events, diabetic end-organ damage, pregnancy complications and respiratory diseases. Recent interventional studies have found that periodontal therapy could increase endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilation. The purpose of this controlled clinical trial is to determine the effect of periodontal therapy on endothelial function in subjects with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis. Furthermore, the relationship between putative periodontal pathogens and endothelial function will be also evaluated.</detailed_description>
