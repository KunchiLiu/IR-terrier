	<brief_summary>This study is an exploratory trial evaluating the tear film break-up time after a single eye drop instillation of over-the-counter artificial tears. The primary hypothesis is that tear film break up time will be greater for test than control eye.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tear Film Break-up Time After Instillation of Artificial Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with varying degrees of dry eye syndrome were enrolled in a randomized, controlled, double masked, single site study. A new formulation of an artificial tear containing glycerin 1% as an active with polylysine-graft-polyethylene glycol as an excipient was compared against a leading commercial product with propylene glycol (0.3%) and polyethylene glycol (0.4%) as active ingredients with hydroxypropyl-guar as a gelling agent. The primary outcome was a comparison of tear film stability after eye drop instillation.</detailed_description>
