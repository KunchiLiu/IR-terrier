	<brief_summary>1. Purpose:Our animal study demonstrated the effectiveness of subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab in the inhibition of corneal neovasculization formation. The purpose of this human interventional study is to report the treatment outcome of subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab in patients with corneal neovascularization. 2. Material and methods: We enrolled 13 patients with unilateral or bilateral clinically significant corneal neovascularization during Aug. 2007 to Jan. 2008. Subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab once per month for at most 7 times was performed according to clinical response. 3. Main outcome measurements: resolution of corneal neovascularization, reduction of lipid infiltrate, improved visual acuity.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Significant unilateral or bilateral corneal neovascularization that extending over the limbus at least 2mm The underlying etiologies that caused corneal neovascularization included post penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), trauma, infectious or noninfectious corneal ulcer, postkeratoplasty, etc. Corneal neovascularization induced lipid keratopathy, corneal edema, or irregular corneal surface. The bestcorrected visual acuity was less than 20/25 PostPKP corneal neovascularization that had no associated lipid keratopathy, no corneal edema, or corneal irregularity. But the neovascularization was highly possible to cause graft rejection. The corneal neovascularization was refractory to other medical treatment The patient had received PKP or other corneal surgeries more than half a year ago and was not in the acute postoperation phase The patient had no active endopthalmitis, glaucoma with uncontrolled intraocular pressure, or vitreoretinal diseases The patient signed inform consent to have regular follow up and treatment The neovascularization had clinical improvement three months before the first injection The lipid keratopathy had clinical improvement three months before the first injection The patient that suspected to have poor visual outcome or had already been light sense negative Glaucoma patient that had uncontrolled intraocular pressure Poor corneal epithelialization PostPKP patient that had graft failure or rejection Patient that had systemic disease which was not suitable for bevacizumab use Pregnant patient</criteria>
