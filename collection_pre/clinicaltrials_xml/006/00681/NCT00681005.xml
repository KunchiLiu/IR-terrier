	<brief_summary>Backgrounds &amp; Aims: Proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) test has been proposed as a valuable tool in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in Western populations. We assumed that a higher prevalence of poor metabolizers in Chinese population might affect the diagnostic accuracy of a PPI test. Methods: In this open-label, randomized trial, patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD were randomly assigned to receive a 2-week test with daily rabeprazole 40-mg or daily pantoprazole 80-mg after diagnostic endoscopy. Therapeutic response was assessed with a five-grade daily record. Genotypes of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 polymorphism were determined.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Consecutive patients with symptoms suggesting GERD will be enrolled from gastroenterology outpatient clinics in our academic institute. The typical GERD symptom was defined as heartburn and/or regurgitation at least 3 episodes per week in recent 3 months. Those who were under maintenance PPI treatment, have a medical contraindication to PPI therapy, report a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal surgery, malignancy proven by endoscopy, or unwilling or unable to provide informed consent.</criteria>
