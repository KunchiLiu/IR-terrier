	<brief_summary>This phase II study will evaluate the efficacy of the combination of two monoclonal antibodies (Avastin + Erbitux) with irinotecan, in patients with colorectal cancer progressed after 1st line treatment with FOLFIRI Avastin or XELIRI Avastin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Avastin + Erbitux + Irinotecan as 2nd Line Treatment of Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treating patients with primary resistance to the most active multi-agent combination remains a challenging clinical problem. The reported data demonstrated that addition of ERBITUX may reverse IRINOTECAN resistance. Further data support the feasibility of the combination of two monoclonal antibodies (AVASTIN+ERBITUX) with IRINOTECAN with better responses compared to historical controls (ERBITUX±IRINOTECAN). As such, a phase II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of AVASTIN plus ERBITUX plus IRINOTECAN as second line treatment in patients progressing while on treatment with FOLFIRI AVASTIN or XELIRI AVASTIN</detailed_description>
