	<brief_summary>This study's purpose is to prospectively determine whether topical therapy with an oxidized regenerated cellulose collagen-silver compound is more effective than the current standard of topical antibiotic therapy for care following the removal of an ingrown toenail. Eighty adult patients with ingrown toenails will be recruited. Each patient will randomly be assigned to apply either topical silver sulfadiazine cream (standard antibiotic) or the novel collagen-silver compound to their nail bed daily, following removal of the ingrown portion of nail. Patients will return for follow up visits weekly, until healing has occurred or twelve weeks have passed. Healing will be defined as resolution of drainage and inflammatory changes surrounding the nail border.</brief_summary>
