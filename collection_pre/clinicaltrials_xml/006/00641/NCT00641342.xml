	<brief_summary>Approximately 1/3 of patients with a permanent end-colostomy will experience a hernia around the stoma. In some cases these problems result in the need of surgical correction and the risk of recurrent hernia after operative intervention is regrettably high. Preliminary investigations suggest a role for primary mesh placement to prevent parastomal hernia. The use of a mesh as a preventive measure is a safe procedure. This study will focus on the effect of primary mesh placement (two different operative procedures are used) compared to patients without mesh placement.</brief_summary>
