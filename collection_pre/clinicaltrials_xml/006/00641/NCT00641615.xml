	<brief_title>Peptide Vaccine and S-1/CPT-11 Therapy for Patients With Unresectable Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RNF43 is a cancer testis antigen which express widely in colorectal cancer tissue but not in normal organs. RNF43-721 induces HLA A24 restricted specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) against RNF43 expressed target. S-1/CPT-11 chemotherapy is performed unresectable advanced colorectal cancer in Japan and is reported to be obtained almost the same result compared with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI as first-line chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer. Because synergistic effect between vaccine therapy and chemotherapy will be expected, we plan phase I study to evaluate the safety and immune response of different doses of RNF43-721 emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 in combination with S-1/CPT-11 chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
