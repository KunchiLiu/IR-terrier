	<brief_summary>Arterial stiffness refers to the accumulation of extracellular deposits of matrix and calcium which reduce blood vessel compliance. Although there is growing evidence that increased arterial stiffness is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), its pathogenesis is unclear. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx) provide tools for estimating arterial stiffness, and therefore predicting cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aims of the study are: (1) compare the effects of nocturnal and conventional haemodialysis on arterial stiffness, and (2) examine the relationship between arterial stiffness and clinical and biochemical parameters.</brief_summary>
