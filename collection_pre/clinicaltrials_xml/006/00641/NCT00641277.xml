	<brief_summary>Dental implants are used in dentistry to reestablish function and appearance to areas of the mouth where natural teeth are missing. Implants can be a good choice for almost all areas of the mouth except where the space left by missing teeth is too narrow. This is usually the case when front teeth are lost of have been missing since birth. The Maximus dental implant is the smallest implant made, just 3mm in diameter, and is especially designed to replace missing front teeth and yet be strong enough to function as a natural tooth. This study will assess the functional success of BioHorizons Maximus one-piece endosseous dental implant. We hypothesize that placement of the 3mm dental implant in areas of limited tooth-to-tooth spacing will be an efficacious tooth root replacement.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>When maxillary anterior (upper front)and/or mandibular incisors are congenitally missing or lost due to other causes, the space between adjacent teeth is frequently too narrow to support traditional implant therapy and patients are often advised to fill the space with conventional fixed or removable prosthetic appliances. The one-piece titanium construction of the Maximus design is believed to retain optimal biomechanical stength while remaining small enough for use in anterior reconstruction thereby allowing access to spaces that were previously beyond the scope of implant dentistry.</detailed_description>
