	<brief_summary>Recent researches indicate that impairment of vascular and endothelial homeostasis plays a major role in the initiation and development of IPAH.We have recently reported the safety and feasibility data for autologous endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) injection in patients with IPAH. Yet many questions remain unanswered: what is the ideal quantity of EPCs for therapy, the duration of the therapeutic effect, and moreover, the potential toxicity of such therapy. To help answer these questions, we designed the one year follow-up to investigate the safety and efficacy of autologous EPCs injection in patients with IPAH.</brief_summary>
