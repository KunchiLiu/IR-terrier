	<brief_title>Probiotics for Prevention of Antibiotic-associated Diarrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A common complication of antibiotic use is antibiotic-induced diarrhea (AAD). AAD is the result of disrupted microflora, occurring two to eight weeks after antibiotic use. Probiotic supplementation may rebalance the intestinal flora, thus reducing the incidence of diarrhea, improving quality of life and reducing symptoms associated with antibiotic administration. The proposed study will be a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial that will assess the efficacy of the Jarro-Dophilus EPS probiotics formula for the prevention of AAD. In addition,a subgroup of participants will be requested to provide one fecal sample at the initiation of the study and one sample in the last three days of probiotic (or placebo) treatment. The samples will undergo microbial analysis for routine C &amp; S(Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Ecoli 0157, Yersinia), VRE, Yeast, Fungus culture (moulds) and C. difficile toxin.</detailed_description>
