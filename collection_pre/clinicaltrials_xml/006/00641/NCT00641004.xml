	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To determine the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and immunohistochemistry surrogate of inflammation in patients with NSAID-induced gastric mucosal injury treated with Rebamipide 3x a day vs Esomeprazole 40mg once a day. Secondary objective: For patients who become symptomatic during NSAID treatment, to compare the proportion of patients with positive treatment effects using the Likert scale. Third objective: To compare the proportion of patients with positive treatment effects as determined by Modified Lanza scoring between the two groups.</brief_summary>
