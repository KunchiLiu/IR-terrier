	<brief_title>A Study on Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an observational, prospective, multi-center study to obtain information about the symptoms and treatment received for patients with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Patients must first meet eligibility criteria and sign informed consent. Patient treatment will be based upon investigator opinion. The following parameters will be assessed: patient's characteristics, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) score, Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and Minimal Mental Status Examination (MMSE). Each patient will be observed for 12 weeks. Medication dosing regimen will be flexible throughout the study and is based on patient response and investigator judgment. During the study observation period, all patients will attend clinic visits for the subsequent 12 weeks (visit 2 to 3) as is the usual clinical practice. Patients can visit clinics on additional dates as needed or by request. At the pre-planned clinic visits, CGI score, NPI, vital signs, reports of adverse events, drug information, and MMSE score (visit 3) will be recorded. This is an observational study and no study drug is administered.</detailed_description>
