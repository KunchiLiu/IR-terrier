	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fentanyl one-day transdermal patch (patch containing a drug that is put on the skin so the drug will enter the body through the skin) in participants switched from morphine preparations, oral oxycodone preparations, fentanyl citrate injection or fentanyl patch for cancer pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Fentanyl (JNS020QD) in Participants With Cancer Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (conducted in more than one center) and non-comparative study of fentanyl one-day transdermal patch. The study consists of 3 periods: Pre-treatment observation period (4-7 days), Treatment period (10 days) and Follow-up period (2 days). Treatment will be initiated at 12.5 microgram per hour (mcg/hr) and the initial dose of fentanyl will be determined based on the daily dose of the opioid analgesic taken by the participant before entering the study and will be maintained for 2 days to ensure safety of participants. Dose escalation or reduction will be as per the Investigator's discretion from Day 3 to Day 7 and thereafter dose will be again maintained from Day 7 to Day 9, ranging from 12.5 mcg/hr-100 mcg/hr and the maximum application dose will be 300 mcg/hr. The patch will be applied on areas including the chest, abdomen, upper arm or thigh and will be replaced daily for 10 days (a total of 9 applications; including the day of final patch removal). Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by visual analog scale (VAS) score. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants receiving any of the following drugs at a stable dose for at least 3 days (or 9 days in case of fentanyl patch) before the start of application of the study drug: Morphine preparations at less than or equal to 314 milligram per day (mg/day) as an oral morphine equivalent dose of less than or equal to 157 mg/day for suppository or less than or equal to 104 mg/day for injection, oral oxycodone preparations at less than or equal to 209 mg/day, fentanyl citrate injection at less than or equal to 2.0 mg/day, fentanyl patch less than or equal to 7.5 mg Participants assumed to use not more than 2 rescue doses (dose of a fastacting opioid analgesic except fentanyl preparations used for lack of analgesic effect) daily for at least 3 days before the start of application of the study drug Participants showing a pain intensity of less than or equal to 34 millimeter (mm) on a 100mm visual analog scale (VAS) Participants who have an established diagnosis of cancer and are notified of the disease Participants who can be hospitalized during the course of application of the study drug Participants with impaired respiratory function due to chronic lung disease or others Participants with asthma (breathing disorder in which there is wheezing and difficulty in breathing or participants with bradyarrhythmia (slow, irregular heartbeats) Participants with following measurements indicative of hepatic or renal impairment during the pretreatment observation period: Aspartate transaminase (AST) greater than 5 times the upper limit of reference range, Alanine transaminase (ALT) greater than 5 times the upper limit of reference range, serum creatinine greater than 3 times the upper limit of reference range Participants with any cerebral damage, such as brain tumor, accompanied by increased intracranial pressure, disturbance of consciousness, coma, or respiratory disturbance Participants with a history of hypersensitivity to fentanyl or other opioid analgesics</criteria>
