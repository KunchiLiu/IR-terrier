	<brief_title>4-Week Study to Assess the Effect of Alendronate and Vitamin D3 Once Weekly on Fractional Calcium Absorption in Postmenopausal Osteoporotic Women (0217A-230)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Placebo will be administered over a 4 week, single-blind run-in phase. Calcium, as citrate-malate, will be administered throughout the study at an individualized dose supplementing the patient's daily dietary calcium intake to a total of approximately 1200 mg. At the end of the stabilization period, baseline calcium absorption will be determined and patients will be randomized to receive either MK0217A, or matching placebo once weekly for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
