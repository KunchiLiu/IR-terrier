	<brief_title>Automated Chest Compression in Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The protocol compares arterial pressures produced by an automated self-adjusting load-distributing band device (AutoPulse™ 100, Zoll®) with those of manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation in refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Each patient will receive first manual compressions and then automated resuscitation. Patients presenting with cardiac arrest are treated following standard advanced life support guidelines. They are intubated and ventilated, received epinephrine and defibrillation if appropriate. Manuel chest compressions are continued. An arterial catheter is placed to monitor hemodynamics continuously as we usually do in this case. Patients are included at this stage. Three blood pressure values (every 1 minutes) are recorded. Then, the automated band device is started up without any pause, following our procedure for refractory cardiac arrest. Three blood pressure values are recorded again, during automated cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</detailed_description>
