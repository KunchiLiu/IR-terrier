	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to examine the activation of markers of endothelial and cardiovascular dysfunctions, from women with high-risk pregnancies. Information from this study will hopefully provide enough information to determine a link between race, the advent of high risk pregnancies and cardiovascular markers. With this information it might be possible to intervene with approved pharmacological treatments.</brief_summary>
