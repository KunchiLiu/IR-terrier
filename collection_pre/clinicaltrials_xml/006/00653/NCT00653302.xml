	<brief_summary>Primary objective: - Efficacy assessment of the percentage of positive responders patients receiving Lantus plus glucophage association. Positive responders patients are defined by a final value of HbA1c&lt;7% and/or a final decrease of HbA1c&gt;15% compare to the basal value (HbA1c final - HbA1c basal). Secondary objectives: - Determination of the predictive criterion of HbA1c final, - Determination of the predictive criterion of weight variation, - Description of the glycemic and therapeutic criteria in the both groups of responders (positive and negative responders), - Assessment of the lipidic parameters according to the HbA1c and weight changes during the study (final value - basal value). Safety: - Adverse Event (AE)/Serious Adverse Event (SAE) assessments</brief_summary>
