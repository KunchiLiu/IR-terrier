	<brief_summary>Methamphetamine use has escalated in recent years. Methamphetamine use has also spread throughout the country. Although much information has been gathered on the treatment of cocaine abuse, very little information has been obtained on the treatment of methamphetamine abuse. One of the first steps in developing appropriate treatment is to examine the effects of stopping a particular substance's use on individuals abusing that substance. To date this has not been well studied for people abusing methamphetamine. The purpose of this study is to better understand and develop accurate ways of measuring symptoms associated with stopping the use of methamphetamine in people that are abusing methamphetamine. If the withdrawal symptoms are able to be effectively measured, this will help to develop treatments targeted at alleviating these symptoms. These symptoms are often associated with relapse to use of that substance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterizing Methamphetamine Withdrawal in Recently Abstinent Methamphetamine Users: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this 4 week observational study is to examine and characterize the withdrawal symptoms experienced by methamphetamine abusers who are recently abstinent from methamphetamine. The period of drug or substance withdrawal is often cited as the time during which risk of relapse use of that substance is very high. Therefore it is highly important to characterize specifically the withdrawal syndrome associated with cessation of methamphetamine use. This study will demonstrate our ability to recruit and work with this methamphetamine dependent population. In addition it will allow for the collection of pilot data to assist in selecting appropriate assessment tools in a submission of an RO1 grant for well-controlled studies characterizing methamphetamine withdrawal.</detailed_description>
