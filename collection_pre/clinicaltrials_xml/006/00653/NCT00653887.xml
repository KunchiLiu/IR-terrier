	<detailed_description>Introduction: Nervous control of pelvic floor is not much known. The dysfunction of this musculature, and particularly of the external anal sphincter, is a frequent cause of anal incontinence and/or dyschesia. Biofeedback training is often offered to patients suffering from incontinence or constipation. However, its mechanisms of action is still controversial. Objective of the study: to compare excitability of the cortical area responsible for control volunteer of the external anal sphincter in healthy subjects before and after 4 biofeedback sessions. Subjects and methodology: we offer to perform two groups of 12 healthy subjects (one active and one control group) without any neurological or digestive disease and having never performed biofeedback. In each group, cortical excitability will be evaluated by cortical magnetic stimulation (curve intensity/amplitude, silent period, inter-stimulus period, motor threshold) before and after 4 biofeedback sessions (one session by week) in active group or 4 placebo sessions (placebo group). We hope to show a modification of cortical excitability in subjects performing biofeedback compared to others.</detailed_description>
