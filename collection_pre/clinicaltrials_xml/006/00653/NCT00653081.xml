	<brief_title>Supervised Exercises Compared With Radial Extracorporal Shock Wave Therapy (rESWT) in Patients With SIS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shoulder pain is, in succession to back, neck, and knee, the fourth most frequently localized musculoskeletal pain reported by patients to general practitioners and physical therapists. A majority of shoulder complaints lasts for more than three months and become chronic. Few of the different interventions for rehabilitation of chronic shoulder pain, have documented effect. Patients with shoulder pain are associated with significant disability and loss of quality of life which interfere with activities related to daily living. Supervised exercises, a treatment method which has been compared to surgery and placebo laser, is one that has documented effect for both short (6 months) and long time (2½ years). The purpose of this study was to compare Supervised Exercises with another non-operative common used treatment method for these patients, radial Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (rESWT). The study is designed as a randomised, single blind clinical controlled study.</detailed_description>
