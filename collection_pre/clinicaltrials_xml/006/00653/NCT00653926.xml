	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to evaluate if intra- and postoperative administration of ropivacaine, ketorolac and epinephrine into the operating field would affect hospital stay. Secondary end-points are morphine consumption, pain intensity and side effects. In an attempt to assess the safety of this technique, knee function and patient satisfaction scores are assessed up to 6 months after surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Local Infiltration Analgesia Following Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative pain is often severe following knee arthroplasty. Recently, a local infiltration analgesia (LIA) technique was developed by Drs Kerr and Kohan in Sydney, Australia. With this LIA-technique, a long-acting local anesthetic (ropivacaine), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ketorolac), and epinephrine are infiltrated intraoperatively and via an intraarticular catheter postoperatively. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate if intra- and postoperative administration of ropivacaine, ketorolac and epinephrine into the operating field would affect hospital stay. Secondary end-points were morphine consumption, pain intensity and side effects. In an attempt to assess the safety of this technique, knee function and patient satisfaction scores were assessed up to 6 months after surgery.</detailed_description>
