Subjects considered to be unstable by the investigator after the following events: a myocardial infarction (heart attack), unstable angina, myocardial revascularisation or another revascularisation procedure or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke. Severe congestive cardiac failure (as defined by the protocol Appendix I).
