The acceptable methods of contraception are condom + spermicide (at least 14 days prior to study drug administration), diaphragm + spermicide (at least 14 days prior to study drug administration)or intrauterine contraceptive device (placed at least 4 weeks prior to study drug administration Subjects who have taken any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism within 30 days prior to administration of the study medication Subjects who have undergone clinically significant surgery within 4 weeks prior to the administration of the study medication Any reason which, in the opinion of the medical subinvestigator, would prevent the subject from participating in the study</criteria>
