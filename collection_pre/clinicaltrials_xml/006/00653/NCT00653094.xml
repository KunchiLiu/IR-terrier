	<brief_summary>Today, there is no available equipment specifically designed for the procedure of instillation of fibrin glue for the repair of perianal fistulae. The currently used equipment involves surgical tools generally used for fistula surgeries, and injection syringes designed for general use. The injection of biological adhesives is performed using standard adhesive syringes that are not specially designed for use in perianal fistulae. The use of the semi-flexible metal probes can cause trauma to tissue and injure the fistula tract, creating an additional path, and the injection syringe and catheter are often inconvenient for perianal use. This study was design to test the use of Halevy kit, by gastroenterology specialist, as a non traumatic probing, mechanical debridement and injecting or inserting device for treatment substances in perianal fistulas. In this study a gastroenterologist will perform the procedure, in each procedure a trained colorectal surgeon will be present during the surgery to oversee the procedure and to provide surgical help if required.</brief_summary>
