	<brief_title>Maintaining Intrauterine Devices (IUDs) in Teens (MINT): A Randomization Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Teenagers have the highest percentage of unintended pregnancies, and often struggle to comply with daily methods of contraception. The intrauterine device (IUD) provides safe, long-term protection and rates highly for patient satisfaction. It also does not require repeat prescriptions or clinic visits, making it a potentially attractive method among teens. However, in adolescent populations, there is both a lack of information about the IUD, as well as few studies that have examined the use of these devices. This study will examine whether a larger scale study on this topic is feasible. IT will address the feasibility of recruiting, consenting, screening, enrolling, randomizing, and retaining adolescents randomized to the LNG-IUS or Copper T 380a.</detailed_description>
