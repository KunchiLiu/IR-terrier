	<brief_title>Efficacy of SYR-472 in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis, resulting from impaired pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin resistance in target tissues. The worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is reaching epidemic proportions, and the total number of cases is expected to reach 221 million by 2010. The high incidence of the disease and its associated complications places a significant burden on healthcare systems. The primary risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus is obesity and its associated insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is characterized by an impaired response to the physiologic effects of insulin and leads to decreased cellular glucose uptake, increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, and a compensatory increase in insulin secretion that contributes to beta-cell exhaustion. Therefore in the insulin-resistant state, blood glucose and insulin levels are increased. The relationship between improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the delay or prevention of comorbidities has been reported in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study. Therefore, reduction of persistent hyperglycemia is the highest priority in treating this disease. Diet and exercise are important and effective measures for maintaining glycemic control in individuals with insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly in the early stages of disease progression. In cases where diet and exercise alone fail to adequately maintain glycemic control, oral antidiabetic drugs are typically used. Combination oral therapy and eventually insulin are usually required to maintain lower blood glucose levels but can result in adverse effects including hypoglycemia and weight gain. Therefore, novel safe and effective antidiabetic therapies are needed. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 is a ubiquitous aminopeptidase that is widely expressed in many tissues; it is thought to be primarily responsible for the in vivo degradation of at least two gut-derived incretin hormones, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, which are both released in response to nutrient ingestion. Glucagon-like peptide-1 has been demonstrated to augment glucose-dependent insulin secretion; suppress glucagon release and hepatic gluconeogenesis; inhibit gastric emptying, and reduce appetite and food intake. Glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide also have been shown to promote insulin biosynthesis and stimulate beta cell proliferation and survival. Orally available inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity have been developed that increase intact postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 levels after oral administration. SYR-472 is a selective inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 in development to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study is to evaluate SYR-472 in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not previously achieved adequate glycemic control with lifestyle modification (diet/exercise) or metformin antidiabetic monotherapy. Study participation is anticipated to be up to 14 weeks.</detailed_description>
