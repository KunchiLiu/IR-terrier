	<brief_summary>As docetaxel is proven to be effective in late stages of prostate cancer with a large tumour burden it should be effective in primarily treated intermediate and high risk prostate cancer as an adjuvant treatment after radiotherapy to prevent early relapse. This will therefore be tested in a randomised phase III trial where patients will be randomized either to docetaxel or surveillance</brief_summary>
