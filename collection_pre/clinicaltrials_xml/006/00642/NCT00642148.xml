	<brief_summary>Phase IIa, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, multi-centre study in subjects diagnosed with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The primary objective is to evaluate the effects of 12-weeks of treatment with GW856553 7.5 mg twice daily (BID) compared with placebo on the percentage of sputum neutrophils at 12 weeks. Twelve weeks of treatment with SERETIDE 50/500 BID will be compared with placebo for effect on sputum neutrophils as a positive control arm in the study</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects eligible for enrolment in the study must meet all of the following criteria: Male adults or female adults of nonchildbearing potential who are between 40 and 75 years of age (inclusive). Note: a female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of nonchildbearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant). This includes any female who is postmenopausal. For the purposes of this study, post menopausal is defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 1 year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms. Postmenopausal status may be confirmed by serum FSH and oestradiol concentrations at screening if deemed necessary by the PI. Surgical sterility will be defined as females who have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis: an established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the following description by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society [American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society, 2004] Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a preventable and treatable disease characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also produces significant systemic consequences. Subjects with a cigarette smoking history of ≥10 pack years (1 pack year = 20 cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year or the equivalent). Both current and former smokers are eligible to be enrolled. A former smoker is defined as a subject who has not smoked for ≥6 months at Visit 1. Subjects with a postbronchodilator FEV1 to FVC ratio (FEV1:FVC) &lt; 0.7 at Visit 1. Subjects will be assessed 30 (± 5) minutes after receiving salbutamol 400 μg. Subjects with a postbronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 50% and &lt; 80% of predicted normal for height, age and sex at Visit 1. Subjects will be assessed 30 (± 5) minutes after receiving salbutamol 400 μg. Subjects capable of providing signed written informed consent to participate. Subjects must have a QTc &lt;450 msec on baseline ECG or triplicate ECG averaged over a brief recording interval. For subjects with baseline bundle branch block the QTc will be &lt;480msec on baseline ECG or triplicate ECG averaged over a brief recording interval. A subject will be eligible for randomisation at the end of the runin period only if the following additional criterion applies: Subjects with no evidence of an ongoing acute infection or sinus symptoms Specific information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, AEs, and other pertinent information on the investigational product that may impact subject eligibility is provided in the Investigator Brochure/Investigator Brochure supplement(s), product label, and other pertinent documents. A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply: Women who are premenopausal and of childbearing potential, or pregnant. Subjects with a primary diagnosis of asthma or α1 antitrypsin deficiency. Subjects who have required hospitalisation or treatment with oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotic therapy for acute worsening of COPD or lower respiratory tract infection in the 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 Subjects with active tuberculosis or being treated for active tuberculosis, sarcoidosis or clinically overt bronchiectasis. Subjects with a history of any type of malignancy with the exception of successfully treated squamous cell cancer of the skin. Subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, connective tissue disorders and other conditions known to be associated with chronic inflammation (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease). Subjects with chronic infections such as gingivitis, periodontitis, prostatitis, gastritis, and urinary tract infections. Subjects with any acute infection, sinus symptoms, or significant trauma (burns, fractures). Subjects with clinically significant renal disease, diabetes mellitus/metabolic syndrome, hypertension or any other clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, endocrine, or haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled on permitted therapy (see Section 6.6.1). Subjects with clinically significant gastrointestinal or hepatic abnormalities. Subjects with hypoxaemia. (All subjects must have an O2 saturation of ≥ 88% on room air). History of Gilbert's syndrome. Subjects with a total bilirubin concentration above the upper limit of normal at Visit 1 will be excluded. Liver function tests (bilirubin, ALT, or AST) above upper limit of normal at Visit 1. The subject has a positive Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of the start of the study.The subject has a history of HIV or other immunosuppressive disease. Subjects who have undergone recent surgery including lung volume reduction surgery or have conditions that prevent them from performing spirometry. Subjects with a history (or suspected history) of alcohol misuse or any other substance abuse. The subject has a three month prior history of regular alcohol consumption exceeding an average weekly intake of &gt; 21 units (or an average daily intake of greater than 3 units) for males, or an average weekly intake of &gt; 14 units (or an average daily intake of greater than 2 units) for females. 1 unit is equivalent to a halfpint (284mL) of beer/lager; 25mL measure of spirits or 125mL of wine; or a positive alcohol breath test at the screening visit Subjects who will commence or who are likely to commence statin therapy (3hydroxy3methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) or treatment with intranasal or topical corticosteroids, acetylsalicyclic acid, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, gemfibrozil, clopidogrel, abciximab, peroxidase proliferatoractivated receptor γ agonists (e.g, rosiglitazone), fibrates, or niacin from Visit 1 until study completion. (Subjects who are receiving these medications at a stable dose at Visit 1 may be entered in the study.) Subjects who require treatment with any of the following from the Visit 1 until study completion: Inhaled corticosteroids Inhaled cromolyn sodium or nedocromil Xanthines (theophylline preparations) Leukotriene modifiers Tiotropium Longacting inhaled β2agonists (salmeterol, formoterol) Oral β2agonists Macrolide antibiotics for more than five days Subjects who have received treatment with oral, intravenous or intraarticular corticosteroids within 6 weeks of Visit 1 or thereafter. Subjects with any known hypersensitivity to salbutamol or ipratropium bromide. Subjects who are participating or plan to participate in the active phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation programme during the study. Maintenance rehabilitation is permitted. Subjects who have received an investigational drug within 30 days or within five drug halflives of the investigational drug (whichever is longer). Subjects with any clinically relevant abnormality detected by the assessments at Visit 1 An unwillingness of male subjects to abstain from sexual intercourse with pregnant or lactating women; or unwillingness of the male subject to use a condom/spermicide in addition to having their female partner use another form of contraception such as an intrauterine devices, diaphragm with spermicide, oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone, subdermal implants or a tubal ligation if the woman could become pregnant from the time of the first dose of investigational product for the duration of the study (i.e., through the followup phase). Subjects who have had a close household contact treated for active tuberculosis within the past 12 months, or who in the judgement of the investigator are at high risk for developing active tuberculosis, shall be excluded from the study. A subject will not be eligible for randomisation at the end of the runin period if either of the following criteria applies: Subjects who have experienced an exacerbation during the runin period requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics and/or hospitalisation. Subjects who are unable to produce an induced sputum sample.</criteria>
