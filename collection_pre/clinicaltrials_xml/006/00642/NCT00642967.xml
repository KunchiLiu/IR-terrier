	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of monthly administration of subcutaneous Mircera when administered for the maintenance of hemoglobin levels in patients with chronic renal anemia, not on dialysis. Patients currently receiving treatment with subcutaneous epoetin or darbepoetin alfa will receive monthly subcutaneous injections of Mircera, with the starting dose (120 or 200 micrograms) calculated from the last weekly dose of ESA previously administered. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
