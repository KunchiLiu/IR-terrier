	<criteria>Histological evidence of nonCNS malignancy (primary or metastatic disease) and lymphomas which are not involving the bone marrow. Undergoing single or multiple days of chemotherapy as long as Day 1 chemotherapy includes: 1. a moderatetohigh emetogenic regimen, or 2. oxaliplatin at doses employed for treatment of colon cancer, or 3. the combination of AC [Adriamycin√í (60 mg/m2) with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2)] as to be used for the chemotherapeutic drug regimen involving taxanes in the treatment of breast cancer. Chemotherapy agents falling into the low (Level 1), moderatetolow (Level 2), moderate (Level 3) unless used in combination with a Level 4 chemotherapy agent on Day 1 of the study. Chemotherapy agents falling into the high (Level 5) classification during study. Any combination of chemotherapy agents that does not fall into the moderatetohigh (Level 4) classification</criteria>
