	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine if treatment with the combination of metoprolol succinate and hydrochlorothiazide is more effective at lowering blood pressure than treatment with either of the two drugs alone. The study will also determine which combined doses of metoprolol succinate and hydrochlorothiazide are most effective at lowering blood pressure (without unacceptable side effects), and whether it is possible to combine both drugs in a single tablet to simplify blood pressure treatment.</brief_summary>
