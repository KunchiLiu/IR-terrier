	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see how Ticagrelor, a new oral reversible anti-platelet medication, affects platelets. Anti-platelet agents are medications that block the formation of blood clots by preventing the clumping of platelets. Blood clots prevent us from bleeding, but when they form inside the arteries their formation is linked to a risk of medical problems such as heart attack and stroke. This study investigated the effect of Ticagrelor on inhibition of platelet aggregation compared with clopidogrel in patients previously identified as non-responsive to clopidogrel.</brief_summary>
