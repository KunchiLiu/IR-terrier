	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial of a Radiation Sensitizer in Radiochemotherapy for Thoracic Esophageal Squamous Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death in the world. The most common type of esophageal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in China. Although concurrent radiochemotherapy is recommended as the standard treatment for advanced esophageal carcinoma, the local failure still reaches up to 44%-54%. Sodium Glycididazole(CMNa) is a radiosensitive drug for hypoxic tumor cells. Clinical trials showed that CMNa can improve local control rate and survival rate of esophageal cancer. This study is going to confirm the efficacy and safety of CMNa in concurrent radiochemotherapy of radiotherapy and 5-FU+DDP for esophageal squamous carcinoma.</detailed_description>
