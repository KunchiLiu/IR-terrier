	<brief_summary>This trial is designed as a phase 2 randomized, double-blind double dummy, active comparator controlled, two-period two-arm crossover study to enroll 40 patients across multiple centers. The study will compare platelet function following a prasugrel loading dose and 1 week of prasugrel maintenance therapy with high-dose clopidogrel loading dose and 1 week of high-dose clopidogrel maintenance therapy in patients with drug treated type 2 diabetes mellitus who have coronary artery disease. Various assays of platelet function will be used in this study. Platelet function will be studied using the following assays: Accumetrics VerifyNowTM P2Y12, Light Transmittance Aggregometry (LTA), Vasodilator-associated stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), and Thromboelastography (TEG)-platelet mapping.</brief_summary>
