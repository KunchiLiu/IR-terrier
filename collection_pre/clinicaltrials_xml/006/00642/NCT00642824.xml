	<brief_summary>This single arm genetic substudy of MO19390 will test the hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between mRNA BRCAI levels and the response to different chemotherapy combinations plus Avastin. A subset of patients participating in MO19390, and receiving Avastin 15mg/kg iv on day 1 and subsequently once every 3 weeks, will undergo BRCAI mRNA expression determination. Depending on the BRCAI mRNA level (low, medium or high) they will receive a different chemotherapy regimen in combination with Avastin: a)gemcitabine/cisplatin, b)vinorelbine + cisplatin/docetaxel + cisplatin or c)vinorelbine or docetaxel. Avastin treatment will continue after completion of chemotherapy cycles until disease progression, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
