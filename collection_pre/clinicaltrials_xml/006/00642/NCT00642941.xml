	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of R1507 in participants with recurrent or refractory sarcoma. Eight cohorts of sarcoma participants will be studied in parallel. Cohort 1: Ewing's sarcoma primary cohort defined as participants who have relapsed less than or equal to (&lt;=) 24 months from diagnosis, received at least two prior chemotherapy programs and are unresectable. Cohort 2: Ewing's sarcoma non-primary (secondary) cohort defined as participants who have relapsed greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 24 months from diagnosis or have only received one prior chemotherapy program. Cohort 3: Expanded Ewing's sarcoma defined as participants with recurrent or relapse regardless of prior number of salvage regimens and regardless of time of relapse. Cohort 4: participants with osteosarcoma. Cohort 5: Participants with synovial sarcoma. Cohort 6: Participants with rhabdomyosarcoma Cohort 7: Participants with alveolar soft part sarcoma (7a), desmoplastic small round cell tumors (7b), extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (7c), clear cell sarcoma (7d), myxoid liposarcoma (7e). Cohort 8: Participants with unspecified sarcoma diagnosis. Participants in the expanded Ewing's sarcoma Cohort 3 will receive 27 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg) every 3 weeks intravenously (IV). All other participants will receive R1507 9 mg/kg IV weekly. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable adverse events, withdrawal or death.</brief_summary>
