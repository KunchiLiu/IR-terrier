	<brief_summary>Cross-linking of the cornea increases the mechanical and biochemical stability of the stromal tissue. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of riboflavin-ultraviolet light induced cross-linking of corneal collagen in improving visual acuity and reducing progression of keratoconus in the Brazilian population.</brief_summary>
