	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if there are differences, (benefits) between carvedilol and metoprolol in the treatment of HTN in patients with type 2 diabetes. Specifically we will be looking at differences in blood pressure and blood sugar control, endothelial function, inflammation, oxidative stress and coagulation. Subjects will be randomized to one of the two beta-blockers and followed for 5 months. Each subject will undergo 4 inpatient studies where an oral glucose tolerance test will be done, Inflammatory and oxidative stress markers will be measured. Endothelial function will be measured using brachial artery ultrasound and laser skin Doppler</brief_summary>
