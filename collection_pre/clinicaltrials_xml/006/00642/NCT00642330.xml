	<brief_summary>it is a prospective randomized simple-blinded pilot trial with the principal aim to compare efficacy and tolerance between oral ibuprofen and intravenous ibuprofen in early curative closure of PDA in very low birth weight infants. The likelihood of ductal closure with only one or two doses of treatment is a secondary objective.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study of Efficacy and Safety of Oral Ibuprofen and Intravenous Ibuprofen in Closure of Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Very Low Birth Weight Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We calculated that a study group of 62 patients would be necessary for the study to be able to detect a difference of at least 25 percentage points in the closure rate between the oral ibuprofen and intravenous ibuprofen groups, assuming a closure rate of 65 percent with intravenous ibuprofen, with a p value of 0, 05 and a power of 80 percent.Patients (gestational age, 25 to 32 weeks) with echocardiographically confirmed patent ductus arteriosus and respiratory distress will randomly be assigned to receive one (10 mg / kg), two (10 mg / kg followed 24 hours after by 5 mg /kg) or three (10 mg / kg followed at 24-hour intervals by two doses of 5 mg /kg each) doses of either intravenous ibuprofen (group I, n = 32) or oral ibuprofen (group O, n = 32), starting on the third day of life. The rate of ductal closure, side effects, complications, and the patients' clinical course will be recorded.</detailed_description>
