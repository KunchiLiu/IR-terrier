	<brief_summary>This study will apply polysomnography (PSG) to evaluate the effect of quetiapine fumarate on sleep architecture. Most of previous studies evaluated sleep by self-reported questionnaires during the antipsychotic treatment (clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, et al), while only a few studies with PSG evaluation had some limitation, such as: small sample size, respective or cross-sectional, potential sleep disorders, et al. In this study, we will investigate both subjective and objective effect of quetiapine fumarate in improving sleep quality in schizophrenic patients by PSG as well as psychiatric scales. The control drug in this study is the typical antipsychotic - haloperidol. It could increase sleep duration and efficiency by mostly increasing the S2 without effect on rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS). The patients will be randomised into two groups as a parallel design. This study is designed as rater blinded to reduce the bias in evaluation. It is suggested that the sedative effect of quetiapine fumarate could diminish in 2 weeks, therefore, we use 4 weeks to ensure the change of sleep quality in this study, which could be helpful for the evaluation of relative short and middle term effect of quetiapine fumarate on sleep quality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A 4-week, Randomized, Rater-blinded, Parallel Study to Evaluate Quetiapine in Improving Sleep Quality of Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. The objective sleep structures of quetiapine fumarate and haloperidol being used as mono-therapy respectively in the treatment of patients with acute schizophrenia are measured by the change of composite variables for PSG test (sleep stages, time in bed, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency) from baseline to Week 4 (LOCF). 2. The subjective sleep qualities of quetiapine fumarate and haloperidol being used as mono-therapy respectively in the treatment of patients with acute schizophrenia are measured by the change of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale(ESS) from baseline to Week 4 (LOCF). 3. The clinical efficacy of quetiapine fumarate and haloperidol being used as mono-therapy respectively in the treatment of patients with acute schizophrenia are measured by the change of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Globe Impression (CGI),and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) from baseline to Week 4 (LOCF). 4. The clinical safety and tolerance quetiapine fumarate and haloperidol being used as mono-therapy respectively in the treatment of patients with acute schizophrenia are measured by Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) in day 14 and day 28.</detailed_description>
