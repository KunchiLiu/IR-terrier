	<brief_summary>This single arm study assessed the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera), a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (C.E.R.A.), for correction and/or maintenance of hemoglobin levels in participants with chronic kidney disease and renal anemia, who were not treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) or on dialysis. Eligible participants received monthly subcutaneous injections of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta at an initial recommended dose of 1.2 micrograms/kilogram (mcg/kg). The anticipated time on study treatment was 3-10 months, and the target sample size was 200 individuals.</brief_summary>
