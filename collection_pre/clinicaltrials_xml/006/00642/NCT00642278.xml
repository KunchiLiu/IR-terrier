	<brief_title>An Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability Study of Canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by decreased secretion of insulin by the pancreas and resistance to the action of insulin in various tissues (muscle, liver, and adipose), which results in impaired glucose uptake. Chronic hyperglycemia leads to progressive impairment of insulin secretion and to insulin resistance of peripheral tissues in diabetes (so-called glucose toxicity), which further worsens control of blood glucose. In addition, chronic hyperglycemia is a major risk factor for complications, including heart disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Although numerous treatments have been developed for the treatment of diabetes and individual agents may be highly effective for some patients, it is still difficult to maintain optimal glycemic control in most patients with diabetes. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter, dose-ranging study to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of JNJ-28431754 taken orally over 12 weeks, compared with placebo, in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary clinical hypothesis is that JNJ-28431754 is superior to placebo as measured by the change in hemoglobin A1c from baseline through Week 12 in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Subject safety will be monitored throughout the study using spontaneous adverse event reporting, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis); severe and serious hypoglycemic episodes, assessment of urinary albumin excretion and markers of proximal renal tubular function; pregnancy tests; electrocardiograms (ECGs); vital sign measurements; physical examinations, assessment of calcium and phosphate homeostasis, bone formation and resorption markers, and hormones regulating calcium and phosphorus homeostasis; and vaginal and urine sample collection for fungal and bacterial culture in subjects with symptoms consistent with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) or urinary tract infection (UTI).</detailed_description>
