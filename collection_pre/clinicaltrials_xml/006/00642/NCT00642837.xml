	<brief_title>A Study on Health - Related Quality of Life in Patients With Rheumatic Diseases Taking Tramadol 37.5mg/Acetaminophen 325mg Tablets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently the concerns about the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) have been increasing especially in chronic diseases. Rheumatic disease is a chronic disease, which can result in a functional disability and impaired HRQOL. Because of this chronic pain, patients with rheumatic disease have lower scores on HRQOL than general population. A several studies have indicated Ultracet as an add-on treatment to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) for osteoarthritis(OA) pain, fibromyalgia pain and chronic low back pain significantly improved HRQOL, compared with placebo. We will use the KEQ-5D (a Korean version of the EQ-5D which is a health related quality of life questionnaire) to assess HRQOL. The KEQ-5D has been shown to be effectively sensitive in several rheumatic conditions. The study hypothesis is that the quality of life will be improved after Tramadol 37.5mg/Acetaminophen 325mg tablets administration in outpatients who need Tramadol 37.5mg/Acetaminophen 325mg tablets administration at the investigator's discretion. This is a multicenter, open-label, prospective, observational study to compare HRQOL using Korean version of EQ-5D before and after the treatment with Tramadol 37.5mg/Acetaminophen 325mg tablets and to assess the correlation among each measurement. Observational Study - No investigational drug administered</detailed_description>
