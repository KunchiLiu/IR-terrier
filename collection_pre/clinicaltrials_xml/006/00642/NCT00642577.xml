	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of Avastin in combination with irinotecan + 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid, versus irinotecan + fluorouracil/folinic acid alone, as first line treatment in Chinese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive 6-weekly cycles of Avastin (5mg/kg iv every 2 weeks) + irinotecan 125mg/m2 iv / leucovorin 20mg/m2 iv / fluorouracil 500mg/m2 iv weekly for 4 weeks, or 6-weekly cycles of irinotecan 125mg/m2 iv / leucovorin 20mg/m2 iv / fluorouracil 500mg/m2 iv weekly for 4 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
