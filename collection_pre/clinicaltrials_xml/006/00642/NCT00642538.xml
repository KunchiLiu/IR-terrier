For subjects taking both metformin and sulfonylurea or meglitinide or alpha glucosidase inhibitor, one or both oral agents must be less than 1/2 the maximal allowable dose as cited in the product label. HbA1c = 6.2 to = 8.5%. Fasting Cpeptide = 0.5 ng/mL. On the last 3 days of the washout period (Day 3, 2, and 1) subjects should have a FBG (finger stick) = 13.5 mmol/L. Normal pulmonary function and performance on pulmonary function tests Written Informed Consent Treatment with any type of antidiabetic therapy other than metformin, sulfonylurea, meglitinide and alpha glucosidase inhibitors within the preceding 12 weeks [ie, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), dipeptyl peptidase inhibitors (DPPIV), Symlin (pramlintide acetate) and or Byetta (exenatide)]. Exposure to any investigational medications or devices within the previous 90 days prior to trial entry or participation in another clinical trial while participating in this trial. Use of any prescription medication within 90 days prior to screening, other than allowed antidiabetic therapy, that has not been approved by the PI and Sponsor. The use of alpha blockers, antihypertensives, proton pump inhibitors and cholesterol medication as comedications is allowed throughout the study. Significant improvement in pre to postbronchodilator spirometry (defined as an increase of 12% AND 200 mL in either FVC OR FEV1). Serum creatinine above Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) as defined by the laboratory Any other condition which, in the opinion of the PI, makes the subject unsuitable for the clinical trial, or could limit the validity of the informed consent and/or impair the subject's ability to participate in the trial.</criteria>
