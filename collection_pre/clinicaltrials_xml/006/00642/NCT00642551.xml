	<brief_summary>From all K-vitamins, menaquinone-7 (MK-7) has been identified now as the most effective cofactor for the carboxylation reaction of Gla-proteins such as osteocalcin (in bone) and matrix-Gla protein (in the arterial vessel wall). The question remains whether supplementation with MK-7 also leads to measurable improvements of bone and vascular health. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that MK-7 has a health benefit in apparently healthy postmenopausal women. In a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial the effect of an MK-7- supplement will be monitored during three years on bone quantity and quality and on vascular characteristics and function.</brief_summary>
