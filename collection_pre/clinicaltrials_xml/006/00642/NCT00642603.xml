	<brief_summary>This 2-arm study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 treatment regimens of Xeloda and Avastin, with either irinotecan or oxaliplatin administered for the first 12 cycles, as first line treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients were randomized to receive 2-weekly cycles of treatment with either: 1) Xeloda, Avastin and oxaliplatin; or 2) Xeloda, Avastin and irinotecan. After 9 cycles, patients continued to receive maintenance treatment with Xeloda + Avastin. The anticipated time on study treatment was until disease progression, and the target sample size was 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
