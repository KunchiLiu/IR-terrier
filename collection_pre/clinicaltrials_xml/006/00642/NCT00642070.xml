	<brief_summary>This study is being done to identify those elements of the immune response that may predispose a woman to recurrent urinary tract infection. We suspect that lesser effectiveness of certain components of the host response will lead to recurrent urinary tract infection. We will also evaluate the role that the bladder reservoir may play in recurrent urinary tract infection.</brief_summary>
