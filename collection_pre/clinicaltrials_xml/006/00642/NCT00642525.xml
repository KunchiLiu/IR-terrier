	<brief_summary>Anastomotic leakage is a major complication in esophageal surgery. Although contrast swallow is the current standard to exclude anastomotic leakage postoperatively, endoscopy may be superior. This is the first study to compare radiographic contrast study and endoscopy for the identification of local complications after subtotal esophagectomy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective, blinded, intraindividual controlled study will be conducted with patients with transthoracic esophagectomy due to esophageal cancer. A radiographic contrast study will be performed prior to endoscopy at the 5th to 7th postoperative day. The investigators will not be aware of the results of the corresponding examination. Sensitivity, specificity and feasibility of the radiologic and endoscopic evaluation of the esophageal substitute will be compared.</detailed_description>
