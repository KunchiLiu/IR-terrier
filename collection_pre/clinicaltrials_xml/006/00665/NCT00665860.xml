	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of Soy Phytoestrogens to Prevent Bone Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over-the-counter soy isoflavone supplement usage is becoming common among postmenopausal women. However, there is no documented scientific evidence of its long-term safety and efficacy in preventing osteoporosis. Our primary goal is to determine the safety, efficacy, and optimal dosage of isoflavone supplementation to reduce bone loss in postmenopausal women. The multi-state, multi-institutional design ensures that the study results are representative of postmenopausal women in the U.S. population. Confirming the skeletal benefits of soy isoflavones could translate into reduced healthcare costs related to osteoporosis.</detailed_description>
