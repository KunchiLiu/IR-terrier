	<brief_summary>This study was to assess the safety of sequential intravenous (IV)/oral (PO) moxifloxacin (Avelox®) compared with sequential IV/PO levofloxacin (Levaquin®) in the treatment of elderly subjects (aged &amp;#8805; 65 years) with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who required initial IV therapy. This study also included an assessment of the clinical and bacteriologic effectiveness of both drugs.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Presence of radiological evidence of a new or progressive infiltrate(s) consistent with bacterial pneumonia and at least 2 of the following: Productive cough with purulent or mucopurulent sputum/tracheobronchial secretions or change in the character of sputum (increased volume or purulence) Dyspnea or tachypnea Rigors or chills Pleuritic chest pain Auscultatory findings on pulmonary examination of rales/crackles and/or evidence of pulmonary consolidation Fever or hypothermia White blood cell count &gt;/= 10000/mm3 or &gt;/= 15% immature neutrophils, regardless of the peripheral WBC count, or leukopenia with total WBC count &lt; 4500/mm3 Known hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones Presence of endorgan damage or shock with need for vasopressors for &gt; 4 hours at the time of study entry Need for mechanical ventilation at study entry Implanted cardiac defibrillator. Significant bradycardia with heart rate &lt; 50 beats/minute. Hospitalized for &gt; 48 hours before developing pneumonia. Systemic antibacterial therapy for more than 24 hours within 7 days of enrollment unless the patient was deemed a treatment failure after receiving greater than 72 hours of a nonfluoroquinolone antibiotic. Coexistent disease considered likely to affect the outcome of the study (e.g. active lung cancer, connective tissue disease affecting the lungs, bronchiectasis). Mechanical endobronchial obstruction (e.g. endobronchial tumor). Known or suspected active tuberculosis or endemic fungal infection Neutropenia (neutrophil count &lt; 1000/Microliter). Chronic treatment (equal or longer than 2 weeks) with known immunosuppressant therapy (including treatment with &gt; 15 mg/day of systemic prednisone or equivalent). Patient with known HIV infection and a CD4 count &lt; 200/mm3 . Known severe hepatic insufficiency . Renal impairment with a baseline measured or calculated serum creatinine clearance &lt; 20 mL/min. If a recent value for a 24 hour creatinine clearance is not available then the creatinine clearance should be calculated using the CockcroftGault formula . Known prolongation of the QT interval or use of Class IA or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, amiodarone, sotalol). Uncorrected hypokalemia. Previous history of tendinopathy with quinolones. Previously entered in this study. Participated in any clinical investigational drug study within 4 weeks of screening. Known or suspected concomitant bacterial infection requiring additional systemic antibacterial treatment. Patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to multivitamin infusion (MVI) or preexisting hypervitaminosis.</criteria>
