	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Gathering information about how patients respond to stress and measuring stress levels in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer may help doctors provide better methods of treatment and on-going care. PURPOSE: This research study is measuring stress in women with newly diagnosed stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring Stress in Women With Newly Diagnosed Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Breast Cancer or Ductal Carcinoma In Situ of the Breast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Describe the distributions of physiologic, psychosocial, and behavioral response to stress in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. - Describe the patterns of diurnal cortisol rhythms in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Secondary - Determine if diurnal salivary cortisol (mean or pattern) is consistent over two days within two weeks of study entry. - Assess the changes in diurnal cortisol rhythm pattern and night-time urinary epinephrine excretion change after an intervening stress event (pre- to post-surgery). - Determine if the diurnal cortisol rhythm and the night-time urinary excretion correlate with a variety of self-reported psychosocial factors: optimism (LOT-R), state and trait anxiety (STAI form Y-2), positive and negative affect (PANAS), depressive symptoms (CES-D), coping (Brief COPE), and perceived stress (PSS-10). - Determine if the diurnal cortisol rhythm and the night-time urinary epinephrine excretion correlate with socioeconomic stress and discrimination (functional social support and discrimination [EOD]). - Determine if the diurnal cortisol rhythm and the night-time urinary epinephrine excretion correlate with one lifestyle behavior and dietary fat consumption (Block food screener). OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to race (Caucasian vs African American). Patients are instructed to collect saliva and urine samples on 2 separate days, within 2 weeks of study enrollment. Saliva samples are collected 6 times a day at baseline, before breast cancer surgery, and 7-10 days after surgery. Urine samples are collected after midnight until and including the first morning sample on the saliva-collection days. Patients also complete questionnaires (either by telephone interview or in person) within 2 weeks of study enrollment and 7-10 days after breast surgery. Stress measures examined include optimism (LOT-R), trait-anxiety scale (STAI form Y-2), functional social support, affect and depression (PANAS and CES-D), perceived stress (PSS-10), economic hardship scales, discrimination (EOD), coping mechanisms (Brief COPE), and dietary fat consumption (Block Sugar/Fat/Fruit/Vegetable screener).</detailed_description>
