	<brief_summary>We will perform a randomized, controlled trial, the primary aim of which is to assess the effectiveness of a behavioral-based physical activity program in the prevention and treatment of obesity and related co-morbid conditions in a primary care setting. We hypothesize that the prevention and/or reduction of obesity and related co-morbidities in patients randomized to an individualized education and behavior counseling group will be greater by comparison to those randomized to a group that receives standard care alone.</brief_summary>
