	<brief_summary>Insulin resistance is common in people coinfected with HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and is associated with poor responses to treatment for HCV. Pioglitazone is an FDA-approved medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It works by increasing the body's sensitivity to insulin. The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with pioglitazone prior to HCV treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin is safe and effective in improving the treatment outcome in insulin-resistant, HIV/HCV-coinfected people for whom previous treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin was unsuccessful.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pioglitazone Before Peginterferon and Ribavirin for Hepatitis C Infection in HIV/HCV-Coinfected Patients With Insulin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New and better strategies for the treatment of HCV in HIV/HCV-coinfected people are urgently needed. Standard therapy for HCV includes treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin. Peginterferon is a modified form of the drug interferon and is used either alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of HCV. Ribavirin works by stopping HCV from multiplying inside the body. Sustained virologic response rates in past large studies of peginterferon plus ribavirin used for treating HCV types 1 or 4 ranged from 11% to 29%. Studies have shown that insulin resistance in HCV-infected people who are HIV uninfected leads to poorer HCV treatment response. Improving the body's response to insulin may also improve the outcome of treatment for HCV. Participants in this study will take pioglitazone alone for up to 28 weeks. At Entry and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12,18, and 24 participants will receive clinical assessments. At Week 24, participants will undergo additional tests to ensure that they can enter Step 2 of the study. Participants who are able to continue will then take peginterferon and ribavirin in addition to the pioglitazone for up to 48 additional weeks. Clinical assessments will take place at the time of entry and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 of Step 2. Participants who do not exhibit a response to the treatment at Weeks 12 or 24 will not continue Step 2, as it is unlikely that further treatment will elicit a response. Participants who continue in the study will return to the study site for clinical assessments at Weeks 32, 40, and 48 of Step 2. Follow-up visits will be held at Weeks 60 and 72. The assessments done at clinic visits may include any or all of the following tests: thyroid function, hematology and chemistry, fasting plasma glucose, liver function, gamma-glutamyl transferase, pregnancy, CD4/CD8, HIV-1 RNA, qualitative HCV RNA, and quantitative HCV RNA. On November 18, 2011 the study was closed to accrual due to not meeting targeted accrual goals.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For Step 1: HIV infected Exhibited no response to previous treatment with PEGIFN alfa2a 180 mcg/week or alfa2b 1.5 mcg/kg/week and at least 1000 mg/day ribavirin given for at least 12 consecutive weeks. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol. HOMAIR valued greater than 2.5 within 42 days prior to study entry. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol. CD4 count of at least 200 cells/mm3 within 42 days prior to study entry HCV RNA of at least 60 IU/ml by quantitative RTPCR assay with or without reactive antiHCV antibodies within 42 days prior to study entry Documentation of infection with HCV genotype 1, within 42 days prior to study entry On stable or no antiretroviral therapy for 12 weeks prior to study entry. Interruptions in treatment lasting 14 days or less are allowed if the participant reinitiated the same regimen prior to study entry. Dose modifications or changes in drug formulations during the 12 weeks prior to study entry are permissible. Participants on antiretroviral therapy should plan to remain on the same therapy for at least 24 weeks after study entry. Participants not on antiretroviral therapy should have no plans to initiate therapy during the first 24 weeks following study entry. Participants with documented or suspected hepatic cirrhosis must have a modified ChildPughTurcotte (CPT) within 42 days prior to study entry. Participants with documented or suspected hepatic cirrhosis must have either serum alphafetoprotein level of 50 ng/ml or less within 24 weeks prior to study entry; OR serum alphafetoprotein greater than 50 ng/ml but no greater than 400 ng/ml with an imaging procedure that shows no evidence of a hepatic tumor, both obtained within 24 weeks prior to study entry.

For Step 2: No more than 28 days have passed since the Step 1, Week 24 visit Participants who were treated in Step 1 who meet the following criteria: 1. Detectable HCV RNA (&gt; 60 IU/mL) at the Step 1, Week 24 evaluation 2. CD4 cell count of at least 200 cells/mm3 at Week 24. If the CD4 count is less than 200 cells/mm3 at Week 24, then it must not have decreased by more than 20 cells/mm3 from the Step 1 entry value. 3.
