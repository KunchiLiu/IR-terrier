	<brief_summary>The purpose of this protocol is to study orbital structures in Graves´ Disease using multidetector computed tomography and color doppler imaging. Some changes in orbital structures detected by imaging exams could predict severity of the ocular Graves´disease. Thus the study could be useful in improve medical management of patients with Graves´ Disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Morphometric analysis of orbital structures in Graves´ Orbitopathy using multidetector computed tomography scan and color doppler imaging: Patients with Graves´ orbitopathy are evaluated by a complete ophthalmic examination.A prospective study with Multidetector CT scan and Color Doppler of these patients are made to develop parameters capable to predict Dysthyroid Optic Neuropathy (DON).</detailed_description>
