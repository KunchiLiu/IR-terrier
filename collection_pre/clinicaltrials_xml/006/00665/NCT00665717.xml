	<brief_title>The Influence of Raltegravir on Pravastatin Pharmacokinetics(GRAPPA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pravastatin is a first choice statin for HIV-infected patients. Therefore, raltegravir and pravastatin are expected to be co-administered frequently in HIV-infected patients.Since both agents share the same metabolic pathway, there is a potential for a pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction. Because co-administration will be indicated in many HIV-infected patients, it is essential to investigate this potential interaction.</detailed_description>
