	<brief_summary>Background: This study uses a new experimental procedure for treating melanoma that uses the patient's own lymphocytes (type of white blood cell), which are specially selected to target and destroy their tumor. Objectives: To determine whether this experimental treatment can cause the patient's tumor to shrink. To test the safety of the treatment and its effects on the immune system. Eligibility: Patients with metastatic melanoma 18 years of age and older for whom standard treatments are not effective or who cannot take high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2). Patients must have the tissue type human leukocyte antigens (HLA-A)0201. Design: Workup: Patients have scans, x-rays, laboratory tests, and other tests as needed. Patients have leukapheresis (a procedure for collecting lymphocytes that is similar to collecting whole blood) to collect cells for laboratory treatment and later reinfusion. Chemotherapy: Patients have low-dose chemotherapy for 1 week to prepare the immune system to receive the cultured lymphocytes. Cell infusion and IL-2 treatment: Patients receive the lymphocytes by infusion through a vein and then either high-dose IL-2 infused through a vein or low-dose IL-2 injected under the skin. High-dose IL-2 is given as infusions through a vein every 8 hours for up to 15 doses. Low-dose IL-2 is given as injections under the skin daily for 5 days, followed by a 2-day rest, with this regimen repeated for a total of 5 weeks. Recovery: Patients rest for 1 to 2 weeks to recover from the effects of chemotherapy and IL-2. Tumor biopsy: Patients may be asked to have a biopsy (removal of a small piece of tumor) after receiving treatment to look at the effects of treatment in the tumor. Follow-up: After treatment is completed, patients return to the clinic for physical examinations, review of side effects, laboratory tests and scans every 1 to 6 months until the disease worsens. Retreatment: Patients whose tumor did not grow after treatment or showed evidence of shrinking may be able to be retreated if their tumor begins to grow. They receive the same regimen of chemotherapy, lymphocyte infusion and IL-2 treatment....</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Followed by gp100 Lymphocytes and Aldesleukin to Treat Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: - Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) transfer studies in patients with metastatic melanoma following lymphodepletion have resulted in 50% objective response rates with a 10-15% rate of complete responses. - Pre-clinical and clinical studies of adoptive immunotherapy have suggested that effective lymphocytes for transfer have high avidity for the target antigen, undergo limited in vitro antigen and IL-2 stimulation, and have high expression of cluster of differentiation 27+ (CD27+). - We have developed a novel in vitro strategy using high throughput polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening to rapidly isolate low frequency antigen specific cluster of differentiation 8+ (CD8+) T cells from the peripheral blood repertoire that have these characteristics, and that recognize the gp100:154-162 epitope, an abundantly expressed melanoma antigen, presented by human leukocyte antigens (HLAA2) on the tumor surface. - The current proposed transfer of gp100:154-162 reactive lymphocytes administered in conjunction with a lymphodepleting preparative regimen and aldesleukin would represent a significantly novel approach to adoptive immunotherapy. Objectives: - To determine whether gp100:154-162 reactive cluster of differentiation 4+ (CD4+) T cell depleted lymphocytes infused in conjunction with the administration of high-dose aldesleukin or low-dose aldesleukin may result in clinical tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma receiving a non-myeloablative lymphoid depleting preparative regimen. - To evaluate the safety of the treatment in patients receiving the non-myeloablative conditioning regimen, cell transfer, and high-dose or low-dose aldesleukin. - To determine the survival in patients, of infused cells following the administration of the non-myeloablative regimen, using analysis of the sequence of the variable region of the T cell receptor or flow cytometry (fluorescence activated cell sorting-FACS). Eligibility: -Patients with refractory metastatic melanoma who are greater than or equal to 18 years of age, are HLA-A2+, who have gp100:154-162 reactive peripheral blood lymphocytes available and are physically able to tolerate non-myeloablative chemotherapy. Patients must be refractory to prior high dose aldesleukin treatment if they are medically eligible to receive it. Patients who can tolerate high-dose aldesleukin will receive it with cell infusion; those who cannot tolerate high-dose will receive low-dose aldesleukin. Design: - Patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day X 2 days intravenous (IV)), fludarabine (25 mg/m^2/day IV X 5 days). - Patients will receive intravenous adoptive transfer of gp100:154-162 reactive peripheral blood lymphocytes (minimum 1 X 10^9) and up to a maximum of 3 X 10^11) lymphocytes) followed by high-dose intravenous (IV) aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg/dose every 8 hours for up to 15 doses) or low-dose subcutaneous (SQ) aldesleukin (125,000 IU IL-2/kg/dose for 5 days for 6 weeks with 2 days rest per week). - A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 4-6 weeks after the last dose of aldesleukin in the high dose arm and 2-4 weeks after the last dose of aldesleukin in the low dose arm. Patients will be enrolled into two cohorts. The cohort receiving high dose aldesleukin will be conducted using a small optimal two-stage Phase II design, initially 21 patients will be enrolled, and if two or more of the first 21 patients has a clinical response (partial response (PR) or complete response (CR)), accrual will continue to 41 patients, targeting a 20% goal for objective response. For the cohort who will receive low dose aldesleukin, the study will be conducted as a Minimax two-stage phase II trial. Initially 12 evaluable patients will be enrolled to this cohort, and if 1 or more the first 12 have a response, then accrual would continue until a total of 21 patients, targeting a 20% goal for objective response.</detailed_description>
