	<brief_title>Atelectasis During Delivery - Comparing Cesarian (c) -Section and Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregnancy causes restriction of diaphragm movements as well as higher resistive component to the respiratory system. Spirometry studies have shown that the supine position increases risks of hypoxemia. There seems to be only casual observation regarding the generation of atelectasis during labor.</detailed_description>
