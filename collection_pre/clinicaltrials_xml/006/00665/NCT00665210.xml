	<brief_summary>Hip implants come in different sizes. Currently, surgeons predict the implant size that will be needed using an analogue method whereby photos of the implant sizes are overlaid on the x-rays. In this study, we propose to use a digital, computerized method of templating which we expect will be more accurate than the overlay method.</brief_summary>
