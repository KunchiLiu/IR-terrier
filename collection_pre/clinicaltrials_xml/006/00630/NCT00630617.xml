	<detailed_description>The sessions include information about energy balance, portion control, appropriate amounts and types of physical activity, physical inactivity, nutrition and self-esteem. The influence of the primary care-giver on the children's physical activity and nutritional behaviors may lead to greater or lesser rates of obesity in childhood and eventually lead to adult obesity. Therefore, the intention of this intervention is to educate primary care-givers so as to effect change (in a positive way) in the children they care for. Assessment on steps taken, BMI, percent body fat, diet, self reported physical activity and diet will be used to evaluate the impact of the sessions.</detailed_description>
