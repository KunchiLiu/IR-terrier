	<brief_title>Clinical Investigation Of The Mitroflow Aortic Pericardial Heart Valve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bioprosthetic heart valves offer several advantages over mechanical valves, the most important being freedom from the need for anticoagulation and a low rate of thromboembolic events. Pericardial bioprosthetic valves are known to have hemodynamic performance superior to porcine valves, and the excellent hemodynamic performance of pericardial valves is particularly relevant in patients with a small aortic root. However, long-term durability continues to be the main concern with use of pericardial valves. Although the first generation pericardial valves were withdrawn from the market due to poor durability, further research has indicated that structural failure of early pericardial valves was due to tissue preparation techniques and design failure rather than the pericardial tissue.The unique desing of the Mitroflow Aortic Heart Valve may provide superior hemodynamic performance over other tissue valves.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The subject is male or female 18 years old or older The subject or subject's legal representative is willing to sign the informed consent A bioprosthesis is the most suitable alternative for replacement of a dysfunctional or diseased native aortic valve or prosthesis accord gin to the current medical practice for valve selection at the center The subject is able to return for all followup evaluations for the duration of the study (i.e. geographically stable The patient has preexisting valve prosthesis in the mitral, pulmonary or tricuspid position The patient requires a double or triple valve replacement The patient had a Mitroflow Heart valve during the clinical study but who then had the valve explanted The patient has active endocarditis The subject is or will be participating in a concomitant research study of an investigational product The subject is a minor, intravenous drug user, alcohol abuser, prisoner, institutionalized, or is unable to give informed consent The patient has a major or progressive noncardiac disease that, in the investigator's experience, results in a life expectancy of less than 1 year, or the implant of the device produces an unacceptable increased risk to the patient the patient is pregnant or lactating</criteria>
