	<brief_summary>This is a clinical trial examining the vascular disrupting agent NPI-2358 combined with docetaxel in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is an important component of tumor growth, vascular disrupting agents are intended to target the differences between these tumor blood vessels and the blood vessels in normal tissues.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1/2 Study of Vascular Disrupting Agent NPI-2358 + Docetaxel in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a clinical trial examining the vascular disrupting agent NPI-2358 combined with docetaxel in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is an important component of tumor growth, vascular disrupting agents are intended to target the differences between these tumor blood vessels and the blood vessels in normal tissues. There are indications of advantages in combining vascular disrupting agents with standard agents in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</detailed_description>
