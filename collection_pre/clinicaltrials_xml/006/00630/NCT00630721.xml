	<brief_summary>Determine the in-vivo mechanism of action of INF-B-1b as it's mechanisms of action are not completely understood. We propose that high dose exogenous recombinant IFN-B-1b induces tolerizing effect on DC-dependent T-cell differentiation in patients with MS by inducing the expression of SOCS3 in DCs.</brief_summary>
