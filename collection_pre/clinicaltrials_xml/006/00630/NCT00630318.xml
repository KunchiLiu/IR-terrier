	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate new MR imaging techniques and protocols for non-invasive monitoring of anti-angiogenesis treatment of breast cancer. This feasibility study is a preliminary imaging study to test this imaging protocol on subjects already undergoing MR for clinical purposes. The specific objective of this research study is to develop and validate both MRI and functional MRI data acquisition methods, task paradigms, and post-processing techniques to ensure reliability of results. The information derived from this research is intended to be applied to a future study of subjects undergoing experimental anti-angiogenesis drug therapy.</detailed_description>
