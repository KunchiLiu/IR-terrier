	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study of Surgery Combined With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy(XELOX) in Colorectal Cancer With Resectable Liver Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liver metastasis is the most important prognostic factor of colorectal cancer. Reasonable multidisciplinary therapy might improve the prognosis of patients with liver metastasis. Surgery has been the first choice under such situation. Recently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has also shown its value in unresectable liver metastasis, for it can increase the chance of R0 resection and give some clues to chemosensitivity of agents. However, for those resectable lesions, the role and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has yet to be confirmed. so we design this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed colorectal cancer with liver metastasis(all patients should have the pathological report of colorectal cancer. The chances of hepatocellular carcinoma or metastasis from other primary lesions should be excluded. ) 2. Liver metastasis should be resected with R0 resection and to save enough normal liver tissue 3. Anticipated liver resection: for normal liver, ﹤70%; for liver with cirrhosis, ﹤50% 4. No metastasis of other organs or lymph nodes in abdominal cavity 5. No previous use of oxaliplatin and capecitabine, or previous adjuvant treatment ended more than 6 months 6. Age 18 to 75 years old 7. Karnofsky performance status ≥70 8. Life expectancy of ≥3 month 9. Bilirubin level &lt; 1.5mg/dL 10. Serum creatinine &lt;1.0 times ULN 11.

No R0 resection or not enough normal liver tissue left 3. previous radiotherapy of target lesions 4. accompanied with unresectable other metastasis or malignant pleural fluids or ascites. 5. complete or uncompleted liver obstruction 6. peripheral neuropathy(NCICTC grade 1 or more) 7. mental disturbance neuropathy that influence the cognition, including brain metastasis 8. other serious disease such as uncontrollable active infection, heart infarction with 1 year, un controlled hypertension, arrhythmia with high risk, or unstable heart infarction,heart failure, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction within the last 6 months 9. Other previous malignancy within 5 year, except nonmelanoma skin cancer 10. accompany with other antitumor therapies,including immune therapy, intervention or injection with chemotherapeutical agents into serous cavity, or participating other clinical trials. 11.
