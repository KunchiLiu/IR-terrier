	<brief_title>Conatumumab/Panitumumab Combination Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an exploratory phase 1b/2, global, multicenter, single-arm, 2-part (phase 1b and 2) study of conatumumab in combination with panitumumab in patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer. The objective for Part 1 is to identify a tolerable dose of conatumumab in combination with panitumumab based on the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities in patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer. The objective for Part 2 is to evaluate the objective response rate stratified by Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Virus Oncogene (KRAS) status (wild-type versus mutant) in patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer treated with the combination of panitumumab and conatumumab (tolerable dose identified in part 1).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum Radiographically documented disease progression per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) during or following treatment with fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, and/or oxaliplatin chemotherapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer. Progressive disease must be documented during or ≤ 6 months after the last dose of the most recent chemotherapy regimen prior to enrollment. At least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion measuring ≥ 20 mm in one dimension per modified RECIST. Lesion must not be chosen from a previously irradiated field, unless there has been documented disease progression in that field after irradiation and prior to enrollment. All sites of disease must be evaluated.

Patients must have recovered from surgery related toxicities. Other investigational procedures are excluded Patient is currently pregnant or breast feeding Man or woman of childbearing potential who is not willing to use adequate contraceptive precautions during treatment and for 6 months (for women) or 1 month (for men) after the last investigational product administration. Adequate contraceptive precautions includes double barrier contraceptive methods (eg, diaphragm and condom) or abstinence.
