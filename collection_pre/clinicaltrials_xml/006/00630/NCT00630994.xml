	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well low-dose decitabine works in treating patients with symptomatic myelofibrosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Dose Decitabine in Treating Patients With Symptomatic Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy and safety of low-dose decitabine in patients with symptomatic primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or post essential thrombocythemic (ET) or polycythemic vera (PV) myelofibrosis. - Analyze the ability of this drug to decrease pathologic angiogenesis and other stromal reactive features intrinsic to PMF or post ET/PV myelofibrosis. OUTLINE: Patients receive low-dose decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving partial remission, complete remission, or clinical improvement may receive up to 12 courses of decitabine in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>
