	<brief_title>Effectiveness of the Consent Process</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obtaining informed consent before performing an invasive medical procedure or treatment is a crucial component of patient care. The manner in which the consent process is conducted impacts the doctor/patient relationship, patient safety and patient satisfaction. Many times, patients sign consent forms without reading or understanding them. Although the form has been signed, true informed consent has not been obtained. While there are many variables that impact the ability to truly consent, ineffective communication between the patient and health care providers hampers the process. Evidence shows that improving the consent process by ensuring effective communication between the child's parent and health care team affords substantial benefit. A consent process well done strengthens the parent-provider relationship. It positively impacts risk management. It improves patient safety. It diffuses would-be litigants by helping parents have realistic expectations of care. The consent process should allow and encourage parents to exercise both their right and their responsibility to take an active role in their child's health care.</detailed_description>
