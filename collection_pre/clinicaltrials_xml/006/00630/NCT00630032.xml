	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving them after surgery may kill any tumor cells remaining after surgery. It is not yet known whether docetaxel is more effective than ixabepilone when given after surgery and combination chemotherapy in treating breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving combination chemotherapy followed by docetaxel or ixabepilone to compare how well they work in treating patients who have undergone surgery for nonmetastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Comparison of Docetaxel and Ixabepilone in Non Metastatic Poor Prognosis Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the benefit from sequential administration of 3 courses of combination chemotherapy (FEC100) followed by 3 courses of ixabepilone versus docetaxel on the 5-year disease-free survival of women with nonmetastatic, poor-prognosis breast cancer. Secondary - To compare the 5-year distant metastasis-free survival. - To compare the 5-year event-free survival. - To compare the 5-year overall survival. - To compare the safety profiles for the two chemotherapy regimens. - To identify and/or validate predictive-gene expression profiles of clinical response/resistance to the two treatment regimens. - To bank frozen and fixed tumor and frozen serum prospectively for future translational studies in both genomics and proteomics (transcriptome and proteome analyses, tissue array analyses). - To compare the cost-effectiveness of these 2 regimens. - To compare the quality-of-life of patients treated with these 2 regimens. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, menopausal status (pre- vs post-menopausal), and tumor hormone-receptor status (triple-negative vs progesterone-receptor negative, HER negative, and estrogen-receptor [ER] positive). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive epirubicin hydrochloride IV, fluorouracil IV, and cyclophosphamide IV every 3 weeks in courses 1-3 and docetaxel IV alone every 3 weeks in courses 4-6. - Arm II: Patients receive treatment in courses 1-3 as in arm I and ixabepilone IV alone every 3 weeks in courses 4-6. In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also complete a quality of life questionnaire periodically. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years.</detailed_description>
