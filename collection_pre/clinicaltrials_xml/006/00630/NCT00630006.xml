	<brief_summary>The prognosis of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)infeciton varies from minimal progressive disease to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Host genetic factors contribute to disease severity. It is known that cytokine gene (including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) polymorphism affect disease prognosis.This study aims to assess the effect of TNF-alpha and IL-10, and their interaction,on prognosis of HCV-related chronic liver disease</brief_summary>
