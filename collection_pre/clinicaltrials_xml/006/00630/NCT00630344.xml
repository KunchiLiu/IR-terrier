	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if the study drug RAD001 in combination with Bicalutamide can slow the growth of prostate cancer. The safety of RAD001 given together with Bicalutamide will also be studied. RAD001 has been shown to kill prostate cancer cells. In addition, several hundred kidney and heart transplant patients have been treated with the same main ingredient as in RAD001 for many years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RAD001 and Bicalutamide for Androgen Independent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants will be given a study medication-dosing calendar for each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts four weeks during which time participants will take RAD001 and bicalutamide orally, once per day. RAD001 will be provided from the research pharmacy at the hospital and a prescription will be given for bicalutamide to obtain from a local pharmacy. - A history, physical exam, and blood tests will be performed every four weeks. An assessment of the tumor by Chest CT scan, chest x-ray, bone scan, and abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI will be performed every 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
