	<brief_summary>Goals of the current project: (1) Does the Early Start Denver Model experimental intervention for toddlers with autism reduce disability associated with autism significantly more than standard community interventions?; and (2) What environmental, child, and biological characteristics mediate and moderate intervention response and outcomes at age 4?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensive Intervention for Toddlers With Autism (EARLY STEPS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thanks to the development of better diagnostic tools and a greater level of professional education, autism is being identified in two year olds and in even younger children, with such early diagnosis justified by the rationale that the earlier intervention begins, the better the outcomes may be. However, there are no published outcome data on intervention models or effectiveness for children who begin intervention by or before 24 months. Furthermore, some teaching procedures considered appropriate for older children, (e.g., 40 hours per week of adult-directed intervention, much repetitive practice while sitting at a table (Lovaas, 2002), 1987) are considered developmentally inappropriate for toddlers (Sandall, McLean, &amp; Smith, 2000). Dawson and Rogers have implemented a feasibility study of a intervention designed for toddlers with autism using a randomized controlled design. The approach involves a relationship-based frame to accomplish developmentally based objectives using naturalistic application of applied behavior analytic principles. The approach fuses the Denver Model (Rogers, Hall, Osaki, Reaven, &amp; Herbison, 2000) and Pivotal Response Training (Koegel, Koegel, &amp; Carter, 1999), and is delivered 1:1 for 25 or more hours per week to 24 toddlers with autism for a two year period. The contrast group receives standard community based intervention. Preliminary results demonstrate large and significant group effects after only 12 months and considerable variability of intervention outcomes in both groups. All families will be referred to the appropriate community service programs, if they have not been referred previously.</detailed_description>

Exclusion criteria include: Any other identifiable genetic condition associated with autism or with mental retardation (e.g. fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome). Once enrolled, a negative fragile X test prior to entry into intensive intervention period ( before or during 1st 3 months of study) is required, no exceptions head trauma known neurological disease (e.g., encephalitis) known biological disorder Significant sensory or motor impairment (e.g., cerebral palsy) epilepsy with anticonvulsant medication, * EEG alone or a history of an occasional febrile seizure, without an accompanying diagnosis of epilepsy, will not exclude a child from the study Enrollment in other treatments.</criteria>
