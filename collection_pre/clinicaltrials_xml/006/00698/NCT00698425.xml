	<brief_title>Safety and Tolerability Study of Transscleral Iontophoresis by the EyeGate® II Drug Delivery Device System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, randomized, single-masked, comparative group, safety and tolerability study of single dose levels of citrate buffer delivered through transcleral iontophoresis administered via the EyeGate® II Drug Delivery System. The current study will also determine the safety and tolerability of the dose ranges of transcleral iontophoresis from 2 mA through 7 mA and will determine the safety and tolerability of the application of the Eyegate II system on the eye for time ranges of up to 10.5 minutes.</detailed_description>
