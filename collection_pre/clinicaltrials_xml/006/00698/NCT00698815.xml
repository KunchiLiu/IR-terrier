	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies pemetrexed disodium and sunitinib malate to compare how well they work when given alone or together as second-line therapy in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed disodium, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether pemetrexed disodium and sunitinib malate are more effective when given alone or together in treating non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed and/or Sunitinib as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the 18 week progression-free survival rate of pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) alone (Arm I), sunitinib (sunitinib malate) alone (Arm II) and pemetrexed plus sunitinib (Arm III) in the second-line setting of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the progression-free survival of the three arms. II. To estimate the response rate, duration of response, rate of stable disease, overall survival and to characterize the toxicity profiles of the three arms. III. To estimate the response rate, duration of response, rate of stable disease, overall survival and toxicity of sunitinib in those patients on Arm I that receive this regimen in the third line setting. IV. To assess vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) haplotypes in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. V. To test change in tumor size at 6 weeks (after 2 cycles of therapy, typically the first evaluation point in this type of study) as an early predictor of therapeutic activity in second-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with documented disease progression may then receive sunitinib malate as in Arm II as third-line therapy. ARM II: Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with documented disease progression may then receive pemetrexed disodium as in Arm I as third-line therapy. ARM III: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1 and sunitinib malate PO QD on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with documented disease progression may then receive third-line therapy at the discretion of the treating physician. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks until disease progression and then every 6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
