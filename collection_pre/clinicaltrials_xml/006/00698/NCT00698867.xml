	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to perform a five-year, multi-center prospective evaluation of the Discovery™ Elbow System for outcome and durability. Relief of pain and restoration of function will determine long-term clinical outcome while durability will be measured by the absence of revisions.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Noninflammatory degenerative joint disease including osteoarthritis and avascular necrosis. Inflammatory arthritis Revision where other devices or treatments have failed Correction of functional deformity Treatment of acute fractures or nonunion about the elbow Patient Selection factors to be considered include: Need to obtain pain relief and improve function. Ability and willingness to follow instructions including control of weight and activity levels. Patients who are able and willing to return for followup evaluations. Patients with a good nutritional state. Patients with full skeletal maturity. Patients of all races and gender. Patients who are able to follow care instructions. Patients less than 18 years. Patients with marked bone loss which would preclude proper fixation of the prosthesis. Metabolic disorders, which may impair bone formation. Patients who are pregnant. Patients with an active or suspected infection in or around the elbow or distant foci of infections, which may spread to the implant site. Patients with a highly communicable disease or diseases that may limit followup (e.g. immunocompromised conditions, hepatitis, active tuberculosis, neoplastic disease, etc.). Patients unwilling or unable to comply with a rehabilitation program for elbow replacement or who indicate difficulty or inability to return for followup visits prescribed by the study protocol. Patients who qualify for inclusion in the study, but refuse consent to participate in the study.</criteria>
