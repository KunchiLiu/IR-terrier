	<brief_summary>L-[3-18F]-α-methyltyrosine (18F-FMT) is an amino-acid tracer for positron emission tomography (PET). The aim of this study was to determine whether PET-CT with 18F-FMT provides additional information for the preoperative diagnostic workup as compared with 18F-FDG PET. Tumor uptake of 18F-FMT was compared with several immunohistochemical markers including L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1).</brief_summary>
