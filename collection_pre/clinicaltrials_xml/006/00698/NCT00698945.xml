	<brief_summary>To assess the additional benefit of common adjunctive classes on the diurnal IOP curve in patients assessed as needing additional treatment to reach target intraocular pressure (IOP). To demonstrate superiority of IOP control with Istalol 0.5% QD compared to Brimonidine Tartrate 0.2% BID as adjunctive therapy in adults with uncontrolled IOP's (determined by P.I. based on target pressures) currently treated with Latanoprost 0.05% in the study eye(s).</brief_summary>

Stable use of Latanoprost 0.005% for a minimum of 30 days prior to screening visit. 3. VA of 20/200 or better in either eye 4. Pachymetry of 600 microns or less 5. Visual Field within 6 months of screening visit 6. Patients who use contact lenses are allowed to participate provided that they will remove lenses 15 minutes before dosing 7. Patients who satisfy all informed consent requirements may be included in the study. 1. Females of childbearing potential (those who are not surgically sterile, postmenopausal or using a reliable birth control method) will be excluded from the study. 2. Any allergic component or contraindication to the study medications 3. Pachymetry of 600 microns or greater 4. Systemic corticosteroids not on a stable regimen within 30 days of screening visit. 5. Any concurrent topical agents that can not be discontinued during the course of the trial (natural tears are acceptable) 6. Significant ocular surface abnormalities 7. Patients with any form of glaucoma other than ocular hypertension or openangle glaucoma 8. Patients who have been on an investigational therapy within 30 days prior to screening visit 9. History of ocular trauma within the past 3 months 10. Intraocular surgery within the past 3 months 11. Ocular laser surgery within the past 3 months 12. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry of either eye 13. VA of 20/200 or greater in either eye 14. History or evidence of clinically significant illness or conditions which would make the patient, in the opinion of the investigator, not suitable for the study</criteria>
