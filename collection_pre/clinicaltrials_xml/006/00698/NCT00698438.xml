	<brief_summary>the purpose of this study was to compare standard trabeculectomy to the Ex-PRESS mini glaucoma shunt implantation under a scleral flap in eyes with open-angle glaucoma.In this report, we describe the results of a prospective, randomized trial in which subjects with bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma underwent the two procedures in fellow eyes.Design: Prospective, randomized clinical trial. Participants: 15 subjects with bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma Methods: Subjects underwent the two procedures in fellow eyes. Safety and efficacy were evaluated for up to two years. Main Outcome Measures: Mean IOP and surgical success rates. Results: Mean IOP was similar in Ex-PRESS and trabeculectomy eyes at all time points except month 9, when Ex-PRESS eyes had lower mean IOP (13.2 mmHg vs 16.5 mmHg, respectively; p=0.025). Percent IOP reduction was also similar at all time points except postoperative day 1, when trabeculectomy eyes were lower (75.5% vs 65.8%, respectively; p=0.003), likely due to a higher rate of early hypotony in trabeculectomy eyes versus Ex-PRESS eyes (47% vs 7%, respectively). Complete (without medications) and qualified (with or without medications) successes were more common at all IOP cut-off values in Ex-PRESS eyes than trabeculectomy eyes at last visit (p=0.015, p=0.015 respectively). Postoperative complications were uncommon in both groups, but trabeculectomy eyes required more postoperative interventions than Ex-PRESS eyes.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects were at least 18 years of age and Had medically uncontrolled primary openangle glaucoma requiring incisional surgery for reduction of intraocular pressure in both eyes. Subjects with prior cataract or failed filtration surgery in either eye were eligible to participate if surgery occurred at least 3 months prior to enrollment. Any form of glaucoma other than primary openangle glaucoma; History of or active uveitis; or Any ocular abnormality that would prevent accurate assessment of intraocular pressure</criteria>
