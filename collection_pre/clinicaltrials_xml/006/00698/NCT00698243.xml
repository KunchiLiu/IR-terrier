	<detailed_description>The study will open with Schedule 1 (S1, intermittent) with initiation of Schedule 2 (S2, weekly) and Schedule 3 (S3, continuous), which may occur in parallel after observation of clinically significant related dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the S1 schedule. Dosing will be initiated on Day 1 with intermittent weekly dosing continuing for 21 days (1 Treatment Period).
