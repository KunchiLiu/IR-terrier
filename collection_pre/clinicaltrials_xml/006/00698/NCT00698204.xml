	<brief_summary>Oral mucositis refers to ulcerative lesions of the oral mucosa that occur due to radiation therapy given for treatment of head and neck cancer. These lesions are painful, compromise nutrition and quality of life and may necessitate interruptions in radiation therapy, thus adversely affecting cancer therapy outcomes. This study examined the use of an anti-inflammatory medicine to reduce pain and severity of oral mucositis.</brief_summary>
