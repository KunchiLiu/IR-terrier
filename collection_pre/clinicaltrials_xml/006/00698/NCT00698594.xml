	<brief_title>Comparison of Effectiveness and Safety of Sublingual Immunotherapy in Children With Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allergen immunotherapy is currently the only one method of cause treatment of the IgE-dependent allergic diseases. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is the method which allows to give allergens via alternative oral route in patients home. Due to the possibility of avoiding injection this therapy allows to have better relationship with patient, and reduce the costs of therapy thanks to reducing the numbers of visits in out-patient clinic.However efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy are still important issues, especially in children. The purpose of trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of sublingual seasonal and annual immunotherapy in children with allergic rhinitis allergic to grass pollens.</detailed_description>
