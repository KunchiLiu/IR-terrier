	<brief_summary>Rationale: Investigation of the circadian rhythm of erythropoietin and melatonin in patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency Objectives: Primary objective: Is there a circadian rhythm of epo and melatonin in patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency? Primary Objective: Is there a circadian rhythm of epo and melatonin in patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency compared to patients with a normal renal function? Secondary Objective: Is there a circadian rhythm of cortisol and IGF in patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency? Secondary Objective: Is there a circadian rhythm of cortisol and IGF in patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency compared to patients with a normal renal function? Study design: Comparative study in 4 groups with various degrees of renal insufficiency, duration for each patient 24 hrs. Total duration of study 12 months, patients admitted to the hospital (on nursing ward) Study population: Patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency Main study parameters/endpoints: Analysis of the existence of a circadian rhythm in patients with a normal renal function and in patients with variable degrees of renal insufficiency Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Better knowledge of the circadian rhythm in renal insufficiency. This could lead to a more efficient administration of erythropoietin and melatonin in the future. Extent of burden is 1 venapunction for placement of infusion needle, the withdrawal of 11 times 5 ml blood in 24 hrs, continuous measurement of body temperature via capsule, 24-hour continuous ambulant blood pressure monitoring.</brief_summary>
