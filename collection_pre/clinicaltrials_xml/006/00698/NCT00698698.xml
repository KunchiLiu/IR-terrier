	<brief_summary>Diabetes mellitus is becoming a global epidemic. There is a need to devise a non invasive method for detection of diabetes and its related complication. Tear proteins are easy to collect causing no harm to a patient and different studies indicate that tear proteins of diabetic patients are significantly different from non diabetic population. This difference in the composition of tear proteins become more pronounced with advancement of diabetic retinopathy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on Tear Proteins in Diabetic Retinopathy of Type 2 Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus causes a significant alteration in tear proteins. If we analyze tear proteins by means of electrophoresis, HPLC, and mass spectroscopy. We can find different type of tear proteins in different grades of diabetic retinopathy these biomarkers can help in mass screening , diagnosis and management of diabetic population.</detailed_description>
