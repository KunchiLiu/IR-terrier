	<brief_summary>The purpose of this data collection is to determine long term survival rate of ArComXL® highly cross-linked polyethylene</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Investigation of ArComXL® Polyethylene in Total Hip Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 500 patients (cases) will be enrolled in this data collection effort and 10-year follow-up will be attempted. Follow-up will be obtained by sending a questionnaire directly to the patients by mail. The follow-up will be annually and only survivorship data will be collected. This data collection project was developed in order to determine the actual long-term (10-year) survival rate of Biomet's ArCom XL highly cross-linked polyethylene. Data will be collated for uncemented cases only. This will eliminate the possibility of cement or cement debris being a confounding variable. The data gathered will be collated and used to provide feedback to designing engineers, support marketing efforts, and answer potential questions from reimbursement agencies.</detailed_description>
