	<detailed_description>This is a 28-day, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled inpatient study of the administration of risperidone alone or in combination with mifepristone in healthy adult male volunteers.

The secondary study objectives are to determine the mean percent change in baseline body weight; and the proportion of subjects that gain less than 5% and less than 7% of their baseline body in the treatment groups.</detailed_description>
