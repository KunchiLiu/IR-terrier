	<brief_title>A Dose Ranging Study of Arformoterol Given Once Daily Compared to Arformoterol Given Twice Daily in Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a double-blind, repeat-dose, randomized, multicenter, two-part, parallel-group, dose-ranging study of arformoterol and placebo in the treatment of subjects with COPD. Approximately 215 subjects will be randomized in this study. Study participation will consist of a total of eight (8) study visits over approximately ten (10) weeks for each subject. This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.</detailed_description>

Subject's schedule or travel prevents the completion of all required visits. Subject is scheduled for inpatient hospitalization, including elective surgery (in patient or outpatient) during the trial. Subject has had a lifethreatening/unstable respiratory status, including upper or lower respiratory tract infection, within the 30 days prior to study start. Subject has a known history of asthma (except childhood asthma) or any chronic respiratory disease (including a current history of sleep apnea) other than COPD (chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema). Subject has a known history of alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiencyrelated emphysema. Subject has a history of cancer except nonmelanoma skin cancer. Subjects with a history of cancer that is considered surgically cured and without a recurrence within the past 5 years may participate in the study.

Subject requires continuous supplemental oxygen therapy (unless subject resides at elevation greater than or equal to 4,000 feet). Subject has had a change in dose or type of any medications for COPD within 14 days before the screening visit. Subject has a known sensitivity to arformoterol, ipratropium or albuterol or any of the excipients contained in any of these formulations. Subject has a history of substance abuse within 12 months of Visit 1, or with a positive urine drug screen at study start. Subject is using any prescription drug for which concomitant betaagonist administration is contraindicated (e.g., betablockers).
