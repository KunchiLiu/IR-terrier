	<brief_title>Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation on Hypertriglyceridemia in HIV-infected Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are no guidelines as to the clinical threshold at which treatment for hypertriglyceridemia is necessary in pediatric populations, and extreme hypertriglyceridemia is relatively infrequent in HIV-infected children. Adult studies have suggested that there is a proportionate reduction in triglycerides of approximately 15-25% when taking fish oil omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, irrespective of the degree of initial triglyceride elevation. This trial would thus represent a proof-of-concept study in children with mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia. The results of this study would contribute to the pool of knowledge regarding the efficacy and safety of this nutriceutical in the treatment of HAART-associated hypertriglyceridemia in children. Compared with other interventions (such as dietary changes and drug therapies), nutritional supplementation with fish oil is an inexpensive, simple, and likely preferable treatment for a potentially significant medical condition. In addition, the results of this study could presumably be extrapolated to benefit children with hypertriglyceridemia secondary to other types of drugs or illnesses.</detailed_description>
