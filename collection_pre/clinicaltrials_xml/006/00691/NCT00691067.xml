	<brief_summary>We propose to conduct placebo-controlled trial of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone in Gulf War veterans (GWV) with chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) to examine its effects on physical and mental health and cognitive functioning. In addition, we propose to examine whether HPA axis biomarkers or their response to mifepristone are useful predictors of clinical response.</brief_summary>
