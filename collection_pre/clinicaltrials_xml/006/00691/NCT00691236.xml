	<brief_summary>This trial will be a pilot study to find out if zoledronic acid improves the response to chemotherapy in high grade osteosarcoma. In arm A of the study, 40 adult patients will be randomised into two groups. One group will get standard chemotherapy and the other group will get Zoledronic acid in addition to chemotherapy. The investigators will assess the histological necrosis as well as disease status for up to 2 years. In Arm B, adult patients with relapsed disease or advanced disease who are unable to take any other therapy and are given only symptomatic care will be given 6 doses of zoledronic acid and followed up for disease status. This will be to determine the role of zoledronic acid as a single agent.</brief_summary>
