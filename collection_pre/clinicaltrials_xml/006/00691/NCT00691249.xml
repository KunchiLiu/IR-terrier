	<brief_title>Resistant Starch on Glucose and Insulin Sensitivity in Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To measure the blood glucose response, after an overnight fast, blood samples will be collected before eating and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after eating each bar. The incremental area under the curve was used to calculate glycemic index. The investigators will also measure the second meal effect by measuring the metabolic response (glucose, insulin, and gut hormones) after a standardized lunch two hours following the first assessment.</detailed_description>
