	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test bone marrow mononuclear cells for patients with recent heart attack who are at high risk of experiencing heart failure. This study drug is made of you own cells. Studies similar to this one have suggested that the use of cell-based transfer after heart attack can improve the recuperation of the heart. The purpose of this study is to assess whether cell transfer can improve the healing of the heart after a heart attack.</brief_summary>
