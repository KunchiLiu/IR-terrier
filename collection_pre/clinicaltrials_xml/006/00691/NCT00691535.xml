	<brief_summary>We hope to learn more about the biology of psychiatric illness with the hope of improving the diagnosis and treatment of such psychiatric conditions as major depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetics of Symptomatology and Treatment Response in Psychotic Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From the blood sample you donate, the researchers will obtain DNA. This DNA will be used to search for DNA markers related to the underlying biology of psychiatric illness and how this might explain the symptoms of these disorders. Research using DNA is an important way to try to understand human disease and/or the role genes play in disease. In effect, part of your blood sample will be used to attempt to understand how genetic factors contribute to the symptoms of such psychiatric conditions as major depression.</detailed_description>
