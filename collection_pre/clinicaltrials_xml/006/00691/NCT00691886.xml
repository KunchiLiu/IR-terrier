	<brief_summary>To achieve safe,consistent, continuous sedation using Dexmedetomidine in advaced bronchoscopy procedures that may reduce the need for rapid pain sedative infusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous (IV) Dexmedetomidine During Flexible Bronchoscopy and Endobronchial Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride as a single agent produces sedation, pain relief, anxiety redution, stable respiratory rates, and predictable cardiovascular responses. Dexmedetomidine facilitates patient comfort, compliance and comprehension by offering sedation with the ability to awaken patients. This study is being done to determine sedation efficacy and dosing; measure reduction or eliminate the need for rapid sedative infusion during bronchoscopy; improvement of patient comfort and safety during complex bronchoscopy; establish a new paradigm for moderate sedation during flexible bronchoscopy</detailed_description>
