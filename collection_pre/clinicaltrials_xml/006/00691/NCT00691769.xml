	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to see if a specific protein that we are interested in is involved in scarring hair loss. If these proteins are involved, further genetic work may also better define the disease as well as future treatment options.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expression of Fas Protein in Skin Biopsies of Participants With Scarring Alopecia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center study, designed to evaluate the expression of Fas protein in skin biopsies of patients with scarring alopecia including fourteen patients with central centrifugal scarring alopecia (CCSA), three patients with lichen planopilaris (LP) and three patients with discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). Skin biopsies of five healthy participants will be used as controls.</detailed_description>
