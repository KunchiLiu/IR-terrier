	<detailed_description>Merck Duration of Treatment : odanacatib; approximately 36 months (even driven study) - Comparator Duration of Treatment : placebo (unspecified); approximately 36 months (event driven study)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Castrationresistant prostate cancer; increased risk for prostate cancer progression Patient underwent bilateral orchiectomy 6 months or more (i.e., =180 days) prior to Visit 1, or is receiving androgendeprivation therapy and is on a stable regimen for at least 3 months (i.e., =90 days) prior to Visit 1. Androgendeprivation therapy may include gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonists such as leuprolide, goserelin, or triptorelin Bone metastases or history of bone metastases Patient has other distant metastases (e.g., visceral, including brain, or softtissue). Patients with regional lymph nodal metastases are eligible Patient has ANY of the following: 1. currently is receiving a bisphosphonate or other drug therapy for osteoporosis 2. has been treated with an oral bisphosphonate for osteoporosis for more than 3 months within the 2 years prior to Visit 1, or for a total of more than 6 months at any time prior to Visit 1 3. has been treated with an intravenous bisphosphonate within the 12 months prior to Visit 1 Patient has received chemotherapy within the 2 years prior to Visit 1 (for example, doxorubicin, cytoxan, estramustine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, etoposide, vinblastine, 5fluorouracil, interferon, mitoxantrone). This exclusion criterion does not include androgendeprivation therapy (e.g., gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonists such as leuprolide, goserelin, or triptorelin) Patient has a history of any malignancy other than prostate cancer &lt;5 years prior to signing informed consent, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer. Melanoma, leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloproliferative disorders of any duration are excluded Patient is currently participating in, or has participated in a study with an investigational compound or device within 30 days of signing the informed consent Patient is currently participating in or has at any time in the past participated in a prostate cancer study with a registered medication (i.e., approved by the regulatory agency in which he resides) being tested for the treatment of prostate cancer (an unapproved indication) Patient is currently using a systemically administered azole antifungal (for example, ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, posaconazole, ravuconazole, and voriconazole). Patients taking these medications must discontinue their use at least one week prior to starting blinded study medication</criteria>
