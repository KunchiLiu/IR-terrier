	<brief_summary>A reduced response to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) has been reported in smoking compared to non-smoking asthmatic patients. However, the comparative response to other currently prescribed medications such as combination therapy of long-acting beta agonists and ICS remain to be further evaluated. No significant differences were found between our group of subjects in regard to changes in asthma control pulmonary function and airway inflammation following budesonide or the association of budesonide with formoterol for a period of 2 months. This should be further explored in larger groups of subjects.</brief_summary>
