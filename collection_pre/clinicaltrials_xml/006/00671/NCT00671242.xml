	<brief_summary>Purpose: L-[3-18F]-α-methyltyrosine (18F-FMT) is an amino-acid tracer for PET. We have conducted a clinicopathologic study to elucidate the correlation of angiogenesis with 18F-FMT and 18F-FDG uptake in the patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Method: Thirty-seven NSCLC patients were enrolled in this study, and a pair of PET study with 18F-FMT and 18F-FDG was performed. Uptake of PET tracers was evaluated with standardized uptake value. VEGF, CD31, CD34, LAT1 and Ki-67 labeling index of the resected tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining, and correlated with the clinicopathologic variables and the uptake of PET tracers.</brief_summary>
