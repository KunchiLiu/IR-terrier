	<detailed_description>Accidental injuries, mostly motor vehicle accident, in civilian population are frequent events.For instance, nearly one-third of injured patients appear to develop trauma-related psychiatric illness and the major diagnoses are post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive disorder.Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (Omega-3 PUFA) has some evidence of efficacy of treatment in patients with anxiety and mood disorders, but no evidence of preventing anxiety and mood disorders that occur subsequent to accidental injuries.We evaluate efficacy and safety of Omega-3 PUFA for the secondary prevention of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and related psychiatric illness in patients with accidental injury</detailed_description>
