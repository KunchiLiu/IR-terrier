	<brief_summary>This is a parallel-group, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, Phase 4 trial comparing three creams in the treatment of impetiginous eczema: - Arm A: QUADRIDERME® cream (betamethasone diproprionate, clotrimazole, and gentamicin sulfate) - Arm B: Combination of betamethasone diproprionate cream and gentamicin sulfate cream - Arm C: Betamethasone diproprionate cream At 7 sites, in Portugal, a total of 207 subjects will be randomized using a 1:1:1 randomization ratio to receive one of the three possible treatments for a maximum period of 28 days or until 5 days after total remission of the signs and symptoms, but never more than 28 days. Assessments will be made of level of improvement of the target area in each treatment group, number of days for total remission, and safety profile. Note: This study was terminated early due to lack of recruitment (only 3 of the 207 planned participants were enrolled). Statistical analyses were not performed. Further, 7 sites were planned, but only 4 sites were approved out of which 3 sites were initiated.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Minimum age: 12 years Good general health confirmed by clinical history and a physical and skin examination (excluding area of skin with impetiginous eczema). Diagnosis of impetiginous eczema. Ability to understand the procedures of the protocol and follow the requirements during the course of the study. Results of routine laboratory tests hemogram with leukogram and platelet count, creatinine, glucose, sed. rate, IgE level and transaminases; along with plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels prior to the start of the treatment. These results must all be within normal limits or not clinically relevant in order to be included in the trial. Pregnant participants or women of childbearing age who are not using birth control methods considered reliable by the attending physician. Participants with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the medication being studied. Participants in whom the extent or severity of the lesions requires treatment of a different type than what is planned for this trial. Participants who need any other type of topical or systemic medication during the trial that might affect the course of the disease. Participants who have been treated with other topical medications during the 14day period prior to the start of the trial. Participants who have received systemic corticosteroids or any other immunosuppressant medication during the 28day period prior to the start of the study.</criteria>
