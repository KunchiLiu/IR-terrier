	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate an intervention to prevent complications after pancreas surgery. The goal is to determine if placing a stent into the pancreatic duct before surgery will decrease or prevent leaking from the pancreatic duct after surgery. Leaks are common after pancreas surgery and can result in serious problems and post-operative pain. The study will compare two groups. One group will have the stent before surgery, and the other group will have standard pancreas surgery, no endoscopy, and no stent.</brief_summary>
