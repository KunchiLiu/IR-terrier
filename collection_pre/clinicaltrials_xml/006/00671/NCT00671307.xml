	<brief_summary>This study is designed to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of an infusion of a single dose of recombinant plasma gelsolin (rhu-pGelsolin) when given to patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with documented low levels of natural gelsolin. It is believed that this drug will raise the gelsolin levels in these patients and decrease the probability that they will develop complications from their underlying disease such as organ system failure or death.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ascending Single Dose Study of Rhu-pGelsolin in Patients With Decreased Gelsolin Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single dose of rhu-pGelsolin infusion study. Thirteen subjects (10 active and 3 placebo) will be dosed at 3 mg/kg and 5 subjects (3 active and 2 placebo) will be dosed at 6 mg/kg. In addition, twenty-two subjects (18 active and 4 placebo) will be dosed at 6 mg/kg per day for 3 days. The Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and Steering Committee will review the preceding dose safety data, and agree the tolerability prior to the enrolment for next higher dose. Blood samples will be collected during 1 hour infusion through 72 hours post dose for PK assessment after each dose.</detailed_description>
