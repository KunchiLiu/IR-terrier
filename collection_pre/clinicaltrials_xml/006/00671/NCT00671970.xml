	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To estimate 6-month progression free survival probability of pts w recurrent malignant gliomas treated w erlotinib + bevacizumab. Secondary Objectives: To evaluate safety &amp; tolerability of erlotinib + bevacizumab among pts w recurrent malignant gliomas To evaluate radiographic response of pts w recurrent malignant gliomas treated w erlotinib + bevacizumab To evaluate pharmacokinetics of erlotinib when administered to pts w recurrent malignant gliomas; &amp; to examine relationship of clinical response to Epidermal Growth Factor (EGFR) expression, amplification, &amp; v-III mutation, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) &amp; phosphorylated protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) in archival tumor samples</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase (Ph) II Bevacizumab + Erlotinib for Patients (Pts) With Recurrent Malignant Glioma (MG)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exploratory, Phase II study designed to assess anti-tumor activity of combinatorial regimen consisting of erlotinib + bevacizumab among pts w recurrent malignant glioma. Signal transduction inhibitors, such as erlotinib, as well as anti-angiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab, are expected to exert a cytostatic anti-tumor effect. Primary endpoint of study is probability of progression-free survival at 6 months. An important secondary objective is to further assess the safety of erlotinib + bevacizumab for pts w RMG. Pharmacokinetic studies included in protocol will evaluate impact of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) on metabolism of erlotinib. If study demonstrates that combo regimen of erlotinib + bevacizumab is associated w encouraging anti-tumor activity among pts w recurrent malignant glioma (RMG), further assessment of regimen in additional ph II &amp; possibly ph III studies, will be considered.</detailed_description>
