	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to enable the study sponsor to develop a new blood test method for clinicians to accurately predict which individuals with lupus will flare, when the flare will occur, and flare severity. Ultimately such a newly derived test would allow treating physicians to start pre-emptive therapy early, with the goal of achieving remission quickly and with a shorter duration of treatment; identify individuals who will have less severe flares and will thus require less aggressive treatments; or intensify and lengthen treatment for those individuals who will need such therapy. The design of this study is to follow individuals with a known diagnosis of SLE for changes in disease activity during the course of one year of observation. Clinical data and blood and urine samples will be collected at scheduled monthly visits. The clinical data and blood samples will be used for identifying gene expression profile(s) that are associated with increases in SLE disease activity (lupus "flares").</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Activity Gene Expression (SAGE) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is currently enrolling individuals who have an established diagnosis of SLE to participate. There is no cost to volunteers who participate and the study pays for the visits to the clinics for monthly collection of clinical information and blood and urine samples. Women who are or become pregnant may participate in the study with the recommendation of their health care providers and the study doctors.</detailed_description>
