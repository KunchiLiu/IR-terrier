	<brief_title>A Phase II Evaluation of Dasatinib (SprycelÂ®, NSC #732517) in the Treatment of Persistent or Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the proportion of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months and the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or partial) in patients with persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v3.0. II. To determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Objectives in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue before treatment with dasatinib. II. Explore the association between the expression and phosphorylation of biomarkers involved in Src signaling pathways and measures of clinical outcome as well as disease status. III. Bank residual FFPE tumor tissue for the development and characterization of predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers or the validation of thereapeutic targets. IV. Objectives in blood drawn before and/or during treatment with dasatinib. V. Isolate, enumerate and characterize circulating tumor cells (CTC) as well as circulating endothelial cells (CEC)/circulating endothelial precursors (CEP). VI. Prepare a buffy-coat specimen from residual blood remaining after isolation of CTC and CEC/CEP. VII. Explore whether CTC and CEC/CEP counts or characteristics are associated with measures of clinical outcome and disease status. VIII. Explore whether the expression and phosphorylation of biomarkers involved in Src signaling pathways in CTC and CEC/CEP are associated with measures of clinical outcome and disease status. IX. Explore the associations between germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in drug metabolism, resistance and DNA repair and measures of clinical outcome and disease status. X. Bank residual DNA and buffy-coat specimens for the development and characterization of predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers or the validation of therapeutic targets. XI. Objectives in plasma prepared from blood drawn before and/or during treatment with dasatinib. XII. Explore the association between angiogenic markers and cytokines including VEGF and measures of clinical outcome and disease status. XIII. Explore the association between measures of cell-free DNA and measures of clinical outcome and disease status. XIV. Bank residual plasma for the development and characterization of predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers or the validation of therapeutic targets. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral dasatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one week prior to registration; continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration; six weeks for patient previously treated with monoclonal antibodies Prior therapy Patients must have had one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound; this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, highdose therapy, consolidation, noncytotoxic agents or extended therapy administered after surgical or nonsurgical assessment Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, one additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease according to the following definition: Cytotoxic regimens include any agent that targets the genetic and/or mitotic apparatus of dividing cells, resulting in doselimiting toxicity to the bone marrow and/or gastrointestinal mucosa Note: patients on this noncytotoxic study are allowed to receive additional cytotoxic chemotherapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease, as defined above Patients must have NOT received any noncytotoxic therapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic (noncytotoxic) therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen Patients who have received only one prior cytotoxic regimen (platinumbased regimen for management of primary disease), must have a platinumfree interval of less than 12 months, or have progressed during platinumbased therapy, or have persistent disease after a platinumbased therapy Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mcl, equivalent to CTCAE v 3.0 grade 1 Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcl Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10 g/dL Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal (ULN), CTCAE v3.0 grade 1 Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN, CTCAE v3.0 grade 1 SGOT and alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN, CTCAE v3.0 grade 1 Mg++, CA++, phosphate, K+, Na corrected to WNL PT/INR, PTT less than or equal to 1 1.5 x ULN, CTCAE v 3.0 grade 1 except for patients on therapeutic anticoagulation Neuropathy (sensory and motor) less than or equal to CTCAE v 3.0 grade 1 QTc interval on electrocardiogram must be less than or equal to 450 msec Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and authorization permitting release of personal health information Patients must meet preentry requirements as specified in section 7.0 Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to initiating protocol therapy and be practicing an effective form of contraception during protocol therapy and for at least 4 weeks following completion of protocol therapy Patients must not be receiving any other investigational agent Patients must be able to swallow whole pills Patients who have had previous treatment with dasatinib Patients who have received radiation to more than 25% of marrowbearing areas Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer and other specific malignancies are excluded if there is any evidence of other malignancy being present within the last five years;

the use of antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving dasatinib therapy; if antacid therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered two hours before or after the dose of dasatinib Therapeutic anticoagulation is not contraindicated, but for those patients on therapeutic anticoagulation, alteration in coagulation parameters is expected following initiation of dasatinib. For patients on therapeutic anticoagulation, coagulation parameters should be assessed weekly for the first cycle following initiation of dasatinib, weekly for the first cycle following a dose reduction, and weekly for a minimum of two weeks after stopping dasatinib. Warfarin is permitted for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis Note: Low molecular weight heparin is permitted provided the patient's PT/INR is =&lt; 1.5; for patients on anticoagulation, coagulation parameters should be assessed weekly for the first cycle following initiation of dasatinib, weekly for the first cycle following a dose reduction, and weekly for a minimum of two weeks after stopping dasatinib Pregnant or nursing women; women of childbearing potential unless using effective contraception as determined by the investigator</criteria>
