	<brief_summary>Despite the lack of trials proving the efficacy of DNase in non cystic fibrosis patients, it is currently heavily used in this population. In fact, per evidence of barcode scanning via Meditech computer system at OU Medical Center 93% of the DNase prescribed in 2005 was for non Cystic fibrosis patients with an estimated yearly cost of $341,968.15.In vitro studies showed that the effect of Dnase was minimal on sputum viscosity when compared to Hypertonic saline . Furthermore recent studies on hypertonic saline in cystic fibrosis patients showed that it is an inexpensive and safe therapy when preceded by a bronchodilator in patients with cystic fibrosis. We hereby propose a prospective randomized trial to compare the efficacy of hypertonic saline, DNase, vs. normal saline in the treatment of atelectasis in non cystic fibrosis, mechanically ventilated patient.</brief_summary>
