	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic yield with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in hirschsprung's disease versus that of standard rectal suction biopsy. In order to compare EMR versus rectal suction biopsy, patients' diagnostic specimens will be analyzed by tissue size, the presence of submucosal tissue, and positive acteylcholinesterase staining. Additionally, the proportion of patients who would have required subsequent full thickness surgical biopsy with each technique will be compared. Biopsy results will be compared with clinical data including history, Bristol stool scale, anorectal manometry results and SITZ markers studies. Finally, the estimated costs that would have been incurred with each method will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
