	<brief_summary>Sinus surgery is a common, day surgery procedure performed by general and subspecialty trained otolaryngologists. In most cases, this is a safe surgery with a low incidence of complications. When there is significant bleeding or enough bleeding to obscure important anatomical landmarks, there is a higher chance of complications. These complications can include blindness, meningitis or cerebrospinal fluid leak. Our hypothesis is that in patients taking oral tranexamic acid three days before surgery and six days after, there will be less intraoperative bleeding, better surgical visualization and less postoperative bleeding events.</brief_summary>
