	<brief_summary>The goal of this observational study is to collect information about the length of surgery, the procedures performed during surgery, and any possible side effects of robot-assisted gynecologic cancer surgeries. The researchers also want to learn if patients who have robot-assisted surgeries have fewer complications during recovery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Information Collection: If you agree to take part in this study, the following information will be collected from your medical record after surgery: - The reason you had or are scheduled to have robot-assisted surgery. - How long the surgery took to complete. - What procedures were performed during the surgery. - If cancer was or was not found in the tissue that was removed. - How long you were in the hospital. - What complications, if any, happened that are related to the surgery. Follow-Up Questionnaires: Depending on when you enroll in the study, you may be asked to complete a short questionnaire 3 different times, each questionnaire will take less than 10 minutes to complete.

If you have your follow up care with a doctor outside of MD Anderson, you will be called to complete the questionnaires over the phone. Each phone call should last about 10 minutes This questionnaire and/or phone calls will ask questions about any side effects you have experienced that you think may be related to the surgery. Length of Study: After the last questionnaire is completed, your participation in the study is over. This is an investigational study. Up to 1,000 patients will take part in this study at MD Anderson Cancer Center and Banner MD Anderson Arizona.</detailed_description>
