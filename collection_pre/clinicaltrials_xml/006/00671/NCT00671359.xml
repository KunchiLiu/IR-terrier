	<brief_title>Food Effects of Single Oral Dose of 600mg TR-701</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will receive the following treatments in a crossover design: Treatment A: Three 200-mg capsules (600-mg dose) of TR-701 administered orally with 240 mL room temperature tap water after at least a 10-hour fast. Treatment B: Three 200-mg capsules (600-mg dose) of TR-701 administered orally with 240 mL room temperature tap water following a high-fat meal preceded by at least a 10-hour fast. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for PK parameters where available, including Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf. Minimum, maximum, mean, and median values will be determined and standard deviations will be calculated. Where data are available, food effect will be examined between test (fed state) and reference (fasted state) groups.</detailed_description>
