	<brief_summary>GW642444 and GSK233705 are in development for treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Development of these two inhaled drugs as a combination therapy would have potential for improved patient benefit as they both work through different mechanisms and the combined bronchodilatory effect might be additive. This study will look at the this combination, for the first time, in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age. Female subjects must be of non childbearing potential including premenopausal females with documented (medical report verification) hysterectomy or double oophorectomy or postmenopausal Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until 90 days postlast dose. BMI within the range 18 30 kg/m2 (inclusive). Average QTc(B)≤450 msec taken from triplicate assessments at screening. No clinically active and relevant abnormality on 12lead ECG at screening or 24h Holter ECG. Normal spirometry (FEV1 ≥ 80% of predicted, FEV1/FVC ≥ 70%). Nonsmokers (never smoked or not smoking for &gt;6 months with &lt;10 pack years history (Pack years = (cigarettes per day smoked/20) x number of years smoked)) A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject The subject is capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form Available to complete the study Any clinically important abnormality identified at the screening medical assessment (physical examination/medical history), clinical laboratory tests, or ECG (12lead). 24hr Holter monitoring outside normal limits. A history of breathing problems (i.e. history of asthmatic symptomatology, unless asthma in childhood that has now resolved and no longer requires maintenance therapy which should not be an exclusion). A mean QTc(B) value at screening &gt;450msec, or an ECG that is not suitable for QT measurements (e.g. LBBB or poorly defined termination of the T wave). A history of elevated resting blood pressure or a mean blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg at screening. A mean heart rate outside the range 4090 bpm at screening. The subject has a positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening. A positive test for HIV antibody (if determined by the local SOP's). History of high alcohol consumption within 3months of the study defined as: an average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an average daily intake of greater than 3 units (males), or defined as an average weekly intake of greater than 14 units or an average daily intake of greater than 2 units (females). One unit is equivalent to a halfpint (220mL) of beer or 1 (25ml) measure of spirits or 1 glass (125ml) of wine. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, (except for simple analgesics eg paracetamol), including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol. Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history of regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products prior to screening. The subject is unable to use the novel dry powder inhaler correctly. The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to ipratropium bromide, Tiotropium, atropine and any of its derivatives. Any adverse reaction including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to any β2 agonist or sympathomimetic drug, The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to milk protein or the excipients lactose monohydrate and MgSt.</criteria>
