	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, open-label Phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of intravitreally administered ranibizumab 0.5mg in subjects with Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy experiencing post- Panretinal Photocoagulation (PRP) macular edema.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravitreal Ranibizumab to Treat Macular Edema After Panretinal Photocoagulation (Phase II)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levels of VEGF are elevated in eyes wth Diabetic Macular Edema and the expression of VEGF was found to be elevated temporarily following the photocoagulation of human Retinal Pigment Epithelial (RPE) cells. Ranibizumab (Lucentis TM, Genentech) is an anti-VEGF antibody shown to have properties to prevent macular edema. We hypothesize that VEGF inhibition can effectively treat PRP-induced macular edema, thereby minimizing post-PRP vision loss. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will receive 0.5mg ranibizumab administered 7-14 days post-PRP. Additional intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg of ranibizumab at Day 30 and/or Day 60 may be also be administered. All subjects will be followed for 90 days for safety and efficacy assessments. There is no placebo or sham arm of this trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PrePRP protocol refraction, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography AND 714 day postPRP OCT Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the full duration of the study Age 21 years or older Previously untreated PDR patients with high risk characteristics who develop edema within 714 days post PRP therapy. This edema, determined by a masked investigator, will be characterized as either increased foveal thickness (&gt;10% increase from prePRP foveal thickness), and/or increased macular volume on OCT (&gt;10% increase from prePRP macular volume). Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) prior to enrollment in the study Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated. Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial PrePRP clinically significant diabetic macular edema (CSME) that would make the patient eligible for macular laser prior to PRP Neovascularization of the iris or neovascular glaucoma Increased central foveal thickness for any other reason Concurrent macular diseases that could confound the results of this study Prior vitrectomy in the study eye Prior treatment with intravitreal injection including pegaptanib sodium, ranibizumab, bevacizumab or triamcinolone acetonide</criteria>
