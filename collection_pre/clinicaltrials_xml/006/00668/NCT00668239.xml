	<brief_title>Diffuse Diabetic Maculopathy With Intravitreal Triamcinolone or Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this double blind randomized clinical trial was to compare the treatment of diffuse diabetic macular oedema with intravitreal triamcinolone and laser in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), using a morphofunctional assessment. Patients with clinically significant diffuse macular oedema, previously untreated and with a macular thickness &gt;250 Î¼m at optical coherence tomography (OCT) were randomized for treatment with Laser or intravitreal injection of Triamcinolone acetate. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, fluorescein angiography, tonometry, scotometry, visual acuity and contrast acuities were performed at 0, 1, 3 and 6 months.</detailed_description>
