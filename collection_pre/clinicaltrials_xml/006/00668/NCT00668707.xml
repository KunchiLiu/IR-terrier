	<brief_summary>There is evidence to support the use of melatonin, a natural health product, as an additional treatment aid for cancer patients. This study is designed to see if the daily ingestion of 20 milligrams of melatonin for one year can lower the incidence of developing lung cancer recurrence and/or death. Only patients with a diagnosis of non small cell lung cancer who are eligible for surgical resection can participate in the trial. The study will also be assessing for changes in quality of life, pain, fatigue, anxiety, sleep, and depression amongst the participants.</brief_summary>
