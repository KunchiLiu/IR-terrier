	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess if aprotinin (BAY A0128), given intravenously during surgery, is safe and can help reduce the amount of bleeding and the need for a blood transfusion during hip replacement surgery. Patients undergoing major surgery are at risk for significant blood loss. Because of this, there is a need for drugs that will help slow the amount of bleeding during surgery.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects requiring elective primary total hip replacement surgery Documented, signed, dated informed consent obtained prior to any study specific procedures being performed Subjects with previous exposure to aprotinin in the last 6 months. If the subject has undergone cardiac surgery in the last 6 months, all attempts should be made to ascertain if aprotinin was administered during cardiac surgery. If no records are available, subject should be excluded. If during cardiac surgery in the last 6 months, there is a record of aprotinin administration, subject should be excluded Subjects with a known or suspected allergy to aprotinin Subjects with impaired renal function (serum creatinine &gt; 3.5 mg/dl or 309 micromoles/liter) Subjects with a history of bleeding diathesis or known coagulation factor deficiency Subjects with failure of a major organ system or any active significant medical illness that in the opinion of the investigator is likely to affect the subject's ability to complete the study or precludes the subject's participation in the study Subjects who refuse to receive allogenic blood products for religious or other reasons</criteria>
