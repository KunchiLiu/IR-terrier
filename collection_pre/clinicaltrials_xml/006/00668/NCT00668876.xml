	<brief_title>Effects of Immunonutrition in Patients Undergoing Pancreaticoduodenectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perioperative immunonutrition is reported to improve the incidence of postoperative infectious complication in patients with gastrointestinal surgery. It has also been recognized that Th1/Th2 balance shifts toward Th2 by surgical stress. On the other hand, the change of Th17 status after surgery has not been established. Furthermore, The change of Th1/Th2 balance and Th17 status with immunonutrition on pancreaticoduodenectomy have not been reported yet. Objective of this study is to investigate the effects of perioperative immunonutrition on incidence of postoperative infectious complication, Th1/Th2 balance and Th17 status after pancreaticoduodenectomy.</detailed_description>
