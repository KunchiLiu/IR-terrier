	<brief_title>Antioxidant Effects of Pomegranate Juice Versus Placebo in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study will evaluate how pomegranate juice (or a placebo juice) affects the body. Participants will be asked to drink 8 oz. of juice daily for 12 weeks. Biomarkers, which are indicators of health, will be measured throughout the study. They are present in blood and urine. The placebo is a juice that is not made from pomegranates, but resembles pomegranate juice in color and taste. Eating pomegranates has been shown to have a positive impact on certain biomarkers. Recent studies have shown that biomarkers can be indicators of general health. The investigators want to know if drinking pomegranate juice daily for 12 weeks is effective at improving a variety of biomarkers in diabetic adults.</detailed_description>
