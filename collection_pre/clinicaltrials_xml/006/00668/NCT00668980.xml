	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to characterize the process of constitution of symbolic representation in infants with Down syndrome, as well as to investigate the relationship between gestures and the emergence of oral language. The investigators hypothesis is that children with Down syndrome could present difficulties during the constitution of symbolic representation that may be related to later deficits on expressive language, generally observed in these children.</brief_summary>
