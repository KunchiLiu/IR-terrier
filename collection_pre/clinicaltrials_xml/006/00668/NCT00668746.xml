	<brief_title>Long-term Safety of Minocycline in Patients With Gum Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate the changes in populations of minocycline-resistant bacteria after long-term use of minocycline HCl microspheres, 1 mg in subjects with moderate-to-severe chronic periodontitis. This will be assessed through monitoring the total number and proportion of minocycline-resistant bacteria and the identity of minocycline-resistant species within a panel of 40 representative periodontal species in saliva and subgingival plaque.</detailed_description>
