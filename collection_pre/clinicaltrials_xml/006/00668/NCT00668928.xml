	<brief_summary>A large and growing segment of the population is prediabetic. Dietary interventions that improve insulin sensitivity may be important in preventing the progression to full-blown diabetes in these individuals. Foods and dietary compounds that increase insulin sensitivity are likely to help maintain a healthier body composition. This pilot study will provide data to evaluate the role of dietary plant polyphenols in improving insulin sensitivity.</brief_summary>
