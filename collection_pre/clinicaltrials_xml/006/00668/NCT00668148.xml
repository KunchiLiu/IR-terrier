	<brief_summary>This multicenter study will enroll approximately 185 participants with metastatic or advanced sarcoma, to assess the effectiveness and safety of IMC-A12 monotherapy for this indication. Participants will be stratified into five tiers according to diagnosis: 1. Ewing's sarcoma/PNET 2. rhabdomyosarcoma 3. leiomyosarcoma 4. adipocytic sarcoma 5. synovial sarcoma. A total of 85 patients will be enrolled initially, 17 in each tier. Participants will receive single agent IMC-A12 every 2 weeks. A treatment cycle will be defined as 6 weeks, with radiological evaluation every cycle. Safety and response in the initial 17 patients in each tier will be used to determine whether to extend enrollment to the target total of 37 patients per tier.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the progression-free survival (PFS) rate assessed 12 weeks after the initiation of IMC-A12 monotherapy, administered every 2 weeks to participants with previously-treated, advanced or metastatic soft tissue and Ewing's sarcoma/PNET.</detailed_description>
