	<brief_summary>Following a radical prostatectomy and lymph node sampling, eligible patients will undergo post-operative radiation therapy, concurrent weekly docetaxel chemotherapy , and hormonal therapy (Casodex daily and Zoladex every 3 months for 2 times or Lupron 22.5 mg im every 3 months for 2 times).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Radiation Therapy, Hormonal Therapy and Concurrent Docetaxel for High Risk Pathologic T2-T3N0 Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the safety and feasibility of combining post-operative radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy (6 months) and concurrent docetaxel in men with high risk pathologic T2-3N0 prostate cancer after a radical prostatectomy. To obtain preliminary information regarding the efficacy of combining weekly docetaxel with adjuvant radiation therapy and hormonal therapy in men with high risk pathologic T2-3N0 prostate cancer by determining PSA failure free survival. To assess baseline and longitudinal changes in health-related quality of life outcomes during and after therapy (at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Only those patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate who have undergone a radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node sampling and found to have high risk nonmetastatic disease with undetectable, persistent or decreasing postoperative PSA levels, or who have subsequently experienced a rise in PSA, will be eligible for the trial as described below in the inclusion and exclusion criteria Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Status post radical prostatectomy with sampling of the pelvic lymph nodes with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, with the patients falling into either the "adjuvant high risk group" or the "salvage high risk group" as follows: a) "Adjuvant High Risk Group" (undetectable, persistent or decreasing PSA levels before starting therapy) who have NO evidence of metastatic disease (i.e. no clinical symptoms or radiologic evidence) who MUST be able to start RT treatments within 6 months of radical prostatectomy with at least one of the 3 disease features: 1. Pathologic T2N0 disease with positive margins and Gleason score ≥8, or 2. Pathologic T3aN0disease with extracapsular extension and Gleason Score ≥ 8, or 3. Pathologic T3bN0disease with any Gleason Score b) "Salvage High Risk Group" are those patients with PSA biochemical failure defined by 2 consecutive increases over baseline PSA levels at least one month apart, who have NO other evidence of metastatic disease (i.e. no clinical symptoms or radiologic evidence), and WITH AT LEAST ONE of the high risk disease features as defined below: 1. Pathologic T3bN0 disease with any Gleason score, or 2. Pathologic T23aN0 disease with Gleason score ≥ 8, 3. Pathologic T23aN0 disease with PSA doubling time ≤10 months, or 4. Pathologic T23aN0 disease with Preradiation therapy PSA level ≥1.0 ng/ml Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy prior to radical prostatectomy is allowed, and postprostatectomy hormonal therapy is allowed as long as it is not within 6 months of protocol treatment No prior chemotherapy, or pelvic irradiation Karnofsky Performance Status ≥70 Hematologic parameters must be within the following limits: WBC ≥ 3,000 Platelet Count ≥ 130,000/ mm3 Hemoglobin level ≥ 11.0 g/dl Creatinine ≤ 2.5 g/dl Normal liver function defined as the following: Total bilirubin below the upper limit of normal AND AST, ALT, and Alkaline Phosphatase must be within a defined range of eligibility as noted below: Alkaline Phosphatase ≤ ULN eligible &gt; 1x but ≤1.5x ULN eligible &gt; 2.5x but ≤ 5x ULN eligible &gt; 5x ULN ineligible AST or ALT ≤ ULN eligible &gt; 1x but ≤1.5x ULN eligible &gt; 2.5x but ≤ 5x ULN ineligible &gt; 5x ULN ineligible Patients with a history of an invasive malignancy within the last 5 years are not eligible for the protocol; patients who are NED from a prior invasive malignancy for at least 5 years or longer are eligible for the trial. Patients with history of benign tumors such as a pituitary macroadenomas, meningiomas, or craniopharyngiomas are eligible as long as the benign tumor is under local control regardless of the time frame. Patients with concurrent adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin are also eligible for the protocol. Patients must be informed of the investigative nature of the treatment, must give appropriate informed consent to protocol procedures and must sign an Informed Consent Documentation Form. Must not have concomitant medical, psychological or social circumstances which would interfere with compliance with the protocol treatment and followup. Age ≥ 18 years Men of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective contraception while on treatment and for a reasonable period thereafter, which should be for at least 6 months after the completion of protocol therapy Patients who have received prior chemotherapy, pelvic irradiation or postprostatectomy androgen ablation within 6 months of protocol therapy. Any coexisting medical condition precluding full compliance with the study. Patients with active infections or known infection with HIV. Psychological, familiar, sociological or geographical conditions which would not permit compliance with the study protocol. Known contraindication to dexamethasone (allergic reaction or systemic fungal infection) Preexisting Grade ≥ 1 peripheral neuropathy Patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to products containing Polysorbate 80 (Tween 80)</criteria>
