	<brief_summary>This is a single institution phase I / II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of URLC10-177 and TTK-567 emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 in combination with different doses of CpG7909 in patients with advanced or recurrent esophageal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PhaseⅠ/Ⅱ Study of URLC10-177 and TTK-567 Peptide Vaccine Combined With CpG7909 in Patients With Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>phase I: Patients will be vaccinated on day 1,8,15 and 22 of each 28-day treatment cycles. On each vaccination day, the URLC10-117 peptide(1mg) and TTK-567 peptide(1mg) mixed with CpG 7909 (escalating doses: 0, 0.02, 0.1mg/kg) emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 will be administered by subcutaneous injection. Repeated cycles of vaccine will be administered until patients develop progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, or for maximum 2 cycles, whichever occurs first. In this phase I study, we evaluate the safety and tolerability of URLC10-177, TTK-567 and different doses of CpG7909 to determine the recommended phase II dose of CpG7909. phase II: Patients will be vaccinated on day 1,8,15 and 22 of each 28-day treatment cycles. On each vaccination day, the URLC10-117 peptide(1mg) and TTK-567 peptide(1mg) mixed with CpG 7909 (recommended dose determined in phase I study) emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 will be administered by subcutaneous injection. Repeated cycles of vaccine will be administered for 2 cycles. In this phase II study, we evaluate the efficacy of this vaccine therapy.</detailed_description>
