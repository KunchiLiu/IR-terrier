	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the safety of 100 mg carboplatin administered intraductally once on Day 1 or twice on Days 1 and 15 in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) undergoing surgical management 2 to 4 weeks following the Day 15 intraductal infusion. Secondary objectives are to characterize the biologic and clinical effects with respect to: pharmacokinetics, extent of disease on MRI and mammogram, histopathological assessment of DCIS, and biomarker measurement of Ki-67, TUNEL and G-actin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Of Intraductal Carboplatin In Women With Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, 3-arm, saline-controlled study involving women undergoing surgical management of DCIS. Forty-five (45) women who have been diagnosed with DCIS by core biopsy will receive intraductal administration of either carboplatin or normal saline (NS) into the DCIS-involved breast duct. Thirty (30) patients (i.e., 15 patients per arm) will receive two intraductal infusions of either 100 mg of carboplatin or NS on Days 1 and 15. Fifteen (15) patients will receive an intraductal infusion of 100 mg carboplatin on Day 1 and an intraductal infusion of NS on Day 15. Patients will undergo surgical resection 2 to 4 weeks following the Day 15 intraductal infusion (i.e. 4 to 6 weeks from diagnosis). The effect of carboplatin on DCIS in the pre-treatment core biopsy specimen and the resection specimen will be assessed. Venous blood samples will be collected for carboplatin PK analysis pre-dose and at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours following intraductal infusions on Days 1 and 15.</detailed_description>
