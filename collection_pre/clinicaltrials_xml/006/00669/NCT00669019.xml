	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well saracatinib works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Saracatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Saracatinib in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether the Src kinase inhibitor, AZD0530 (saracatinib), has single agent clinical activity in patients with advanced melanoma. II. To determine whether this drug will increase progression-free survival of these patients from 3 months to 4.5 months. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether this drug may inhibit the activation of peripheral blood T cells analyzed ex vivo. OUTLINE: Patients receive saracatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
