	<brief_summary>The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of Atorvastatin on the endothelial function improvement during the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) after 3 months of treatment, by a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center study. An interim analysis will be performed when 25 patients per group will be included.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives of this clinical trial : - To evaluate the effect of Atorvastatin in comparison with the placebo on the inflammation occurring during OSAS, after 3 months of treatment. - To evaluate the effect of Atorvastatin in comparison with the placebo on the insulin-resistance associated to OSAS, after 3 months of treatment. - To evaluate the effect of Atorvastatin in comparison with the placebo on the hypercholesterolemia associated to OSAS, after 3 months of treatment. - To evaluate at 6 months, the effect of the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) + Atorvastatin association on the previously cited parameters, in comparison with Atorvastatin, CPAP and placebo. - To measure the CPAP efficiency in comparison with sham CPAP in patients receiving the placebo, after 3 months of treatment.</detailed_description>
