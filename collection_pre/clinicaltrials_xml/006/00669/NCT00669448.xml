	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES The objective is to evaluate the effect of an 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) programme on psychological - and somatic symptoms, and illness perceptions in individuals with self- reported multiple chemical sensitivities. PARTICIPANTS Participants will be recruited among respondents to a survey on the consequences of self-reported symptoms related to inhalation of airborne chemicals conducted by the Danish Research Centre for Chemical Sensitivities. DESIGN The pilot trial is designed as a randomized trial on the effect of MBCT versus treatment as usual. INTERVENTION The MBCT programme includes 2½ hours of group training at the Psychiatric Centre, Rigshospitalet once a week for 8 weeks. Furthermore participants are encouraged to practice at home for up to 45 min per day, 6 days a week during the entire course. OUTCOME MEASURES Effect of MBCT will be estimated from individual scores on psychometric scales</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Trial on Effect of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy for Individuals With Multiple Chemical Sensitivities (MCS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Multiple chemical sensitivities is a collective term used to describe illness from exposure to common environ-mental agents. A recent Danish population-based cross sectional study reported that 27% of the respondents reported various symptoms from exposure to common environmental agents. In 19% of the respondents symptoms had led to behavioral changes and in 3.3% of the respondents to adjustments in either social life or occupational conditions, and in 0.5% to adjustments in both social life and occupational conditions. Multiple chemical sensitivities is not acknowledged as a clinical diagnose in Denmark and the Danish Healthcare System has no clinical guidelines for management of people who report this type of illness. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effect of an 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) programme on psychological - and somatic symptoms, and illness perceptions in individuals with self- reported multiple chemical sensitivities. PARTICIPANTS Participants will be recruited among respondents to a survey on the consequences of self-reported symptoms related to inhalation of airborne chemicals conducted by the Danish Research Centre for Chemical Sensitives. DESIGN The pilot trial is designed as a randomized trial on the effect of MBCT versus treatment as usual. Eligible participants (n= 42) stratified by occupational status (e.g. employed/not employed) will be randomized to either intervention (MBCT) or treatment as usual. INTERVENTION The MBCT programme includes 2½ hours of group training at the Psychiatric Centre, Rigshospitalet once a week for 8 weeks. Furthermore participants are encouraged to practice at home for up to 45 min per day, 6 days a week during the entire course. OUTCOME MEASURES Effect of MBCT will be estimated from individual scores on the following psychometric scales: Symptom-Check List-92, The Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale-10 and The Subjective Health Complaints-inventory. Estimations will be carried out at baseline, four weeks after start of MBCT programme, eight weeks after start of MBCT programme, and three months after ending the MBCT programme.</detailed_description>
