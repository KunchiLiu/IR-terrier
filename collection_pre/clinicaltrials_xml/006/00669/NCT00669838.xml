	<brief_title>Anesthesia for Dental Treatment in Cardiac Patients: Lidocaine Comparative Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with valvular disease constitute a group in which local anesthesia must be effective to avoid higher release of endogenous catecholamines that could trigger hemodynamic. The study was conducted in the Dental Department of the Instituto do Coração do Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (Brazil). Patients were allocated into two groups through an aleatory numbered table: PL (plain 2% lidocaine, n= 31) and LE (2% lidocaine with 1:100.000 epinephrine, n= 28). The anesthetic amount was registered. DIXTAL monitor (São Paulo- Brazil) captured blood pressure, heart rate, oxygenation and electrocardiogram records.</detailed_description>
