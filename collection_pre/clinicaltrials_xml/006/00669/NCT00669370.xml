	<brief_title>Biweekly Docetaxel in Combination With Capecitabine as First-Line Treatment in Patients With Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GAST-TaxXel is an open, phase II, single arm, non-randomized, Finnish multicenter trial. At least 50 subjects will be enrolled. Primary endpoint: To determine the quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22) in patients with gastric cancer who receive combination treatment with Taxotere and Xeloda. Secondary endpoint: To evaluate time to progression (TTP), overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Quality of life: to evaluate that QOL does not deteriorate from baseline. Quality of life is measured using EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22 with physical functioning score as the primary variable. Efficacy: time to progression, overall response rate, overall survival Time to progression is defined as time elapsed from inclusion to first documented progression or death whatever the reason. Overall response rate is assessed according to the RECIST criteria. Overall survival is defined as time elapsed from inclusion to death. Safety: clinical and laboratory toxicities or symptomatology will be graded according to NCI-CTC criteria. Statistical considerations: The primary variable, physical functioning score measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22 instrument, will be analyzed using a paired t-test (change from baseline after two treatment cycles). A 95% confidence interval will also be calculated for the primary variable. Median TTP and OS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The ORR will be summarized. Safety variables will be summarized descriptively.</detailed_description>
