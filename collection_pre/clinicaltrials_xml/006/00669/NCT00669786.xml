	<brief_summary>A randomized controlled trial comparing the ongoing pregnancy rate (primary end-point) in 280 patients undergoing IVF/ICSI after stimulation with hp-hMG or rFSH controlled with a GnRH antagonist. Non significant differences were observed between hp-hMG and rFSH in terms of the ongoing pregnancy rate per started cycle (35.0% vs. 32.1%; p=0.61); R.R: 1.09 (95% CI: 0.78-1.51; Risk Difference: 2.9%). No differences were observed for implantation, clinical pregnancy and pregnancy loss rates. Patients receiving rFSH obtained more oocytes (14.4 ± 8.1 vs. 11.3 ± 6.0; p=0.001). Estradiol was higher at the end of stimulation in the hp-hMG group, while Progesterone was higher in patients stimulated with rFSH.</brief_summary>
