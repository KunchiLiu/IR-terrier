	<brief_summary>Autologous stem cells may improve myocardial regeneration after intracoronary administration in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The primary hypothesis of this prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial is that the increase of ejection fraction determined by magnetic resonance imaging between baseline and 6 months follow-up is superior in active treated patients compared to patients receiving placebo. The study includes an integrated pilot phase of 40 patients for evaluation of left ventricular ejection fraction determined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Based on the data of this analysis the final sample size will be calculated. The primary endpoint is the improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction with an assumed 2.5% higher improvement in the cell treated population compared to the placebo treated group.</brief_summary>
