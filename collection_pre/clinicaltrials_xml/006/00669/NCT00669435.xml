	<brief_summary>Angiotensin II has been proposed as a lipid metabolism regulator. It is known that adipocytes secrete a variety of protein, such as TNFÎ±, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, leptin, resistin and adiponectin; these proteins have a wide range of biological effects and are associated with insulin resistance. Adipocytes also produce angiotensinogen and angiotensin II and a local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is present in adipose tissue. In overweight or obese hypertensive normocholesterolemic patients the treatment with AT1-receptor blocker (Losartan) may have a better effect on hepatic steatosis and visceral fat deposition than the antihypertensive treatment with calcium channel blocker (amlodipine). Simvastatin will be added to both groups. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of losartan and simvastatin on ultrasonographic qualitative and quantitative parameters in overweight or obese hypertensive normocholesterolemic patients with hepatic steatosis.</brief_summary>
