	<brief_summary>T-wave alternans is a test that looks at microvolt changes in the T-wave on a beat to beat basis. The presence or absence of such changes has been shown to predict or exclude future arrhythmic events. The mechanism of T-wave alternans is unclear, but may relate to calcium metabolism in the heart, and may be affected by conditions such as ischemia or heart failure. The purpose of this study is to determine whether T-wave alternans, as measured through the lead of an implantable defibrillator, is produced by acute ischemia induced by occlusion during percutaneous coronary interventions.</brief_summary>
