	<brief_summary>The POST study comprised patients whose data were entered into the NRMI 4 and 5 databases. NRMI is a prospective, observational study of patients presenting with AMI in the United States. NRMI was launched in 1990 and to date has enrolled more than 2.5 million AMI patients. More than 1,700 hospitals have participated in NRMI during the last 16 years. The NRMI 4 and 5 substudies were sponsored by Genentech and collected data on approximately 160,000 AMI patients (both ST elevation and non-ST-elevation MI) hospitalized in the United States each year. This corresponds to approximately 18% of the AMI patients in the United States.</brief_summary>
