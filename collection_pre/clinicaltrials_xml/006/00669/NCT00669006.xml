	<brief_summary>To establish the infrastructure for a national neuropathic pain database. To determine the longterm outcome of the management of chronic neuropathic pain including pain relief, disability, and quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuropathic Pain Database</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The database will provide standard information on demographics, diagnosis, treatment interventions and outcome modeled on guidelines from the expert panel on initiatives on Methods, Measurement and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT)(Turk et al.,Pain 2003;106:337-345) The IMMPACT panel determined that patients should be evaluated according to six core domains as follows: Pain, physical functioning, emotional functioning, subject rating of global satisfaction with treatment, symptoms and adverse events and subject disposition. The database will allow us to examine outcomes based on single (eg. pregabalin) and multiple (e.g tricyclic antidepressants and gabalin) therapeutic interventions. Standard guidelines for management of neuropathic pain acknowledge that polypharmacy is appropriate when individual first line treatments fail to provide adequate pain relief (Gilron I et al., CMAJ 2006; 175: 265-275; Attal N et al., European Journal of Neurology 2006; 13: 1153-1169)</detailed_description>
