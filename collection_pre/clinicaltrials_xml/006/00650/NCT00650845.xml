	<brief_summary>Although there is a well documented risk of acute renal failure with the iodinated contrast agents, the implication of intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agents in nephrotoxicity remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety profile of gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem®) in patients with chronic renal insufficiency by evaluating the rate of patients experiencing contrast-induced nephrotoxicity following the injection of gadoterate meglumine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Renal Safety Evaluation After Dotarem®-Enhanced MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with renal insufficiency not requiring hemodialysis and scheduled to undergo a contrast enhanced MRI or unenhanced MRI examination to specify a diagnosis, were selected for inclusion. Two groups of patients were defined on the basis of the planned imaging procedure selected to obtain a diagnosis: those undergoing a Dotarem®-enhanced MRI and those undergoing an unenhanced MRI. A clinically significant increase in serum creatinine levels after the contrast-enhanced MRI exam was used as an indication of contrast induced nephrotoxicity. A blood test was performed 24h before the MRI in order to evaluate baseline creatinine values. 72h after the exam, a second blood test was performed. An increase in creatinemia above 25% from baseline levels was defined as a contrast-induced nephrotoxic reaction. The primary endpoint of the study assessed the percentage of patients presenting a contrast-induced nephrotoxic reaction in order to show a non inferiority of enhanced as compared to non-enhanced MRI exams.</detailed_description>
