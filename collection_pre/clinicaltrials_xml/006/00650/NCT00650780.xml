	<brief_summary>We have just completed a randomized, clinical trial of 100,000 IU Vitamin D3 given as a single dose at the beginning of winter. We found a wide range of responses to the dose. This study proposes that genetic differences account for some of the variation in response of 25(OH)D levels after treatment with oral Vitamin D.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Binding Protein (Gc) Allele Variation Effects Response to Vitamin D Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We suspect that the wide range of response is effected by other factors such as variation in Vitamin D binding protein (the major transporter of Vitamin D metabolites). Gc, also known as Vitamin D binding protein (DBP), group specific component, or Gc globulin, is a 52-58 kDa multifunctional plasma protein, synthesized in the liver. The gene encoding for Gc is located on chromosome 4, and three common co-dominant alleles give rise to three phenotypes (Gc1s, Gc1f, and Gc2). Gc binds actin, recruits neutrophil leukocytes and converts into a macrophage- and osteoclast- activating factor. It also is the major transporter of Vitamin D and its' metabolites. Lauridsen et al. showed that Gc phenotype correlates with 25(OH)D levels in a group of postmenopausal women. This study proposes that Gc phenotype accounts for some of the variation in response of 25(OH)D levels after treatment with oral Vitamin D.</detailed_description>
