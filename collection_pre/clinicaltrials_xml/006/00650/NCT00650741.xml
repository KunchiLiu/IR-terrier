	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the Endotect compared with an ultrasound device in a flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) test.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a New Non-Invasive Device for Detection of Endothelial Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study compares the results obtained with Endotect with the results obtained from a brachial ultrasound FMD test, with and without nitroglycerin. The results from 3 patient groups (see below) will be compared 1: 10 subjects, Half with Endothelial Dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound FMD) , Half with no endothelial dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound FMD), no repetition of test 2: 10 subjects, Half with Endothelial Dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound FMD) , Half with no endothelial dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound FMD), Repetition with Nitroglycerin 3: 10 subjects, Half with Endothelial Dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound FMD) , Half with no endothelial dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound FMD), repetition of test with the Endotect</detailed_description>
