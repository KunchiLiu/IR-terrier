	<brief_summary>1. Assess whether excimer laser coronary atherectomy (ELCA) before direct infarct-related artery (IRA) stenting results in improved reperfusion success in patients presenting with acute ST wave elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and angiographically evident thrombus. 2. Validate an ELCA technique for the treatment of STEMI, at high-volume centers experienced in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).</brief_summary>
