	<brief_summary>Trial design: This Phase III, investigator-driven, randomised, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study will compare the effects of Sitagliptin in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (Lenograstim, G-CSF) on the improvement of myocardial function in patients undergoing routine percutaneous coronary revascularisation for acute myocardial infarction (time from onset of infarction to intervention 2 to 24 hours). The primary objective of this study is to compare between a treatment of G-CSF plus Sitagliptin, (G-CSF/Sitagliptin treatment group, n=87) versus Placebo (control treatment group, n=87) in change of global myocardial function from baseline to 6 months of follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The trial will be conducted as a multi-centre trial. Secondary objectives of this study are to monitor changes of regional myocardial function, myocardial perfusion and extent of non-viable myocardium from baseline to 6 months after revascularisation between the treatment groups. Furthermore the following parameters over up to 12 months of follow-up are analysed: occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, coronary bypass grafting, or re-intervention), spontaneously reported adverse events. Analyses of cardiac function consists of evaluation of segmental systolic wall thickening, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume, ejection fraction and cardiac output by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The extent of non-viable myocardium and myocardial perfusion will be assessed using contrast enhanced MRI. This study consists of a revascularisation period (angioplasty of the infarcted vessel), a treatment period (up to 28 days), and a follow-up period (up to 12 months). The Revascularisation Period starts with the treatment of the patient in the emergency room. As soon as possible the patient will be transferred to the catheterisation laboratory where acute percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the infarct-related artery will be performed. The first phase of the Treatment Period consists of a screening period during which a patient's eligibility is preliminarily evaluated. The second phase of the Treatment Period is the randomisation for patients in the control or G-CSF/Sitagliptin treatment group. After baseline MRI, patients are randomised. Patients will be treated either with G-CSF (10Âµg/kg/d divided in two doses subcutaneously) over a period of 5 days and Sitagliptin 100 mg each day for 28 days or with placebo. Patients will be randomised in 1:1 ratio to the control and verum therapy treatment groups. Follow-up Period assessments will be performed in all patients at 6 months including clinical status, occurrence of adverse events, laboratory investigations, and MRI. To assess occurrence of in-stent restenosis, routine control angiography will be performed in all patients 6 months after initial PCI. Safety will be evaluated by monitoring treatment-emergent signs and symptoms, 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, physical examination, and clinical laboratory assessments after 1 month and 1 year.</detailed_description>
