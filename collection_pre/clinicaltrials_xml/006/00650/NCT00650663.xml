	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether coadministration of ezetimibe 10 mg/day with simvastatin 20 mg/day for 12 weeks will result in greater reduction of LDL-C, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), non HDL-C, and apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and greater increase in HDL-C, compared with simvastatin 20 mg/day as monotherapy for 12 weeks in African-American subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia. This study is being performed to better define the efficacy of ezetimibe coadministered with simvastatin in this population.</brief_summary>
