	<brief_title>A 52-week, Open-label Extension Study Following a 6-week, Double-blind, Placebo- and Active- Controlled Study (R076477-SCH-303) to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Paliperidone ER in Subjects With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 52-week, open-label extension study followed a 6-week, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study (R076477-SCH-303) and was conducted at 52 sites in 11 countries. The primary objective of the open-label extension was the long-term assessment of safety and tolerability of flexibly-dosed ER OROS® paliperidone. The secondary objective was the assessment of long-term efficacy expressed as a function of change in the total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score, effect on positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia by means of change in PANSS factor scores, and personal and social functioning, overall functioning, and quality of life parameters as measured by Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP), Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity (CGI-S), and Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale (SQLS), respectively. Subjects in the open-label phase received flexibly dosed ER OROS® paliperidone (3 mg to 12 mg/day) for 52 weeks</detailed_description>
