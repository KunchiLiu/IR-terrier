	<brief_summary>The standard imaging procedure to diagnose a nasal fracture still is radiography (lateral nasal view and occipitomental view). But technological advances in ultrasonography during the last few decades have made high-resolution ultrasound devices available to the majority of medical centers. It has been shown that the bony structures of the nose can be well examined by ultrasound in the last few years. The hypothesis: "Is ultrasound of equal diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing nasal fractures as radiography" is being tested in the investigators' study. Patients with suspected nasal fracture undergo ultrasound examination in addition to the routine x-ray imaging. After completion of treatment, the readings of both ultrasound and radiographs are compared in terms of sensitivity and specificity to diagnose nasal fractures.</brief_summary>
