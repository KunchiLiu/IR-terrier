	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to compare the adhesive quality of the current Mylan estradiol placebo transdermal system, with that of an alternate second generation Mylan estradiol placebo transdermal system following a single system application. As a secondary objective, primary dermal irritation was assessed after removal of each transdermal system.</brief_summary>
