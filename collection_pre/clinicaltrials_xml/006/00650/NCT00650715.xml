	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute and chronic effect of whole-body vibration exercise on serum insulin-like growth factor-1 levels in women with fibromyalgia (FM). It was hypothesized that women with FM would exhibit an increase in IGF-1 following both acute and chronic WBV. Twenty-four women with FM were randomized into two groups: Vibration Group (VG) and Control Group (CG). The VG underwent a protocol with WBV exercise twice a week for a total of six weeks, whereas the CG performed the same protocol without vibratory stimulus. Both groups continued with their usual pharmacological treatment. Serum IGF-1 levels were determined using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). To test the effect of chronic WBV, serum IGF-1 measurements were taken at baseline and at weeks 1,3, and 6 of intervention. To test the effect of acute WBV, within week 1, serum IGF-1 measurements were taken before and immediately following a session of WBV.</brief_summary>
