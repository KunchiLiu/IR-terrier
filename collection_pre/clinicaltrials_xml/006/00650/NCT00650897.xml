	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Escitalopram for Depression in Patients With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depression is common in patients diabetes (point prevalence about 15-20%). It has been shown that patients with diabetic and major depression experience more severe diabetes symptoms, greater disability, more frequent medical complications, greater healthcare utilization costs, poorer glycemic control, and greater difficulties with diabetes self-care activities, compared with patients with diabetes without depression. Few specific features of Escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), make it a promising medication for use in diabetes. These include a benign side effect profile; high tolerance in elderly patients; rapid action with efficacy often demonstrated in as little 1-2 weeks, which in turn could help improve compliance; its efficacy for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, which may also be relatively common in patients with diabetes, and co-occurs frequently with depression. This study is designed to test the efficacy of Escitalopram for the treatment of major depression in patients with diabetes mellitus.</detailed_description>
