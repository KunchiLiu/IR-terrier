	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if Lupron (leuprolide acetate) is safe and effective in treating children with Central Precocious Puberty (CPP), and to assess long term effects of leuprolide acetate treatment after therapy is discontinued.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Lupron Depot In The Treatment of Central Precocious Puberty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study includes a Prestudy Period; a treatment period where subjects will receive treatment every 4 weeks until the initiation of puberty (age 12 for males and age 11 for females); a follow-up period where subjects will be observed every 6 months until physical and laboratory observations are at pubertal levels, then every 12 months for 5 years; lastly a final follow-up questionnaire is given to all subjects when they are at least 18 years old. At the treatment visits, efficacy assessments are Tanner staging (suppression of breast development in females and genital development in males), gonadotropins (LH and FSH), sex steroids (estradiol in females and testosterone in males), ratio of bone age to chronological age, adult height compared to a standard population and predicted mature height, and age and time to regular menses in females. This protocol will also capture data from the final questionnaire about female reproductive status at adulthood including the presence of regular menses and number of pregnancies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of isosexual central precocious puberty with onset of Tanner scores of Stage II for breast or pubic hair earlier than age 8.0 years in girls or Stage II for pubic hair or genitalia earlier than 9.0 years in boys. Confirmation of diagnosis by a pubertal response to a gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test (LH &gt; 10 U/L at baseline). Chronological age less than 9.0 years in girls or less than 10.0 years in boys at time of first dosing. Bone age advanced at least 1 year beyond the chronological age at entry into the study. The condition may be idiopathic or secondary to another lesion. If secondary, therapy of the primary condition will have been undertaken and stabilized. No evidence of abnormal pituitary, adrenal, thyroid and gonadal function except for premature secretion of gonadotropins. Irradiation to the central nervous system. Prior therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate and/or with any GnRH analog (including prior treatment with daily subcutaneous and depot formulations of leuprolide acetate).</criteria>
