	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to conduct a 12-month randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of strength and impact exercise training to flexibility/relaxation training on body composition (bone, muscle and fat mass), physical function (strength, gait, power, balance and self-report physical function and symptoms) in men currently treated with hormone therapy for prostate cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer survivors with advanced disease are commonly treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to reduce testosterone. Serious side effects of ADT are rapid bone and muscle loss that can lead to osteoporosis and declines in neuromuscular function (strength, power, gait and balance) which increases the risk of fracture and falls (a risk factor for fracture) and impairs physical function. Men on ADT are 1.4 times more likely to fracture compared with their cancer-free peers and those who fracture have a poorer prognosis than those who do not. Self-report physical function is also lower among men on ADT. Exercise can prevent bone loss, neuromuscular declines and falls in several populations. However, the ability of exercise to prevent bone loss from ADT has not been tested, while data on exercise and neuromuscular function (strength only) in this population are limited to one published trial. The long-term goal of our research is to improve musculoskeletal health and function in cancer survivors. Critical first steps to meet this goal are to determine whether our previously tested program of impact and resistance exercise, shown to improve bone health and neuromuscular function in women, can prevent bone loss and neuromuscular declines in prostate cancer survivors on ADT. Based on our previous research, we have developed the Prevent Osteoporosis With Impact + Resistance (POWIR) program to be adapted to clinical populations at risk for bone loss and declines in neuromuscular function. Potentially, POWIR could mitigate bone and muscle losses from ADT, and thereby lower fracture risk and improve quality of life.</detailed_description>
