	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as tegafur-uracil, leucovorin, and S-1, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving tegafur-uracil together with leucovorin is more effective than giving S-1 in treating patients with stage III colon cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving tegafur-uracil together with leucovorin to see how well it works compared with giving S-1 in treating patients with stage III colon cancer that has been completely removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tegafur-Uracil and Leucovorin or S-1 in Treating Patients With Stage III Colon Cancer That Has Been Completely Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the disease-free survival of patients with stage III colon cancer treated with S-1 or tegafur-uracil and leucovorin after curative surgery . OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral tegafur-uracil and oral leucovorin 3 times daily on days 1-21. The treatment repeats 5 times every 5 weeks. - Arm II: Patients receive oral S-1 twice daily on days 1-28. The treatment repeats 4 times every 6 weeks. Biological samples are collected for gene expression analysis for identification of predictive markers.</detailed_description>
