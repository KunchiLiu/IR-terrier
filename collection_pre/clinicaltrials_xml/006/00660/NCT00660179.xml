	<brief_summary>The AC-055-302/SERAPHIN study will be an event-driven Phase III study, comparing two different doses of macitentan (ACT-064992) (3 and 10 mg) vs placebo in patients with symptomatic PAH. The main study objective is to demonstrate that macitentan (ACT-064992) prolongs time to the first morbidity or mortality event, and to evaluate the benefit/risk profile of macitentan (ACT-064992) in the treatment of patients with symptomatic PAH.</brief_summary>

PAH associated with non corrected simple congenital systemictopulmonary shunts, and combined and complex systemictopulmonary shunts, corrected or non corrected. 3. PAH associated with significant venous or capillary involvement (PCWP &gt; 15 mmHg), known pulmonary venoocclusive disease, and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. 4. Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. 5. Pulmonary Hypertension belonging to groups 2 to 5 of the Venice classification. 6. Moderate to severe obstructive lung disease: forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) &lt; 70% and FEV1 &lt; 65% of predicted value after bronchodilator administration. 7. Moderate to severe restrictive lung disease: total lung capacity (TLC) &lt; 60% of predicted value. 8. Moderate to severe hepatic impairment, i.e., ChildPugh Class B or C. 9. Estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min 10. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. 11. Hemoglobin &lt; 75% of the lower limit of the normal range. 12. Systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mmHg. 13. Acute or chronic physical impairment (other than dyspnea), limiting the ability to comply with study requirements. 14. Pregnant or breastfeeding. 15. Known concomitant lifethreatening disease with a life expectancy &lt; 12 months. 16. Body weight &lt; 40 kg. 17. Any condition that prevents compliance with the protocol or adherence to therapy. 18. Recently started (&lt; 8 weeks prior to randomization) or planned cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program based on exercise. 19. Treatment with endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) within 3 months prior to randomization. 20. Systemic treatment within 4 week prior to randomization with cyclosporine A or tacrolimus, everolimus, sirolimus (calcineurin or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors). 21. Treatment with cytochrome P3A (CYP3A) inducers within 4 weeks prior to randomization 22. Known hypersensitivity to drugs of the same class as the study drug, or any of their excipients. 23. Planned treatment, or treatment, with another investigational drug within 1 month prior to randomization.</criteria>
