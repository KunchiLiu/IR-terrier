	<criteria>1. Histological Diagnosis: Patients must have a histological or cytological proven advanced gastrointestinal or other solid malignancy. 2. Measurable or Evaluable Disease: See RECIST Criteria: www.cancer.gov/dip/RECIST 3. Age: Patients must be 18 years old or older. Because no dosing or toxicity data are currently available on the use of oxaliplatin in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for other pediatric Phase I singleagent trials, when available. 4. Performance Status: NCI CTC 02. 5. Life Expectancy: &gt;=8 weeks. 6. Recovery from Prior Therapy: Patients must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study and must be without significant systemic illness (e.g. infection). No chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be given within 3 weeks prior to the start of protocol treatment. Patients must have received &lt;= 2 prior chemotherapy regimes. 7. Recovery from Intercurrent Illness: Patients must have recovered from uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia. 8. Hematological Status: Patients must have adequate bone marrow function which is defined as an absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mm³, platelet count &gt;= 100,000/mm³ and hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dl. 9. Hepatic Function: Total bilirubin must be &lt;= institutional limit of normal (ULN). Transaminases (SGOT and/or SGPT) must be &lt;= 4 x ULN. 10. Neurological Status: Patients must not have active CNS metastases. Patients with Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy are ineligible due to the potential neurological complications of oxaliplatin therapy. 11. Renal Function: Patients must have adequate renal function defined as serum creatinine &lt;= 2.0 mg/dl or creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 ml/min/1.73m² for patients with creatinine levels above 2.0 mg/dl. 12. Sexually Active Patients: For all sexually active patients, the use of adequate barrier contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) will be required during therapy, prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Nonpregnant status will be determined in all women of childbearing potential. Pregnant and nursing women patients are not eligible. 13. HIVPositive Patients: Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV infection are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions. Appropriate protocols will be offered to patients receiving HAART therapy, when indicated. 14. No known hypersensitivity to oxaliplatin, gemcitabine or capecitabine 15. No preexisting clinically significant cardiac, hepatic or renal disease. 16. Informed Consent: After being informed of the treatment involved, patients must give written consent. The patient should not have any serious medical or psychiatric illness that would prevent either the giving of informed consent or the receipt of treatment. 17. Inclusion of Women and Minorities: Entry to this study is open to both men and women and to all racial and ethnic groups.</criteria>
