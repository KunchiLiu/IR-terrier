	<brief_summary>Postprandial lipemia and exercise oppose each other in terms of cardiovascular risk, however the mechanism of their interaction is not well understood. Therefore we want to study vascular function, as assessed by brachial artery (BA) flow mediated dilation (FMD), in healthy men before and after a high fat meal (HFM) preceded (16-18 hrs) by rest, a single bout of continuous moderate intensity exercise (CME), and high intensity interval exercise (HIIE).</brief_summary>
