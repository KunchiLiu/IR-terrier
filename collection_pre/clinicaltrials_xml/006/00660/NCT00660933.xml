	<brief_title>Intravenous Iron Versus Oral Iron for Severe Postpartum Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postpartum anemia is commonly defined as hemoglobin levels less than 8.5 g/dl and it is usually treated with oral iron supplements. Blood transfusion is reserved to women with hemoglobin levels &lt; 6 g/dl and/or clinical symptoms of anemia. Without treatment, the restoration of blood parameters in postpartum anemia can take approximately one month (hemoglobin levels increase to 2.8 g/dl in 30 days). Several reports have demonstrated the efficacy of intravenous iron in severe anemia in non-obstetric pathologies. However, the clinical effect of intravenous iron in patients with postpartum hemoglobin levels ranging from 6.0 to 8.0 g/dl has been not reported. There has not been evaluated its capacity to restore hemoglobin levels and to minimize clinical side-effects of anemia (sickness, weariness, depression, anxiety).</detailed_description>
