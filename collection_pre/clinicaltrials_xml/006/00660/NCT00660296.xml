	<brief_summary>CO2 insufflation instead of air for colonic distension in colonoscopy is considered to reduce pain after and during colonoscopy. There is limited data, that Co2 is similar effective in sedated patients. Furthermore it had not been investigated if patient's compliance for participating in cancer screening could be improved by using Co2. The aim of the study is to assess postoperative pain and satisfaction after colonoscopy by comparing C02 with air.</brief_summary>
