	<brief_summary>The Nordic FLOX-regime consists of a combination of bolus 5-FU, leukovorin and oxaliplatin (Eloxatin®). Cetuximab (Erbitux®) is an antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The combination of FLOX and weekly Erbitux has been investigated in the Nordic VII study where 571 patients were randomized to FLOX (regime A) or FLOX + Erbitux (regime B or C). Effect-data has not yet been published but the combination is well tolerated, and other studies have shown that Erbitux administered with chemotherapy seem to be more efficient than chemotherapy alone. The main purpose with this study is to investigate the effect of FLOX and Erbitux given every second week as first line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and K-RAS wildtype tumor. The latest accessible data regarding treatment towards EGFR and K-RAS mutations shows that patients with K-RAS wildtype responds better to treatment than patients with K-RAS mutations.</brief_summary>
