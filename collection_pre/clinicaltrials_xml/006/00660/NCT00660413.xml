	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare two methods for neuromuscular monitoring, acceleromyography and mechanomyography for establishing the dose-response relationship and the potency of a neuromuscular blocking agent using rocuronium as an example. We hypothesized that there would be no significant difference between potencies estimated using acceleromyography and mechanomyography.</brief_summary>
