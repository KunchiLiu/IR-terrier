	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study with ferumoxytol works as a contrasting agent in assessing early response in patients with glioblastoma multiforme receiving temozolomide and radiation therapy. Ferumoxytol is a very small form of iron particles that are injected into the body and taken up by certain tissues which may make these tissues easier to see during imaging. Diagnostic procedures, such as an MRI study with ferumoxytol, may help measure a patient's response to earlier treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Study With Ferumoxytol in Assessing Early Response in Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme Receiving Temozolomide and Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumor vascular properties using ferumoxytol (ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite) and compare to those obtained using gadolinium (Gd) based MRI contrast agent. II. To characterize vascular changes in GBM tumors associated with standard radio/chemotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT), and time-to-peak (TTP) perfusion parameters will be measured for each contrast agent and evaluated in post-hoc analysis. II. To obtain qualitative assessment of tumor vascularity using time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance (MR) angiography techniques. III. To characterize changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of tumor water associated with standard radio/chemotherapy in GBM. OUTLINE: Patients receive gadolinium intravenously (IV) on day 1 and ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite IV on day 2 then undergo dynamic susceptibility contrast enhanced (DSC) MRI, and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (day 1 only), and TOF MR angiography on days 1-3 at 4 time points: before radiation, 3 weeks after initiation of radiation plus temozolomide, at the end of radiation (6 weeks post first dose) and 6 weeks after radiation (12 weeks post first dose). Ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite administration continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive temozolomide and undergo radiation therapy per standard of care. After completion of ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite administration, patients are followed up for 4-6 weeks and then periodically until the resolution or stabilization of unacceptable toxicities.</detailed_description>
