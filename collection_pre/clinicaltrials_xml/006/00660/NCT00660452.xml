	<brief_title>A Phase III Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of STALORAL® 300 IR Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT) in Asthmatic Patients Allergic to House-dust Mites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Male or female outpatients aged 16 to 50 years (inclusive). 2. House dust miteinduced allergic asthma with or without perennial allergic rhinitis for at least 1 year. 3. Sensitised to D. pteronyssinus and D.farinae (positive skin prick test (SPT) with wheal diameter ≥ 4 mm and specific IgE level ≥ 0.70 kU/L 4. Patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) before the screening visit at a dose ≥ 200 µg and &lt; 1,000 µg equivalent budesonide/day. 1. Mild intermittent asthma needed to be treated only with β2agonist (GINA level 1). 2. Severe asthma needed to be treated with inhaled corticosteroids with a dose ≥ 1,000 µg/day equivalent budesonide. 3. FEV1 &lt; 70% of predicted value at Visit 1. 4. Cosensitisation to other inhalant allergens than dust mites leading to clinically relevant allergic asthma and proven by a positive skin prick test with wheal diameter ≥ 4 mm and serum specific IgE ≥ 0.70 KU/L . 5. Patients with a past or current disease, which as judged by the investigator, may affect the patient's participation in or the outcome of the study. These diseases include, but are not limited to, past or current cardiovascular disease, malignancy, hepatic disease, renal disease, haematological disease, neurological disease, immunological disease and endocrine disease.</criteria>
