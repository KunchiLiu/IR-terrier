	<detailed_description>"Phase I/II, Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled, Dose Escalating, Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study in Very Low Birth Weight Neonates of Four Doses of BSYX-A110, a Human Chimeric Anti-Staphylococcal Monoclonal Antibody for the Prevention of S. epidermidis Infection" will be the first study of BSYX-A110 in the target population of hospitalized, very low birth weight infants. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of BSYX-A110 administered on Study Days 0 and 14. This will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, dose escalating study of BSYX-A110 in 48 very low birth weight neonates. The dose levels to be evaluated are 10, 30, 60 and 90 mg/kg. Each dose level will enroll 12 infants who will receive two doses of BSYX-A110 or placebo intravenously at a ratio of 2:1 while hospitalized following birth. Infants will be followed for 8 weeks following the first dose of BSYX-A110 or placebo. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability. The secondary objective is to analyze the pharmacokinetics of BSYX-A110. Positive cultures obtained during the study period will be recorded and analyzed.</detailed_description>

Neonates with known or suspected HIV infection but without other active systemic infection are not excluded. 2. Life threatening hemodynamic instability 3. Severe congenital anomalies or genetic disorders (especially any predisposing to cardiac decompensation) as determined by history and/or physical examination and including but not limited to: i. Trisomy 13 ii. Trisomy 18 iii. Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome iv. Omphalocele v. Gastroschesis vi. Holoprosencephaly 4. Known or suspected hepatic or renal insufficiency 5. Persistent seizure disorder 6. Immunodeficiency other than due to prematurity 7. A history of immune globulin administration prior to first study drug infusion 8.
