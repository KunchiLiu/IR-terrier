	<brief_title>A 6-Month Efficacy and Safety Study of Org 50081 in Adult Patients With Chronic Primary Insomnia (21106/P05701/MK-8265-002)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insomnia is a common complaint or disorder throughout the world. About one third of the population in the industrial countries reports difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, resulting in a non-refreshing or non-restorative sleep. The majority of the insomniacs suffer chronically from their complaints. The maleic acid salt of Org 4420, code name Org 50081 (esmirtazapine), was selected for development in the treatment of insomnia. The first clinical trial with esmirtazapine was a proof-of-concept trial with a four-way cross-over design. All 3 esmirtazapine dose groups showed a statistically significant positive effect on TST (objective and subjective) and Wake Time After Sleep Onset (WASO), as compared to placebo. The current study is designed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of esmirtazapine in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group outpatient trial in participants suffering from chronic primary insomnia. During the 6-month treatment period, participants are randomly assigned to receive either esmirtazapine or placebo. Then, during the 7-day discontinuation period, participants who received esmirtazapine in the 6-month treatment period are randomly assigned to receive either esmirtazapine or placebo, while participants who received placebo in the 6-month treatment period continue to receive placebo.</detailed_description>
