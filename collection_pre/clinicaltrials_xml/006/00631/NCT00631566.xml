	<brief_summary>This study will prospectively evaluate the prevalence and incidence (over a two year period) of MRSA colonization and infection among HIV-infected military beneficiaries to determine predictors for the development of MRSA colonization and infection. This study will also investigate the utility of decolonization procedures for clearance of MRSA carriage and prevention of MRSA infections. Finally, the molecular characteristics and the antimicrobial sensitivities of isolates in this population will be determined.</brief_summary>
