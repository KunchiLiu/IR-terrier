	<brief_title>XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System India Post-marketing Single-arm Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long term surveillance studies using a drug eluting stent (DES) may help elucidate mechanisms responsible for death, myocardial infarction, and late stent thrombosis risks not observed during controlled pre-market trials. This study will evaluate XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (EECSS) performance in the "real world" when used by a broad group of physicians at a variety of health care facilities. Consequently, this protocol will include all consecutively enrolled patients in India who consent to participate and receive the XIENCE V® EECSS, which is expected to represent the range of clinical use during commercialization. Adjunctive anti-platelet therapy is a critical factor in optimizing long term DES safety. Despite established guidelines that recommend 6-12 months dual antiplatelet therapy, patients with DES implants frequently stop taking their medication early. Consequently, XIENCE V® EECSS India Post-marketing Single-Arm Study (XIENCE V® India) follow-up will document patient adherence and persistence with adjunctive antiplatelet drug therapy at several time points throughout the study. The long term safety and efficacy of the XIENCE V EECSS have been demonstrated in the SPIRIT FIRST trial up to 5 years, the SPIRIT II trial up to 4 years, and in the SPIRIT III Randomized Control Trial (RCT) up to 3 years. In addition, these pre-approval studies have shown low rates of Target Vessel Failure and Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) that were observed to plateau or gradually decline after about 1 year and were consistently lower than the comparator arm of each study. This benefit in MACE is sustained for up to 5 years and is also independent of the first year results. The post approval XIENCE V India study demonstrated that the use of the XIENCE EECSS in complex lesions in a real-world population resulted in 1 year MACE, Stent Thrombosis and Target Lesion Revascularization rates that are comparable to those of the previously mentioned pre-approval studies which included patients with more restricted inclusion / exclusion criteria. Therefore, based on existing data from these trials, Abbott Vascular has decided to discontinue further follow up in the XIENCE V India study, from 5 years to after completion of the three year follow-up.</detailed_description>
