	<brief_summary>Develop a tool to objectively quantify technical skills necessary to perform diagnostic cystoscopy (using Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills- OSATS). Develop criteria by which surgeons skills in diagnostic cystoscopy can be evaluated or judged. Develop an intervention (1.5 hour workshop) which can be replicated by other residency programs in order to enhance learning of diagnostic cystoscopy. The workshop should be adequate for practicing Gynecologists as well as they already have experience with diagnostic hysteroscopy which uses many of the same concepts.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standardized Criteria to Judge Diagnostic Urethrocystoscopy Skills</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The OSATS and a written examination will be used to assess residents skills and knowledge pertinent to diagnostic urethrocystoscopy. All residents will be tested on anatomic replica of human bladder for baseline competency using the above tools. Then approximately half will be randomly selected to undergo an educational intervention (a workshop teaching diagnostic urethrocystoscopy). As we are interested in short-term acquisition, about a week later all residents will be retested using the same methods. Grades on the exam will be kept confidential.</detailed_description>
