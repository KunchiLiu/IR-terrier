	<criteria>Subjects over the age of 18 years old with known or suspected cardiovascular disease including documented CAD by cardiac catheterization, and multiple cardiovascular risk factors will be included, regardless of severity of endothelial dysfunction or previous history of cardiovascular events. Subjects with no known history of cardiac disease will also be eligible to participate. Subjects must demonstrate endothelial dysfunction via the RHPAT test (an RHPAT score of less than 2.0) to continue participating in this study. Patients will be excluded if they have confounding factors including, but not limited to, history of renal or liver failure, or relevant food allergies (cranberries, etc.).</criteria>
