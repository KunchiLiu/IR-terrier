	<brief_summary>This study attempts to observe the efficacy (response time) and safety of the second-generation antipsychotic agent-quetiapine versus the first-generation antipsychotic agent-haloperidol, in treating acute schizophrenia episode and to evaluate the effect of the effectiveness of acute schizophrenia episode on long-term tolerability.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter, Open-Label, Randomised, Haloperidol-controlled Study to Evaluate Seroquel as Mono-Therapy in the Treatment of Agitated Symptoms in the Patients With Acute Episode of Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both medication and patient can affect the compliance of patients to treatment. The control of schizophrenia syndromes effectively and rapidly will build up the confidence of patients on treatments. These early effects may influence the long-term compliance and prognosis of patients. And the antipsychotic medications with neuroprotection effect can significantly improve the long-term prognosis of patients, too.In the past, we always think that there is "delayed onset of antipsychotic" by antipsychotic medications. Recently, a large sample study indicated that the onset of antipsychotic effect was as early as the first day after administration (in 24 hours). This study was carried out in order to compare the second-generation antipsychotic agent- quetiapine with the first-generation antipsychotic agent- haloperidol on the onset time of treatment.</detailed_description>
