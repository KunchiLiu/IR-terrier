	<criteria>Stable antiretroviral therapy for at least 12 months Screening CD4+ T cell count &lt; 350 cells/mm3 All available CD4+ T cell counts in the last year and at screening &lt; 350 cells/mm3 Screening plasma HIV RNA levels below level of detection (&lt; 50 copies RNA/mL using Roche Amplicor or &lt; 75 copies/mL using Bayer bDNA or &lt; 40 copies/mL using Abbott RTPCR), and all available determinations in past 12 months also below level of detection (isolated single values &gt; 75 but &lt; 1000 copies/mL will be allowed if they were preceded and followed by undetectable viral load determinations). &gt;90% adherence to therapy within the preceding 30 days, as determined by selfreport Both male and female adult (at least 18 years old) subjects are eligible. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and agree to use a doublebarrier method of contraception throughout the study period. Patients who are intending to modify antiretroviral therapy in the next 24 weeks for any reason Serious illness requiring hospitalization or parental antibiotics within preceding 3 months **Any vaccination 2 weeks prior to baseline (day 0) visit and throughout the study period Concurrent treatment with immunomodulatory drugs, or exposure to any immunomodulatory drug in past 16 weeks Concurrent treatment with phenobarbital, phenytoin, or rifampin. Screening absolute neutrophil count &lt;1,000 cells/mm3, platelet count &lt;70,000 cells/mm3, hemoglobin &lt; 8 mg/dL, estimated creatinine clearance &lt;40 mL/minute Pregnant or breastfeeding women</criteria>
