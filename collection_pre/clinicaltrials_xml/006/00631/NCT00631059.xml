	<brief_summary>The objective of this protocol is to collect leukemia cell specimens from adults (18 years of age) diagnosed with acute leukemia at time of initial diagnosis and, if applicable, at time of first relapse. These specimens, in conjunction with a de-identified data set, will be utilized prospectively to determine potential chemotherapy resistance in this patient population. The specific aims of this study are as follows: To collect peripheral blood specimens from patients diagnosed with acute leukemia at time of initial diagnosis and, if applicable, at time of first relapse To evaluate the leukemia cells in the blood specimens for chemotherapy resistance utilizing the Hem(A)+ technology To develop a body of evidence from acute leukemia patients that demonstrates the applicability of the Hem(A)+ assay to determine the following: Predict responders and non-responders to common chemotherapeutic agents Track treatment results and comparison to prediction results from the assay Identify optimal chemotherapy doses for each patient Identify the most efficacious pharmaceutical agent combinations</brief_summary>
