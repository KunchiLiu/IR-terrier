	<brief_summary>The efficacy of low dose aspirin appears to be substantially lower in diabetic patients, compared to patients without diabetes. We will perform an observational study where we follow up patients with uncontrolled type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and low response to aspirin (Aspirin Resistance), during a period of 6 months in the diabetic clinic. Our hypothesis is that glucose control will improve the response to aspirin in those patients.</brief_summary>
