	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to compare the adhesive quality of a new formulation of the Mylan Estradiol Transdermal System with that of Climara® Transdermal System following a single system application in 80 healthy postmenopausal female volunteers. As a secondary objective, primary dermal irritation was assessed after removal of each transdermal system.</brief_summary>

The physical examination shall include pelvic and breast exams. a. Pelvic findings should be consistent with hypoestrogenemia. b. A mammogram will be required if not performed within the last 12 months. c.

Social Habits: a. Use of any tobacco products. b. Ingestion of any alcoholic, caffeine or xanthinecontaining food or beverage within the 48 hours prior to the initial dose of study medication. c. Ingestion of any vitamins within the 48 hours prior to the initial dose of study medication. d. Any recent, significant change in dietary or exercise habits. 3. Medications: 1. Use of any medication within 14 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 2. Use of any medication known to alter hepatic enzyme activity within 28 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 3. Use of any systemic antibiotics, estrogens, or hormones within 28 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 4. Diseases: 1. History of any significant chronic disease such as (but not limited to): 1. Thrombotic disorders. 2. Coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease. 3. Liver, kidney or gallbladder dysfunction/disorder(s). 4. Fibrocystic disease or breast nodules. 5. Family history of breast cancer. 6. Diabetes or any other endocrinological disease. 7.

Acute illness at the time of either the prestudy medical evaluation or dosing. 5. Abnormal and clinically significant laboratory test results: 1. Clinically significant deviation from the Guide to Clinically Relevant Abnormalities (See Part II: ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS). 2. Abnormal and clinically relevant ECG tracing. 6. Subjects who have received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 7. Allergy or hypersensitivity to tapes or adhesives (ex. Bandaids, medical tape), estradiol or other hormonal products.</criteria>
