No hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy are permitted in this study. Acceptable forms of contraception include the following: 1. intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months prior to the start of the study and remaining in place during the study period, or 2. barrier methods containing or used in conjunction with a spermicidal agent, or 3. surgical sterility (tubal ligation, oophorectomy or hysterectomy) or postmenopausal accompanied with a documented postmenopausal course of at least one year. 3.

Clinically significant deviation from the Guide to Clinically Relevant Abnormalities (See Part II ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS). 2. Abnormal and clinically relevant ECG tracing. 6. Donation or loss of a significant volume of blood or plasma (&gt; 450 mL) within 28 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 7. Subjects who have received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 8. Allergy or hypersensitivity to doxycycline monohydrate or any tetracyclines. 9.
