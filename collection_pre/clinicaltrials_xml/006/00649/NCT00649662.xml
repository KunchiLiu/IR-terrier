If dosing is scheduled on weekends, serum should be collected within 24 hours prior to dosing of each study period. An additional serum (βHCG) pregnancy test will be performed upon completion of the study. 2. Women must practice abstinence or use an acceptable form of contraception throughout the duration of the study. No hormonal contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapies are permitted in this study. Acceptable forms of contraception include the following: 1. intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months prior to the start of the study and remaining in place during the study period, or 2. barrier methods containing or used in conjunction with a spermicidal agent, or 3. surgical sterilization 3.

Abnormal and clinically relevant ECG tracing. 6. Donation or loss of a significant volume of blood or plasma (&gt; 450 mL) within 28 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 7. Subjects who have received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 8. Allergy or hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin or any other quinolone (e.g., ofloxacin, levofloxacin, or lomefloxacin) or any related products. 9.
