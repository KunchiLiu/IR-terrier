Women of childbearing potential must have negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG) pregnancy tests performed within 14 days prior to the start of the study and on the evening prior to each dose administration. If dosing is scheduled on Sunday or Monday, serum samples for βHCG testing may be collected and sent for analysis within 48 hours prior to dosing for both study periods. An additional serum (betaHCG) pregnancy test will be performed upon completion of the study. 2.

No hormonal contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy are permitted in this study. Acceptable forms of contraception include the following: 1. intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months prior to the start of the study and remaining in place during the study period, or 2. barrier methods containing or used in conjunction with a spermicidal agent, or 3. surgical sterility (tubal ligation, oophorectomy or hysterectomy) or postmenopausal accompanied with a documented postmenopausal course of at least one year. 3.

All subjects should be judged normal and healthy during a prestudy medical evaluation (physical examination, including vital signs, laboratory evaluation, 12lead ECG, hepatitis B and hepatitis C tests, HIV test, and urine drug screen including amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepine, cannabinoid, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine, and methadone) performed within 14 days of the initial dose of study medication. 1. Institutionalized subjects will not be used. 2. Social Habits: 1. Use of any tobacco products. 2. Ingestion of any alcoholic, caffeine or xanthinecontaining food or beverage within the 48 hours prior to the initial dose of study medication. 3.

Use of any medication within the 14 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. b. Use of any medication known to alter hepatic enzyme activity within 28 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. c. Use of hormonal contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy within three months prior to the initial dose of study medication. 4. Diseases: 1. History of any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic disease. 2. History of angioedema. 3. History of drug and/or alcohol abuse. 4. Acute illness at the time of either the prestudy medical evaluation or dosing. 5. Positive HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C test. 5. Abnormal and clinically significant laboratory test results: 1. Clinically significant deviation from the Guide to Clinically Relevant Abnormalities (See Part II ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS). d. Abnormal and clinically relevant ECG tracing. 6. Donation or loss of a significant volume of blood or plasma (&gt; 450 mL) within 28 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 7. Subjects who have received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the initial dose of study medication. 8. Allergy or hypersensitivity to benazepril or amlodipine or any other related products. 9.
