	<brief_title>Novel Internet-Based Interventions to Reduce Sexual Risk Among Men Who Have Sex With Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an Internet-based, five-branch randomized controlled intervention, enrolling 3,000 adult MSM. The five branches include 1) a control condition receiving no intervention content, 2) a standard text-based prevention webpage, 3) an 8 minute dramatic video addressing sexual risk reduction within the context of alcohol use, 4) a 5 minute documentary video addressing HIV disclosure, HIV testing, and condom use with the sub-context of drug use, and 5) both videos. After completing the baseline survey, eligible participants who consent to participate in the intervention will be randomly assigned to the control condition or one of the four intervention conditions. The control condition will not include the delivery of any intervention content. All participants (branches 1-5) will be asked to complete a brief post-intervention survey (to measure intentions). All intervention participants will be invited to complete a final 60-day follow-up survey.</detailed_description>
