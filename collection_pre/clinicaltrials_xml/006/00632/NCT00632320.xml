	<brief_title>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure and Oxygen Concentration on Measurement of Rapid Shallow Breathing Index</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>98 ready for weaning patients were included and divided into success (n=71) and failure (n=27) groups based upon their weaning outcome. Before weaning, the RSBI values were determined under the patients disconnecting from the ventilator (RA-no ventilator) and still connecting to the ventilator with 4 different settings (fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 21 or 40% combined with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 0 or 5 cm H2O). The patients were extubated after completing the weaning trials. Successful weaning was defined as patients free from the ventilator for over 48 hours.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>intubated medical patients with mechanically ventilated more than 48 hours clinically ready for weaning Glasgow coma scales were at least 8 their ventilator settings were: assistcontrolled, pressure support (PS)or synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation plus PS mode, FiO2 40% or less, positive endexpiratory pressure 5 cm H2O or less, and sensitivity setting on 1 L/min. Their arterial blood gases results were acceptable having ongoing lung or neuromuscular disease and signs of increased intracranial pressure</criteria>
