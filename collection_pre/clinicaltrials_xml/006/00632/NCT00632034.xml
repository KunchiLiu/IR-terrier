	<brief_summary>The aim of this trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of expanded autologous progeny of an adult CD34+ (haemopoietic) stem cell subset when infused directly into the tibial artery of patients with recent tibial fracture. The trial will also seek to determine clinical improvement or deterioration by measurement of clinical parameters such as, length of time to union of the fracture, changes in bone mineral density, improvements in pain scores (VAS), functional ability (TUGT) and IPAQ scores.</brief_summary>
