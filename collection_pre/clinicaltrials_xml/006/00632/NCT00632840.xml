	<detailed_description>Insulin resistance is a heterogeneous metabolic disorder of complex etiology. It underpins dyslipoproteinemia, a key feature of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) that independently predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypertriglyceridemia, the most consistent lipid disorder in subjects with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, is chiefly a consequence of overproduction and delayed clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs). Although the precise mechanisms involved are incompletely understood, experimental and clinical evidence suggests that elevated apolipoprotein (apo) C-III may play a crucial role in the dysregulation of TRL metabolism. investigating the effects of these agents on VLDL-apoC-III kinetics. In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of two lipid-regulating agents, atorvastatin and fenofibrate on VLDL-apoC-III transport. We hypothesized that atorvastatin and fenofibrate would have similar effects on apoC-III transport by decreasing the production and increasing the catabolism of VLDL-apoC-III.</detailed_description>
