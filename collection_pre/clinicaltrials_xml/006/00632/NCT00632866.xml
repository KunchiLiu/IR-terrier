	<brief_summary>Primary Sjögren's syndrome (SJp) affects 0.1% of the population. This systemic autoimmune disease systemic is characterized by disabling dryness, fatigue and pain, and systemic complications in 30% of patients. No treatment has proven effective in this disease. In open studies, some efficacy was observed with hydroxychloroquine but no RCT versus placebo has ever been done. Thus, the primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (400mg/ day) on dryness, pain, and fatigue, assessed by the patient using visual analogical scales.</brief_summary>

In open studies, some efficacy was observed with hydroxychloroquine but no RCT versus placebo has ever been done. Thus, the primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (400mg/ day) on dryness, pain, and fatigue, assessed by the patient using visual analogical scales (VAS).
