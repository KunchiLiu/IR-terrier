	<brief_summary>Prior clinical trials involving bevacizumab and sorafenib have demonstrated single agent activity in previously treated advanced breast cancer. This trial will test combined VEGF inhibition with sorafenib and bevacizumab in less heavily pre-treated patients with advanced breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study of Bevacizumab + Sorafenib in Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

	<criteria>Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of breast cancer with evidence of metastatic disease. NOTE: Patients with Her2 positive (3+ by IHC or gene amplification by FISH) are eligible only if they have had prior trastuzumab therapy. Must have measurable or nonmeasurable lesions as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Two or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens in any disease setting. NOTE: All adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be considered one regimen. NOTE: Prior hormonal therapy for metastatic disease is allowed. NOTE: Prior radiation therapy is allowed as long as the irradiated area is not the only source of evaluable disease. Age &gt; 18 years at the time of consent. Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health information. Females of childbearing potential and males must be willing to use an effective method of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from the time consent is signed until 8 weeks after treatment discontinuation. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to being registered for protocol therapy. Ability to comply with study and/or followup procedures. No prior therapy with bevacizumab, sorafenib or any other known VEGF inhibitors. No known hypersensitivity to any component of the study drugs. No other forms of cancer therapy including radiation, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy within 21 days prior to being registered for protocol therapy. No history or radiologic evidence of CNS metastases including previously treated, resected, or asymptomatic brain lesions or leptominigeal involvement. A head CT or MRI must be obtained within 28 days prior to being registered for protocol therapy. No other participation in another clinical drug study within 28 days prior to being registered for protocol therapy. No known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic Hepatitis B or C No major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to being registered for protocol therapy or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study. Placement of a vascular access device and breast biopsy will not be considered major surgery. No minor surgical procedure within 7 days prior to being registered for protocol therapy.
