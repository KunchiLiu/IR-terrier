	<brief_title>Assessment of the Effectiveness of Low-Level Laser Therapy on the Hands of Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that basically compromises the joints in a generalized, symmetrical, additive and usually progressive manner. This clinical condition includes pain and altered functionality. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been studied since the 1970s with regard to its therapeutic effects. The literature suggests that it offers analgesic as well as anti-inflammatory benefits. A number of studies carried out in the laboratory and on animals have shown that LLLT contributes toward the treatment of inflammatory joint disease. However, studies on humans with RA have yielded controversial results. A large part of the authors researched state that further randomized double-blind controlled studies should be carried out to prove the effectiveness of LLLT on RA. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of LLLT on the reduction in pain and improvement in function in the hands of patients with RA.</detailed_description>
