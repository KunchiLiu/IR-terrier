	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to: 1. determine if a rehabilitation program that consists of exercise and manual therapy reduces pain and improves quality of life in patients with shoulder subacromial impingement syndrome; 2. determine which patients are likely to respond to this rehabilitation program and which patients are not likely to respond to this rehabilitation program The hypotheses are: 1. the rehabilitation treatment program will result in significant changes in pain and quality of life 2. there will be items from the history and examination that will identify those patients who respond favorably and those who do not respond favorably to rehabilitation at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise and Manual Therapy for Shoulder Subacromial Impingement Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subacromial impingement syndrome (SAIS) is the most frequent cause of shoulder pain. A variety of non-surgical treatments have been advocated to correct the impairments associated with SAIS. Clinical trials support the use of therapeutic exercise and joint mobilizations to improve pain and functional disability associated with SAIS. However, not all patients in these trials had a favorable outcome. Moreover, the effect sizes in these trials were small to moderate. Thus the purposes of this study are to 1. determine the effect of a multi-modal rehabilitation program consisting of strengthening, stretching, manual therapy to the shoulder and spine, patient education, posture, and functional re-training; and 2. identify those patients who are and who are not likely to respond to rehabilitation at the start of care.</detailed_description>
