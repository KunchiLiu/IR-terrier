	<brief_title>Treatment of PTCL With Aggressive Induction Therapy Followed by Autologous SCT Using Denileukin Diftitox (Ontak)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol proposes first to increase the proportion of patients who achieve adequate initial disease control and are able to proceed to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in first complete or partial remission. It administers intensive and novel induction therapy. Two cycles of GND (gemcitabine, vinorelbine, Doxil) will be used followed by two cycles of augmented dose CHOP (Cyclophosphamide) plus high-dose MTX. Patients will be restaged after two cycles of GND to assess response to GND alone and again after the second cycle of augmented CHOP/high-dose MTX. Those achieving a remission status will receive intensive consolidation with HDAC/etoposide followed by stem cell mobilization. A five-day course of denileukin diftitox (Ontak) will be administered at and will serve as an in vivo purge. This will be followed by autologous stem cell transplant. Those not achieving partial remission or better following the four induction courses will receive 2 cycles of denileukin diftitox(Ontak) for 5 days. Those achieving partial remission or better to this regimen will go on to consolidation/mobilization and autologous stem cell transplant. Post-transplant, denileukin diftitox will also be used as an additional module of therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic diagnosis of any of the following: Peripheral Tcell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCLU),(IPI &gt;2) Angioimmunoblastic Tcell lymphoma (IPI &gt;2) Nonprimary cutaneous Alk1negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma Extranodal NK/T lymphoma (Excluding stage I/II nasal disease) Blastic NK cell lymphoma Enteropathy type Tcell lymphoma Subcutaneous panniculitislike Tcell lymphoma Hepatosplenic Tcell lymphoma Measurable or assessable disease is not required. Age &gt;18 and &lt; 70 years Previously untreated or 1 prior cycle of chemotherapy Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL, AST &lt; 3x upper limit of normal Patients who test positive for HepBSAg or HepC Ab are eligible provided all of the following criteria are met: bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal; AST ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal; liver biopsy demonstrates ≤ grade 2 fibrosis and no cirrhosis. Hepatitis B surface Ag(+) patients will be treated with amivudine (3TC) or investigator's preferred antiviral regimen throughout protocol therapy and for 612 months thereafter. Neutrophils &gt;1000/uL platelets &gt; 100,000/uL Albumin &gt; 3.0 mg/dL HIVnegative No known hypersensitivity to denileukin diftitox or any of its components: diptheria toxin, interleukin2, or excipients Nonpregnant, nonnursing: Treatment under this protocol would expose an unborn child to significant risks. Women and men of reproductive potential should agree to use an effective means of birth control. Patients with a "currently active" second malignancy, other than nonmelanoma skin cancers are not eligible. (This includes Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, since such patents have experienced transient increases in IgM following initiation of rituximab, with the potential for hyperviscosity syndrome requiring plasmapheresis). Patients are not considered to have a "currently active" malignancy if they have completed anticancer therapy, and are considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse.
