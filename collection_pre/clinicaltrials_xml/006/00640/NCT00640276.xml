	<brief_summary>We will identify the influence of long-term treatment of Pitavastatin compared to non-treatment control group on the metabolic syndrome by evaluation of a change of metabolic syndrome component score. And we will additionally observe the changes of CVD risk factors like lipid profile, abdominal fat, insulin resistance and so on.</brief_summary>
