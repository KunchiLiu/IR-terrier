	<brief_summary>Background: Experimental studies have documented the beneficial effects of the endogenously produced antioxidant, melatonin, in reducing tissue damage and limiting cardiac pathophysiology in models of experimental ischemia-reperfusion. Melatonin confers cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury most likely through its direct free radical scavenging activities and its indirect actions in stimulating antioxidant enzymes. These actions of melatonin permit it to reduce molecular damage and limit infarct size in experimental models of transient ischemia and subsequent reperfusion. Study design: The Melatonin Adjunct in the acute myocaRdial Infarction treated with Angioplasty (MARIA) trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of the intravenous administration of melatonin. The primary efficacy end point of this study is to determine whether melatonin treatment reduces infarct size determined by cardiac magnetic resonance 5-7 days post-reperfusion. Other secondary end points will be the clinical events occurring within the first year: death, sustained ventricular arrhythmias, resuscitation from cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, major bleedings , stroke, need for revascularization, recurrent ischemia, re-infarctions and rehospitalization; and changes in left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline to 4 months of follow-up. Implications: The MARIA trial tests a novel pharmacologic agent, melatonin, in patients with acute myocardial infarction and the hypothesis that it will confer cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury. If successful, the finding would support the use of melatonin in therapy of ischemic-reperfusion injury of the heart.</brief_summary>
