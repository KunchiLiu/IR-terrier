	<brief_title>Interventional Trial of Vitamin D Deficiency in the Patients of General Departments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Today vitamin D is thought to be one of the most important vitamins in the human body. It's made in the skin during the sun expose, so it must be sufficient in so sunny countries as Israel. Although many old people in our country suffer from vitamin d deficiency which bring them to recurrent falls, osteoporotic fractures and physical disability. This problem is still underestimated by health authorities in different countries. In this study we will examine the vitamin D state of the therapeutic patient older than 65 year including their physical self-estimation, muscle strength measurement and gait-and-balance tests. Then, according to the resent studies, we will treat the patients in the interventional group with two large doses of vitamin D during a month. After that we will compere their health and physical state with the patients treated in the out-hospital department. So we will try to find a useful approach to treat the vitamin D deficiency during the hospitalization.</detailed_description>
