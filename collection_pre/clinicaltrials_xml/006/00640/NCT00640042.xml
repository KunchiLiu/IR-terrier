	<brief_title>Evaluation of Risk Minimization, Assessment and Outcomes in Patients With Chronic Pain Taking Avinza</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain affects more Americans than diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined and although it is one of the earliest known ailments, pain is still without a universal cure. It is estimated that only about 25% of patients with chronic pain receive adequate analgesia. Long-term treatment of chronic pain with opioids is recognized as an important treatment option for patients with moderate-severe pain related to cancer and other chronic serious illnesses. AVINZA (morphine sulfate extended-release capsules) was approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2002 as a once daily treatment for the relief of moderate to severe pain requiring continuous opioid therapy for an extended period of time. While opioids, such as AVINZA, are beneficial in the management of chronic pain, they are sometimes associated with illicit activities. Misuse, abuse and diversion of controlled prescription drugs, particularly opioids, are problems that have increased dramatically in the United States (U.S.) since the 1990s. This study will follow the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Policy for the Use of Controlled Substances for the Treatment of Pain. Patients will be counseled on the proper storage and destruction of unused AVINZA in accordance with federal and applicable state laws. A universal precautions approach to chronic pain management (KAIR) will be utilized in this study. Although not validated as a risk assessment and management instrument, KAIR is designed to assist clinicians with responsibly managing chronic moderate-severe pain patients prescribed AVINZA. The KAIR tools will be used by the Investigator to determine the level of monitoring required based on the patient's potential risk for opioid misuse or abuse (KAIR level). Investigators and staff participating in this study will be required to participate in a training program on the counseling to be given, procedures to be followed and tools to be used in this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient is an adult (greater than or equal to 21 years old Patient has chronic (greater than or equal to 3 months) moderatesevere pain who, at the discretion of the Investigator, requires an aroundtheclock opioid for optimal analgesia. Patients may be opioid naïve (not currently on an opioid) or opioid tolerant. Opioid naïve patients with a pain score of greater than or equal to 4 on an 11point NRS (numerical rating scale. OR Opioid tolerant patients experiencing suboptimal response (i.e. pain score of greater than or equal to 4) or unacceptable side effects to sustained release opioids or shortacting opioids. Patient is able to read and understand English and comply with protocol requirements. A patient who meets ANY of the following exclusion criteria will not be enrolled: Hypersensitivity to morphine, morphine salts, or any components of AVINZA Respiratory depression (slowed breathing) Acute or severe bronchial asthma or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Currently has or is suspected of having paralytic ileus Requires a daily dose of AVINZA greater than 1600mg/day Patient is abusing alcohol Pregnancy or breast feeding Currently taking AVINZA Patient unwilling to sign the Treatment Agreement Life expectancy is less than 2 months Migraine as the primary pain score Patient resides in a hospital or nursing home Patient has had more than 2 surgeries for low back pain Patient is anticipated to require major surgery or steroid injections for chronic pain over the next 12 weeks</criteria>
