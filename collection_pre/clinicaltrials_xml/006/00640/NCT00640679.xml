	<brief_title>Abrupt Versus Tapered Interruption of Chronic Clopidogrel Therapy After DES Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A possible rebound in platelet activity after clopidogrel withdrawal has been suggested in patients on chronic clopidogrel therapy. However, a systematic evaluation of the role of rapid thienopyridine withdrawal on ischemic complications in patients with treated coronary artery disease has not been addressed by specifically designed studies. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abrupt or tapered interruption of chronic clopidogrel therapy after intracoronary drug-eluting stent implantation.</detailed_description>
