	<brief_title>Anemia in the Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible elderly men and women with anemia will undergo a full hematologic evaluation (blood sample for complete blood count, CBC) to determine the etiology of the anemia (eg, myelodysplastic syndrome). Peripheral smears; iron studies; serum creatinine; serum erythropoietin; reticulocyte count; vitamin B12; and folate levels may be obtained/conducted. When no etiology is identified (ie, "unexplained anemia"), additional laboratory tests will be performed which will include some or all of urinary hepcidin levels; plasma cytokine levels; serum soluble transferrin receptor; C-reactive protein; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; D-Dimer; neopterin level; tryptophan level; and blood for a cytokine profile that may include IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and VEGF levels. Serum; plasma; and nucleated peripheral blood cells may be banked for future DNA and other analyses. In a subset of those found to have either unexplained anemia (approximately 6 to 30 subjects) or anemia of chronic inflammation (approximately 6 to 30 subjects) , bone marrow aspirate and biopsies may be performed for a planned analysis of erythroid progenitor and stem cells in these populations. In addition, plasma and serum and bone marrow samples will be obtained from elderly non-anemic controls (approximately 6 to 30 subjects), and bone marrow samples will be purchased for non-anemic young controls (approximately 6 to 30 subjects) .</detailed_description>
