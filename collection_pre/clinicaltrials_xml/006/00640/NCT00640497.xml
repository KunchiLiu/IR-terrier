	<brief_summary>In this study, a combination of two T-cell directed antibodies both conjugated to a cell-killing toxin will be evaluated. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that this so-called immunotoxin-combination (IT-combination) acts synergistically in eliminating T cells. In a subsequent clinical pilot-study, the IT-combination has generated encouraging results when applied as third line therapy. Extensive biological and clinical responses could be noted in the absence of severe acute toxicities. Building on this experience, the current study aims at evaluating the characteristics of the IT-combination when administered in an earlier phase of the disease, i.e. as second line instead of as third line therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>"The experimental design is a non-controlled multicentric fixed-dose Phase I/II study. A total of 12 evaluable patients will be enrolled in 4 transplant centers throughout the Netherlands, in a 9 to 12 months period. The treatment consists of a standard dose of 4 infusions IT-combination (4 mg/m2), given 48-hours apart over a 4-hour period. The intended follow-up period is 12 months. The patient will also be asked to participate in additional research aiming at determining the presence and evolution of biomarkers suggestive for the extent to which the IT-combination 'resets the T-cell compartment, induces clinical tolerance, and/or enhances the risk of over-immunosuppression."</detailed_description>
