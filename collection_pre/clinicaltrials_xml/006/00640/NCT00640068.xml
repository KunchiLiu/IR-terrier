	<brief_summary>The ACIC is a Collaborative Quality Improvement (CQI) program involving the collection of data related to: indications for Coronary Computed Tomography (CCTA), patient health characteristics, acquisition techniques of CCTA scans, physician interpretation of results and short-term outcomes over a 90 day period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging Consortium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a collaborative quality assurance initiative organized by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Blue Cross Network (BCBSM/BCN) for initiation of insurance coverage of coronary artery CT scanning (CCTA), a relatively new procedure that can provide non-invasive coronary angiograms. While this procedure has promise in that it can rapidly diagnose patients with unknown chest pain and reduce the cost of medical care, there is substantial potential for abuse and excess cost and inappropriate care if not appropriately used. The Consortium's objectives are to educate participating sites of the clinical uses of CCTA as well as other best-practice recommendations; to create a database (Registry) to develop evidence of the best-practice utilization of CCTA; to provide a feedback mechanism to the sites about the positive or negative evidence of best-practice utilization of CCTA; to develop strategies to improve the utilization of CCTA; to monitor the CQI process of the individual participating sites; to reduce cost and improve safety and efficiency in in the care of patients with acute chest pain, indeterminate stress tests results, and to assess coronary bypass graft patency.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>(Patient must meet one criteria) Patient has had a CCTA examination ordered by a referring physician at a participating site. Patient is a self referral. Clinical contraindications to CCTA are present as determined by attending physician or staff, including but not limited to: Pregnancy or potential pregnancy. Renal failure or dysfunction. Inability to receive beta blockers. Allergy to iodinated contrast without prior premedication. Unwillingness to participate. Inability to read or understand Patient Information Sheet. Age less than 18 years without parent or guardian's evaluation of Patient Information Sheet. Underage and other vulnerable populations are included as the CQI process is intended to detect and correct adverse consequences of CCTA, e.g., excessive radiation, and protect such patients.</criteria>
