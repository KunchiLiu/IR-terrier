	<brief_summary>Automated external defibrillators have improved survival for adult in hospital cardiac arrest. Automated external defibrillators are approved for children aged 1 year and older for out of hospital cardiac arrests. It is unknown whether automated external defibrillators have a role for in hospital pediatric cardiac arrests. The purpose of study is to compare the management of cardiac rhythm disorders by pediatric residents using an automated external defibrillator versus a standard defibrillator in simulated pediatric cardiac arrests. It is our hypothesis that residents using an automated external defibrillator will have a shorter time to defibrillation.</brief_summary>
