	<brief_summary>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive diagnostic imaging technology that produces images of the body. This technology does not utilize radiation, as does Computed Tomography (CT) but relies on radio waves and a strong magnet to produce images. The purpose of this study is to evaluate new commercially available MR imaging sequence and/or hardware that have been installed on an existing MR unit or to evaluate a new MR unit. The study also serves to familiarize the MR technical staff with how to operate the new equipment. The information obtained will be used to optimize new MR equipment that has been installed on the MR scanner</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been utilized for 20 years as a clinical and research tool at SUNY Upstate Medical University. Currently, there are five (5) MR (1 low-field 0.2 Tesla, 3 high-field 1.5 Tesla and 1 3.0 Tesla) units in use on the university campus. During this time, new imaging sequences and hardware including smaller more powerful magnets and faster computers have been developed that assist in the diagnosis of many disease processes. MR Angiography, MR Spectroscopy, diffusion weighted imaging and a dedicated combination Neurovascular head and neck coil are just several of the many imaging sequences and specialized coils that have been developed over the last several years. New imaging sequences and hardware including 4.0 and 7.0 Tesla magnets are currently undergoing development and testing at several universities in the United States and worldwide. As a consequence of the many new innovations in MR imaging we must periodically upgrade our existing MR units and on occasion replace one of our existing MR units or purchase a new MR unit. This will ensure that we have the most up to date MR equipment to provide state of the art diagnostic imaging capabilities at University Hospital. The new imaging sequences and/or hardware must be optimized for each MR unit to achieve the highest signal to noise (SNR) and contrast to noise (CNR) ratios in a reasonable scan time. This practice is routinely performed at every university and private hospital as well as outpatient imaging center when a new MR unit is installed and when an existing unit is upgraded</detailed_description>
