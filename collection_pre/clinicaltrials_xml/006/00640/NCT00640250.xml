	<brief_summary>We propose a prospective, multi-center, double-blind, randomized study comparing the diagnostic performance (primary) and safety (secondary) of 3 concentrations of Disperse blue 106 and 4 concentrations of Bronopol in 40 adult subjects (20 subjects per allergen) with a clinical history of contact dermatitis and a positive patch test (current or previous) to the corresponding reference petrolatum allergen ("sensitives").</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of T.R.U.E. TESTÂ® Panel 3.2 Allergens: Dose Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary endpoint: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of Disperse blue 106 and Bronopol T.R.U.E. Test allergens in 20 adult subjects per allergen with a clinical history of contact dermatitis and a positive patch test to the respective reference allergen. Evaluations will include: - Determination of the lowest concentration eliciting positive skin reactions (+1 or +2) in 70-90% of sensitive subjects. - Frequency of positive, negative, doubtful and irritant reactions for each allergen and tested concentration. - Concordance/discordance as compared to the corresponding reference petrolatum allergen. Secondary endpoint: To evaluate the safety of Disperse blue 106 and Bronopol T.R.U.E. Test allergens in 20 adult subjects per allergen with a clinical history of contact dermatitis and a positive patch test to the respective reference allergen. Evaluations will include: - The frequency of tape-induced irritation at the test site, incomplete panel adhesion, and subject-reported sensations of itching or burning. - The frequency and characterization of adverse events and serious adverse events. - The frequency and characterization of late and/or persistent reactions.</detailed_description>
