	<brief_summary>This aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors as prophylaxis against pandemic influenza infection in patients who are prescribed a long term course in the context of a place of employment or profession. The study is observational only. The primary measure used in this study will be the incidence of symptomatic pandemic influenza in patients receiving prophylaxis. Seroconversion to pandemic influenza, the incidence of adverse events and the relative effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir prophylaxis will also be examined. This project will commence upon pandemic influenza being declared in Australia, Hong Kong or Singapore. Data will be analysed as quickly as possible to help inform the continued use of neuraminidase inhibitor therapy as a cornerstone of the public health agency response to pandemic influenza.</brief_summary>
