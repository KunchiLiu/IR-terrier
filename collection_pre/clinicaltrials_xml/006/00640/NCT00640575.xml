	<brief_summary>Corticosteroid injections is a popular treatment option in shoulder disease. The evidence of effectiveness of corticosteroid injections is however contradicting. The importance of the accuracy of the steroid placement have been discussed and recently there are a few studies indicating better treatment effect if the injections are guided towards specific anatomical structures by real time ultrasound imaging. None of these studies have been double blinded. The aim of this study is to investigate the importance of placement of steroid injection in patients with rotator cuff disease by comparing systemic and ultrasound-guided injection in the subacromial bursa using a double blinded design.</brief_summary>
