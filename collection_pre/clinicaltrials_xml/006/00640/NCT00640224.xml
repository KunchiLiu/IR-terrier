	<brief_summary>The purpose is to investigate the effects of 2 different treatments (drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol versus rosiglitazone) on insulin sensitivity and androgen levels, inflammatory markers, vascular markers and bone development in overweight adolescent females with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Resistance, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, and Bone Research Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to: 1) to compare effects of treatment with drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol (Yasmin)versus rosiglitazone (Avandia) on hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia, adrenal hyperresponsiveness, body composition, chronic inflammation, bone mass and turnover. OCPs are the first-line therapy for PCOS, however, they do not address the insulin resistance or the inflammation. Insulin sensitizers have been used successfully to treat PCOS but thiazolidinediones such as rosiglitazone have not been used in adolescents. Therefore we will investigate the effects of treatment with drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol versus rosiglitazone in overweight adolescents with PCOS. We will obtain comprehensive evaluations before and 6 months after randomization, to the respective treatment arms to determine the differences between the 2 treatment modalities.</detailed_description>
