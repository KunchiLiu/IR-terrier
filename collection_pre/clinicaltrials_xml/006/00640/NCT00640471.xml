	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Brivanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving brivanib together with cetuximab is more effective than cetuximab alone in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying cetuximab to see how well it works compared with cetuximab given together with brivanib in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab With or Without Brivanib in Treating Patients With K-Ras Wild Type Tumours and Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To compare the overall survival of patients with previously treated K-Ras wild type metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with brivanib alaninate in combination with cetuximab versus placebo in combination with cetuximab. Secondary - To compare the progression-free survival of these patients. - To compare the objective response rate and duration of response in these patients. - To compare the quality of life of these patients. - To compare the health utilities of these patients. - To conduct a comparative economic evaluation of these patients. - To evaluate the safety profile of this regimen in these patients. - To explore an association between FGF-2, BRAF mutations, amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG) as determined from paraffin embedded tumor specimens and the potential for clinical benefit from the addition of brivanib alaninate or placebo to cetuximab in terms of overall survival, progression-free survival and objective response rate compared to cetuximab alone. - To explore associations with mRNA and/or protein expression and/or variations in genes associated with epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiogenesis, and other related pathways and the potential for clinical benefit from the addition of brivanib alaninate to cetuximab in terms of overall survival, progression-free survival, and objective response rate compared to cetuximab alone. - To explore an association with changes of Collagen IV in the blood and the potential for clinical benefit from the addition of brivanib alaninate to cetuximab in terms of overall survival, progression-free survival and objective response rate compared to cetuximab alone. - To establish a comprehensive tumor bank linked to a clinical database for the further study of molecular markers in colorectal cancer. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center and ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral brivanib alaninate once daily and cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes once weekly. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily and cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes once weekly. In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor tissue and blood samples are collected for correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for biomarker levels (Collagen IV, FGF-2, and epiregulin, amphiregulin, and BRAF mutation status) and correlation with response. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter.</detailed_description>
