	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of rosiglitazone alone compared with rosiglitazone plus metformin or rosiglitazone plus losartan in the treatment of biopsy proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This study was designed to answer the question: are there differences in the efficacy (as measured by histopathology and insulin resistance) of three different therapeutic modalities used to treat NASH?</brief_summary>
