	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of IMC-A12 when given together with temsirolimus and to see how well they work in treating patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving IMC-A12 together with temsirolimus may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cixutumumab and Temsirolimus in Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish the recommended dose level of cixutumumab and temsirolimus for the phase II study in patients with metastatic breast cancer. (Phase I) II. To examine the safety profile of this combination in patients with metastatic breast cancer. (Phase I) III. To assess the anti-tumor activity (in terms of overall response rate) and toxicity profile of cixutumumab in combination with temsirolimus in patients with metastatic breast cancer. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival distributions (as well as the 6-month PFS rate). II. To evaluate the in vivo mechanisms of action of temsirolimus in combination with cixutumumab and to examine potential biomarker predictors of treatment response. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cixutumumab. Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes and cixutumumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Peripheral blood samples are collected periodically for circulating markers and mononuclear cells. Samples are analyzed for pharmacodynamic assessments via western blot and proteomic studies. If pre-existing tumor tissue is available, tissue is examined by immunohistochemical staining for markers (e.g., pIRS-1, pIGF-IR, pMAPK, pAKT [S473], pS6, PTEN, Stathmin). Fluorescence in situ hybridization is used to assess IGF-IR amplification. Gene resequencing is performed to identify mutations of PIK3CA (exons 9 and 20), AKT1, and other genes. Genes IGF-1, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3, and others are analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 2 (phase I) or 5 (phase II) years.</detailed_description>
