	<brief_title>Study of Cetuximab to Treat Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to now, although FU based, cisplatin based and taxane based regimen, and ECF regimen have been suggested as the first line therapy for A/MGC by FDA, there is no standard regimen for patients with A/MGC as second line treatment. Based on the promising results of cetuximab combined with FOLFIRI in metastatic colorectal cancer, we design this clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cetuximab combined with FOLFIRI for A/MGC patients as a second line treatment.</detailed_description>
