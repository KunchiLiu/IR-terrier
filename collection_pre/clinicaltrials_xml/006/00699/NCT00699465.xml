	<brief_summary>- To evaluate the efficacy of using IPC during the acute phase of ICH in the prevention of VTE. - To assess the safety and efficacy of additional therapy with enoxaparin. - To compare the efficacy and safety of the European and American guideline recommendations. - To provide an efficient and safe thromboprophylaxis for several weeks until the patient is able to walk.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Although it has been poorly investigated, the risk of VTE among patients with acute primary intracerebral hemorrhage is generally believed to be at least as high as among patients with ischemic stroke. - The currently available guidelines state that while low doses of subcutaneous heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin may reduce VTE, it is possible that their effect is counterbalanced by an increase in hemorrhagic complications. - It is still unclear when (if ever) low-molecular-weight-heparin should be safely initiated in ICH patients.</detailed_description>
