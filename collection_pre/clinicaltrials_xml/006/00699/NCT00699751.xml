	<brief_title>A Phase III Study of Radium-223 Dichloride in Patients With Symptomatic Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer With Skeletal Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study was to compare, in patients with symptomatic hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) and skeletal metastases, the efficacy of best standard of care plus Radium-223 dichloride versus best standard of care plus placebo, with the primary efficacy endpoint being overall survival (OS). Patients were randomised in a 2:1 allocation ratio (Radium-223 dichloride:Placebo). The study treatment consisted of 6 intravenous administrations of Radium-223 dichloride or placebo (saline) each separated by an interval of 4 weeks. The patient were followed until 3 years after first study drug administration. Within the U.S., the trial was conducted under an IND sponsored by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals. All patients received BSoC (Best Standard of Care). This study has the original PCD as 14 October 2010, when a total of 316 deaths had been observed; this resulted in the Independent Data Monitoring Committee's (IDMC's) recommendation to stop the study as the primary efficacy analysis of overall survival had crossed the pre-specified boundary for efficacy. Later an updated analysis of primary endpoint in the first addendum was done with cut-off of 15 July 2011.</detailed_description>
