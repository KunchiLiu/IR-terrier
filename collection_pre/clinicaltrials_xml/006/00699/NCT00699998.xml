	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of prasugrel and clopidogrel in a medically managed Unstable Angina/Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (UA/NSTEMI) acute coronary syndrome (ACS) population (that is, patients who are not managed with acute coronary revascularization).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Prasugrel and Clopidogrel in Acute Coronary Syndrome Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based upon the significant number of subjects with UA/NSTEMI ACS who are managed medically and their high risk for future cardiovascular events, further exploration of novel treatment strategies for this population, who are under-represented in large clinical trials, is warranted. Potential subjects will be those with a recent UA/NSTEMI event who are to be medically managed. Eligibility for this study will be determined by both the timing of the medical management decision and by prior commercial clopidogrel treatment at the time of randomization. The TaRgeted platelet Inhibition to cLarify the Optimal strateGy to medicallY manage Acute Coronary Syndromes (TRILOGY ACS) Study will assess the efficacy and safety of prasugrel and aspirin compared to the current standard of care, clopidogrel and aspirin, for long-term treatment of medically managed UA/NSTEMI ACS subjects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Have had a Unstable Angina/NonSTElevation Myocardial Infarction (UA/NSTEMI) index event within 10 days prior to randomization Had a medical management strategy decision made with reasonable certainty that neither percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) nor coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is planned for treatment of the index event Had at least 1 of 4 specified highrisk features at the time of the UA/NSTEMI event Key Decision for medical management greater than 72 hours after onset of index event without commercial clopidogrel treatment within 72 hours following onset of the index event. Insignificant coronary artery disease (CAD) on coronary angiography if performed for Index Event (absence of greater than or equal to 30% stenosis in at least one native vessel) Previous or planned PCI or CABG as treatment for the index event PCI/CABG within previous 30 days STsegment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) as the index event Cardiogenic shock, Refractory ventricular arrhythmias, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV congestive heart failure (CHF) within the previous 24 hours History of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), Intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm History of spontaneous gastrointestinal (GI) or nonGI bleeding requiring hospitalization for treatment, unless definitive treatment has occurred and there is low likelihood of recurrence Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis</criteria>
