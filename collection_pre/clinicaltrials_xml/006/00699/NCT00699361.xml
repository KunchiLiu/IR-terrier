	<brief_summary>Recently literature revealed facts, that show H+/K+ ATPase expression is not limited tot he stomach. H+/K+ ATPase was also found in smooth muscle cells and in other tissues (McCabe, R.D. et al., Am J Physiol. 1992). For myocard a localisation is only proven for rats yet (Beisvag, V. et al., Acta Physiol Scand. 2003). Moreover biochemical hints lead us to a highly probability of a myocardial H+/K+ ATPase (Nagashima, R. et al., Jpn Heart J. 1999).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recently literature revealed facts, that show H+/K+ ATPase expression is not limited tot he stomach. H+/K+ ATPase was also found in smooth muscle cells and in other tissues (McCabe, R.D. et al., Am J Physiol. 1992). For myocard a localisation is only proven for rats yet (Beisvag, V. et al., Acta Physiol Scand. 2003). Moreover biochemical hints lead us to a highly probability of a myocardial H+/K+ ATPase (Nagashima, R. et al., Jpn Heart J. 1999). Aim of our clinical study is to examine, whether proton pump inhibitors have an influence on myocardial contraction of human myocard and we want to ascertain the amount of influence of a H+/K+ ATPase on myocardial contraction. Therefore the mechanism of a putative inhibition by proton pump inhibitors is at our focus. These findings will be of major credit regarding treatment of patients with congestive heart failure with common proton pump inhibitors. We want to find out, whether this intake may have a negative inotropic effect on the heart failure myocard.</detailed_description>
