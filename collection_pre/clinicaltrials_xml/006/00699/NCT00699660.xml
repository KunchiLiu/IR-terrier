	<brief_title>Enhancing Equitable and Effective (E-3) Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Disability Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our objective is to compare the process and outcomes of C&amp;P exams for PTSD conducted with CAPS and WHODAS-II interviews versus the PTSD exams conducted without the CAPS and WHODAS-II interviews. This project will conduct a randomized controlled trial on 688 veterans to evaluate the effects of the CAPS/WHODAS instruments on the initial PTSD C&amp;P examination process. Study outcomes include variation in assessing the DSM-IV components of PTSD, diagnostic accuracy, veteran perception of the exam process, VBA rater utility and resource utilization. This project will 1) demonstrate the feasibility of conducting program evaluation and intervention studies on the PTSD C&amp;P examination process, 2) develop research tools, instruments and methods for C&amp;P evaluation, 3) provide data on the value-added contribution of CAPS and WHODAS-II to the PTSD assessment process and examination report, and 4) inform the business case of utilizing the CAPS and WHODAS-II in the PTSD C&amp;P process. The ultimate aim is to improve the reproducibility, consistency and validity of the PTSD examination process while maintaining a level of efficiency and cost restraint that provides veterans with an exam process that is fair, accurate and equitable across VHA.</detailed_description>
