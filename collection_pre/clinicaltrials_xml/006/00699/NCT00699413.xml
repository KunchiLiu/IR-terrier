	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a combination of hydroxcycitrate (HCA) and niacin-bound chromium, in conjunction with nutrition education, over a twelve week period. Participants will be evaluated with regard to BMI, percent body fat, insulin activity, and hunger.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supplements for Controlling Resistance to Insulin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of obesity among youth has increased dramatically in recent years. Parallel to the increased rates of pediatric obesity, overweight children present clinically with adiposity related comorbidities such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The prevailing recommendations for overweight youth are to increase physical activity levels and limit energy intake in order to improve body composition. Currently there is little empirical evidence to support the efficacy of these recommendations. Alternatively, evidence in adults suggests that nutritional supplementation with (-) hydroxycitric acid (HCA), an organic acid found naturally in citrus fruits, and chromium may lead to favorable changes in body composition and improve glucose regulation. To date, these issues have not been tested in youth. Therefore, the purpose of the present investigation is to examine the effects of a nutritional education program combined with either HCA + chromium or placebo on measures of body composition and glucose regulation in overweight adolescents.</detailed_description>
