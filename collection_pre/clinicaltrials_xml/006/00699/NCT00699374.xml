	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of sunitinib (Arm A), given at 37.5 mg orally once daily, compared to sorafenib (Arm B), given orally at 400 mg twice daily, in patients with inoperable liver cancer. A total number of 1200 patients will be enrolled, 600 on Arm A and 600 on Arm B. Study treatment may be adjusted based on patient tolerance. and will be given until disease progression, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria are met. After discontinuation of study treatment, patients will be followed up in order to collect information on further antineoplastic therapy and survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Of Sunitinib Malate Versus Sorafenib In Patients With Inoperable Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was terminated on April 22th, 2010, based on a higher incidence of serious adverse events in the sunitinib arm compared to the sorafenib arm, and the fact that sunitinib did not meet the criteria to demonstrate that it was either superior or non-inferior to sorafenib in the survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular cancer. Patients on sunitinib who are judged by the investigator as receiving clinical benefit may chose to remain on study and continue treatment with sunitinib until clinical benefit as per the investigator's judgment.</detailed_description>
