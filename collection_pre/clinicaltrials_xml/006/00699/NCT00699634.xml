	<brief_summary>The purpose of this proposed study is to conduct a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial assessing the benefit of nabilone in pain management and improvement of quality of life in patients with phantom limb pain. Our Hypothesis is that the synthetic cannabinoid Nabilone will significantly reduce the phantom limb pain and improve quality of life, compared to the placebo controlled group. This will be evident by finding significant differences in Visual Analogue Scale pain scores, frequency of phantom pain episodes, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, and the Groningen Sleep Quality Scale and daily prosthetic wearing time.</brief_summary>
