	<brief_title>Psychological Symptoms in Patients With Behcet's Disease by SCL90-R</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>200 BD and 200 Non-BD patients were checked for psychological symptoms by Symptom Check List 90 Revised (SCL90-R). BD diagnosis was based on the new International Criteria for Behcet's Disease (ICBD). Non-BD patients were patients mimicking BD. All patients were asked to complete the SCL90-R when they attended the clinic for their routine follow-up. The demographic information and disease manifestations including ocular and neurological involvement were registered. For those with visual impairment, SCL90-R was applied by an interviewer. Frequencies and descriptive analysis were measured in both BD and Non-BD groups. Means and standard deviations (SD) of visual acuity were calculated. Data collected from SCL90-R did not have normal distribution in any dimension. The mean values of raw numbers, global severity index (GSI), the positive symptoms total (PST) and the positive symptom distress index (PSDI), were compared by Mann-Whitney U (M-W U) test.).To detect any bias in results due to data collection method, self reported data and reviewer collected data were compared.</detailed_description>
