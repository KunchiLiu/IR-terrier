	<brief_summary>Being a parent to a premature infant in NICU is an anxious state. Parents ask a lot of questions, and look for information all the time. Organizing the information given to parents could reduce their anxiety. The parents will be divided into two groups: one group will get organized information, by a lecture at the first week of their infant's life, and the other group will not. Of course, questions will be answered all the time. The parents will answer a questionnaire on the first week of the infant's life, and on the last week, just before releasing the infant home.</brief_summary>
