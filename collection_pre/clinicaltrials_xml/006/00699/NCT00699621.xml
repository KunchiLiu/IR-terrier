	<brief_summary>- To prove whether use of antiplatelet agents results into a rapid enlargement of hematoma after onset of acute intracerebral hemorrhage. - To prove the efficacy and safety of platelet transfusion for prevention of hematoma growth in patients who were stricken by acute intracerebral hemorrhage while being on antiplatelet medication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet Transfusion in Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Hematoma growth is a well-known powerful determinant of mortality and poor outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage. - Some observations suggest that previous use of antiplatelet agents associates with rapid hematoma enlargement and poor outcome after cerebral hemorrhage. - Immediate platelet transfusion for such patients may prevent hematoma growth but also cause thromboembolic complications.</detailed_description>
