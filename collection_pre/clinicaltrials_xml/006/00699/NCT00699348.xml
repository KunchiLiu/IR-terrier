	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of once-monthly administration of intravenous methoxy polyethylene glycolepoetin beta (Mircera) for the maintenance of hemoglobin levels in hemodialysis participants with chronic renal anemia. Participants currently receiving intravenous epoetin alfa or beta or darbepoetin alfa will receive intravenous Mircera at a starting dose of 120, 200 or 360 micrograms/month (based on the erythropoietin stimulating agent [ESA] dose administered on week -1). Subsequent doses will be adjusted to maintain hemoglobin levels within the target range of 10 to12 gram per deciliter (g/dL). The anticipated time on study treatment is 1-2 years, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
