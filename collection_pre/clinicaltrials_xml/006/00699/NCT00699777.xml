	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized, open-label, crossover study to assess the bioequivalence of 1 risedronate 150 mg tablet versus 2 risedronate 75 mg tablets administered as a single oral dose. Approximately 320 subjects will be enrolled from 4 study centers in the U.S.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assess Bioequivalence of One 150 mg Risedronate Tablet Versus Two 75 mg Risedronate Tablets in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The data to support the interchangeability of one risedronate 150 mg tablet versus two risedronate 75 mg tablets as monthly dose forms is primarily based on the similarity of in vitro dissolution and an in vivo study, which showed risedronate absorption is not dissolution rate limited. These results suggest that monthly dosing of risedronate may be accomplished by administration of either one risedronate 150 mg tablet or two risedronate 75 mg tablets. The purpose of this study is to provide additional clinical data to support the interchangeability of these 2 dose regimens.</detailed_description>
