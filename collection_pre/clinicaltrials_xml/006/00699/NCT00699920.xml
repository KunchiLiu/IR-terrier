	<brief_summary>Primary objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response at Day 28 of Coarsucam versus Coartem, based on the first malaria attack of each patient. Secondary objectives: For the first attack: To compare the 2 groups of treatment in terms of: - Day 42 efficacy - Parasitological and fever clearance - Clinical and Biological tolerability - Evolution of gametocyte carriage For attack 2nd and following: To compare the 2 groups of treatment in terms of: - Day 28 and Day 42 clinical and parasitological effectiveness - Clinical and Biological tolerability - Proportion of patients without fever at Day 3 - Proportion of patients without parasites at Day 3 - Evolution of gametocyte carriage - Compliance During the total follow up of the cohort: To compare the 2 groups of treatment in terms of: - Treatment incidence density - Impact of repeated treatment on clinical and biological tolerability - Impact on anaemia - Impact on Hackett score.</brief_summary>
