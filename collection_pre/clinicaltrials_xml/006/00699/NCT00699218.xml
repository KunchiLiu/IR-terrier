	<brief_summary>This is a pilot project to study if repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) will benefit patients with bipolar depression safely. Based on published studies, this study hypothesizes that rTMS on the left dorsal prefrontal lobe will improve symptoms in some patients who have failed at least two medications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study on Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) Treatment of Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Candidate with bipolar depression will be screened after signing informed consent. Those who meet the selection criteria will be treated with daily rTMS for 3 weeks and be followed-up at 2 weeks. Participants will keep their ongoing medication unless a medication significantly increases the possibility of seizure. They must be on the same dose of antidepressant medication for least 4 weeks without improvement of symptoms before being recruited into the study. Mood and other observed mental status will be measured by standard psychological scales.</detailed_description>
