	<brief_summary>There is general agreement that physical exercise can positively influence osteoporotic fracture risk along two pathways: first by reducing the risk of falls via an improvement of fall related neuromuscular abilities; second by increasing bone strength. Whole body vibration (WBV) training has recently been proposed as a new approach for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Animal studies have shown evidence that WBV may be an effective method to improve bone mass, architecture and strength. However, the results of human WBV training studies are rather heterogeneous. In the Erlangen Longitudinal Vibration Study II (ELVIS II), a randomized, controlled 12 month lasting study the investigators determine the effect of a thrice weekly WBV training on two different devices on the osteoporotic risk factors: bone mineral density, falls and neuromuscular performance. Particular the investigators compare a bipedal vertical oscillating Plate with a plate which rotates around a central axis leading to a side-alternating loaning.</brief_summary>
