	<brief_title>Costs &amp; Outcomes of Hospitalization/Treatment With Levalbuterol &amp; Albuterol in Asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a randomized, open-label study evaluating clinical and pharmacoeconomic outcomes in hospitalized patients with asthma or COPD who have been admitted due to an exacerbation of their disease and required further treatment with a beta2-adrenergic agonist. Approximately 430 patients were randomized and enrolled. Patients were then followed during their hospitalization. Once discharged, patient status was assessed via telephone interview 30 days after discharge. This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.</detailed_description>
