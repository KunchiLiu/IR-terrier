	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To investigate the biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and pharmacokinetics of two separate intravenous (IV) injections of Xofigo (100 kBq/kg body weight [b.w.] [=110 kBq/kg based on the 2015 National Institute of Standards and Technology standardization], 6 weeks apart). Secondary objectives: To determine the safety of IV injections of Xofigo after two separate injections (6 weeks apart), to evaluate treatment response (antitumour effect in osteoblastic bone metastases) of Xofigo treatment consisting of two injections of activity 100 kBq/kg b.w. (=110 kBq/kg based on the 2015 National Institute of Standards and Technology standardization), 6 weeks apart and to evaluate long term radiation toxicity and to collect survival data at 6 and 12 months after the first injection</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate Hormone refractory with evidence of rising prostatespecific antigen (PSA): Subject must be maintained on androgen ablation therapy with luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonist or have undergone bilateral orchiectomy Serum testosterone level required to be ≤50 ng/dL Subjects who have received prior antiandrogen drug therapy: Flutamide, nilutamide, or cyproterone acetate must have stopped at least 4 weeks prior to study drug administration and progression, as defined by rising PSA as defined below, must have been demonstrated since cessation; bicalutamide must have stopped at least 6 weeks prior to study drug administration and progression, as defined by rising PSA as defined below, must have been demonstrated since cessation PSA progression: Progressive rise in PSA, defined as two consecutive increases in PSA documented over a previous reference value (measure 1). The first increase in PSA (measure 2) should occur at a minimum of 1 week from the reference value (measure 1). This increase in PSA should be confirmed (measure 3) after a minimum of 1 week. If the confirmatory PSA value (measure 3) is less than the previous value, the subject will still be eligible provided the next PSA measure (measure 4) is found to be greater than the second PSA value (measure 2) Skeletal metastases confirmed by bone scintigraphy within the last 6 weeks Performance status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 02 Life expectancy: ≥6 months Laboratory requirements: Neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 109/L, platelet count ≥100 x109/L, haemoglobin ≥95 g/L, total bilirubin level within normal institutional limits, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤2.5 times upper institutional limit of the normal range, S Creatinine ≤1.5 times upper institutional limit of the normal range Has received an investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to the administration of radium223, or is scheduled to receive one during the treatment and posttreatment period Has received chemo, immunotherapy, or external radiotherapy within the last 4 weeks prior to administration of study drug, or has not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier More than one regimen of previous cytotoxic chemotherapy Has received prior hemibody external radiotherapy Has a need for immediate external radiotherapy Has received systemic radiotherapy with radium223, strontium89, samarium153, rhenium186 or rhenium188 for the treatment of bony metastases within the last year prior to administration of study drug Has started treatment with bisphosphonates less than 3 months prior to administration of study drug. Patients are allowed to be on bisphosphonates provided patient is on a stable dose for &gt;/= 12 weeks before administration of study drug Patients who are &lt;/= 4 weeks (6 weeks for bicalutamide) post withdrawal of antiandrogen therapy Patients who have started or stopped systemic steroids, within a week prior to study drug administration, or are expected to be subject to changes in the systemic steroid medication Other currently active (relapse within the last 3 years) malignancy (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) that are not prostate cancer metastases Visceral (e.g. liver, lung) metastases from prostate cancer as assessed by abdominal/ pelvic CT or chest radiograph within six weeks before administration of study drug Lymph node metastases with shortaxis diameter greater than 2 cm Bulky locoregional disease Any other serious illness or medical condition, for example: any uncontrolled infection, any patient who has clinical heart failure severe enough to cause marked limitation of activity, and who is only comfortable at rest; or any patient who has heart failure more severe than this (NYHA Heart Failure Class III or IV), Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis</criteria>
