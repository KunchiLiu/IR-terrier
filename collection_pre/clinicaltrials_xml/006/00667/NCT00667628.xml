	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether TAC-101 combined with Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) is more effective than TACE alone in slowing tumor activity in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The study is also looking at the safety of TAC-101 in combination with TACE.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study of TAC-101 Combined With Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) Versus TACE Alone in Japanese Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not treatable by surgical approaches or locoregional therapies such as hepatic artery hemoembolization or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) which are effective in controlling localized tumors. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most commonly performed procedure in the treatment of unresectable liver tumors for selected patients. The TACE procedure delivers highly concentrated drugs to the tumor itself and arrests blood flow. Most patients will have intrahepatic recurrence of their tumors following TACE. Studies of TAC-101, a synthetic retinoid, indicate that although TAC-101 may not induce tumor regression, it appears to have a stabilizing effect, prolonging survival over what was expected historically. This study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2 study in patients with advanced HCC who have undergone a TACE procedure, which will be conducted at multiple sites in Japan, to determine if administration of TAC-101 will enhance the benefits of the TACE procedure.</detailed_description>

Must be willing and able to comply with schedule visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. 12. Must provide written informed consent prior to the implementation of any study assessment or procedures. Patients will be excluded from participation in the study if any of the following conditions are observed before undergoing the first TACE procedure: 1. Patient has longest diameter of intrahepatic lesion ≥ 100 mm. 2. Patient has only infiltration type of HCC. 3. Patient has extrahepatic metastasis of HCC including regional lymph node metastases (including in lymph nodes and organs). 4. Patient had systemic chemotherapy (eg, sorafenib, doxorubicin), immunotherapy, or biologic therapy or radiotherapy for HCC, or treatment with TAC101. 5. Patient received treatment with any of the following within the specified time frame: Any major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to signing the ICF; Any transfusion, treatment with blood component preparation, albumin preparation, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) within 14 days prior to signing the ICF; Any local therapy such as alcohol injection, radiofrequency/ultrasound ablation, intraarterial chemotherapy (transcatheter arterial injection) for HCC performed within 28 days prior to signing the ICF; Any investigational agent within 28 days prior to signing the ICF. 6. Patient has ascites, pleural effusions or pericardial fluid refractory to diuretic therapy. 7. Patient has clinical symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. 8. Patient has active or uncontrolled clinically serious infection excluding chronic hepatitis. 9. Patient has a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in last 3 months. 10. Patient has previous or concurrent malignancy except for in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or other solid tumor treated curatively and without evidence of recurrence for at least 3 years prior to the study. 11. Patient has uncontrolled metabolic disorders or other nonmalignant organ or systemic diseases or secondary effects of cancer that induce a high medical risk and/or make assessment of survival uncertain. 12. Patient has any history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), transient ischemic attack (TIA), unstable angina pectoris, or any other significant thromboembolic event (TE) during the last 3 years. 13. Patient has clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality. 14. Patient has GI disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication. 15. Patient has known allergy or hypersensitivity to TAC101, doxorubicin, epirubicin, other anthracyclines, anthracenediones or any of the components used in the study drug formulations. 16.
