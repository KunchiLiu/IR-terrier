If the subject has systemic sclerosis resulting from an environmental exposure 2. If the subject has an autoimmune disease excluding scleroderma 3. If the subject has an active infection (including, but not limited to hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV) 4. If the subject has been treated with cyclophosphamide in the past 8 weeks. 5. If the subject is prone to bleeding because they are on medications that thin the blood or have a low platelet count.</criteria>
