	<brief_title>Lower Urinary Tract and Sexual Function in Women Following Surgery for Colorectal Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower urinary tract symptoms, including urinary incontinence, voiding dysfunction, urgency, frequency, fecal incontinence, as well as sexual dysfunction, are directly affected by surgery for colorectal disorders. Increased risk of injury to the urinary tract is a recognized complication of pelvic surgery. These risks are related to the radical nature of pelvic surgery used to treat certain colorectal disorders, including colorectal malignancies and inflammatory bowel disease. Few studies have looked at the incidence of lower urinary tract symptoms and sexual dysfunction in patients with colorectal conditions before and after surgery. The primary goal of this study is to determine the prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms in women undergoing surgery for colorectal ocnditions. We also want to describe the prevalence of these symptoms in different colorectal disorders, and how pelvic surgery impacts these symptoms.</detailed_description>
