All study volunteers must agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g., active attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization) and, if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the female study volunteer/male partner must use at least one reliable method of contraception (e.g., condoms, with or without a spermicidal agent; a diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide; an IUD; or hormonalbased contraception), simultaneously while receiving the protocolspecified medication(s) and for 6 weeks after stopping the medication(s). If oral birth control pills, hormone patches, or hormone injections are used for contraception, then a second method of contraception must be used.
