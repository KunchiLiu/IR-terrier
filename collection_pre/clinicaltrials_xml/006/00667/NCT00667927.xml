	<brief_summary>This study proposes to transfer marker genes (detectable genetic traits or segments of DNA that can be identified and tracked) into aliquots of marrow obtained for Bone Marrow Transplant (BTM) in patients in remission of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant for Children With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) in First Complete Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study was to estimate the continuous complete remission rate at 2 years post transplant for children with AML in first complete remission treated with autologous BMT. Secondary objectives used transduction of marker genes into autologous marrow to determine the following: 1. whether the source of relapse after BMT for AML is residual malignant cells in the harvested marrow or in the patient, and whether marrow purging is therefore rational. 2. whether the majority of AML, which lack genetic markers, represent abnormalities in a multi-lineage progenitor cell, and whether therefore, auto grafting/intensified chemotherapy is ever likely to augment the cure rate. 3. the mechanisms of autologous reconstitution, and the effects of stimuli which modify the process.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients aged between 1 and 18 years at diagnosis with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in first remission are eligible for this protocol. Patients enrolled on the AML87 study in second or subsequent remission are eligible for this protocol. Has an HLAmatched, MLCcompatible donor(unless parents and/or patient refuses transplant.
