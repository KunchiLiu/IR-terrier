	<brief_title>Safety Extension Study Of Leuprolide Acetate (Lupron Depot) In The Treatment Of Central Precocious Puberty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study includes a 36-month Study Drug Treatment Period (3-month treatment cycles), and a Safety Follow-up Period (12 weeks following the Month 36 visit). Participants will receive a total of twelve injections of the same treatment they received in the lead-in study, L-CP07-167 (NCT00635817) either leuprolide acetate 11.25 mg or 30 mg depot formulation. Each injection will be administered 3 months apart for up to 36 months of treatment. Study visits will occur on Day 1, Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 and 33 (1st through the 12th leuprolide acetate depot injections, respectively), Month 36, and 12 weeks later for the Safety Follow-up Visit.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject completed the Treatment Period of the leadin study, LCP07167 (NCT00635817), and has documented luteinizing hormone suppression as evidenced by peakstimulated luteinizing hormone &lt;4 mIU/mL at the Month 6 study visit of the leadin study. Demonstrated suppression of the physical signs of puberty at Month 6 of the leadin study. Subject is expected to receive at least 12 months of therapy to treat Central Precocious Puberty after study entry. In general good health with no uncontrolled, clinically significant disease which would interfere with bone maturation or mask the objectives of this protocol as assessed by the investigator. Incomplete precocious puberty, peripheral precocious puberty or evidence of any abnormal pituitary, hypothalamic, adrenal, thyroid and gonadal function (other than premature secretion of gonadotropins) not adequately controlled, unstable intracranial tumors except hamartoma. Bone age ≥14 years for girls and ≥15 years for boys (based on the Month 6 lead in study, LCP07167, radiographic results). Has an abnormal laboratory value suggesting a clinically significant underlying disease or condition. Chronic illness requiring treatment that may interfere with growth, ie, chronic steroid use, renal failure, moderate to severe scoliosis. Current therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Current therapy with growth hormone. Current therapy with insulinlike growth factor1 (IGF1). Current use of an estrogen preparation. Any concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may expose a subject to an unacceptable level of safety risk or that affects subject compliance. Subject has a positive pregnancy test.</criteria>
