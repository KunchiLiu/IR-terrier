	<brief_summary>Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. However, there remains no prospectively obtained data on the maximal time of effectiveness of vardenafil. The goal of the current study was to determine if vardenafil will significantly increase the percentage of successful intercourse attempts from 12 to 24 hours following dosing. A total of three time points 12, 18, and 24 hours were assessed in this pilot study to better quantify the effect of vardenafil.</brief_summary>
