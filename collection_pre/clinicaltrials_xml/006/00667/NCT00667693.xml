	<brief_summary>This study will compare the Macintosh laryngoscope with the Pentax. The Pentax AWS is a novel airway management device that is designed to facilitate laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pentax Airway Scope (AWS) Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>100 obese patients (BMI 30 to 50) requiring orotracheal intubation for elective surgery will be randomly allocated to intubation with either a conventional Macintosh laryngoscope or with the Pentax AWS. Our study hypothesis is that use of Pentax AWS will make tracheal intubation easier to perform in the obese surgical patient (BMI 30 to 50), as evidenced by the time to complete the intubation process as well as an "Ease of Use" visual analog score (VAS) measure.</detailed_description>
