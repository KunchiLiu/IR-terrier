	<brief_summary>This is a clinical trial examining the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of IV NPI-0052 (a proteasome inhibitor) in combination with oral vorinostat (Zolinza; a HDAC inhibitor) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma or lymphoma. Proteasome inhibitors block the breakdown of proteins by cells and HDAC inhibitors block modification of proteins regulating gene expression in cells. Both of these actions preferentially affect cancer cells, and the combination of the two has been seen to have a greater effect in laboratory studies.</brief_summary>

Signed informed consent. 1. Recent administration of chemotherapy, biological, immunotherapy or investigational agent, major surgery, or radiotherapy. 2. Intrathecal therapy. 3. Known brain metastases. 4. Significant cardiac disease. 5. Prior treatment with vorinostat or NPI0052, or other HDACi (including valproic acid) or proteasome inhibitors. 6. Known allergy to any component of vorinostat. Prior hypersensitivity reaction of CTCAE Grade &gt; 3 to therapy containing propylene glycol or ethanol. 7. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. 8. Concurrent, active secondary malignancy for which the patient is receiving therapy. 9. Significant active infection.</criteria>
