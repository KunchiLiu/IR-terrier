	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the PRESTIGE® LP Cervical Disc as a method of treating patients with symptoms of cervical degenerative disc disease at a single level from C3-C4 to C6-C7.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Safety &amp; Effectiveness of PRESTIGE® LP Cervical Disc vs. Anterior Cervical Fusion in Cervical DDD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pivotal clinical trial was conducted to compare treatment data of the investigational implant device,the PRESTIGE® LP Cervical Disc, with a control patient group receiving a plate. The PRESTIGE® LP Cervical Disc devices were implanted using an anterior surgical approach. Data from control patients receiving anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with an ATLANTIS Anterior Cervical Plate from the initial Artificial Cervical Disc study (NCT00642876) were compared as both treatment groups receive single-level surgical treatment from C3-C4 to C6-C7 for symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Has cervical degenerative disc disease as defined as: intractable radiculopathy and/or myelopathy with at least one of the following items producing symptomatic nerve root and/or spinal cord compression that is documented by patient history: a) herniated disc; b) osteophyte formation One level requiring surgical treatment C3C4 disc to C6C7 disc level involvement Unresponsive to nonoperative treatment for six weeks or presence of progressive symptoms or signs of cord compression No previous surgical procedures at the involved level or any planned surgical procedure at the involved or adjacent level. Preop Neck Disability index score ≥ 30 Preop Neck Pain score of ≥ 20 based on the Preop Neck &amp; Arm Pain Questionnaire Not pregnant at time of surgery Willing and able to comply with study plan and able to understand and sign patient informed consent Any other cervical spinal condition requiring surgical treatment at the involved level Documented or diagnosed cervical instability defined by radiographs showing 1. Sagittal plane translation &gt; 3.5mm or 2. Sagittal plane angulation &gt; 20 degrees. More than one cervical level requiring surgery A fused level adjacent to the level to be treated Severe pathology of the facet joint of involved bodies Previous surgery at the involved level Previously diagnosed osteopenia or osteomalacia Any of the following that may be associated with an osteoporosis diagnosis (if "Yes" to any of these, a DEXA Scan will be required to determine eligibility) 1. Postmenopausal nonBlack female over 60 years of age and weighs less than 140 pounds 2. Postmenopausal female that has sustained a nontraumatic hip, spine, or wrist fracture 3. Male over the age of 70 4. Male over the age of 60 that has sustained a nontraumatic hip or spine fracture. If the level of Bone Mineral Density is a T score of 3.5 or lower or a T score of 2.5 or lower with the vertebral crush fracture, then the patient is excluded. Presence of spinal metastases Overt or active bacterial infection, either local or systemic Severe insulin dependent diabetes Chronic or acute renal failure or history of renal disease Temperature &gt; 101º F oral at surgery Documented allergy to stainless steel, titanium or a titanium alloy Mentally incompetent Is a prisoner Is pregnant Is an alcohol and/or drug abuser Has received drugs which may interfere with bone metabolism within 2 weeks prior to the planned surgery date (steroids, methotrexate), excluding routine preop antiinflammatories) A history of endocrine or metabolic disorder known to affect osteogenesis A condition that requires postop medications that interfere with the stability of the implant (steroids). This does not include low dose aspirin therapy. Received treatment with an investigational therapy within 28 days prior to surgery or planned for 16 weeks following implantation.</criteria>
