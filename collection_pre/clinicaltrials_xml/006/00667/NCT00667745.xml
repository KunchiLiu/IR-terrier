	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Lithium Plus Optimized Medication in Treating People With Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar illness, a brain disorder that causes dramatic changes in a person's mood and energy, affects about 2.6% of adults in the United States. Bipolar disorder is characterized by cyclical periods of extreme highs and lows, known as episodes of mania and depression. A person undergoing an episode of mania often experiences euphoric moods, increased energy, and aggressive behaviors, while a person in a depressed state often experiences low moods, lack of energy, and feelings of sadness. Lithium is a widely used mood stabilizing medication that has been shown to reduce the occurrence and intensity of manic episodes and may lessen depressive episodes as well. Including lithium as a part of a personalized medication treatment approach may be the most effective means of improving symptoms of bipolar disorder. This study will evaluate whether lithium included as part of optimized medication treatment improves overall level of illness, symptoms of mania and depression, and quality of life in people with bipolar disorder. Participation in this study lasted for 6 months. All participants had an initial assessment that included an interview and questionnaires to confirm a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, vital sign measurements, a blood draw, and if female, pregnancy. Eligible participants were then assigned randomly to receive either optimized medication plus lithium or optimized medication without lithium. Participants in both groups received 6 months of monitored treatment with their medication regimens, as prescribed by their study doctor. Participants attended study visits every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks and then once a month for 4 more months. These visits lasted between 45 and 60 minutes and included medication adjustments and questions about symptoms, side effects, and quality of life.
