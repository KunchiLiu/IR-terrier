	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Titrated Oral Misoprostol Solution for Labor Augmentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous labor course necessitate augmentation when uterine contractions are inadequate. When the cervix is favorable, labor augmentation attempts are more likely to be successful. Augmentation is these women is traditionally undertaken with intravenous oxytocin and amniotomy, either alone or in combination. In our previous trial, it has been proven that the method of titrated oral misoprostol is associated with a lower incidence of uterine hyperstimulation and a lower cesarean delivery rate than vaginal misoprostol for labor induction in patients with unfavorable cervix. Because administering Misoprostol solution is easy and cost saving, it is worth to develop this novel method in labor augmentation.</detailed_description>
