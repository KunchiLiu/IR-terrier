	<brief_summary>Prospective, interventional cohort study of drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) to evaluate the upper airway in a cohort of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) surgical patients. This study has investigated the reliability of this technique, demonstrating moderate-substantial interrater and test-retest reliability. This research has also compared DISE findings to those of the lateral cephalogram X-ray and examined DISE findings in individuals who have not responded to previous sleep apnea surgery. These papers have been published and available through PubMed. Additional research is ongoing, with examination of DISE findings, comparison to other evaluation techniques, and the association between DISE findings and surgical outcomes.</brief_summary>
