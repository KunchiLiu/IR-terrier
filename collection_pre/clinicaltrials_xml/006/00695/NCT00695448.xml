	<criteria>Written informed consent provided. 18 years old or older. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of solid tumor malignancy or lymphoma that is not responsive to accepted standard therapies or for which there is no standard or curative therapy. Performance Status score of 0 or 1 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. A life expectancy of &gt; 12 weeks. Able to swallow and retain oral medication. A male is eligible to enter and participate in the study if he either: agrees to abstain from sexual intercourse from the first dose of study drug and until 21 days after last dose of study medication, or agrees to use a condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault cap) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository from the first dose of study drug and until 21 days after last dose of study medication, or is surgically sterile. NOTE: Male patients must use contraception to prevent pregnancy in a female partner and prevent exposure of any partner to semen by any means (refer to protocol). A female is eligible to enroll in the study if she is of: Nonchild bearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant) including any woman who is characterized by at least one of the following: Has had a hysterectomy Has had a bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy) Has had a bilateral tubal ligation Is postmenopausal (total cessation of menses for ≥ 1 year) Childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and agrees to one of the following from at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug and until 21 days after last dose of study medication: Use an intrauterine device (IUD) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year. Have intercourse only with a vasectomized partner who is sterile and is the sole sexual partner for that woman. Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse. Use double barrier contraception defined as condom with spermicidal jelly, foam, suppository, or film; OR diaphragm with spermicide; OR male condom and diaphragm. NOTE: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential for drugdrug interaction. Adequate organ system function as defined in the protocol. Use of an investigational anticancer drug within 28 days or 5 halflives preceding the first dose of GSK1059615. Chemotherapy within the last 3 weeks (6 weeks for prior nitrosourea or mitomycin C). Chemotherapy regimens given continuously or on a weekly basis with limited potential for delayed toxicity are permitted with approval of the GSK medical monitor if administered at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Trastuzumab within the last 4 weeks. Any major surgery, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy within the last 4 weeks. Prior use of any PI3K inhibitor. Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to the study drug. (To date there are no known FDA approved drugs chemically related to GSK1059615). Current use of a prohibited medication or requires any of these medications during treatment with GSK1059615 as per protocol. Current use of warfarin for therapeutic anticoagulation. NOTE: Low molecular weight heparin and prophylactic lowdose warfarin are permitted. PT/PTT must meet the inclusion criteria. Patients taking warfarin must have their INR followed closely. Presence of an active gastrointestinal disease or other condition known to interfere significantly with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs. Unresolved toxicity greater than Grade 1 from previous anticancer therapy except alopecia. Patients with stable Grade 2 neuropathy can be enrolled with approval by the GSK Medical Monitor. QTc interval ≥ 480 msecs. History of acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina and myocardial infarction), atrial fibrillation, coronary angioplasty, or stenting within the past 24 weeks. Class II, III, or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system. Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases. Patients previously treated for these conditions who are asymptomatic and off of corticosteroid and P450inducing antiepileptic medication for at least 2 months are permitted. Primary malignancy of the central nervous system. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit compliance with the protocol.
