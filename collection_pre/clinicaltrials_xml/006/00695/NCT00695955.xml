	<brief_title>One-Year Safety and Tolerability Study of Azilsartan Medoxomil in Participants With Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension affects approximately 50 million individuals in the United States. As the population ages, the prevalence of hypertension will continue to increase if broad and effective preventive measures are not implemented. According to the World Health Organization, hypertension is the most common attributable cause of preventable death in developed nations, as uncontrolled hypertension greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and renal failure. Despite the availability of antihypertensive treatments, hypertension remains inadequately controlled; only about one-third of patients continue to maintain control successfully. Takeda Global Research and Development is developing TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil) for the treatment of essential hypertension. This study is being conducted to demonstrate the long-term safety and tolerability of azilsartan medoxomil in individuals with essential hypertension. Study participation is anticipated to be approximately 1 year and 1.5 months, and participants will be required to return to the clinic for 10 study visits.</detailed_description>
