	<brief_summary>This study aims to compare the performance of the tuberculin skin test, used for more than 50 years as a diagnostic tool for latent tuberculosis infection, with 2 blood tests which have recently become commercially available (Interferon-gamma release assays) in a population of immunosuppressed individuals with chronic renal failure undergoing long term hemodialysis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection of Latent Tuberculosis in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study includes all adults aged over 18 years of age who accept to be included in the study and provided written informed consent. All patients are under long term hemodialysis for chronic renal failure. They are subjected to a questionnaire including history of contacts with tuberculosis (TB), prior treatment for TB, history of prior tuberculin skin testing, history of BCG vaccination, country of origin, trips or prolonged stays in high incidence areas, smoking history, and medications. All patients will have a chest X-ray, and simultaneous testing with the tuberculin skin test according to the Mantoux technique, and with the T-SPOT. TB and QuantiFERON Gold in tube Interferon-gamma release assays. The study analysis agreement between tests, detection of prior TB and presumptive latent tuberculosis infection, based on these items.</detailed_description>
