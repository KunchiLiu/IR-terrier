	<brief_title>Effects of Cranberry Extractive on the Lipid Profiles in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypercholesterolemia is a notorious risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It had been reported cranberry consumption increased nearly 8% of circulating high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in non-diabetic subjects. Although characteristics of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL and high triglyceride, the benefits of concentrated powder of cranberry juice on lipid profiles were not evident in type 2 diabetic subjects with diet control alone. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of cranberry on lipid profiles in type 2 diabetic subjects using oral anti-diabetic drugs have never been studied, especially total to HDL cholesterol ratio which is important in predicting cardiovascular diseases in Asian and/or diabetic population. Furthermore, cranberry has anti-oxidative effect which is associated with reduction of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) cholesterol in non-diabetes. Therefore, we conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to assess the effect of cranberry on lipid profiles in type 2 diabetes.</detailed_description>
