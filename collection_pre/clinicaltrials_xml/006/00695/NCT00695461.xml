	<brief_summary>Intestinal pathogenes are often involved in postoperative complications after colon surgery. Probiotic bacteria, i e live bacteria which have beneficial effects on the host when ingested, have been shown to reduce bacterial translocation in animal studies. However, in humans studies results have varied. The purpose with this study was to find whether high doses of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v affects the potentially pathogenic microflora of the gut, bacterial translocation and cell proliferation in patients undergoing planned colon surgery.</brief_summary>
