	<brief_summary>Many pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass for repair of complex congenital malformations, require inotropic support for low cardiac output syndrome. Milrinone through its positive inotropic and vasodilatory effects is widely used for this purpose. The aim of the study is to compare Milrinone with Levosimendan, a novel inotope with calcium-sensitizing properties. We hypothesized that using Levosimendan would result in reduced serum lactate through a higher cardiac index.</brief_summary>
