	<brief_title>Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes - a Cross Sectional Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It has been estimated that 1 billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. It is well known that vitamin D deficiency causes osteoporosis, increases the risk of fracture and causes muscle weakness. But there is now evidence that calcium malnutrition and hypovitaminosis D are predisposing conditions for various common chronic diseases such as malignancies (particularly colon, breast and prostate) chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disease (inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis) as well as metabolic disorders (metabolic syndrome, hypertension). It has also been reported that vitamin D deficiency may predispose to glucose intolerance, altered insulin secretion and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study is to determine vitamin D status among type 2 diabetics in our outpatient clinic and examine the relationship between vitamin D status , calcium and phosphorous metabolism, inflammatory markers, glycemic control, blood pressure and lipid profile. Moreover the patients are asked to answer a questionnaire regarding lifestyle, exercise, sun exposure and food intake.</detailed_description>
