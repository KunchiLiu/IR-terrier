	<brief_title>Irinotecan, Carboplatin, and Sunitinib in First Line Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irinotecan/platinum regimens are emerging as standard treatments for patients with extensive-stage disease. The irinotecan/carboplatin doses that will be used in this study have been used in two previous Phase II SCLC trials, and were found to be extremely well tolerated (Thompson et al. 2005; Spigel et al. 2007). Adding a novel, minimally toxic agent to this regimen may further enhance efficacy in this patient population without contributing to toxicity. This trial will evaluate the use of sunitinib following 6 cycles of treatment with chemotherapy in the treatment of SCLC. The trial will be performed under the leadership of SCRI, a community-based, multi-center, clinical trial organization.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Cytologically and/or histologically confirmed smallcell lung cancer with extensivestage disease. 2. Measurable or evaluable disease. 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 01. 4. Adequate bone marrow function, as defined by: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1,500/µL; platelets &gt;100,000/µL; hemoglobin &gt;=9.0 g/dL. 5. Normal organ function, defined as follows: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;=2.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), or AST and ALT &lt;=5 × the ULN if liver function abnormalities are due to underlying malignancy; total serum bilirubin &lt;=1.5 × the ULN; serum creatinine &lt;=1.5 × the ULN. 6. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior therapy or surgical procedures to grade &lt;=1. 7. Women of childbearing potential and men with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a form of birth control that is acceptable to their physician to prevent pregnancy during treatment. 8. Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and sign an informed consent form. 9. Patients who have treated brain metastases &gt;=4 weeks out (with surgery and/or radiation therapy) and who have no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) progression. Steroid use should be discontinued before study treatment begins. 1. Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 2. Patients may not have received other agents (either investigational or marketed) which act by antiangiogenic mechanisms. Angiogenesis inhibitors include (but are not limited to): thalidomide, sorafenib, bevacizumab. 3. Patients who have had previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy for extensivestage disease will be excluded. Palliative radiation (e.g., for bone disease) or radiation for cranial metastasis is acceptable if the patient has recovered from any adverse effects. 4. Previous treatment with sunitinib. 5. Myocardial infarction, severe or unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attack), or pulmonary embolism within 6 months prior to study initiation. 6. Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade &gt;=2, atrial fibrillation of any grade, or prolongation of the QTc interval to &gt;450 msec (for males) or &gt;470 msec (for females). 7. Uncontrolled hypertension (i.e., blood pressure &gt;150 mm Hg that cannot be controlled with standard antihypertensive agents). 8. Active brain metastasis. (Patients who had brain metastases treated with radiation or surgery and have no evidence of progressive brain metastases at least 4 weeks later are eligible). 9. Patients who have had major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury with 28 days (4 weeks) of study initiation.</criteria>
