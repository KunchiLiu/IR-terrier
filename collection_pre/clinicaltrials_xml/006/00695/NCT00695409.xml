	<brief_summary>This phase II clinical trial studies how well yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan, rituximab, and high-dose chemotherapy followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant in treating patients with relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan and rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can find tumor cells and carry tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving monoclonal antibody therapy, radioimmunotherapy (RIT), and high-dose combination chemotherapy before a peripheral blood stem cell transplant may be an effective treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the progression free/relapse free survival and overall survival probabilities among patients with poor risk/relapsed follicular lymphoma (grade 1-3), mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and transformed low-grade lymphoma who undergo radioimmunotherapy (RIT) based autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). II. To evaluate hematopoietic recovery, using neutrophil (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &gt;= 500 x 10^3/ul, ANC &gt;= 1000 x 10^3/ul) and unmaintained platelet (&gt;= 20 x 10^3/ul, &gt;= 100 x 10^3/ul) engraftment as primary criterion, following RIT based autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). III. To characterize early and late pulmonary, cardiac and hepatic toxicities during the first 100 days post ASCT and again one year post ASCT. IV. To evaluate the response rate and the disease progression/relapse rate in patients treated with RIT based ASCT. V. To evaluate long-term incidence of myelodysplasia and therapy related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with this new preparative regimen. VI. To descriptively compare the outcomes of patients treated on this protocol to a comparable patient population treated with chemotherapy alone. VII. To perform exploratory studies on expression of costimulatory molecules before and after RIT based ASCT. OUTLINE: RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients receive yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan intravenously (IV) following rituximab IV on day -14. HIGH-DOSE COMBINATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive carmustine IV on days -7 and -6; etoposide IV over 1 hour twice daily (BID) and cytarabine IV over 2 hours BID on days -5 to -2; and melphalan IV on day -1. STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant on day 0. Patients also receive rituximab on day 8*. NOTE: * Some patients may also receive rituximab on day -1. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>
