	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see how well patients tolerate the side effects of treatment with Floxuridine, Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan. We also want to know if these methods used together are a useful way of treating cancer. We have studied these drugs and know the best doses of each when they are used alone. We do not yet know how well the drugs work with each other. This study will tell us the best doses of each drug when they are given over the same period of time.</brief_summary>
