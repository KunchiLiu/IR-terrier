	<brief_summary>This randomized controlled trial was designed to investigate whether a daily training session using a bedside cycle ergometer, started early in stable critically ill patients with an expected prolonged ICU stay, could induce a beneficial effect on exercise performance, quadriceps force and functional autonomy at ICU and hospital discharge compared to a standard physiotherapy program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Exercise Training in Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inactivity during prolonged bed rest leads to muscle dysfunction. Muscle function decreases even faster in ICU patients due to inflammation, pharmacological agents (corticosteroids, muscle relaxants, neuromuscular blockers, antibiotics), and the presence of neuromuscular syndromes, associated with critical illness. A recent recommendation document advices to start early with active and passive exercise in critically ill patients. However, no evidence is available concerning the feasibility of an early muscle training intervention in the acute ICU phase when patients are still under sedation. A rather new method to train bed-bound patients is the use of a bedside cycle ergometer. This randomized controlled trial was designed to investigate whether a daily training session using a bedside cycle ergometer, started early in stable critically ill patients with an expected prolonged ICU stay, could induce a beneficial effect on exercise performance, quadriceps force and functional autonomy at ICU and hospital discharge compared to a standard physiotherapy program.</detailed_description>
