	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and urine from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This research study is evaluating kidney damage in patients receiving cisplatin and ifosfamide for solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Kidney Damage in Patients Receiving Cisplatin and Ifosfamide for Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Identify and evaluate the early biomarkers of renal toxicity in patients with solid tumors treated with cisplatin and ifosfamide. Secondary - Correlate the modification of biomarker studies and blood concentrations of cisplatin. OUTLINE: Patients receive standard chemotherapy comprising cisplatin and/or ifosfamide. Blood and urine samples are collected on days 1 and 2 (or day 3 if receiving ifosfamide only) during the first 3 courses. Samples are analyzed to determine plasma concentrations of residual cisplatin and to obtain urinary-protein profiles to measure renal toxicity.</detailed_description>
