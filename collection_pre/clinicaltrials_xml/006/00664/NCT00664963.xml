	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the treatment with balloon-expandable YUKON-BTX-Sirolimus-eluting stent over the treatment with YUKON-BTX uncoated stent in patients with ischemic infrapopliteal arterial disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>YUKON-drug-eluting Stent Below The Knee - Randomised Double-blind Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on the fact that drug eluting stents have been proven to reduce the restenosis rate in the coronary arteries, we assume that YUKON-BTX-Sirolimus-eluting stent has a superior restenosis rate compared to treatment with uncoated stent in the below-the-knee arteries consecutively. The purpose of this study is to compare the restenosis rate of the treatment with balloon-expandable YUKON-BTX-Sirolimus-eluting stent over the treatment with YUKON-BTX uncoated stent in patients with ischemic infrapopliteal arterial disease. Randomisation will be performed by extremity, that may lead to varying treatments within one patient during the study.</detailed_description>
