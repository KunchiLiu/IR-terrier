	<brief_title>Resurfacing Hemiarthoplasty Versus Conventional Stemmed Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this multi-centered, randomized, controlled trial will be to determine if patient self-assessed outcomes (Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of Shoulder Score- WOOS) following humeral resurfacing are superior to those following a conventional, modular, stemmed, humeral prosthesis. The first phase of this study will be a one year pilot recruitment period. This is necessary in order to determine both a center by center, and national recruitment rate, and to determine a sample size necessary for a sufficiently powered full randomized trial. If a full randomized trial is not considered feasible following Phase 1, then a prospective cohort study will be completed.</detailed_description>
