	<brief_title>Joint Stiffness Following Knee Replacement Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After total knee replacement surgery, some people develop joint stiffness, which is also called a joint contracture. Contractures cause the envelope of the knee (called the capsule) to stiffen and become rigid so the patient can no longer move their knee the way they used to. After stretching and other exercises, only a surgery can try and divide or remove the contracture. The main purpose of this research is to study the cause of the contracture and specifically if certain people are predisposed to contractures.</detailed_description>
