	<brief_summary>Following the licensure of sanofi pasteur's 90 µg rgA/Vietnam/1203/2004 pandemic influenza vaccine, efforts to develop a lower antigen dose formulation with improved immunogenicity using adjuvants were initiated. The present study is part of this endeavor. It is primarily a formulation/dose-finding study with a secondary aim at generating safety and immunogenicity data for the final formulation for the development of a pre-pandemic vaccine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Different Formulations of an Intramuscular A/H5N1 Inactivated, Split Virion Influenza Adjuvanted Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, observer-blinded, randomized, controlled multicenter, dose-finding study in adult subjects. All vaccines will be administered as a two-dose schedule in (H5N1) immunologically-naïve adults. Immunogenicity and safety will be evaluated after each injection.</detailed_description>
