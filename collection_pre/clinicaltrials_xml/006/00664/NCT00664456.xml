	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Giving luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist together with an iodine I 125 implant may be an effective treatment for patients with prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well giving luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy together with an iodine I 125 implant works with or without additional luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy in treating patients with previously untreated prostate cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To evaluate the biochemical progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, clinical PFS, and disease-free survival of patients with previously untreated intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy and permanent iodine I 125 implantation with vs without adjuvant LHRH agonist therapy. - To determine the non-adaptive interval to salvage therapy in patients treated with these regimens. - To determine the safety of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive neoadjuvant luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy for up to 3 months and undergo permanent iodine I 125 implantation. Patients then receive adjuvant LHRH agonist therapy for up to 9 months. - Arm II: Patients receive neoadjuvant LHRH agonist therapy and undergo permanent iodine I 125 implantation as in arm I.</detailed_description>
