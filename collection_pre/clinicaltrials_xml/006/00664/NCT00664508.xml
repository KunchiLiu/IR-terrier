	<brief_summary>Much research has shown that patients are generally satisfied with pain relief in the months and years following a total hip replacement (THR) or hip resurfacing procedure. However, many express dissatisfaction with their ability to perform daily activities, a reduced walking ability and long-term lower extremity muscle weakness. Given the general lack of knowledge surrounding joint motion of the lower extremities in the THR population, there is a need to characterize the joint mechanics of people having undergone THR, so that interventions and rehabilitation strategies can be designed to reduce post-operative complications and improve mobility.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>15 patients between the ages of 50 and 75 yrs having undergone a primary total hip replacement or hip resurfacing within 6 to 18 months of the study will participate, as well as an equal number of age, sex, height and weight matched healthy control participants. Potential participants for the control group will be asked if they have had previous lower limb ailments or surgery, and if they have they will be excluded. Moreover, the THR participants cannot have had secondary hip replacement due to infection, revision surgery, or a concomitant surgical procedure (i.e., graft). Participants from both groups cannot have had any medical conditions which could affect physical movement such as a stroke.</criteria>
