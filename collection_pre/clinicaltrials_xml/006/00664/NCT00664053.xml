	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether muscle strength and balance will improve in women with frailty selected for dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels below 550 ng/dl treated with DHEAS supplementation and Hatha yoga. Investigators believe the effects of both treatments will improve outcomes more than either treatment alone and may be additive; in addition, lean body mass, skeletal muscle mass, markers of bone turnover and physical performance will improve following treatment with DHEA and/or yoga.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of DHEA/Exercise on Bone, Muscle and Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS) and yoga may mitigate or reverse the effects of aging and frailty on bone, muscle and balance loss. The mechanism of the effects may be direct - working through androgen or estrogen receptors in bone, muscle or brain. Or the effects may be indirect, countering effects of the stress response. The specific aims of this study are: 1. To determine the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) supplementation and/or Hatha yoga on muscle strength, balance, body composition and physical performance measures over 6 months in women with osteopenia and some degree of frailty 2. To determine the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) supplementation and/or Hatha yoga on function (physical and cognitive), bone metabolism, and cardiovascular risk factors.</detailed_description>
