	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of rasburicase in terms of prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia related to Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) in 2 populations of adult patients, previously treated or not with urate oxidase, with relapsing aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and at risk of TLS, presenting with hyperuricemia and/or bulky disease at diagnostic of relapse. The secondary objectives were to : - evaluate the efficacy of rasburicase in terms of renal protection, - evaluate the safety of rasburicase in the two cohorts of patients, - correlate efficacy and safety results with antibodies generation/level.</brief_summary>
