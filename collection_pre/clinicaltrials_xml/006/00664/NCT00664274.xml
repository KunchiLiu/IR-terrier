	<brief_title>Relation of Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Genotype and Response to Cognitive Remediation Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive deficits play a crucial role in both the pathogenesis and prognosis of schizophrenia. The COMT gene is functionally expressed in neural systems considered important in a range of healthy brain functions and brain disorders, including schizophrenia. The COMT Met allele has been shown to be associated with a lower activity form of COMT, and with better performance on neurocognitive tests, while the COMT Val allele is associated with poorer executive cognition. This study will investigate the relationship of COMT polymorphism in patients with chronic schizophrenia with the response to CRT targeting visuospatial processing, attention, and cognitive flexibility using MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) developed by the NIH-MATRICS initiative.</detailed_description>
