	<brief_title>Phase IIa Trial to Determine the Effects of Bardoxolone Methyl on Renal Function in Patients With Diabetic Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bardoxolone methyl is an Antioxidant Inflammation Modulator in clinical development for inflammation and cancer-related indications that inhibits immune-mediated inflammation by restoring redox homeostasis in inflamed tissues. It induces the cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2 and suppresses the activities of the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory transcription factors NF-kB and the STATs. In vivo, bardoxolone has demonstrated significant single agent anti-inflammatory activity in several animal models of inflammation such as renal damage in the cisplatin model and ischemia-reperfusion model of acute renal injury. In addition, significant reductions in serum creatinine have been observed in patients treated with bardoxolone. Based on these data, it is hypothesized that bardoxolone can improve renal function in patients with diabetic nephropathy through suppression of renal inflammation and improvement of glomerular filtration.</detailed_description>

Patient has any concurrent clinical conditions that in the judgment of the investigator could either potentially pose a health risk to the patient while involved in the study or could potentially influence the study outcome; 8. Patient has known hypersensitivity to any component of the study drug; 9. Patient has known allergy to iodine; 10. Patient has undergone diagnostic or intervention procedure requiring a contrast agent within the last 30 days prior to entry into the study; 11. Change or doseadjustment in any of the following medications: ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II blockers, nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or COX2 inhibitors within 3 months; other antihypertensive, and other antidiabetic medications within 6 weeks prior to entry into the study; 12. Patient has a history of drug or alcohol abuse or has positive test results for any drug of abuse (positive urine drug test and/or alcohol breathalyzer test). 13.

Patient must have been off the aforementioned medications for a minimum of two weeks prior to enrollment. 14. Patient with an intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level &gt; 300 pg/mL. 15. Patient has participated in another clinical study involving investigational or marketed products within 30 days prior to entry into the study or would concomitantly participate in such a study. 16. Patient is unable to communicate or cooperate with the Investigator due to language problems, poor mental development or impaired cerebral function.</criteria>
