	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Because of its success in advanced NSCLC both as a single agent and in combination with other chemotherapeutics, it is reasonable to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel as a multimodality regimen in this patient population. Docetaxel at a dose of 20 mg/m2 appears to be a well-tolerated "weekly" dose when combined with either cisplatin 25 mg/m2 20-22 or carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 2 23-25 concomitant with radiation therapy. PURPOSE: To explore the potential benefits of the radiosensitizing effects of weekly docetaxel/carboplatin/radio therapy concurrent therapy followed full dose systemic docetaxel/carboplatin consolidation therapy on overall response rate, survival, progression-free survival, safety and toxicity in patients with locally advanced NSCLC.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the overall survival (0S) for advanced NSCLC patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel, carboplatin and radiation therapy followed by two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with docetaxel and carboplatin. Secondary - To determine the overall response rate in patients treated with this regimen. - To determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen. - To assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: - This is a Phase II, open label, multi-center study to determine the overall survival rate for patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel, carboplatin and radiation followed by two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with docetaxel and carboplatin. Eligible patients will receive concurrent therapy with docetaxel (20 mg/m2) administered weekly for seven weeks as a 30-minute intra-venous (IV) infusion followed by carboplatin (AUC 2) administered weekly for seven weeks as a 30-minute IV infusion. Concurrent radiation therapy will be administered at a dose of 1.8 Gy daily 5 days/week for 25 fractions followed by a dose of 2.0 Gy daily, 5 days/week for 9 fractions (total of 34 fractions). There will be a three-week rest period following the end of the concurrent chemotherapy after which the consolidation phase will begin. During this phase of the study, patients will be treated with docetaxel (75 mg/m2) administered as a 1-hour IV infusion followed by carboplatin (AUC 6) administered as a 30-minute IV infusion. Patient will be treated every three weeks for a total of two cycles.</detailed_description>
