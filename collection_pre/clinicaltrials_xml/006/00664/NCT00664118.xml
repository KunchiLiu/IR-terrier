	<brief_summary>Accumulating evidence indicated that neuraxial analgesia in the latent phase of the first stage of labor would be an effective and safe health care procedure for nulliparas. Doulas, women with labor experience trained for parturients, is a new way to alleviate the psychological stress from the laboring pain. Previous data in our study showed that doula accompany is a good method in shortening the progress of labor used in the active phrase of the first stage of labor, and decreasing the rate of cesarean delivery. Investigators hypothesized that doula combined neuraxial (epidural) analgesia in the latent phrase would be a superior means for effective pain relief, decreased rate of cesarean section, and shortened duration of labor.</brief_summary>
