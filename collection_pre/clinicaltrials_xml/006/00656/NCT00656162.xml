	<brief_summary>Fractures of an elbow are common in children. Accurate initial diagnosis is crucial for the management of the fractures of an elbow. In young children the fractures may be suspected clinically but missed on x-rays due to mostly non-ossified cartilage that is not visible on a regular x-ray. We propose that every x-ray negative, but clinically suspicious elbow trauma in children can be additionally evaluated using high resolution US.</brief_summary>
