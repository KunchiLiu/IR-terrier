	<brief_summary>Adequate administration of drugs via dry powder inhalers is dependent on adequate inspiratory flow rates and volumes. These vary according to the device being used and its resistance. The dry powder inhaler device under investigation is a device approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (ARTG no. 196255) for use with dry powder mannitol. Dry powder mannitol is currently being investigated as a treatment for bronchiectasis. We wish to measure the inspiratory flow characteristics of both the low and high resistance devices amongst a group of subjects with bronchiectasis. We propose that the majority of subjects investigated with varying lung function will achieve adequate flow during a controlled inspiration.</brief_summary>
