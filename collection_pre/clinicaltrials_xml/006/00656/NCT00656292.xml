	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present study is to quantify the degree of modulation, if any, in the perioperative inflammatory response associated with statins use. Specifically, we hypothesize that: In a population of patients undergoing elective orthopedic spine surgery, administration of a specific statin (Simvastatin, ZocorÂ®, Merck Pharmaceuticals), will be associated with a decrease in perioperative inflammatory markers when compared to patients not taking statins</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing the Role of "Statin" Therapy and Perioperative Inflammatory Response in Patients Undergoing Major Orthopedic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have reported activation of the body's immune system during the perioperative period.1 Typically, this "stress response" is limited and goes unnoticed by the patient and health care team. However, physiologic insults that occur during major surgery may elicit a more pronounced response known as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Such a response is of great clinical consequence, as it is known to significantly worsen perioperative morbidity and mortality.1 HMG Co-A Reductase Inhibitors (hereafter identified by the common name, "the statins") are potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis, and their role in the treatment of atherosclerosis and prevention of coronary artery disease is well documented.2-5 Interestingly, data from animal studies have shown that statins have unique anti-inflammatory properties that are independent of their lipid lowering effects.6 Recently, statin therapy has been associated with a reduced incidence of perioperative cardiovascular and neurologic complications in major vascular and thoracic surgery patients as well as improved outcomes in patients experiencing acute coronary syndrome (ACS).7-13 In all ACS patient populations studied, improvement in outcome has been attributed to coronary plaque stabilization, presumably a result of statins mitigating the local inflammatory response at the level of the coronary plaque. The purpose of this study is to quantify the magnitude of perioperative inflammation during major orthopedic spine surgery and determine whether statins alter this systemic physiologic response.</detailed_description>
