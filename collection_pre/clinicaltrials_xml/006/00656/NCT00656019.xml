	<criteria>Women undergoing core needle biopsy for a breast abnormality suspicious for breast cancer. Women who have undergone a core needle biopsy demonstrating breast cancer who have not yet had any further therapy are also eligible so long as their core needle biopsy is available for analysis. No prior therapy for breast cancer. Age 18 years or older. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Signed informed consent History of parathyroid disease, hypercalcemia, or kidney stones. Supplemental vitamin D other than from a standard multiple vitamin or from standard formulations of calcium and vitamin D (e.g. calcium citrate with vitamin D) within the prior 6 months. History of renal failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. Women who are known to be pregnant or who are nursing. (As vitamin D does not have toxicity to the fetus, a negative pregnancy test is not a requirement to participate in the study.) Supplemental calcium greater than 600 mg calcium per day during study. Patients for who initial treatment of their breast cancer will not be with breast conserving surgery or mastectomy. Patients with locally advanced breast cancer Patients planned for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or other systemic therapy. Patients planned for preoperative radiation therapy. Patients with planned surgical therapy of their breast cancer that would not allow for at least 10 days of vitamin D intervention. Any condition potentially interfering with subjects ability to comply with taking study medication. Any medical condition that would potentially interfere with vitamin D absorption, such as celiac sprue, ulcerative colitis. Current participation in another research study that would increase risk to subject, in the opinion of the investigators</criteria>
