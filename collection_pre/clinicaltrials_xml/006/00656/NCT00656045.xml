	<detailed_description>In adult observational studies, TV viewing has been positively related to overweight and obesity. It is theorized that TV watching influences eating and activity behaviors, such that with greater TV watching less physical activity and greater consumption of energy occurs, producing a positive energy balance state. While no experimental research has been conducted with adults examining the influence of reducing TV watching on weight status, experimental research conducted with children does indicate that lower levels of TV watching can produce reduced energy intake and greater levels of physical activity. Most importantly, family-based, behavioral childhood obesity interventions that have targeted reducing sedentary behaviors (which includes TV watching) have found that as compared to targeting increasing physical activity during treatment, similar increases in activity and fitness occur, but that greater weight loss and greater increases in liking for physical activity occur when sedentary behaviors, as compared to physical activity, are targeted in family-based behavioral childhood weight control programs. Thus, this investigation will involve an 8-week pilot study to examine the effects of two different leisure-time activity prescriptions. All participants in the investigation will receive a standard 8-week behavioral obesity intervention. The intervention will include a reduced caloric prescription (1200-1500 kcal/day) and fat gram prescription (30% or less kcals from fat). One condition will receive an activity goal (200 minutes/week of moderate-intense physical activity [Physical Activity]), while the other condition will receive a TV watching goal (10 hours/week [ TV Watching]). Participants will be assessed at 0 and 9 weeks (pre- and post-intervention) on measures of dietary intake, physical activity, TV watching, liking of physical activity and TV watching, and weight.</detailed_description>
