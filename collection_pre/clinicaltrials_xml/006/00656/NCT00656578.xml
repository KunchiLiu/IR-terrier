	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of 4975 to Manage Pain of Bunionectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in the US. A dose of 4975 will be evaluated against placebo in patients undergoing bunionectomy. Upon enrollment, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 4975 or placebo. After the surgery, patients will be admitted to the clinical study site, where trained study personnel will monitor them for up to 48 hours. While at the clinical study site, patients will undergo safety and efficacy assessments. After discharge, patients will report pain severity daily through Day 14 via an interactive voice response system (IVRS). Also, safety and patient-reported outcome assessments will be performed at the Day 14 (Week 2) and Day 28 (Week 4) clinic visits.</detailed_description>
