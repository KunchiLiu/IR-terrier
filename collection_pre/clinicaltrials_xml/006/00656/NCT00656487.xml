	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out more about cognitive functioning in people who are cannabis dependent, relative to people who do not use cannabis, and how their brains process information after one month of not using cannabis. An additional goal is to characterize the severity of cannabis dependence using precipitated and naturalistic withdrawal with a double blind, placebo controlled, single administration of rimonabant. Research assessments occur bi-weekly throughout this 28 day study.</brief_summary>
