	<brief_title>Dialysis of Sugammadex in Participants With Severe Renal Impairment (Study 19.4.333) (P05773)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current trial was designed to evaluate the dialysability of the sugammadex-rocuronium complex in participants with severe renal impairment. A dose of 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex was administered 15 minutes after administration of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. Blood and dialysate samples were collected before, during and after hemodialysis/filtration, for calculation of clearance of sugammadex-rocuronium complex and assessment of rebound.</detailed_description>
