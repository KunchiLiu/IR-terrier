	<brief_title>Primary Care Community Partnerships to Prevent Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized controlled trials have shown that modest lifestyle changes can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes in adults with pre-diabetes. Unfortunately, despite the increasing prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes in all facets of the population, intervention programs needed to achieve these goals are costly and remain unavailable in most clinical settings. Over the past 3 years, we have demonstrated the feasibility of training community instructors to deliver a group-based adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle intervention. In this pilot research, this new delivery model achieves a level of weight reduction that was associated with diabetes prevention and improved cardiometabolic risk factor control in the DPP. This new, large-scale randomized effectiveness trial is designed to evaluate the costs and effectiveness of a partnered approach to identify adults with pre-diabetes in primary care settings, deliver brief advice for diabetes prevention, and provide access to a group-based adaptation of the DPP lifestyle intervention offered by the community. This study will compare costs and outcomes to a standard care, brief clinical counseling approach delivered by Registered Dietitians.</detailed_description>
