	<brief_summary>FIBER is 4-year study that will evaluate the implementation of a large-scale population-based colorectal cancer screening patient reminder and coordinated follow-up program. The CRC screening program began in 2007 with Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW),a not-for- profit, integrated health system in Oregon and Washington. FIBER consists of 1)a practical randomized controlled trial at the start of the program, followed by 2) a longer-term cohort study as all remaining eligible patients receive the program, and 3)a qualitative evaluation. FIBER will evaluate the factors that are associated with implementation success across multiple levels: patient, primary care provider (PCP) team, specialists (gastroenterologists, general surgeons, pathologists), and other health plan staff and systems.</brief_summary>
