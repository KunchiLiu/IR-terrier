	<brief_summary>Historically metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in a cervical lymph node from an occult primary malignancy of the head and neck was evaluated with panendoscopy and biopsies of high risk areas, such as the base of tongue, nasopharynx, and tonsils. This diagnostic protocol identifies the primary malignancy in about 50% of cases. In recent years, the availability of CT has slightly increased the detection rate to 65% when used as an adjunct to the traditional work-up. Studies using PET as an adjunct are conflicting with detection rates ranging up to 75%. Currently, no prospective study has analyzed the role of the PET-CT fusion in the work-up of an occult primary malignancy of the head and neck. This study will compare the detection rate of the traditional work-up to a new protocol involving a pre-operative diagnostic PET-CT.</brief_summary>
