Have compensated liver disease with the following minimum criteria: white blood cell count (WBC) &gt;3,000/mm3, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1,800/mm3, platelets &gt;100,000/mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) &gt; 13 g/dL for males and &gt; 12 g/dL for females. Evidence of decompensated liver disease. Pregnant or lactating female.
