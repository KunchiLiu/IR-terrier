	<detailed_description>The goal of this research is to investigate a potential CSF biomarker of NPH as a new tool for both the diagnosis of NPH and prognosis of VPS placement. Transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1) is a signaling molecule involved in three fundamental activities; suppression of cell proliferation, immunosuppression, and deposition of extracellular matrix through promotion of synthesis and inhibition of degradation.8 Previously, TGF-b1 had been implicated in the development of communicating hydrocephalus secondary to pre-term infant intraventricular hemorrhage9 and adult aneurysmal sub-arachnoid hemorrhage.10, 11 Recently, an investigation demonstrated elevated levels of TGF-b1 in patients with shunt-responsive NPH compared to non-NPH patients.12 The specific aims of this research proposal are to: 1. Correlate CSF levels of TGF-b1 with the clinical response of patients diagnosed with NPH to VPS placement. 2. Correlate CSF levels of TGF-b1 with optimal VPS pressure settings.</detailed_description>
