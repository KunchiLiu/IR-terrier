	<brief_summary>This study aims to show that the MedGem indirect calorimetry measurement device will be feasible to use in children with GVHD. Also, it aims to show that children with chronic GVHD will have elevated REE that is not adequately predicted by standard equations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurements of Resting Energy Expenditure in Patients With or at Risk of Developing Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow and hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation. In adults, it has been shown that patients with acute or chronic GVHD have an increase in their resting energy expenditure (REE), likely as a result of chronic systemic inflammation. These studies have not yet been performed in children. This study's objective is to determine the REE of pediatric patients with acute and chronic GVHD after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).</detailed_description>
