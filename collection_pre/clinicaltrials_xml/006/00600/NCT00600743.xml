	<brief_summary>The ultimate aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that the oral CCK agonist GSKI181771X will reduce the size of a binge meal among individuals with Bulimia Nervosa. The study will be conducted in phases. First, an effective dose for reducing food intake, when normal subjects eat normally will be attained. Next, it will be determined whether intake at this dose is reduced in control subjects instructed to eat to capacity. If the dose is still effective compared to placebo, the same dose will be tested in patients with bulimia nervosa.</brief_summary>

Inclusion and exclusion will be evaluated using the following guidelines: Normal Controls: No current or past psychiatric illness No history of binge eating or vomiting 80120% ideal weight Of nonchildbearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant or surgically sterile) If of childbearing potential, willing to use an acceptable method of birthcontrol (please see list in "Exclusion" section) Patients with Bulimia Nervosa: DSMIV criteria for bulimia nervosa Duration of illness &gt; 1 year Purging after binges via selfinduced vomiting (Same as controls for remaining inclusion criteria) Normal Controls: Significant medical illness: CBC, Chem1, serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, CO2), glucose, BUN, creatinine, Alk Phos, ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT), LDH, total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, A/G ratio, calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, cholesterol, triglyceride ALT outside of upper limit of normal: Chem1 History of gallstones, pancreatitis or cholecystitis Current medication Hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines (contraindication in DCSI v02, 1March2006) Drug or alcohol abuse in last 3 mts Pregnancy Unable or unwilling to use highly effective methods of contraception for the duration of the study until an insignificant amount of the investigational product remains in the subject (i.e. at least 5 terminal phase halflives). Examples of highly effective methods of contraception are: Implants of levonorgestrel, or Injectable progestogen, or Oral birth control pills for at least 3 monthly cycles prior to administration of study drug + continuation for 24 hrs after last dose of study drug, or Doublebarrier method (e.g. condom, diaphragm) with spermicide NoteSignificant medical illness is any illness requiring continued care, i.e. chronic medication. Examples include hypertension, diabetes, and systemic lupus erythematosis. Subjects with seasonal allergies or occasional urinary tract infections will be included. Patients with Bulimia Nervosa: Same as controls</criteria>
