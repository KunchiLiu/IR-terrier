	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the nature and quality of speech after removal of the voice box and all or part of the swallowing tube. The study is evaluating which type of surgery provides patients with the best speech and voice. These data will be used to help surgeons to design better ways to restore voice function after removal of the voice box. Information about disease, its treatment, quality of life, and physical and vocal function will be collected. An audio recording of vocal tasks will also be done. All of this information will be analyzed and the two different subject groups will be compared to see if there are differences.</brief_summary>
