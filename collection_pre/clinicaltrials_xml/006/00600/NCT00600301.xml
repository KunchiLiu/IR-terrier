	<brief_summary>Diabetic macular edema is the most common cause of visual loss among patients with diabetic retinopathy. Pars plana vitrectomy has been reported to be effective for the treatment of diabetic macular edema. Previous report showed a limited improvement in visual acuity and macular thickness posterior intraoperative triamcinolone acetonide. Bevacizumab intravitreal injection has been proven be effective in the treatment of diabetic macular edema, in recent publications. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether vitrectomy with and without intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide and bevacizumab injection affects vision outcome and macular thickness in patients with diabetic macular edema.</brief_summary>
