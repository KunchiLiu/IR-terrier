	<brief_summary>Background: to evaluate the 3-month efficacy of a single dose of intravitreal bevacizumab on the progression of severe non proliferative diabetic retinopathy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy and active photocoagulated diabetic proliferative by evaluation of ischemic areas and regression of retinal and disc neovasculrization. Methods: 40 patients were enrolled in a prospective, interventional study. Patients were treated with intravitreal bevacizumab 0.1ml (0.25mg). We evaluated visual acuity, neovascularization leakage points, capillary closure ischemic areas and macular edema by clinical examination and fluorescein angiography. A clinical examination was performed at baseline and days 1,14 and 30. Active leakage points were measured by fluorescein angiography at 30 days.</brief_summary>
