	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the value of induction Erlotinib therapy before thoracotomy or radiotherapy in ⅢA-N2 (confirmed by mediastinoscopy or PET) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) selected by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene analysis and initial to explore a new treatment strategy for ⅢA-N2 NSCLC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Erlotinib Therapy in Stage III A (N2) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stage IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is seen in a relatively heterogeneous group of patients with ipsilateral mediastinal (N2) lymph node involvement. The relative roles of different treatment modalities are not clear. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may result in dramatic responses in patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma carrying EGFR activating mutations. In case reports, the efficacy of perioperative EGFR-TKI therapy in patients with locally advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR gene mutations was satisfactory. Although no prospective data support the use of EGFR-TKIs as induction therapy in stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC, their low toxicity profile and the possibility of a rapid tumor response suggests that prospective trials are required. Therefore, this study evaluated the value of induction erlotinib therapy in IIIA-N2 NSCLC selected by EGFR gene analysis and explored a new treatment strategy for this subset. Erlotinib specifically targets the EGFR TK domain, which is highly expressed and occasionally mutated in various forms of cancer. It binds in a reversible fashion to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the receptor.</detailed_description>
