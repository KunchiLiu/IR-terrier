	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to determine if a combination of AZD6244 given orally twice a day with standard doses of selected chemotherapies will be safe and tolerable for cancer patients with advanced solid tumors. The highest tolerated dose of AZD6244 in combination with selected chemotherapies will be evaluated. The study will also investigate how AZD6244 in combination with standard chemotherapies are absorbed, distributed and excreted by the body as well as the length of time that the drugs remain in the body. Initial and periodic assessments will establish patient response to the combination therapies.</brief_summary>
