	<brief_summary>This is a phase 2, single-arm, multi-center study, with a safety review component, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nimotuzumab in approximately 44 patients with recurrent diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) following one previous regimen for their disease. Patients must be diagnosed with radiologically verified recurrent diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma that is measurable in at least two dimensions. Patients are eligible without histologic confirmation. Treatment regimen will consist of two phases-induction and consolidation.</brief_summary>
