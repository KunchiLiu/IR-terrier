	<brief_summary>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a rapidly progressive lung disorder that is often associated with a chronic, intractable cough. The etiology of the cough associated with IPF is unclear but it is often so severe that it adversely effects the patient's quality of life. We propose that thalidomide specifically suppresses the cough associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis via its anti-inflammatory properties, by suppressing the excessive functional up-regulation of sensory fibers with in the respiratory tract of patients with IPF. This study is a Phase III, double blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, crossover trial testing the efficacy of thalidomide in suppressing the chronic cough of IPF. The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of thalidomide administered daily for 12 weeks to suppress the chronic cough in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as measured by cough specific questionnaires, scales and improved quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Chronic Cough in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis With Thalidomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a Phase III, double blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, crossover trial testing the efficacy of thalidomide in suppressing the chronic cough of IPF. All subjects will be randomized to either begin the study receiving the active study drug - (thalidomide) or inactive drug (placebo). Study drug will be administered in escalating dose starting at 50 mg a day increasing to 100 mg a day if cough is still present after 2 weeks. Study drug will be taken by mouth at bedtime. Patients will remain on their initial treatment for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment, the subjects will be administered the Cough Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (CQLQ), a visual cough analogue scale, and St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). In addition, investigators will collect the subjects cough diary. After 12 weeks of treatment all subjects will enter a 2 week wash-out phase in which all drugs will be discontinued. After the 2 week wash-out phase, all subjects will again be administered the Cough Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (CQLQ), a visual cough analogue scale, and St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). In addition, investigators will collect the subjects cough diary. All subjects will then be crossed over to the other treatment arm for an additional 12 weeks of treatment. After the second 12 weeks of treatment, the subjects will be administered the Cough Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (CQLQ), a visual cough analogue scale, and St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). In addition, investigators will collect the subjects cough diary.</detailed_description>
