	<criteria>Subjects who the Investigator believes that they can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female between, and including, 21 and 40 years of age at the time of the first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to any study procedure. Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical examination before enrolment into the study. If the subject is female, she must be of nonchildbearing potential, or if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. No evidence of pulmonary pathology as confirmed by chest Xray. Clinically normal laboratory values for creatinine, ALT, AST and complete blood count. Seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus1 (HIV1). No history of extrapulmonary TB. Subjects must have the appropriate PPD skin reactivity (induration measured at 48 to 72 hours after PPD skin test administration). Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within 6 months prior to the first vaccine dose. History of previous administration of experimental Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccines. History of previous exposure to experimental products containing MPL or QS21. Administration of any immunoglobulins, any immunotherapy and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccination, or planned administrations during the study period. Participation in another experimental protocol during the study period. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition based on medical history and physical examination. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. Subjects who describe a firstdegree relative with clearly documented autoimmune disease will be excluded History of any acute or chronic illness or medication that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity of the vaccine. Any chronic drug therapy to be continued during the study period, with the exception of vitamins and/or dietary supplements, birth control pills, antihistamines for seasonal allergies, SSRIs. History of any neurologic disorders or seizures. History of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis to previous immunisations. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse which in the investigators opinion would put the subject at risk. Major congenital defects. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.</criteria>
