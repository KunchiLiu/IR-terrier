	<brief_summary>The patients will receive either Pasireotide LAR or Octreotide LAR for one year of treatment. The objective of this study is to compare the proportion of patients with a reduction of mean GH level to &lt;2.5 Âµg/L and the normalization of IGF-1 to within normal limits (age and sex related) between the two treatment groups (pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR) at 12 months. Following one year of treatment patients may proceed into the study extension. Patients who did not respond to the treatment they were randomized to (based on month 12 assessment results) will be switched to the other treatment arm at month 13.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Patients with active acromegaly (based on elevated GH and IGF1 levels) Patients who have undergone one or more pituitary surgeries, but have not been treated medically, or denovo patients presenting a visible pituitary adenoma on MRI and who refuse pituitary surgery or for whom pituitary surgery is contraindicated Patients for whom written informed consent to participate in the study has been obtained prior to any study related activity Exclusion criteria: Patients who are being or were treated with octreotide, lanreotide, dopamine agonists or GH antagonists with the exception of a single dose of shortacting octrotide or shortacting dopamine agonists. In case of a single dose of shortacting octrotide, the dose should not be used to predict the response to the octretide treatment. The single dose of shortacting octreotide or shortacting dopamine agonists should not be administered in the 3 days prior to randomization Patients with compression of the optic chiasm causing any visual field defect Patients who have received pituitary irradiation within the last ten years prior to visit 1 Poorly controlled diabetic patients Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
