	<brief_title>Virtual Reality Training Program for Ambulatory Patients With Chronic Gait Deficits After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Virtual reality (VR) systems enable the learning of simple and complex skills in a controlled virtual environment; i.e., one in which the different components (constraints) of the environment can be displayed, graded, changed and monitored in a quantitative manner. Small preliminary studies suggest that VR may be used to augment chronic stroke rehabilitation and may enhance cortical reorganization. Our aim is to examine the feasibility and efficacy of a virtual reality program for ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate chronic gait deficits after stroke. Study design-a single center randomized controlled trial of an experimental group and a usual care group.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Main Stroke within 372 months. Mildtomoderate residual gait deficits after the index stroke with preserved capacity for ambulation without or with an assistive device (e.g., walker, cane) or orthotics (e.g. AFO). Main exclusion Criteria: Unstable cardiac or other medical condition or aphasia, dementia or other significant neurological disease limiting ability to train.</criteria>
