	<brief_title>Ai Chi Versus Stretching in Fibromyalgia Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical therapies have shown to be effective in the treatment of fibromyalgia and It is generally assumed that a multidisciplinary approach, combining both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic measures, is probably the optimal treatment approach for most fibromyalgia patients. As these patients are usually physically deconditioned, low-intensity exercise has been recommended at least as initial treatment. At this respect, exercise in warm water is considered a good option as both temperature and water buoyancy minimize body weight's stress and help patients to minimize pain. In a previous study comparing short term physiotherapy with stretching and Ai Chi we found that Ai Chi was at least as effective as stretching and induced a significant reduction in fibromyalgia core symptomatology and in sleep parameters. The objective of the present randomized controlled study is to compare both physiotherapy techniques in a long term basis.</detailed_description>
