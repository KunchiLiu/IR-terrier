	<brief_summary>The trial is designed to assess the long term subjective well-being in schizophrenic outpatients treated with quetiapine XR (extended release) or oral risperidone at flexible dose in a naturalistic setting over a period of one year. Secondary outcome measures have been selected for helping in the differentiation of the compared atypical antipsychotics. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of quetiapine XR to risperidone assessed at month 6 in terms of responder rate using the self-report instrument SWN-K</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Treated for symptomatic schizophrenia (DSMIVTR codes: 295.10, 295.20, 295.30,295.60, 295.90) or schizoaffective disorder (DSMIVTR code:295.70) or schizophreniform disorder (DSMIVTR code: 295.40). Patients with comorbid depressive symptoms may be enrolled Patient with first episode of the above mentioned disease (item 3) or patient requiring a medication change for clinical reasons (effectiveness, tolerability, compliance, patient preference), i.e. switch from typical to atypical neuroleptics, switch from other atypical neuroleptics, excluding patients treated with risperidone or quetiapine at the time of enrolment. Patients with a baseline SWNK total score of &gt;75 Patients with previous treatment with risperidone or quetiapine may be enrolled if change of treatment has not been dictated by major lack of tolerability and efficacy and if date of last dose has been at least 3 months prior to enrolment.</criteria>
