	<brief_summary>Study Objectives: To collect and describe demographics, disease-management, and treatment outcomes of Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) patients who are newly diagnosed and classified according to the WHO criteria. To perform observational studies concerning relevant scientific research questions in MDS using clinical data and biological samples, and to present relevant research outcomes in the fields of diagnosis and prognostication, health related quality of life issues, health economics, and risk stratification for newly developed classes of drugs. To disseminate results of the studies to all stakeholders involved.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective, Multicentre European Registry for Newly Diagnosed Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology: Data on patients with MDS will be collected prospectively at diagnosis and at 6-months intervals after diagnosis. The data will be gathered by seventeen (or more) countries that are represented within the LeukemiaNet MDS Working Party and will be combined in one central European Database. Data analyses will be conducted by the Data Management Centre at the University of York in various sub studies, after every 500 patients included in the European Registry and at the end of the follow-up period. Number of Patients &amp; Centres Over 140 hematology centres in seventeen (or more) different countries (Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, The Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom) will participate as referral centres in this Registry. The recruitment target is a minimum of 3000 cases lower-risk MDS and 1000 higher-risk cases. Population: The study population will consist of newly diagnosed patients with all subtypes of MDS classified according to the WHO criteria, including therapy-related MDS and MDS-F, AML with 20-30 percent marrow blasts (former RAEB-t), and CMML and other forms of mixed MDS/MPD. Study Duration: The enrolment time is scheduled to continue until at least June 2020 but extension of the recruitment period is possible. Patients will be followed until withdrawal (for any reason) or termination of the EUMDS Registry.</detailed_description>
