	<brief_title>Study of MLN8237 in Participants With Advanced Hematological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib is being tested to treat people who have advanced hematological malignancies. This study determined the dose-limiting toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, safety and pharmacokinetics (how the drug moves through the body) for alisertib when given once or twice a day for 7 to 21 days. This open label study enrolled 58 patients. Participants were enrolled in one of 3 treatment groups: - Part 1: Powder-in-Capsule (PIC) Dose Escalation (alisertib 25 mg PIC, orally twice daily [BID] on Day 1 [loading dose] and then alisertib 25 or 35 mg PIC once daily [QD] for 21 days (D), or alisertib 35, 45, 65 or 90 mg PIC, orally, QD for 14D) - Part 1: Enteric-coated Tablet (ECT) Dose Escalation (alisertib 40 mg, ECT, orally, QD for 14D or alisertib 30, 40 or 50 mg, orally, BID for 7D) - Part 2: Participants with Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL) (alisertib 50 mg ECT, orally, BID for 7D) All participants received treatment for 12 months or until their disease progressed or they experienced unacceptable alisertib-related toxicity. This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study was 422 days. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, including a final visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of alisertib for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Relapsed or refractory disease and a histologically or cytologically confirmed hematological malignancy of the following type for which standard curative treatment does not exist or is no longer effective: Bcell Follicular lymphoma Bcell Marginal zone lymphoma Diffuse large Bcell lymphoma Bcell Mantle cell lymphoma Bcell Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) BCell Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL) Multiple myeloma Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia Noncutaneous peripheral Tcell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCLNOS) Angioimmunoblastic Tcell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma, enteropathy associated Tcell lymphoma (EATCL), NK lymphoma (NKL) Participants with diffuse large Bcell lymphoma must have failed, be ineligible for, or have refused an autologous stem cell transplant. There is no restriction regarding the maximum number of prior regimens. Aged 18 years or older Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2 Radiographically or clinically evaluable disease for Part 1 of this study and measurable disease for Part 2 of this study Suitable venous access for the conduct of blood sampling for MLN8237 pharmacokinetics (PK) Recovered from the reversible effects of prior antineoplastic treatment (with the exception of alopecia and Grade 1 neuropathy) Pregnant or lactating Treatment with clinically significant enzyme inducers within 14 days prior to the first dose of MLN8237 as specified in the protocol Prior allogeneic bone marrow (or other organ) transplantation Newly diagnosed or uncontrolled cancerrelated central nervous system (CNS) disease Systemic antineoplastic treatment within 21 days preceding the first dose of study treatment. Exceptions requiring a 42day recovery period from last treatment include: Nitrosoureas, mitomycin C or Rituximab, alemtuzumab (Campath®), or other unconjugated therapeutic antibody (21 days if clear evidence of progressive disease) Treatment with radioimmunoconjugates or toxin immunoconjugates such as ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin™), or tositumomab (Bexxar®) within 56 days preceding the first dose of study treatment Antineoplastic treatment with glucocorticoids within 21 days preceding the first dose of study treatment Radiotherapy involving &lt;25% of the hematopoietically active bone marrow within 21 days preceding first dose of study treatment Radiotherapy involving ≥25% of the hematopoietically active bone marrow within 42 days preceding first dose of study treatment Inability to swallow capsules or known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedures that could interfere with the oral absorption or tolerance of MLN8237. Examples include, but are not limited to, partial gastrectomy, history of small intestine surgery, and celiac disease. History of uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome and other conditions that could result in excessive daytime sleepiness such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Known or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive or hepatitis B surface antigenpositive status, or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection. Testing is not required in the absence of clinical findings or suspicion. Participants who fail to meet laboratory values as specified in the protocol during the screening period</criteria>
