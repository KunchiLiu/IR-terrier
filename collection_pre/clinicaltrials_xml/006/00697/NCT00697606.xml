	<brief_summary>Adhesion formation is a result of abdominal and pelvic surgery and is a cause of such diseases as chronic pain syndrome, bowel obstruction and infertility. Both patients and surgeons suffer when adhesions are encountered, since the surgery becomes more intense, lengthy, and complicated. Seprafilm® has been shown to limit the formation of adhesions in gynecologic and abdominal surgery. Limited data is available on the effectiveness of Seprafilm® in the prevention of abdominal wall and pelvic adhesions at the time of cesarean section. Adhesions at the time of repeat cesarean make the surgery frustrating and complex, with difficult lysis of adhesions being the cause of morbidities such as bladder damage, increased blood loss, and longer operating times. The objective of this definitive project is to define the extent of reduction of adhesion formation of Seprafilm® when used at the time of primary cesarean section. Women undergoing primary cesarean section will be randomized for Seprafilm® application, and the incidence and grade of adhesions at repeat cesarean will be determined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Seprafilm® for Prevention of Adhesions at Repeat Cesarean</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective randomized double-blinded study. Patients will be randomized prior to primary cesarean section to either the study arm (Seprafilm® placement) or control arm (nothing placed). Seprafilm® will be placed over the repaired uterine incision and over the anterior aspect of the uterus prior to closure of the fascia (2 to 3 sheets per patient). Randomization will be by opaque envelops containing group assignment. Participants and surgeons will be blinded to group designation at the time of repeat cesarean. The surgeon will be asked to grade the adhesions at the time of repeat cesarean.</detailed_description>
