	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of addition of zometa to anti-neoplastic treatment compared with anti-neoplastic treatment alone, as measured by the primary efficacy variable of SREs (Skeletal Related Events) and to assess the safety in nasopharyngeal patients with bone metastases randomized to receive either zometa 4 mg or anti-neoplastic treatment alone.</brief_summary>
