	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the adjuvanted recombinant hepatitis B vaccine with that of Engerix™-B when both are injected according to a three dose schedule (0, 1, 6 months) in an adult non-responder population</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age: older than 18 years of age. Documented nonresponders 2 to 5 months after having received 4 doses of a hepatitis B vaccine Good physical condition as established by clinical examination and history taking at the time of entry. Female participants who are at risk to become pregnant will be on a contraceptive programme if necessary during the study period. Written informed consent obtained from the subjects Positive at screening for antiHBV antibodies Elevated serum liver enzymes. History of significant and persisting hematologic, hepatic, renal, cardiac or respiratory disease. Any acute disease at the moment of entry. Chronic alcohol consumption. Hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant abdominal pain or tenderness. Any chronic drug treatment, including any treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, which in the investigator's opinion, precludes inclusion into the study. History of allergic disease likely to be stimulated by any component of the vaccine. Simultaneous participation in any other clinical trial. Previous vaccination with an MPL containing vaccine. Administration of immunoglobulins 6 months before and during the whole study period Vaccination one month before and one month after each dose of the study vaccine</criteria>
