	<brief_summary>To assess the safety of Ambisome 10 mg/kg/week in patients as a preemptive treatment in intensive care patients with a sepsis and rising candida colonisation. Preemptive treatment (i.e., prophylactic treatment with two high doses of Ambisome® administered with an interval of one week, in patiens with a high risk of developing a fungal infection) should decrease the incidence of actual systemic infections. The incidence of such actual fungal infections will be assessed directly and its impact on patients' survival and intensive care resourches assessed</brief_summary>
