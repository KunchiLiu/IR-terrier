	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate whether a corifollitropin alfa (Org 36286) regimen applying a single or repeated dose of corifollitropin alfa followed by a low daily dose of Human Chorion Gonadotropin (hCG) or recombinant Follicular Stimulating Hormone (recFSH) can induce monofollicular growth (one follicle ≥18 mm and no other follicle ≥15 mm at day of bolus injection of hCG) in women with WHO group II anovulatory infertility.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Trial to Evaluate if Corifollitropin Alfa (Org 36286), Followed by a Low Daily Dose of hCG or Recombinant FSH Can Induce Monofollicular Growth in Women With WHO Group II Anovulatory Infertility (P05693)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial will include two separate stages (Ia+Ib and II). Stage Ia will be open-label and uncontrolled in a small cohort of women (n=5) to explore whether the intended dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by daily low dose recFSH provide an appropriate response in eligible participants meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Stage Ib will be open-label and uncontrolled in a small cohort of women (n=5) to explore whether the intended dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by daily low dose hCG provide an appropriate response in eligible participants meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Stage II is open-label and randomized (n=40) to evaluate whether the intended dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by low dose FSH (n=20) or hCG (n=20) provide an appropriate response in eligible participants meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.</detailed_description>
