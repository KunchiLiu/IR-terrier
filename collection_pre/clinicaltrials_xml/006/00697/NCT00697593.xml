The subject must be willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements for the duration of the study. 5. Have given written informed consent with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn at any time without prejudice to future medical care. 6. Women of childbearing potential must use appropriate contraception during treatment and up to the last study visit (safety followup visit). For men, it is also mandatory to practice contraception during participation in the trial, as there are no existing data on the effect of Raptiva on spermatogenesis. 7. Discontinuation of any investigational drug or treatment 3 months prior to study start or as per washout requirements from previous protocol. No primary vaccinations (e.g., tetanus, booster, influenza vaccine) for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study drug.For the purposes of this trial, women of childbearing potential is defined as: "All female subjects after puberty unless they are postmenopausal for at least two years, are surgically sterile or are sexually inactive." 1. Any contraindication to Raptiva, according to the Investigator Brochure, or as follows: Hypersensitivity to Raptiva or to any of the excipients. Subjects with history of malignancies. History of active tuberculosis (TB) or currently undergoing treatment for TB. Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) testing or chest Xray is required for highrisk subjects. Subjects with a positive PPD (not due to BCG vaccination) or chest Xray will be excluded. Subjects with specific forms of psoriasis like guttate, erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis as sole or predominant form of psoriasis. Subjects with immunodeficiencies. 2. Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial. 3. Subjects experiencing a psoriasis exacerbation during screening period. 4. Subjects who have previously been on Raptiva treatment who withdrew due to lack of efficacy or an adverse event. If withdrawal was due to another nondrug reason (vaccination, or infection) then the subject can be included in this study. 5. History of hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 6. History of thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia or clinically significant anaemia. 7. Hepatic enzyme levels =/&gt;3 times the upper limit of normal or serum creatinine level =/&gt;2 times the upper limit of normal. 8. Pregnant or breastfeeding. 9. Any medical condition (prior or existing) that, in the judgment of the investigator or sponsor, could jeopardize the subject's safety following exposure to study drug.</criteria>
