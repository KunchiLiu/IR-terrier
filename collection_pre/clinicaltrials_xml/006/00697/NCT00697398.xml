	<detailed_description>We recently demonstrated that these patients exhibit significant perfusion abnormalities in regions of the brain known to be involved in sensory and affective-attentional dimensions of pain processing. These results, in agreement with previous functional magnetic resonance imaging reports, confirm the hypothesis of central sensitization, which provides the rationale for prescription of centrally acting analgesic agents in patients with severe FM.</detailed_description>
