	<brief_title>Color Doppler Imaging of Orbital Venous Flow in Grave's Orbitopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective study with Grave's patients in active and fibrotic disease, myogenic and lipogenic forms, with muscle restriction and without muscle restriction and with or without optic compressive neuropathy. Blood flow was studied with Color Doppler Imaging (CDI) in the following orbital vessels: - Superior Ophthalmic Vein (main target of the study protocol) - Retinal Central Vein - Retinal Central Artery - Ophthalmic Artery</detailed_description>
