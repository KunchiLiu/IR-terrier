	<brief_summary>The high percentage of failure using available non-surgical options to treat menorrhagia in women with bleeding disorders shows a continuing need for innovative treatments. This has led to development of this protocol in order to make available tranexamic acid as a potentially effective menorrhagia therapy option in women with an underlying bleeding disorder.
