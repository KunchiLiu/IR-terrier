	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of dasatinib in treating patients with solid tumors or lymphomas that are metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors or Lymphomas That Are Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of dasatinib in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. II. To estimate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of this drug in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. III. To assess the safety profile and dose-limiting toxicities (if any) of dasatinib in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe any antitumor efficacy associated with dasatinib administration in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. II. To examine whether the pharmacokinetic clearance of dasatinib correlates with hepatic function as assessed by Child-Pugh Criteria, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Organ Dysfunction Working Group Criteria, or other assessments of liver function. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor or lymphoma that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective; patients with a liver mass, elevated alphafetoprotein level (&gt;= 500 ng/mL) and positive serology for viral hepatitis, consistent with a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma will be eligible without the need for pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis; all solid and lymphoma tumor types are eligible Patients must have measurable or nonmeasurable disease; xrays and/or scans for disease assessment must have been completed within 28 days (for measurable disease) or 42 days (for nonmeasurable disease) prior to registration; all disease must be assessed and documented on the webbased Baseline Tumor Assessment Form Patients with brain metastases who require corticosteroids must be on stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids; patients with known brain metastases must have had brain irradiation (whole brain or gamma knife); patients with untreated (nonirradiated) brain metastases are not eligible; patients on enzymeinducing anticonvulsant medications (e.g. phenobarbital, phenytoin or carbamazepine) are not eligible Patients must not be taking H2receptor antagonists such as cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine, or any proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, and pantoprazole; patients must stop these medications within 7 days prior to starting treatment Patients must not have had anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to registration, except for targeted agents with halflife known to be &lt; 24 hours; patients must not have had targeted agents with halflife &lt; 24 hours within 2 weeks prior to registration; patients also must have recovered from serious adverse events due to agents administered within these acceptable time frames Patients must not be planning to receive concurrent radiation, other chemotherapy, immune therapy or any other investigational agents for malignancy while receiving protocol treatment; hormonal treatment for prostate carcinoma may be continued and bisphosphonate treatment for bone disease is permitted Patient must not have received prior therapy with dasatinib (BMS354825) Patients for whom there is a strong suspicion of being allergic to dasatinib because of a history of allergic reactions to similar compounds are not eligible Patients must not have had major surgical procedures within the last 4 weeks prior to the first planned dose of study drug Patients must not be taking therapeutic doses of anticoagulants; low dose warfarin for port prophylaxis is permitted Zubrod performance status of 02 Patients may not have any clinically significant cardiovascular disease including the following: Myocardial infarction or ventricular tachyarrhythmia within 6 months Prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;= 480 msec (Fridericia correction) Ejection fraction less than institutional normal Major conduction abnormality (unless a cardiac pacemaker is present) Patients with any cardiopulmonary symptoms of unknown cause (e.g. shortness of breath, chest pain, etc.) should be evaluated by a baseline echocardiogram with or without stress test as needed in addition to electrocardiogram (EKG) to rule out QTc prolongation; the patient may be referred to a cardiologist at the discretion of the principal investigator; patients with underlying cardiopulmonary dysfunction should be excluded from the study Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L Magnesium &gt;= lower limit of normal (LLN) Potassium &gt;= LLN Creatinine =&lt;

there must be no evidence of biliary sepsis and at least 2 weeks must have elapsed after the placement of a biliary shunt Patients must not be pregnant or nursing; women/men of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method; since interaction with dasatinib and oral contraceptives is possible, a barrier method should be used and oral contraceptives are not permitted; a negative pregnancy test is required within 72 hours prior to starting therapy for women of reproductive potential; a woman is considered to be of "reproductive potential" if she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months; in addition to routine contraceptive methods, "effective contraception" also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a sideeffect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation; however, if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures Patients who have experienced any of the following within the 12 months prior to starting protocol treatment are not eligible: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack, or significant pulmonary embolus Patients with ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade &gt;= 2, atrial fibrillation of any grade, or QTc interval &gt;
