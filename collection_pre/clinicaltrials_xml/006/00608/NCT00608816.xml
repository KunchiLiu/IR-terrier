	<brief_title>Hypoglycemia Associated Autonomic Failure in Type 1 DM, Q4</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When a person had previously experienced bouts of low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, his or her counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia would be weakened. This is especially true and important for a person with Type 1 diabetes, because it will cause him or her to be vulnerable to another bout of hypoglycemia, and cause hypoglycemia unawareness, which can lead to serious or even life-threatening consequences. Epinephrine is one of the important hormones in the defense of hypoglycemia. We will test the hypothesis that antecedent hypoglycemia will blunt the metabolic, neuroendocrine and cardiovascular effects of subsequent epinephrine infusion in Type 1 DM.</detailed_description>
