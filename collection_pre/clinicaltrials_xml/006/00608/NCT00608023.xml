	<brief_summary>HIV lipodystrophy affects a significant proportion of patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) and is characterized by excess visceral fat accumulation, loss of extremity and subcutaneous fat, in association with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Data from the first Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that daily administration of 2mg TH9507, a growth hormone releasing factor (GRF), to HIV- infected patients with excess of abdominal fat accumulation for 26 weeks resulted in decreases in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and trunk fat, with lesser changes in limb fat and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). The present study is aimed at confirming the observations made during the first Phase 3 study.</brief_summary>
