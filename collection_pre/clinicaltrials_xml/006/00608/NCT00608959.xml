	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine if omiganan 1% gel (the investigational medication in this research study) is effective and safe when compared to chlorhexidine 2% (an FDA approved medication) for killing bacteria (germs) that live on the surface of the skin. Both of the study medications are applied topically (on the surface of the skin).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Antimicrobial Activity of Omiganan 1% Gel vs. Chlorhexidine 2% for Topical Skin Antisepsis in Healthy Adult Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is comprised of 2 parts with approximately 20 subjects participating in each part. Subjects eligible for Part 1 will have omiganan 1 % gel applied to 6 sites across the chest and/or abdomen and chlorhexidine 2% solution will be applied to 6 matching sites on the contralateral side. Subjects eligible for Part 2 will each have omiganan 1% gel applied to 6 sites across the upper chest or abdomen.In addition,subjects in Part 2 will have 2 peripheral catheters inserted, one in each arm.One catheter insertion site will be treated with omiganan 1% gel (following treatment with isopropyl alcohol) and the other site will be treated with chlorhexidine 2%/isopropyl alcohol.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female subjects1870 years of age No evidence of dermatosis, dermatitis, inflammation, scarring, or acute injuries to the drug application sites on the chest or abdomen Subjects must have screening samples from the skin on the right and left side of the chest or abdomen containing at least 2.5 log10 colony forming units per square centimeter (CFU/cm2 )organisms (from the average of 2 samples obtained during screening) Willing to provide written informed consent. Allergies or sensitivities to alcohol, adhesive tape, bandages, latex, chlorhexidine gluconate, or any of the ingredients of omiganan 1% gel Prior treatment with any systemic antibiotic, or any other product known to affect the normal microbial flora of the skin within 7 days of the screening examination Requirement for topical antibiotic use on or within 10 cm of any study test site Subjects who have been treated with any investigational drug (other than omiganan) within the previous 30 days, or who are participating in an investigational drug study at any time during the course of this study Subjects who have been previously treated with omiganan and experienced a possibly related adverse event during the study Note: a wash out period of one week is required prior to participation in Part 2 of the study A medical condition that the Investigator believes may interfere with the safety of the subject or the intent and conduct of the study Note: this includes conditions such as: severe eczema, psoriasis and/or dermal infections, old scars, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, severe immunocompromising conditions, HIV infection, or use of medications that would interfere with assessment of study endpoints A current or recent history of illicit drug or alcohol abuse Subjects not willing or able to fulfill protocol requirements Pregnancy.
