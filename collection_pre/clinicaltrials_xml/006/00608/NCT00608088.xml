	<brief_summary>This research was done to better understand how new mothers who are breastfeeding feel and the questions they have. We wanted to use ways to help new mothers to breastfeed successfully. We compared a new approach (home visits and telephone calls) to the usual care given at Johns Hopkins Hospital with strong support to new mothers from nurses, and a peer counselor (another mother with breastfeeding experience).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Community Health Nurse/Peer Counselor Program to Help Low-Income Women Breastfeed Longer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy People 2010 included the goal of increasing breastfeeding duration to 6 months for 50% of all mothers. Other professional and national health organizations and the Health and Human Services Blueprint for Action on Breastfeeding recommend that women breastfeed exclusively for six months. Increasing breastfeeding among low-income women is a priority, as disparities exist. Only 20.1% of low-income women (on WIC) breastfeed for six months compared to 40.7 % of more affluent women. Consistent, comprehensive, culturally sensitive breastfeeding support increases duration of breastfeeding, thus offering well-documented health benefits often specifically appropriate for low-income women. Breastfeeding relates to lower formula cost, lower health care costs, and breastfeeding may be less time consuming. These cost savings can potentially offset costs of breastfeeding promotion. Facilitating breastfeeding among low-income women includes comprehensive and culturally relevant support in the hospital, during the first week postpartum, and periodic support in the mother's home. Nearly 35% of low-income women stop breastfeeding within eight days of delivery. Repeated contact with supportive persons such as peer counselors and nurses, affects the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding practice after the immediate postpartum period. However, support for low-income women has been neglected and not made available because of generally unsubstantiated claims that it is not cost effective. The breastfeeding intervention used an enhanced traditional community health nurse/peer counselor home visit, which is no longer usual care for contemporary community health nursing practice, along with in-hospital and telephone support. The overall hypothesis was the intervention group will have improved breastfeeding outcomes and will demonstrate a net cost savings over usual care. The consent form explained the purpose of the study; the actual number of visits and telephone calls (if randomized into the intervention group) and the data collecttion procedures. There were no identified risks for those enrolled in the study. Incentives included $105 if the participant completed each data point.</detailed_description>
