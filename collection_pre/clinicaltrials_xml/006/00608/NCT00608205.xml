	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy together with cisplatin and fluorouracil may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy and cisplatin are more effective with or without fluorouracil in treating patients with head and neck cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy and cisplatin to compare how well they work with or without fluorouracil in treating patients with stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Cisplatin With or Without Fluorouracil Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To compare the relapse-free survival of patients treated with radiotherapy and cisplatin with vs without fluorouracil. - To compare the overall survival, local control without surgery, and patterns of failure in patients treated with these regimens. - To compare the acute and long-term toxicity of these regimens in these patients. - To compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. - To prospectively collect biopsy material, mucosal scrapings, and serum in an effort to generate hypotheses for future correlative studies. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to radiotherapy schedule (once daily vs twice daily) and radiotherapy planning (2D vs 3D vs intensity-modulated radiotherapy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo full-dose radiotherapy once or twice daily 5 days a week for up to 7 weeks and receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 22, and 43 of radiotherapy. - Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I and receive fluorouracil IV and cisplatin IV continuously on days 1-4 and 22-25 of radiotherapy. Patients with biopsy-verified residual disease at the primary site or local recurrence after achieving a complete response to chemoradiotherapy may undergo salvage surgery 12 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy. Patients complete questionnaires periodically to assess late toxicity and quality of life. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
