	<brief_title>Influence of Physostigmine on Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) in Postoperative Intensive Care Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain management is of major concern in the postoperative period, mostly based on opioids. In numerous experimental and clinical trials cholinergic mechanisms have been demonstrated to play an important antinociceptive role. Physostigmine, a central cholineresterase inhibitor, has been shown to produce analgesia and enhance opiate analgesia after systemic injection. This action is not based on Âµ-receptor (opioid) activity, but can be mostly explained by stimulation of serotonine (5-HT-3) receptors. The major withdrawal of utilizating physostigmine in postoperative care, is due to its short duration of action. In the present study, we examined the effect of a continuous intavenous physostigmine application during a patient-controlled analgesia with piritramide for 48 hours compared to a placebo infusion with NaCl. Major concern was set for consumption of analgesics, VAS-pain scale, hemodynamics, mobilisation and side effects.</detailed_description>
