	<brief_summary>Patients with head and neck cancer and are schedule to receive standard radiation therapy known as IMRT to treat cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Feasibility Study of Adaptive Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, we will plan additional measurements of the position of the patient's organs weekly during radiation treatment. We will analyze these measurements in order to evaluate whether we need to adjust our treatment procedures for the remainder of the treatments. We might adjust the dose of radiation received to specific organs in order to try to minimize the amount of radiation the healthy tissue receives.</detailed_description>
