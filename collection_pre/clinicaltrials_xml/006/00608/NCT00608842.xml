	<criteria>One or more lipomas, based on clinical and histological diagnosis, which are accessible for treatment and assessment, are quantifiable along at least 2 perpendicular diameters, and have the following characteristics: History of slow growth followed by dormancy, and stable for at least 6 months Greatest length multiplied by greatest perpendicular width between 1 and 16 cmÂ², inclusive Discrete, oval to rounded in shape, not hard or attached to underlying tissue Without changes in overlying skin (ie, inflammation, pain or tenderness, hyperpigmentation) Located on the trunk, arms, legs, or neck Signed informed consent. Absence of significant medical conditions that could affect safety History of surgical or deoxycholate treatment for lipomas Treatment with an investigational agent within 30 days before ATX101 treatment</criteria>
