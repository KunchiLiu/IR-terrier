	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the planning of radiation treatment of prostate cancer patient can be made more precise by comparing currently planning techniques to an imaging technique called SPECT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) Lymph Node Mapping</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) uses radioactive tracers and a scanner to record data that a computer constructs into two- or three-dimensional images. A small amount of a radioactive drug is injected into the body and a scanner is used to make detailed images of areas inside the body where the radioactive material is taken up by the cells. Using a gamma camera (a special kind of scanner), we can create a better picture of the lymph node region. We will compare these pictures to images from your CT scan, to help plan your therapy. The research in this study involves seeing if it is feasible to use SPECT scanning procedures for the purpose of planning your radiation treatment. We hope that doing so will allow us to more accurately and precisely plan radiation treatment to potential sites of cancer, and avoid delivering too much radiation to normal</detailed_description>
