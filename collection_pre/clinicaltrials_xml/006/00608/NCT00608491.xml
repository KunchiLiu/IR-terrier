	<brief_summary>Heart failure is a serious condition in which the heart's ability to pump blood through the body is impaired, often making a person feel weak or fatigued. When a person's condition worsens to the point of hospitalization, that person is said to have acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Abnormal kidney function in association with cardiac distress, known as cardiorenal syndrome, is a common complication of heart failure and causes further medical problems and need for hospitalization. While there are various effective treatments for heart failure, more research is needed to determine the best treatment for targeting both ADHF and cardiorenal syndrome. This study will compare the safety and effectiveness of ultrafiltration versus standard medical drug therapy in improving renal function and relieving fluid buildup in people hospitalized with ADHF and cardiorenal syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Ultrafiltration in Treating People With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure and Cardiorenal Syndrome (The CARRESS Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure is a common condition that affects approximately 5 million people in the United States, with 550,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Common symptoms of heart failure include swelling and fluid buildup in the legs, feet, and/or lungs; shortness of breath; coughing; elevated heart rate; change in appetite; and fatigue. If left untreated, the condition of the heart may deteriorate so far that the person undergoes ADHF. The number of hospitalizations attributed to ADHF has risen significantly, with many people readmitted soon after discharge because of recurring symptoms or further medical complications, such as cardiorenal syndrome. Current heart failure treatments focus on removing excess fluid buildup, often by increasing urination with diuretic medications or by draining directly from the veins. Direct drainage from the veins, also known as ultrafiltration, may be the more effective method for treating people with ADHF and cardiorenal syndrome. This study will compare the safety and effectiveness of ultrafiltration versus standard medical drug therapy in improving renal function and relieving fluid buildup in people hospitalized with ADHF and cardiorenal syndrome. Participation in this study will last 60 days. All potential participants will undergo initial screening, which will include a medical history, physical exam, blood draws, measurements of fluid intake and urine output, and questionnaires. These same evaluations and procedures will be repeated at various points during the hospital stay. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive standard medical drug therapy or fluid removal by ultrafiltration. Standard medical drug therapy will involve the intravenous delivery of diuretics and possibly other doctor-recommended medications. Ultrafiltration will involve intravenously removing blood, passing it through an ultrafiltration device, and then returning the blood to the participant. During ultrafiltration, participants will be treated with a blood thinner through the IV, as well. Follow-up assessments will occur at Days 30 and 60 after treatment. Follow-up assessments will include measurements of fluid intake, urine output, and vital signs; blood draws; physical exams; and questions about medications and status of recovery.</detailed_description>
