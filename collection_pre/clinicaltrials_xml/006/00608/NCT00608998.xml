	<brief_title>Identification of Cardiovascular Risk Factors Linked to Renal Failure Progression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to appreciate the relationship between: - extension of coronary calcifications and chronic renal failure progression - extension of coronary calcifications and levels of osteoprotegerin (bone disease marker) - cardiovascular risk factors and coronary calcifications - cardiovascular risk factors and existence of cardiovascular diseases</detailed_description>
