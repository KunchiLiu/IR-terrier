	<brief_title>Clinical Nutrition Concept for Hospitalized Patients With Malnutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients have been consecutively screened at admission by SGA (Subjective-Global-Assessment)-Score and NRS 2002 (Nutritional-Risk-Screening)-Score in the departments of surgery and internal medicine. The nutrition status of each patient is combined with clinical data, utilization data and direct costs on the basis of clinical homogenous patient clusters. Risk-Adjustment was provided by the Disease-Staging-Scale (MEDSTAT/Thomson Healthcare, Ann Arbor MI), which allows patient classification by diagnosis and co morbidities including age and gender. The risk adjustment scales run by routine data sets from german inpatient G-DRG system. In the control period the effects of usual nutrition care are documented. During the intervention period an implementation of an interdisciplinary evidence-based guideline for screening and clinical nutrition was introduced in each participating hospital. The issue is to describe the relation between risk-adjusted malnutrition status and clinical outcomes and costs.</detailed_description>
