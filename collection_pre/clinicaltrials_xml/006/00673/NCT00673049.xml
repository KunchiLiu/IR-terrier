	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to test a clinical benefit of the addition of CP 751,871 to erlotinib therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC of non adenocarcinoma histology. The primary endpoint is Overall Survival (OS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Of CP-751, 871 And Erlotinib In Refractory Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was terminated on March 8, 2010 due to an analysis by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) indicating that the addition of CP-751,871 [figitumumab] to erlotinib [Tarceva] would be unlikely to meet the primary endpoint of improving overall survival when compared to erlotinib alone. This Oncology study continues as terminated, however for ethical reasons some patients, noted with resultant benefit, continue receiving treatment.</detailed_description>
