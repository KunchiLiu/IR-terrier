	<brief_title>The Blood Pressure and Metabolic Effects of Nebivolol in Hypertensive Patients With Impaired Glucose Tolerance or Impaired Fasting Glucose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is double blind (neither you nor the physician will know when you are receiving placebo, which is an inactive compound such as a sugar pill, or active study drugs nebivolol or hydrochlorothiazide). All participants will also receive lisinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme, or losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker. All medications are approved and marketed for the treatment of hypertension.This study is being conducted in about 500 patients at approximately 80 research centers in the United States. The study consists of approximately 9 study visits over a period of 5 months. During these visits, patients will undergo routine health exams and some special laboratory tests such as an oral glucose tolerance test.</detailed_description>
