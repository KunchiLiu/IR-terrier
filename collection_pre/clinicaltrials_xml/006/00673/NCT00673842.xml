	<brief_summary>This study will assess whether an implantable defibrillator will increase the likelihood of survival in patients who have had a heart attack in the prior 5 years, have abnormal test results from a 24 hour heart monitor, and who have low normal heart function.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The REFINE ICD trial will assess whether prophylactic ICD therapy, guided by non-invasive risk assessment tools, reduces mortality in MI survivors with better-preserved LV function.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Site investigators are responsible for screening. Subjects must meet all inclusion criteria. Subjects with any exclusion criteria will be excluded. Initial inclusion criteria (eligibility for Holter screening). 18 80 years old at time of consent History of MI &gt; / = 2 and &lt; / = 60 months prior to screening based on ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF criteria (both STEMI and NSTEMI subjects are eligible) Appropriate postMI management including revascularization where indicated No contraindication for transvenous ICD placement (e.g., mechanical tricuspid valve, known vascular access problems, active sepsis, etc.) LVEF 36% 50% measured 2 to 60 months after a confirmed MI, &gt; / = 3 months after coronary angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery and &lt; / = 6 months of the screening visit Proven, necessary or appropriate medications (e.g. betablocker, ACE inhibitor / ARB, statin, and antiplatelet) In normal sinus rhythm (ECG documented) within the two weeks prior to the screening Holter Written informed consent Able and willing to complete the screening Holter, including the sixminute hall walk Additional inclusion criterion (eligibility for randomization). â€¢ Abnormal HRT &amp; TWA (core lab interpretation) on Holter performed 2 to 60 months after the index MI and the specified time after coronary revascularization Exclusion criteria (randomization or registry). Use of antiarrhythmic drugs Clinical indication for permanent pacemaker or a cardiac resynchronization device Clinical indication for an ICD or cardiac resynchronization ICD Prior implantation of a pacemaker, ICD, or Cardiac Resynchronization device Any condition, in the investigator's judgment, that would limit life expectancy to &lt; 12 months Chronic renal failure (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) Active ischemia that is amenable to revascularization if not previously revascularized Participation in another trial that may interfere with the REFINE ICD results. Pregnancy Inability to comply with the followup schedule</criteria>
