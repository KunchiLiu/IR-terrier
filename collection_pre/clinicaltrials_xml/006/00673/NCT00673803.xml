	<brief_summary>Studies showed that a sharp posterior optic edge of an intraocular lens (IOL) inhibits migration of lens epithelial cells in between posterior capsule and optic of the IOL and therefore reduces the rate of posterior capsule opacification (PCO). In present time most IOLs implanted have a sharp posterior optic edge. Due to differences in IOL production different IOLs have different rates of PCO. Progression in cataract surgery technique allow phacoemulsification through micro-incisions. Therefore there is need for IOLs that can be implanted through incisions of about 2.5 mm. This study investigates the effect of two different hydrophobic acrylic IOLs with a sharp posterior optic edge on the rate of PCO after implantation through a micro-incision. The results will be compared intraindividually.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>prospective, randomized, bilateral study with intraindividual comparison, implantation of a Polylens Y10 IOL in one eye and implantation of a Polylens Y30 in the contralateral eye. PCO rate will be detected at 1 year and 2 years.</detailed_description>
