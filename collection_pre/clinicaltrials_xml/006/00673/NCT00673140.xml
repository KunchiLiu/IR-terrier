	<brief_summary>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, sometimes called Lou Gehrig's s Disease, or Maladie de Charcot) is a progressive, usually fatal, neurodegenerative disease caused by the degeneration of motor neurons, the nerve cells in the central nervous system that control voluntary muscle movement. This study will investigate the use of far infrared radiation for the control, management and treatment of ALS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Far Infrared Irradiation for Control, Management and Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As a motor neuron disease, ALS causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body as both the upper and lower motor neurons degenerate, ceasing to send messages to muscles. Unable to function, the muscles gradually weaken, develop fasciculations (twitches) because of denervation, and eventually atrophy due to that denervation. The patient may ultimately lose the ability to initiate and control all voluntary movement except of the eyes. Observations from our research studies indicate that, far infrared rays provide energy to the body, improve the autonomic functions of the nervous system, restore the functions of the endocrine system, strengthen the immune system, improve blood circulation and increase the level of oxygen in the cells and promote the regeneration of muscle cells, nerves and brain cells. It is hereby postulated that irradiation using far infrared, with wavelength between 5 to 20 microns, of the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the whole body could prevent, control, manage or possibly lead to complete rehabilitation of people who have ALS.</detailed_description>
