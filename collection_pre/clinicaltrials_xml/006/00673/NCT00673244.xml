	<brief_summary>The principal objective is to safely determine if we can identify the severity of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) early in the course of the disease. Once enrolled, we will draw blood and urine for relevant biomarkers. Our goal is to validate if any of these biomarkers can predict the course of AKI (recovery v. RRT v. death)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protocol to Assess the Severity of Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AKI is a very common disease in the intensive care unit. However, despite advances in supportive care, patients with AKI carry a high mortality rate (50% to 70%). The established AKI affects nearly 5 percent of hospitalized persons and as many as 15 percent of critically ill patients. Currently, there are no FDA approved therapeutic agents for the treatment of AKI. Retrospective studies suggest that the early initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) improves outcome. Many clinicians tend to take a "wait and see" approach because they do not want to dialyze a patient who is destined to recover renal function without the need for RRT. Therefore, it is vitally important to know early in the course which patients with AKI are likely to progress to RRT.</detailed_description>
