	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find ways to improve wound healing and decrease the negative effects of trauma from burn injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Mechanisms of Improved Wound Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involves research and the investigators hope to learn the following: how or what effect one or more anabolic ("tissue building") agents have on muscle metabolism, wound healing, and immune function after severe burn. The agents include the following: growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 in combination with its binding proteins, insulin, Beta-adrenergic blockers, Alpha Adrenergic Agonist, anabolic steroids such as testosterone, Oxandrolone and nandrolone, ketoconazole and its derivatives, dehydroepiandrosterone, fenofibrate, diet or the application of skin substitute.</detailed_description>
