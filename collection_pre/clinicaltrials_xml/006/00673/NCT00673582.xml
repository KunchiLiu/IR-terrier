	<brief_summary>Rosuvastatin is a drug used to lower cholesterol, which also has other cardiovascular benefits. The goal of this project is to determine if rosuvastatin is effective at slowing the development of heart disease in people with HIV. We expect that after 2 years of treatment people treated with rosuvastatin will show significantly better results than people treated with a placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV+ patients with at least one cardiovascular risk factor will be randomized to either rosuvastatin 10mg/day or placebo for a period of 96 weeks. B-mode carotid ultrasound will assess the primary outcome measure of average total thickness (a composite measurement of intima media thickness and total plaque area) at baseline, 24, 48, 72 and 96 weeks. We hypothesize that rosuvastatin will be significantly more effective with respect to inhibition of change in average total thickness between baseline and 96 weeks compared to placebo.</detailed_description>
