	<brief_summary>Diabetic premacular hemorrhage occurs when blood from preretinal neovascular tissue is entrapped between the retina and the posterior hyaloid in the macular area. It may occur spontaneously or secondary to traction from a localized posterior vitreous detachment. This complication may greatly disturb the central vision and may be an important stimulant of fibrovascular proliferation. Bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, Inc.) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which has been used to treat a variety of neovascular ocular diseases. In proliferative diabetic retinopathy, intravitreal bevacizumab has been shown to induce prompt regression of neovascularization and may enhance resolution of vitreous hemorrhage. In this study, we propose that simultaneous intravitreal injection of gas and bevacizumab may be a useful treatment option in diabetic premacular hemorrhage with active fibrovascular tissue. In this procedure, gas is used to displace the blood while bevacizumab may render the neovascularization less active to decrease the likelihood of recurrent hemorrhage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravitreal Injection of Bevacizumab and Gas for Diabetic Premacular Hemorrhage With Active Fibrovascular Proliferation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, consecutive cases of acute diabetic premacular hemorrhage and active fibrovascular proliferation will receive intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg in 0.05 mL) and C3F8 (0.2-0.3 mL) during the same setting. Before intravitreal injection, all patients should either have complete panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) treatment or PRP to the peripheral retina. After treatment, patients will maintain a prone position for three days and be followed at regular interval. After vitreous clear-up, further supplementary PRP extending beyond equator will be done. Snellen best-corrected visual acuity measurements, intraocular pressure, slit-lamp examination and non-contact lens biomicroscopic examination will be performed before treatment and at each follow-up visit. Data including the extent of premacular hemorrhage, and the interval between the treatment and clearing of premacular hemorrhage will also be recorded.</detailed_description>
