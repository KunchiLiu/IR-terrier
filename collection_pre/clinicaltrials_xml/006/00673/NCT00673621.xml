	<brief_summary>This study will compare the rate and extent of absorption of TI Inhalation Powder in subjects with asthma and subjects with normal lung function. 24 eligible subjects will be enrolled into the treatment phase of the trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Designed to Determine if the Pharmacokinetic Disposition of Inhaled Insulin Exposure is the Same for Asthmatics and Non-asthmatics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Visit 1 screening will determine eligibility and obtain informed consent. At visit 2, 3 and 4 subjects inhale 1 dose of 45U TI Inhalation Powder. At visit 3 subjects inhale 2 puffs (200mcg) Albuterol prior to dosing. Only asthmatic subjects undergo visit 4 where a methacholine challenge test (MCT) is performed followed by inhalation of Albuterol then administration of TI Inhalation Powder. Each visit's dosing will occur during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Visit 5 is the follow up visit.</detailed_description>
