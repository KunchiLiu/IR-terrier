	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of this study is to determine whether the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin is effective in the treatment of symptoms of schizophrenia. The primary hypothesis is that patients with schizophrenia receiving add-on treatment with simvastatin will improve clinically (as measured mainly by symptom severity) compared with patients receiving placebo, and that this improvement will be accompanied by concomitant reduction in peripheral inflammatory markers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The identification of alternative therapies with the capacity to dampen inflammatory processes and reduce serum cholesterol takes on additional significance given independent concerns about heightened cardiovascular risk in schizophrenia patients, through exposure to antipsychotic drugs, increased cholesterol levels, metabolic syndrome and obesity, and smoking.</detailed_description>
