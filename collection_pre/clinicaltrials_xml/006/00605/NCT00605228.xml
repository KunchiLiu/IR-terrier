Results will be summarised by treatment and age (overall, 18-35, 36-49, 50-74 and 75-85 years old) and provided in individual data listings. Safety analysis will be performed on the safety set (ITT population). Safety data of all patients exposed will be summarised by treatment and age (overall, 18-35, 36-49, 50-74 and 75-85 years old). Acceptability analysis will be performed on the ITT population. Acceptability data of all patients will be summarised by treatment and age (overall, 18-35, 36-49, 50-74 and 75-85 years old).</detailed_description>
