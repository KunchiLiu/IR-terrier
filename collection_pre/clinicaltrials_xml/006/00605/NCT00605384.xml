	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical research study is to find out whether a combination of entecavir (ETV) plus tenofovir (TNF) works better against Hepatitis B virus than adefovir (ADV) added to continuing lamivudine (LVD) therapy in patients whose Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is resistant against lamivudine. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.</brief_summary>
