Subjects must meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSMIVTR) criteria(18) for opioid dependence.

Subjects must not, according to selfreport, have injected opioids more than four times in the month prior to screening. Subjects must have an opioidnegative urine drug screening (UDS) result prior to randomization. Each subject must confirm that he or she is practicing adequate contraception. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (Î²hCG) test prior to enrollment in the study. Subjects for whom treatment with either Subutex or Suboxone as required in the protocol would be inconsistent with national labeling. Subjects who are unwilling or unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol (eg, pending incarceration) or are in a situation or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with participation in the study. Subjects who are participating in any other clinical study in which medication(s) are being delivered. Subjects with known allergy or sensitivity to naloxone. Subjects who are on the staff, affiliated with, or a family member of the staff personnel directly involved with this study. Subjects must not have serious untreated Axis I DSMIVTR psychiatric comorbidity (eg, those who are actively suicidal or homicidal, have untreated schizophrenia, etc).
