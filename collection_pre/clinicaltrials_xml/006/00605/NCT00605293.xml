	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study will compare the efficacy and safety of monthly administration of intravenous (IV) Mircera versus epoetin alfa for the maintenance of hemoglobin levels in hemodialysis patients with chronic renal anemia. Participants currently receiving maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa will be randomized either to receive monthly injections of 120, 200 or 360 micrograms Mircera, with the starting dose derived from the dose of epoetin alfa they were receiving in the week preceding study start, or to continue on epoetin alfa treatment. The anticipated duration of study is 32 weeks, and the target sample size is 146 participants.</brief_summary>
