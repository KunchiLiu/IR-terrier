	<brief_summary>Hyperglycemia is a common complication of corticosteroid (cortisone) therapy. It is estimated that more than a third of patients with chronic pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation (16). Despite its frequency, the impact of corticosteroid-induced diabetes on clinical outcome and mortality is not known. A computerized search of biomedical journal literature from MEDLINE, PubMed, and Ovid from 1966 to 2006 provided very little information on the prevalence and outcome of corticosteroid-induced diabetes in patients with COPD. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the impact of corticosteroid-induced diabetes on clinical outcome in patients with COPD exacerbation. We will perform a retrospective chart review of all patients admitted to the hospital with COPD exacerbation from 1/01/05 to 06/30/06 at Grady Memorial Hospital. Medical records of all patients with COPD exacerbation treated with corticosteroids will be analyzed. Data on demographics, laboratory values, mortality rate, rate of hypoglycemic events, length of stay, as well as disposition at discharge will be analyzed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on COPD Corticosteroid-induced Hyperglycemia on Clinical Outcome in Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses: We hypothesize that COPD patients with corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia experience higher morbidity (infections, ventilator associated pneumonia, length of stay, acute renal failure) and mortality compared to COPD patients with normal glucose levels. Specific Aim: To determine the impact of corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia on clinical outcome (length of stay, disposition, APACHE score, need for ventilatory support and ICU admission, mortality) in patients with COPD exacerbation.</detailed_description>
