	<criteria>Patients for this study must meet the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment: 1. The patient is &gt;18 years of age. 2. Patient is considered a candidate for the IVCF under one of the following indications: Proven PE Recurrent PE despite adequate anticoagulation Contraindication to anticoagulation Inability to achieve/maintain therapeutic anticoagulation Iliocaval DVT Large, freefloating proximal (i.e. ileofemoral) DVT Massive PE treated with thrombolysis/thrombectomy Chronic PE treated with thrombectomy Protection during thrombolysis for iliocaval DVT PE with limited cardiopulmonary reserve Poor compliance with anticoagulant medications High risk of injury worsened by anticoagulation (e.g., ataxia, falls) Multitrauma patient with high risk of PE Surgical patients at high risk of PE Medical condition with high risk of PE 3. Patient has a vena cava diameter of 1728mm. 4. The patient or legal guardian has been informed of the nature of the study and agrees to its provisions and has provided informed written consent. 5. The patient is willing to be available for the appropriate followup for the duration of the study. 6. The patient has suitable IVC anatomy that would allow infrarenal placement of the filter. Patients who have ANY of the following exclusion criteria are NOT eligible for the study: 1. The patient has one of the following conditions: Renal vein thrombosis IVC thrombosis extending to renal veins Duplicate IVC Gonadal vein thrombosis Requires suprarenal filter placement 2. The patient has an uncontrolled infectious disease. 3. The patient is at risk for aseptic PE. 4. Patient has uncontrollable coagulopathy. 5. Patient has an existing IVCF. 6. The patient has a life expectancy of less than 6 months. 7. The patient is pregnant. 8. The patient has a condition that inhibits radiographic visualization of the IVC. 9. The patient has a known allergy or intolerance to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or Nitinol. 10. The patient has a known hypersensitivity to contrast which cannot be pretreated. 11. The patient's access vessels preclude safe insertion of the delivery system. 12. The patient is participating in another device or drug study. Patient must have completed the follow up phase of any previous study at least 30 days prior to enrollment into this trial. The patient may only be enrolled in this study once. 13. The patient is unable and/or unwilling to cooperate with study procedures or required followup visits.</criteria>
