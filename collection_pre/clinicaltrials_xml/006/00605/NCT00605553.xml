	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate SYN115 in Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study in which each patient will act as their own control. Each patient enrolled will receive both SYN115 (20 mg or 60 mg) and placebo separated by a minimum of one week washout between periods. An adaptive design will be used to determine if SYN115 elicits effects relevant to PD in the fewest number of patients by performing interim analyses in successive cohorts of patients receiving 60 or 20 mg.</detailed_description>
