	<brief_summary>This is a phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy of the combination of metronomic cyclophosphamide and tailored sorafenib dosing in advanced, progressive NET. NET are highly vascular tumors, and high VEGF expression has been correlated with worse clinical and pathological characteristics as well as poor prognosis. A novel antiangiogenic approach relies on targeting not only the endothelial cells but also rendering them more sensitive to VEGFR blockade by achieving pericyte detachment. In this study, the dose of sorafenib will be titrated up to a maximum of 800mg BID based on patients' toxicity and on a novel pharmacodynamic assay that measures inhibition of molecular target(PDGFR) in patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Dual VEGFR targeting is achieved by administering sorafenib plus metronomic low dose cyclophosphamide.</brief_summary>
