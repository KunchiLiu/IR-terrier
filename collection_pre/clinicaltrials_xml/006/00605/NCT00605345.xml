	<brief_summary>This two arm study will compare the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous Mircera versus darbepoetin alfa for the maintenance of hemoglobin levels in kidney transplant recipients with chronic renal anemia. Patients currently receiving maintenance treatment with darbepoetin alfa will be randomized either to receive 4-weekly injections of Mircera with a starting dose (120, 200 or 360 micrograms subcutaneously) derived from the dose of darbepoetin alfa they were receiving in the 2 weeks preceding study start, or to stay on 2-weekly darbepoetin alfa therapy. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
