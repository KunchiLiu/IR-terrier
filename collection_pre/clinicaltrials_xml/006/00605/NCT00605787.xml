	<brief_title>TTA in Treatment of Diabetes and Dyslipidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The tight linkage of obesity, insulin resistance (and frank diabetes), dyslipidemia, and hypertension has been widely observed and has been named syndrome X, or the metabolic syndrome. For many years metformin has been the only drug in clinical use with effects on insulin resistance. Recently, agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have been introduced in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The different PPARs seem to be activated by a wide range of lipids and lipid mediators, including fatty acids. 2-tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA) is a modified fatty acid with high affinity for the PPARgamma receptor. In animal models of obesity-related insulin resistance (obese Zucker rats and dietary manipulated Wistar rats), TTA has an insulin sensitizing effect by enhancing the insulin mediated uptake of glucose in peripheral tissues. TTA treatment promotes fatty acid catabolism in experimental animals and this could casually be linked to the improved glucose tolerance. The protocol for the present study describes a safety assessment and therapeutic exploratory evaluation of TTA in a small subset of male type 2 diabetes patients for 4 weeks. The primary safety parameters will include general physical observational parameters, liver function test and hematological parameters. To goal is to assess the efficacy of TTA on selected metabolic parameters including fasting blood glucose and insulin, fasting plasma lipids, antioxidant status, and fibrinolytic parameters, weight, BMI and blood pressure.</detailed_description>
