	<brief_title>A Study of IMC-A12 or Ramucirumab Plus Mitoxantrone and Prednisone in Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the United States. Chemotherapy, either as a single agent or in combination, may lead to clinical response, pain control, and/or improved quality of life. Docetaxel is now the first-line standard therapy for AIPC. Mitoxantrone was approved in 1996 for use in combination with corticosteroids as initial chemotherapy for pain related to advanced Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer (HRPC). Hormonal manipulations and docetaxel-based chemotherapy are often effective in metastatic prostate cancer; however, disease becomes refractory to these interventions in the majority of men. Although mitoxantrone continues to be a significant agent in the treatment of HRPC, there exists a need for more efficacious therapy in docetaxel-refractory- AIPC. Because of the potential contribution of Insulin Like Growth Factor Receptor (IGF-IR) and VEGFR-2 mediated pathways in prostate cancer pathogenesis, it is hypothesized that each of these biological agents in combination with mitoxantrone and prednisone will result in clinically meaningful activity in AIPC. Therefore, ImClone plans to conduct a randomized Phase 2 trial to assess the safety and efficacy of IMC-A12 or IMC-1121B (ramucirumab) in combination with mitoxantrone and prednisone in participants with AIPC.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The participant has histologicallyconfirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate The participant has radiographic evidence of metastatic prostate cancer (stage M1 or D2) The participant has prostate cancer unresponsive or refractory to hormone therapy (androgenindependent) The participant has had disease progression (clinical or radiographic) while receiving docetaxel, or within 120 days of receiving docetaxelbased chemotherapy and in the opinion of the investigator is unlikely to derive significant benefit from additional docetaxelbased therapy, or was intolerant to therapy with this agent The participant must have evidence of progressive disease defined as at least one of the following; 1. Progressive measurable disease: using conventional solid tumor criteria 2. Bone scan progression: at least two new lesions on bone scan 3. Increasing PSA: at least two consecutive rising PSA values over a reference value (PSA #1) taken at least 1 week apart. A third PSA (PSA #3) is required to be greater than PSA #2; if not, a fourth PSA (PSA #4) is required to be greater than PSA #2 The participant has a PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL The participant has prior surgical or medical castration with a serum testosterone of &lt;50 ng/mL. If the method of castration is luteinizing hormone releasing level hormone (LHRH) agonists, the participant must be willing to continue the use of LHRH agonists during protocol treatment The participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 02 The participant has adequate hematologic function (absolute neutrophil count [ANC]≥1500/uL, hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL, and platelets ≥100,000/uL) The participant has adequate hepatic function (bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), Aspartate Transaminase (AST) and Alanine Transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3 times the ULN, or ≤ 5 times the ULN if liver metastases are present) The participant has adequate renal function (creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min) The participant's urinary protein is ≤ 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA). If urine dipstick or routine analysis indicates ≥ 2+ proteinuria, then a 24hour urine must be collected and must demonstrate &lt; 1000 mg of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in the study The participant has adequate coagulation function (an international normalized ratio [INR] ≤ 1.5 and a Partial Thromboplastin Time [PTT] ≤ 5 seconds above the ULN [unless on oral anticoagulant therapy]). Participants receiving fulldose anticoagulation therapy are eligible provided they meet all other criteria, are on a stable dose of oral anticoagulant or low molecular weight heparin (and if on warfarin have a therapeutic INR between 2 and 3) The participant has a fasting serum glucose level of &lt; 160 mg/dL, or below the ULN The participant has received more than one prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease. (Participants who have had a treatment break followed by a second docetaxelbased regimen with subsequent disease progression are eligible.) The participant has received prior therapy with mitoxantrone for advanced prostate cancer (prior adjuvant therapy with mitoxantrone is permitted) The participant has a history of symptomatic congestive heart failure or has a prestudy echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) that is ≥ 10% below the LLN The participant has received radiotherapy ≤ 21 days prior to first dose of IMCA12 or Ramucirumab The participant is receiving corticosteroids (dexamethasone, prednisone, or others) at a dose &gt; 5 mg prednisone orally (PO) two times per day (BID) or equivalent. Participants receiving corticosteroids at higher doses may be eligible if their corticosteroid therapy is tapered to study levels (prednisone 5 mg PO BID) prior to first dose of study medication, without concomitant clinical deterioration The participant has known or suspected brain or leptomeningeal metastases The participant has uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension The participant has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.
