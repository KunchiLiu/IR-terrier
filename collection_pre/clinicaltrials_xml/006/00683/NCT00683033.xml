These sessions include testing a breath sample for evidence of smoking twice each day (separated by at least 5 hours), counseling based on Public Health Service (PHS) guidelines for quitting smoking during the second session each day, and setting a quit date. After these sessions, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two 4-week conditions: (a) standard care or (b) standard care plus prize CM for smoking abstinence with the opportunity to win prizes for submitting samples that meet smoking abstinence criteria (e.g., CO ≤ 6ppm; cotinine ≤ 30ng/mL).
