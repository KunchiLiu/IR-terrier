	<brief_summary>AZUR Pharma has received several reports from practicing psychiatrists prescribing FazaClo showing that FazaClo patients start losing body weight instead of keep gaining it, after being switched from other clozapine products or other atypical antipsychotics treatments. Another important clinical observation reported by doctors is a considerable reduction in hypersalivation when FazaClo administration is compared to other antipsychotic treatments. Based on the findings described above, and on the real need for effective and safer treatments for schizophrenia, AZUR Pharma has decided to design and conduct an observational study in a large number of patients taking FazaClo to prove the received clinical reports from physicians. Better understanding and evaluation of these beneficial findings are necessary to provide physicians information for improved treatment decision.</brief_summary>
