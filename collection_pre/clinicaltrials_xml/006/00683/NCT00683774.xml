	<brief_summary>Increased insulin levels leads to increased secretion of D-chiro inositol(DCI) from the kidneys in women with PCOS, but not in normal women. This leads to a reduction in circulating DCI and insulin stimulated release of DCI-IPG.To determine if decreasing circulating insulin directly by inhibition of islet insulin release with diazoxide in obese women with PCOS 1)decreases the renal clearance of DCI and 2) increases the circulating concentration of DCI.</brief_summary>
