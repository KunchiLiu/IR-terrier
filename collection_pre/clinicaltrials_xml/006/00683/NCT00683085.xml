	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States, and no combination therapy is far superior to gemcitabine alone. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 1 (VEGFR1) is expressed on the tumor vessels and a candidate of tumor vessel-specific peptide vaccination strategy to induce T cell immune response. We conducted the study to confirm the safety and efficacy of combined modality intervention using conventional dose of gemcitabine with peptide vaccination targeting tumor-vessel specific VEGFR1 in case of advanced/inoperable or therapy-resistant pancreatic cancer patients. Gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m^2 (body surface area) will be administered on day 1, day 8, day 15, day 29, day 36, and day 43, respectively. VEGFR1-derived HLA-A*02:01-restricted peptide (VEGFR1-A02-770; TLFWLLLTL) emulsified with Montanide ISA51 will be subcutaneously injected twice weekly for 8 weeks (total 16 doses).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HLA-A*02:01-restricted VEGFR1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses were obtained from HLA-A2/Kd transgenic murine model. HLA-A*02:01-restricted VEGFR1-specific CTL clones were also obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteer donors. These CTL clones showed potent anti-tumor CTL responses in HLA class Ⅰ-restricted manner in vitro. Vaccination of HLA-A*02:01-restricted VEGFR1-specific peptide to A2/Kd transgenic mice markedly suppress the tumor-induced angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo.</detailed_description>
