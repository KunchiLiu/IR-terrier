	<brief_summary>Although patient-ventilator asynchrony is a frequent phenomenon, its course following management is unknown. As the aid of a data recording system, we try to observe the consequence of patient-ventilator asynchrony following management. Our target is aimed at the patients with high asynchronization index ( &gt; 10%) as this group of patients have been shown to have prolonged course in intensive care unit and are also prone to be tracheostomized</brief_summary>
