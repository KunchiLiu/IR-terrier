	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Comparing Conventional and Robot-assisted(Da Vinci®)Laparoscopic Interventions for Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the last few years robot-assisted surgery has been introduced in many surgical specialties and experiences in gynaecological surgery are very limited. Several aspects like the wider range of motion of robot-instruments leading to more precision in surgery, the 3 dimensional optical system and the ergonomically designed console may offer some advantages. For better judgment these possible benefits as well as safety and outcome need to be evaluated and compared with conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy techniques. This randomized clinical trail intends to compare conventional with robot-assisted(da Vinci®-System) laparoscopic hysterectomy regarding specific parameters. The focus of the study will be to investigate if the robot assisted procedure shows significant advantages for the patient considering duration of surgery, complications, hospitalisation and costs.</detailed_description>
