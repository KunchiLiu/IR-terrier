	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate a method of using dendritic cells (a kind of white blood cell) as a vaccine to stimulate your own immune system to react to your melanoma cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dendritic Cells (White Blood Cells) Vaccination for Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients that provide written informed consent will undergo apheresis to collect blood mononuclear cells for vaccine production. All patients will be given cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2 IV three days prior to vaccine dose #1 in order to deplete regulatory T cells. All patients will receive mature DC for each dose of vaccine. For each dose all patients will receive autologous dendritic cells pulsed with 2 gp100 melanoma peptides (G209-2M and G280-9V) plus up to an additional 10 unique melanoma tumor-specific peptides. All patients will receive booster doses with mature DC. The DC vaccine will be given intravenously every three weeks for a total of six vaccine doses. Peripheral blood (16 ml) will be taken weekly to monitor the immune response to each peptide by tetramer assay. Apheresis is repeated after vaccine dose #3 and dose #6 in order to collect PBMC for immune monitoring. Restaging is performed after three and six vaccine doses. Patients with stable disease or better (partial response/complete response) after six doses will be eligible to receive additional vaccinations as maintenance therapy every 2 months until progression.</detailed_description>
