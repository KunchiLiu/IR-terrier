	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if radical radiochemotherapy on the mediastinum after lobectomy can be associated with significant long term survival in patients with initially unresectable stage III NSCLC responding to induction chemotherapy but in which the residual disease is too large to be treated by radiotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histological or cytological diagnosis of nonsmall cell carcinoma of the lung Initially stage III NSCLC Pathologically proven N2 or N3 disease Any response to induction chemotherapy (whatever the regimen administered) Disease still not fully resectable (because of extensive mediastinal N disease) and not suitable for radical radiotherapy (single field) after induction chemotherapy Lobectomy possible for the treatment of T disease Availability for participating in the detailed followup of the protocol Informed consent Prior treatment with radiotherapy or surgery Karnofsky PS &lt; 60 Functional or anatomical contraindication to mediastinal radiotherapy Functional or anatomical contraindication to surgical lobectomy A history of prior malignant tumour, except nonmelanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix or cured malignant tumour (more than 5 year diseasefree interval) Malignant pleural or pericardial effusion Neutrophils &lt; 2,000/mmÂ³ Platelet cells &lt; 100,000/mm3 Serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5 mg/100 ml Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/100 ml and/or creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min Recent myocardial infarction (less than 3 months prior to date of diagnosis) Congestive cardiac failure or cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical treatment Uncontrolled infectious disease Hearing loss Symptomatic polyneuropathy Serious medical or psychological factors which may prevent adherence to the treatment schedule</criteria>
