	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to establish a feasible combination of bendamustine and paclitaxel in a weekly schedule. The two agents have different toxicity profiles and are well tolerated when given in a weekly fashion. The combination might be of special interest for elderly patients with hormone insensitive breast cancer</brief_summary>
