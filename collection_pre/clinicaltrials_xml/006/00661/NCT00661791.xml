	<brief_title>Effects of Massage Therapy and Kinesthetic Stimulation on Pre-Term Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premature infants are often cared for in a fashion that minimizes physical activity in order to reduce stress and stress-related complications. Previous studies have indicated that massage therapy may increase weight gain and enabled earlier discharge of premature infants. In this study, premature infants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: A: Control Group B: Massage Group, 15 minutes twice a day; C: Massage and physical exercise group 15 minutes each, twice a day.</detailed_description>
