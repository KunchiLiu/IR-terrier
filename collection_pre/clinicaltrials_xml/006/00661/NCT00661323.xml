	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography are two imaging methods that are used to obtain pictures of the heart and assess heart function. This study will evaluate a new, four-dimensional echocardiography approach of obtaining heart images to determine if it is as effective at evaluating heart function as MRI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating a New Echocardiography Imaging Procedure for Evaluating Heart Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MRI is a non-invasive method of obtaining images of the body. An MRI is conducted by having a person lie down on a narrow table, which then slides into a large tunnel-like tube. Powerful magnets and radio waves scan the body and a computer records the resulting signals. An echocardiography is a non-invasive ultrasound test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart. It is performed by having a doctor move a wand-like device over a patient's chest. The device then converts sound waves into pictures of the heart. Currently, a special MRI technique is used to evaluate heart function; however, MRI is expensive and cannot be used on critically ill patients. Echocardiography can be performed at a patient's bedside and it may be a more effective way of assessing heart function. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a new four-dimensional echocardiography approach at evaluating heart function. Results from this study may be used to diagnose and treat patients more effectively in the future. This study will enroll healthy people who do not have heart disease and people who are receiving chemotherapy who do not have heart disease. Participants will have a physical examination and a medical records review. MRI scans and a four-dimensional echocardiography of the heart will be performed. There will be no additional study visits.</detailed_description>
