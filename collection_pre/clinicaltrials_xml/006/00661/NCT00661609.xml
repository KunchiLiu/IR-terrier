	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase II study is to determine if AZD4877, an experimental drug that is a novel anti-mitotic agent (Eg5 or Kinesin Spindle Protein inhibitor that interferes with tumor cell division leading to tumor growth), can reduce tumor sizes in patients with bladder cancer</brief_summary>
