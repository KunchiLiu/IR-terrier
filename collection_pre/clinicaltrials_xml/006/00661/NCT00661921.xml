	<criteria>Diagnosis of T2DM ≥ 3 months at time of randomization HbA1c of 7.0 9.5% (inclusive) at screening ≥ 18 years of age at the time of randomization BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 and ≤ 45 kg/m2 at screening, and, per patient selfreport, following their regular weight maintenance or reduction diet for the management of diabetes for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization Fasting plasma glucose ≤ 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) at each of 2 determinations during screening (samples taken at least 1 day apart) No new therapy for the treatment of elevated blood pressure or dyslipidemia, use of any weight loss medication (over the counter or prescription), or initiation of a prescribed weight management or exercise program within 4 weeks before randomization Subject is able and willing to comply with the study's visit requirement History of type 1 insulindependent diabetes Significant signs and symptoms of uncontrolled hyperglycemia (ie, polyuria, polydypsia, polyphagia), in the opinion of the investigator History of significant weight gain or loss (+/ 5%) during the 4 weeks before randomization Triglycerides ≥ 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L) and/or total cholesterol ≥340 mg/dL (8.7 mmol/L) at screening Currently receiving or received within 60 days prior to screening any antidiabetic pharmaceutical therapy (eg, insulin) other than metformin and/or sulfonylurea. If receiving metformin or sulfonylurea, doses must be stable for ≥ 60 days. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as diastolic pressure &gt; 95 mmHg and/or systolic &gt; 170 mmHg during screening Hepatic function test (alanine aminotranferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin) results at screening &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal for the central laboratory White blood cell count &lt; 3000 / μL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of &lt; 2500 / μL, or platelet count of &lt; 125,000 / μL at screening Any significant inflammatory, rheumatologic, or systemic autoimmune disease in the opinion of the investigator Evidence of active infection, recent infection, or chronic infection, requiring treatment with antiinfectives, hospitalization or IV antibiotics within 4 weeks prior to randomization Active or latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection as defined by known positive PPD or chest xray findings and failure to complete treatment with appropriate chemoprophylaxis, or exposure to a person with active tuberculosis within 6 months prior to randomization Existence of nonhealing wounds or ulcers Known to be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Estimated GFR (eGFR) at screening &lt; 30 mL/min as calculated via the MDRD equation (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study group) Clinical evidence of current malignancy, with the following exceptions: basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, prostate cancer (if stable localized disease, with life expectancy of &gt; 3 years); or receiving or has received chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for treatment of a malignancy within 6 months prior to randomization Clinically significant cardiovascular disease (eg, heart failure of New York Heart Association [NYHA] class 3 or 4), hematological abnormality, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (eg, requiring oral or IV steroids), in the opinion of the investigator Receipt of any biologic or immunosuppressive therapy (experimental or commercial), including anakinra (Kineret®) or any tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocking agents (eg, etanercept and infliximab), or live vaccines, within 3 months of randomization Previously received AMG 108 Subject is evidently pregnant (eg, positive human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG] test), is breast feeding, or is of childbearing potential and not using adequate contraceptive precautions, as determined by the investigator Subject currently is enrolled in or has not yet completed at least 30 days since ending other investigational device or drug study(s), or subject is receiving other investigational agent(s) Subject has any kind of condition (eg, psychiatric illness) or situation that, in the investigator's opinion, compromises the ability of the subject to give written informed consent, may put the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study</criteria>
