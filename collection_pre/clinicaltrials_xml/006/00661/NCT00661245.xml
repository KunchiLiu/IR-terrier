	<brief_summary>The TOGA® trial is a prospective, multi-center, randomized sham-controlled trial designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of the TOGA System for the treatment of morbid obesity. The study will also determine the effect of the treatment on co-morbidities and quality of life. Subjects will be blinded to treatment or sham. Sham arm may crossover to TOGA treatment at 12 months.</brief_summary>
