	<brief_title>Specific IgG Antibody in Patients With Primary Antibody Deficiencies Treated With Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapy with polyvalent immunoglobulin (Ig) has been established as the standard therapy for antibody deficiencies for several decades now. Although subcutaneous infusions were originally proposed as an alternative to intramuscular injections, more recently, this method has been proven as a safe and convenient method for providing immunoglobulin levels in adults and children. Subcutaneous administration of immunoglobulins has some clinical advantages over intravenous immunoglobulin infusions (IVIG) , including a more benign side effect profile, better sustained levels of IgG in the blood and reduced cost. An additional benefit is an improvement in the quality of life, which is in part secondary to the feasibility of the patients to administer it themselves at home. The most common infections in primary antibody deficiency patients involves encapsulated bacteria, mainly Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b. The aim of this study is to verify if patients with antibody deficiency receiving subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) infusions keep protective antibody levels to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and tetanus toxoid.</detailed_description>
