Known or suspected impairment/alteration of the immune system, immunosuppressive therapy, including use of corticosteroids in immunosuppressive doses or chronic use of inhaled highpotency corticosteroids within the previous 60 days. [Use of topical corticosteroids administered during the study in limited areas (i.e., eczema on knees or face or elbows) of the body is allowed]; immunostimulants; 10. Receipt of blood, blood products and/or plasma derivatives, or a parenteral immunoglobulin preparation within the previous 90 days; 11. History of severe allergic reactions after previous vaccinations or hypersensitivity to any vaccine component; 12. Receipt of or intent to immunize with any other vaccine(s) within 30 days prior (60 days for live viral vaccines) and throughout the study period (exception: licensed fluvaccine should not be administered within 14 days prior to enrollment; routine vaccine administration may be administered after the blood draw at Study Month 7); 13. Participation in another clinical trial within the last 90 days or planned for during study; 14. Family members and household members of research staff; 15.
