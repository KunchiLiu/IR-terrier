	<brief_summary>Opioid medications are commonly used for pain relief. When given over time, physical dependence can occur. This results in unpleasant side effects--such as agitation and nausea--if opioid medications are suddenly stopped. We are interested in knowing if a medication named Ondansetron can help ease or prevent symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal. We are also interested in knowing if a similar (but more potent FDA-approved drug, palonosetron) can more effectively treat withdrawal symptoms with or without combination with an antihistamine called hydroxyzine (vistaril).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>POWS: Palonosetron/Ondansetron Opioid Withdrawal Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hope to learn if Ondansetron, Palonosetron, and/or combination with hydroxyzine can be used to prevent or attenuate the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. If we find that it can help prevent these symptoms, it may become a new treatment that can aid patients suffering from these symptoms.</detailed_description>
