	<brief_summary>To find out more information on how treating impotence with vardenafil in comparison to placebo affects the quality of life (QoL) of men and their partners. Subjects will receive 10mg vardenafil or placebo for 4 weeks followed by an 8 week period when the dose of vardenafil may be reduced to 5mg or increased to 20mg. Subjects will then receive their 'preferred' dose for 14 weeks. During this time Quality of Life Measures will be collected via questionnaires</brief_summary>
