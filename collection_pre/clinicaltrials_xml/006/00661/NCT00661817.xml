	<brief_title>Evaluating a Blood Pressure Reduction and Weight Loss Program in a Low Income, Ethnically Diverse Population (The Be Fit, Be Well [BFBW] Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity is a serious health problem in the United States, particularly among lower income and racial and ethnic minority populations. These populations have a high risk of developing heart disease and high blood pressure, and obesity is likely a contributing factor for both conditions. African-Americans, in particular, experience an earlier onset of high blood pressure and suffer more severe health consequences as a result, than do other racial and ethnic groups. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a lifestyle modification program that will focus on reducing blood pressure levels and encouraging weight loss among patients at community health centers that serve a primarily low-income, ethnically diverse population. Researchers will also evaluate the cost effectiveness of the lifestyle modification program. This 2-year study will enroll people who have high blood pressure. Participants will attend a baseline study visit to complete health questionnaires. They will then be randomly assigned to either receive usual care along with printed materials about maintaining a healthy weight or take part in the lifestyle modification program that incorporates health information technologies. Participants assigned to the program will visit the BFBW study Web site several times a week to review educational and motivational information. They may receive automated weekly phone calls that will prompt them to answer questions and assist them in setting goals for losing weight and managing their blood pressure. A study researcher will call participants every 6 weeks to discuss any problems and to invite participants to take part in optional walking groups or other group activities. Participants will attend group support sessions every other month and will wear a pedometer to track their walking habits. For all participants, study visits will occur at baseline and Months 6, 12, 18, and 24. All visits will include weight and blood pressure measurements, health questionnaires, and physician referrals if needed.</detailed_description>
