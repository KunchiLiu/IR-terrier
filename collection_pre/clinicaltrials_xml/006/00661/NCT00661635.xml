	<brief_title>A Randomized, Double-Blind Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Valdecoxib Compared to Placebo for Treatment of Post- Cholecystectomy Surgery Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Valdecoxib</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients had required an elective, nonurgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, as an outpatient procedure, with ASA Class IIII, with a Baseline Pain Intensity of moderate or severe on a categorical scale and â‰¥45 mm on a VAS (100 mm) Patients were able to get their first dose of study medication within 8 hours after the end of surgery Patients could not undergo procedures expected to produce a greater degree of surgical trauma than the laparoscopic cholecystectomy alone, nor have acute preoperative pain (other than biliary colic) nor chronic pain conditions, nor uncontrolled chronic conditions, nor cancer, nor a laboratory abnormality that the investigator considered to contraindicate study participation Patient had any cognitive impairment that would, in the investigator's opinion, preclude study participation or compliance with protocol mandated procedures Patient had a history of known alcohol, analgesic, or narcotic substance abuse within the one year prior to Screening Patient had any laboratory abnormality at screening, that, in the opinion of the investigator, is not due to the condition requiring surgery and is not expected to resolve postsurgery, and would, therefore, contraindicate study participation</criteria>
