	<brief_title>A Study of Yoga for Treating Geriatric Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction: Geriatric insomnia is prevalent, reducing life quality, diminishing cognition and increasing risk of accidents and mortality. Treatment with sedative-hypnotic drugs has limited effectiveness and further increases the risk of accidents and falls. Yoga has been shown to increase well-being in the elderly. Hypotheses 1. Integrated yoga style practice can improve sleep quality/quantity 2. Integrated yoga style practice can improve quality of life. Objectives: 1. Examine effectiveness of yoga for insomnia and reduction in use of hypnotics/relaxants in the elderly; 2. Determine whether yoga enhances quality of life in the elderly; and 3. Determine whether yoga is suitable for elderly in western culture(s). Methods: A mixed design crossover controlled trial (n =74, age range 60-87, M = 74.4, SD = 7.1) with 2 weekly classes incorporating physical and meditative yoga, and daily home practice of meditative yoga for 12 weeks. Measures included self-reported assessment of sleep quality (Sleep Logs, KSS, ESS, PSQI, MAPS), mood states (DASS, POMS), general health (SF-36) and mobile objective home sleep studies.</detailed_description>
