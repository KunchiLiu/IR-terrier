	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, 2 doses of Cetuximab will have on head and neck cancer. The study is done because 250 mg/m2 given weekly does not work very well. Doses as high as 700 mg/m2 every other week appear to be no more toxic, so we will try to determine if 500 mg/m2 and 750 mg/m2 given every other week can work better. We do not know if it will help. We can use what we learn from this research study to help other people with the same disease.</brief_summary>
