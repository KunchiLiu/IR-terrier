	<brief_title>Use of Ranibizumab With Mitomycin C During Trabeculectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A common problem after undergoing trabeculectomy surgery to create a bleb (blister or bubble) to reduce intraocular pressure, is scarring of the opening. This scarring prevents fluid drainage and interferes with the proper functioning of the bleb. MMC (Mitomycin C) is usually administered intraoperatively, to reduce scarring and increase filtration. However, the failure rate of trabeculectomy remains high. Anti-VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor) agents have been used successfully in cases requiring bleb needling. The purpose of the study is to determine the safety of the combination of ranibizumab and MMC vs monotherapy MMC in patients with glaucoma. This is an open-label, Phase I/II safety study of 30 patients randomized to either treatment with ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreally injected (n=10), combination ranibizumab 0.5mg intravitreally injected and MMC (0.4 mg/ml for 2 min) in eyes after trabeculectomy (n=10) or MMC therapy alone (n=10). For the ranibizumab groups, a repeat injection of ranibizumab 0.5mg may be given PRN (as needed) at 1 month if hypervascularity or neovascularization of the conjunctiva exists.</detailed_description>
