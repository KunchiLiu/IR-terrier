	<brief_summary>Low habitual intake of low-dose dark chocolate (6 g/day) has been shown to have a beneficial effect on arterial blood pressure in one previous study. The trial will assess if ingestion of a higher but still moderate dose (25 g/day) over 3 months will have a more pronounced effect. The population will consist of cardiovascular high-risk patients only (who will potentially benefit most from blood-pressure lowering).</brief_summary>
