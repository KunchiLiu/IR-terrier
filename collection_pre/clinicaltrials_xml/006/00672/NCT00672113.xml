	<brief_summary>This study compares the effect of Adalat LA to Coracten on drug levels as well as changes in blood pressure and heart rate in fed hypertensive subjects. Subjects are dosed with either Adalat or Coracten for first 2 weeks, followed by the other drug for 2 weeks, and then switched back to the original drug for one day. Blood samples, blood pressure, and heart rate are taken before and after each treatment period.</brief_summary>
