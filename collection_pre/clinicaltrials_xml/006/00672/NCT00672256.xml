	<brief_summary>The broad objective of this proposal is to identify functional neuroanatomical correlates of impairments in response inhibition during smoking abstinence. We will measure changes in performance and regional blood oxygenation levels using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)while smokers complete tasks designed to assess decision making and response inhibition. Our primary hypothesis is that smoking abstinence will result in impaired response inhibition accompanied by decreases in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal in brain regions associated with these cognitive processes including frontal cortex and the ventral striatum. Abstinence may also result in performance-related increases in activation in brain regions associated with effortful processing including the anterior cingulate cortex in effort to compensate for deficits in other regions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will learn and practice a Go/No-Go reaction time task (Garavan, Hester, Murphy, Fassbender, &amp; Kelly, 2006) that measures inhibitory and excitatory aspects of behavioral control. During the task subjects are presented with an alternating series of Xs and Ys in the center of the screen and must press a button every time they see a Go trial (the letter 'Y' or the letter 'X') while inhibiting a response when they are presented with a No-Go trial (any interruption of the X Y alternating stream, e.g., X Y Y).</detailed_description>
