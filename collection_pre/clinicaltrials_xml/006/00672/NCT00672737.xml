	<brief_summary>We would like to test the effect of opioid medication on pain sensitivity in subjects who have been diagnosed with a sleep disorder called Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) compared to other subjects without OSA. Patients with OSA may have an altered sensitivity to the sedative, analgesic, and respiratory depressant effects of opioids.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Pain Processing in Subjects Suffering From Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that patients who suffer from moderate-to-severe OSA have increased pain thresholds and are more sensitive to the analgesic effects of opioids compared to patients with normal sleep-related breathing physiology. We will evaluate the effect of remifentanil, a short acting mu-opioid receptor agonist, on pain using an experimental heat and cold-induced pain tests, and compare it between volunteers with and without a polysomnography (PSG)-based diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.</detailed_description>
