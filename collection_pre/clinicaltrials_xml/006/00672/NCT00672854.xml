	<brief_summary>Many hospitalized patients who are malnourished or not eating receive intravenous feeding or total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Despite improving nutrition, TPN may increase the risk of infections and hospital complications. We do not know why TPN increases hospital complications, but it may be caused by the high sugar or fat content in TPN solutions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing a Soybean Oil-Based With an Olive Oil-Based Lipid Emulsion in Intensive Care Unit Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study compares the effect of a soybean oil-based versus an olive oil-based lipid emulsion in healthy volunteers and in critically ill patients. In healthy volunteers, your blood sugar levels, blood vessel function, and your ability to fight infections will be examined. In ICU patients, we examines whether use of the olive oil-based lipid emulsion may decrease the risk of infection and hospital complications.</detailed_description>
