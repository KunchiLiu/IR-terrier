	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at blood and tissue samples for changes following the use of Sunitinib malate. Additionally, we would like to find out if the drug, Sunitinib malate, is safe and works in men with prostate cancer. Sunitinib malate , also known as Sutent, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for treatment of tumors of intestines and kidney but it is being tested in research studies for use in men with prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Sunitinib Malate in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Prior to Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients will be treated with 50 mg once daily for four weeks followed by one to two weeks off treatment prior to undergoing radical prostatectomy. Patients with palpable disease (cT2-3) and patients with 3 or more positive prostatic biopsies from one lobe may undergo an additional study of IFP monitoring before treatment and during week 4 of study treatment. Safety and tolerability of Sunitinib malate therapy at this dose and schedule in this patient population will be assessed. Extensive correlative science evaluations, including assessment of physiologic, cellular, molecular and genetic changes during treatment with Sunitinib malate, will be performed</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic evidence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate deemed candidates for curative RRP Intermediate or high risk, clinically localized disease Adequate organ function Patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy Select imaging to rule out metastasis will be done as clinically indicated Signed and date informed consent document Prior treatment for prostate cancer Major surgery or radiation therapy within 4 weeks of starting the study treatment NCI CTCAE grade 3 hemorrhage within 4 weeks of starting therapy History of or known metastatic prostate cancer Any of the following within the 6 months prior to study drug administration: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism. Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE grade 2 or greater QTc interval &gt; 500 msec on baseline EKG Hypertension that cannot be controlled by medications (&gt;150/100 mm Hg despite optimal medical therapy). Preexisting thyroid abnormality with thyroid function that cannot be maintained in the normal range with medication Known active infection Concurrent treatment on another clinical trial. Supportive care trials or nontreatment trials, e.g. QOL, are allowed. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.</criteria>
