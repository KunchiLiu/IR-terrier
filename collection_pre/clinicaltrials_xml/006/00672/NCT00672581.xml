	<brief_summary>This study is designed to compare how ZD4054 (Zibotentan) is taken up, how it is broken down and removed from the body in subjects with liver cirrhosis and hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects of a similar age, sex and weight. As for all clinical trials, safety and tolerability of the drug will be evaluated as well to develop dosing recommendations for dosing of ZD4054 (Zibotentan) in subjects with varying stages of hepatic impairment.</brief_summary>
