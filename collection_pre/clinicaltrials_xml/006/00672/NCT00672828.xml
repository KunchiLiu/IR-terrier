	<brief_title>Interactive Computer Program or Brochure in Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening Among African Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare rates of participation in fecal occult blood testing and endoscopic screening (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) among African-Americans who receive an interactive computer intervention (ICI) versus a non-tailored colorectal cancer screening brochure. - Examine mediators and moderators of intervention effectiveness as depicted in the conceptual model. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Participants are stratified according to site, age (â‰¤ 65 years old vs &gt; 65 years old) and gender. Participants are randomized to one of two arms. - Arm I (non-tailored colorectal cancer screening brochure): Participants undergo a baseline interview via telephone and receive a colorectal cancer screening brochure in the clinic prior to visit with healthcare provider. Participants then undergo telephone interviews at 1 week, 6 months, and 15 months. - Arm II (interactive computer intervention [ICI]): Participants undergo a baseline interview via telephone and complete an ICI in the clinic prior to visit with healthcare provider. Participants then undergo telephone interviews at 1 week, 6 months, and 15 months.</detailed_description>
