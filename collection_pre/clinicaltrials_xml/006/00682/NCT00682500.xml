	<brief_summary>This study will determine if administration of an suspension of calfactant, a lung surfactant, intratracheally in patients with Direct Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome within 48 hours of requiring mechanical ventilation can decrease the mortality in patients with lethal disease and shorten the course of respiratory failure in patients with sub-lethal disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recruitment limited to direct adult respiratory distress syndrome patients who have been intubated &lt;48 hours.
