	<brief_summary>Prospective, longitudinal multi-center study performed in 15 participating substitution centers in Germany. Aims: - Primary objective: To compare the impact of the different substitution drugs (methadone, buprenorphine, and suboxone) on the neurocognitive, emotional, and quality-of-life-related tolerability in opioid dependent patients under HCV treatment. - Secondary objective: To investigate if IFN therapy impairs efficacy (with respect to e.g. retention rates, concomitant drug use and in particular neurocognitive function) and tolerability of agonist maintenance treatment with methadone, buprenorphine, or suboxone</brief_summary>
