	<brief_summary>The Phase I portion of this protocol will determine the best phase II dose and schedule of obatoclax with carboplatin and etoposide in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. The Phase II portion will evaluate the response rate to this regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study of Carboplatin and Etoposide With or Without Obatoclax in Extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the Phase I portion, both 3 hour and 24 hour infusions of obatoclax with carboplatin and etoposide every 3 weeks will be evaluated at different doses. In the Phase II portion, 3 hour infusions of obatoclax with or without carboplatin and etoposide every three weeks will be evaluated for response rates.</detailed_description>
