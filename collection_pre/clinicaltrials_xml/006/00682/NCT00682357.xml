	<brief_summary>Oral and nasal steroids may enhance osteoporosis by suppressing bone formation. Intra-articular steroids may also suppress bone formation, however, the duration or relationship to a steroid dose has not been established. It is hypothesized that intra-articular steroids suppress bone formation transiently, returning to pretreatment levels within four weeks in subjects with osteoarthritis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Intraarticular Steroids on Bone Turnover in Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral and nasal steroids may enhance osteoporosis by suppressing bone formation. Intra-articular steroids may also suppress bone formation, however, the duration or relationship to a steroid dose has not been established. It is hypothesized that intra-articular steroids suppress bone formation transiently, returning to pretreatment levels within four weeks in subjects with osteoarthritis. The purpose of the study is to determine if intra-articular steroids suppress markers of bone formation or resorption in osteoarthritis patients and whether these markers may be modified by Vitamin D or Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) bone density status</detailed_description>
