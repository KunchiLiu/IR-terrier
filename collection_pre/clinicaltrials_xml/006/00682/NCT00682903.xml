	<brief_summary>The objective of the project is to evaluate advantages from the use of a bearable continuous interstitial glucose monitoring device (GuardianR) during educative sessions of diabetic patients dedicated to functional insulin therapy teaching. This concept of intensified treatment is based on testing and explanation of simplified decision making algorithms to adapt insulin dose to every true life conditions. As self monitoring of capillary glucose level is needed to validate those algorithms, we postulate that using a device able to permanently control interstitial glucose readable by both medical team and patient himself (during the session and the 5 following days after discharge) could significantly improve safety and efficiency of such educative session.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of a Bearable Continuous Interstitial Glucose Monitoring Device (GuardianR) During Teaching Sessions to Functional Insulin Therapy Concept in Patients Suffering From Type 1 Diabetes: Evaluation at 6 and 12 Months</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two groups of 60 patients (experimental and control groups) will be followed and evaluated at 6 and 12 months. We do think that this new tool would facilitate education of patients and lead further to a better glycemic control.</detailed_description>
