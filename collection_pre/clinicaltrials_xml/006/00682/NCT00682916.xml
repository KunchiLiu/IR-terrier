	<brief_summary>Obesity and type 2 diabetes have clearly been linked together and identified as epidemics in much of the developed world. Historically several different dietary fibers have been used as means of reducing body weight and the related development of type 2 diabetes. These studies have generated mixed, if not inconsistent, results suggesting that none of these fibers promise a solution to either of these two conditions. We are proposing to investigate the effects of including a new soluble fiber, a-cyclodextrin, FBCx® (to be called Y288 in this study), into the diet of adult overweight volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compare Effects of a Soluble Fiber on Weight and Blood Cholesterol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall aim is to investigate the effectiveness of a soluble dietary fiber, FBCx®, on weight loss and/or weight management, and blood lipid levels in overweight humans.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>30 men and 30 women Age 18 65 years BMI 25.0 32.0 Kg/m² fasting glucose &lt;126 mg/dL Blood pressure &lt; 140/85 mm Hg. Hypertension on stable drug regimen using 2 or fewer antihypertensives will be acceptable. Total plasma cholesterol &lt;240 mg/dl, LDLcholesterol &lt;160 and triglycerides &lt;400 mg/dl. Hyperlipidemia on a stable medication regimen using single antihyperlipidemic drug acceptable.

Subjects with pacemakers will not participate in bioimpedance studies but will go through all the other testing.</criteria>
