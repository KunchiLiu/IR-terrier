Smoking status: a.Must have smoked 5 to 20 cigarettes per day for the previous 12 months. b.Must be motivated to quit smoking upon randomization into study.

Acceptable methods of contraception are hormonal birth control, intrauterine device, double barrier methods, vasectomized partner or abstinence. Oral health:Must have good oral health (in the opinion of the Investigator) with no clinically significant oral pathology at screening. General health:Must have good general health (in the opinion of the Investigator) with no clinically significant and relevant abnormalities of medical history on physical examination at screening. Compliance:Understands and is willing, able and likely to comply with all study procedures and restrictions. Consent:Demonstrates understanding of the study and willingness to participate as evidenced by voluntary written informed consent and has received a signed and dated copy of the informed consent form. Pregnancy:Women who are known to be pregnant or who are intending to become pregnant over the duration of the study. Females of childbearing potential will be required to undergo a urine pregnancy test which must be negative. Breastfeeding:Women who are breastfeeding. Nicotine use: a.Is unable/unwilling to stop using forms of tobacco. b.Is unable/unwilling to stop using other nicotine replacement therapy. Disease:Has a medical history, which in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact the validity of the study results, e.g. known history of heart disease, recent myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident (i.e. within 12 weeks prior to the first study session), unstable angina, severe cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes or peptic ulcer. Oral condition: a.Has history of oral surgery (including extractions) within four weeks, operative dental work within seven days, or a presence of any clinically significant oral pathology (as determined by the Investigator) including lesions, sores or inflammation which would interfere with assessments. b.Has fixed retainers, orthodontic appliances, or either maxillary and/or mandibular dentures or other appliances which may interfere with the placement or wearing of the product. c.Has current or recurrent disease that could affect the site of application, the action, absorption or disposition of the study treatment, or clinical assessment. d.Has severe gingivitis, periodontitis or rampant caries, as diagnosed by the investigator. e.Has the presence of oral or perioral ulceration including herpetic lesions at the time of baseline (subjects with these lesions may be reexamined at a subsequent appointment and may be able to be admitted at a later date if the ulceration or herpetic lesion heals). f.Has elective dentistry scheduled during the study duration. Allergy/Intolerance: a.Has a known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients. b.Presence of a genetic deficiency with an inability to metabolize aspartame or phenylalanine or has been diagnosed with phenylketonuria. Clinical Study/Experimental medication: a.Participation in another clinical study or receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit at the start of the study. b.Previous participation in this study. Substance abuse: a) Current or recent (within two year of screening) alcohol or other substance abuse. b) Positive alcohol breath screen. c) Positive urine drug screen for cannabinoids, amphetamine, cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine or morphine. Urine glucose:Positive glucose urine screen. Personnel: a.Is an employee of the sponsor or the study site. b.Is a member of the same household as another subject in this trial.</criteria>
