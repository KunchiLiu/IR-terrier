	<brief_title>Daclizumab Versus Thymoglobulin in Renal Transplant Recipients With High Immunological Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this randomized, multi-center trial is to directly compare the ATG, Thymoglobulin, with the anti-CD25 mAb, daclizumab, in a high-risk, HLA-sensitized renal transplant population, in order to elucidate whether there is any significant difference in the incidence of acute rejection after one year. Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either ATG (1.25 mg/kg/d from day 0 to day 7) or daclizumab (1 mg/kg at days 0, 14, 28, 42 and 56). Maintenance immunosuppression comprised tacrolimus, MMF and prednisone. The study's primary endpoint was the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection at one year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Third or fourth renal graft or 2. Current antiHLA antibodies above or equal to 30% at the last evaluation or 3. Peak antiHLA antibodies above or equal to 50% at the last evaluation or 4. A second graft if the first was lost within 2 years because of rejection. 5. Patients who gave their informed consent and are able to understand the scope of the study 1. Transplantation from living donors or recipients of multiple grafts or patients who already have received another (nonrenal) allograft. 2. Transplantation from a nonheart beating donor 3. Transplantation of two kidneys from the same donor 4. Patients with generalized infection at the time of transplantation 5.
