	<brief_summary>Malnutrition is a critical public health problem in developing countries. Malnutrition may be linked to more than one half of the deaths in children under 5 years old. In July 2001, after an intervention related to a measles epidemic, Medecins sans Frontieres-France opened a nutritional program in Maradi, in the South of Niger. The introduction of ready to use therapeutic foods (RUTF), in particular Plumpy'Nut (Nutriset, France) allowed for the treatment of the majority of children at their homes using ambulatory treatment. Children with complicated cases were cared for in an inpatient center. With ambulatory treatment the number of children cared for in the MSF program reached close to 70000 in 2006. This study aimed to assess the effect of a 3-month distribution of RUTF in the context of a preventative supplementary feeding program. The primary hypotheses were that short-term RUTF supplementation at the village-level would prevent declines in weight-for-height and reduce the incidence of wasting in children 6 to 60 mo of age over a period of 8 mo. Because RUTF may have additional health effects, the intervention effect on height-for-age, stunting, mortality and morbidity from malaria, diarrhea, and respiratory infection were also examined.</brief_summary>
