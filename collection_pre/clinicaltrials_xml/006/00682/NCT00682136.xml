	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to establish the efficacy of local anaesthetic TAP (transversus abdominis plane) blocks in providing pain relief in the first 24hrs following open or laparoscopic elective abdominal colorectal operations. TAP blocks involve the injection of local aesthetic (ropivicaine) into the transversus abdominis plane in the abdominal wall. This injection takes place after induction of anaesthesia, but before the commencement of surgery. TAP blocks have been proposed as a potential safer alternative to epidural anaesthesia. The blocks have been extensively used in the Hunter New England system over the last 18 months. As yet there is no clear evidence for there efficacy, hence the need for this trial. This trial would establish the efficacy of this practice. If the technique proves effective it could be widely used and provide a simpler method of managing post operative pain.</brief_summary>
