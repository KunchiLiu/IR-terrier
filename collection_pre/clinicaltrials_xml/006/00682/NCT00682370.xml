	<brief_summary>Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) serves as a protective gene. It has been shown that one factor modulating HO-1 activity is a genetic variation in the HO-1 gene (functional GT length polymorphism in the promotor region). Heme arginate is a strong inducer of HO-1 as shown in several animal experimental studies. The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the HO-1 stimulation of heme arginate in healthy humans.</brief_summary>
