	<brief_title>Peptide Vaccination in Treating Patients With Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We recently identified three HLA-A2402-restricted epitope peptides (TTK protein kinase (TTK), lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus K (LY6K), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II mRNA binding protein 3 (IMP-3)) derived from novel Cancer-Testis antigens (CTA) for the development of immunotherapies against esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and reported that the pre-existence of specific T cell responses to these epitope peptides were frequently seen in ESCC patients. Then, we performed Phase I vaccination trial using multi-epitopes involving TTK, LY6K, and IMP-3 peptides for locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who had failed for the standard therapy. Each of three HLA-A2402-restricted epitope peptides mixed with IFA were injected every week at five round. Primary endpoints were to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the therapy. Secondary endpoints were to investigate the immunological monitoring and clinical effect.</detailed_description>
