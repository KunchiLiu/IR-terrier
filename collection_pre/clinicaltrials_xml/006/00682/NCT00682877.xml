	<brief_title>A Comparison of SmartPill Capsule With Scintigraphy for Determining Gastric Residence Time - Over 65 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric emptying scintigraphy is considered the gold standard for evaluating gastric emptying and is widely available. Accurate characterization of gastric emptying may guide medical and surgical treatment choices. In addition, these techniques may allow for monitoring of therapeutic results for follow-up patient management. The SmartPill GI Monitoring System offers an alternative non-invasive method for characterizing disorders of the stomach. The system consists of an ingestible capsule that houses sensors for pH, temperature, and pressure, a receiver for receiving and storing signals from the capsule, and software for displaying data on a personal computer. The capsule samples at regular intervals and transmits the sensed pH, pressure, and temperature data to a portable receiver worn by the subject. After test completion, the recorded data is downloaded to a personal computer for subsequent evaluation. This trial is for subjects 65 years of age and older.</detailed_description>
