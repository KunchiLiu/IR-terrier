	<brief_summary>Classical imaging techniques are inaccurate to detect residual cholesteatoma. The aim of our study is to evaluate the value of diffusion-weighted MR imaging and delayed contrast enhanced T1 weighted spin-echo sequences in the detection of residual cholesteatoma in children, in a large serie of surgically verified cases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging in the Post Operative Follow-up of Cholesteatoma in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Classical imaging techniques are inaccurate to detect residual cholesteatoma. Thin-section CT detects that the postoperative cavity is filled with a soft tissue mass. Classical MR imaging (T2 and T1 weighted spin-echo sequences) can not provide additionnal information about the nature of this filling : cholesteatoma, granulation or fibrous tissue.</detailed_description>
