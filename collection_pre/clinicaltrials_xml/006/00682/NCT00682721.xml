	<brief_summary>We will be examining the effects of suppressive valacyclovir therapy on the stability of vaginal flora in women who are seropositive for HSV-2. We have preliminary data that suggests the presence of HSV-2 increases the risk for Group B Streptococcus colonization as well as many other deleterious organisms (e.g. Streptococcus pseudoporcinus), in addition to increasing the risk for acquisition of BV-associated vaginal flora. We will be examining the effects of suppressive therapy on the vaginal flora of any HSV-2 seropositive woman.</brief_summary>
