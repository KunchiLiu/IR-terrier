	<brief_title>Impact of Anti-Giardia and Antihelmintic Treatment on Infant Growth in Bangladesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomised double-blind controlled intervention of 36 weeks duration was conducted in a rural community located 40kms north-west of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. Infants aged between 3 and 11 months were randomly assigned to either receiving anti-Giardia and antihelmintic treatment, or anti-Giardia treatment only, or a control group receiving placebos. Weight and supine length were recorded every 4 weeks. Every 12 weeks intestinal permeability (L/M ratio), haemoglobin, plasma albumin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, immunoglobulin G and Giardia intestinalis specific IgM titre (GSIgM) and eggs of the three common geohelminths and Giardia intestinalis cysts were determined.</detailed_description>
