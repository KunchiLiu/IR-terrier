	<criteria>Ongoing treatment for malignancy by at the University of Chicago with any agent with recognized, specific inhibition of VEGF, VEGFreceptors, or downstream signaling molecules with the specific intention of inhibiting signaling of this pathway. These agents include but are not limited to: bevacizumab (Avastin™), sorafenib (Nexavar™), sunitinib (Sutent™), axitinib (AG013736), and AZD 2171. Treatment of hypertension with at least 2 or more antihypertensive medications with blood pressure remaining greater than 140/90 mmHg. Stable management of other toxicities from the cancer treatments Expected to continue current cancer treatments for at least 4 weeks 18 years and older Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document prior to any study specific procedures. Concurrent use of hematopoietic supportive treatment with erythropoietin or congeners. Current uncontrolled toxicities due to the cancer treatments. Patients having known contraindications to hydralazine or minoxidil therapy. Any readings of systolic blood pressure &gt;200 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;120 mmHg in the four (4) weeks prior to screening. Use of either minoxidil or hydralazine in the six (6) months prior to screening.</criteria>
