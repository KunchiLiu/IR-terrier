	<brief_summary>We will determine the metabolic response to a Low Biologically Available Glucose Diet (LoBAG30) in subjects currently receiving the maximum dose of metformin as monotherapy in whom the glycohemoglobin is not at an acceptable level (&gt;8.0%). Our hypothesis is that introduction of a LoBAG30 diet to subjects currently treated with a full therapeutic dose of metformin will improve blood glucose control in people who have not achieved an acceptable total glycohemoglobin on metformin alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LoBAG30 Diet in Patients on Metformin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will ingest a control diet (55% carbohydrate (CHO), 15% protein, 30% fat) or a LoBAG30 diet (30% CHO, 30% protein, 40% fat) in a parallel design with block randomization in pairs of two. Subjects will return to the study center twice each week while on the diets to have blood glucose, glycohemoglobin, lactate, weight and blood pressure measured, and to have urine assayed for urea and creatinine. At the beginning and end of the 5 week study period, the subjects will be admitted to the study center for 28 hours during which time blood will be drawn for 24 hour profiles of glucose, insulin, other hormones and several metabolites. For those subjects randomized to the LoBAG30 arm of the study, the control diet will be given during the first 24 hour study period; the assigned diet will be given at the end of the 5 week period.</detailed_description>

	<mesh_term>Metformin</mesh_term>
	<criteria>People with type 2 diabetes mellitus who currently are receiving the maximal dose of metformin monotherapy (2500 mg/day). These subjects will have had a stable glycohemoglobin (tGHb) in an unacceptably high range (811%) for at least 4 months prior to beginning the study. Subjects with tGHB &gt; 11% (HbA1c &gt; 10%) will not be recruited into the study. Hematological abnormalities liver disease kidney disease macroalbuminuria (&gt;300 mg albumin/24 hours) untreated thyroid disease congestive heart failure angina lifethreatening malignancies proliferative retinopathy severe diabetic neuropathy peripheral vascular disease serious psychological disorders a body mass index &gt; 35 and a fasting triglyceride of &gt;400 mg/dl. Subjects taking slowrelease metformin will not be studied. Subjects taking medications other than metformin, known to affect fuel metabolism such as: insulin the sulfonylureas glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP1) analogs and metabolic inhibitors pramlintide prednisone and similar steroids thyroid hormone antipsychotic medications thiazide diuretics medroxyprogesterone high dose aspirin, also will be excluded. If concentrations of serum folate, B12 or iron are low, the subject will be excluded from the study until corrected, i.e. until normal concentrations are recorded.</criteria>
