	<brief_summary>Substudy and continuation of HEMI-SAB-UUS (NCT00491673) Study on radiostereometric measurements of acetabular wear in bipolar hemiarthroplasties and measurements of periprosthetic bone mineral density in cemented and uncemented hemiarthroplasties in patients with femoral neck fractures. Null hypothesis: No difference in acetabular wear or in bone mineral density changes between cemented and uncemented hemiarthroplasties</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiostereometric Analysis of Acetabular Wear and Periprosthetic Bone Mineral Density Changes in Hemiarthroplasties</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomised to treatment with cemented or uncemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty. 1mm tantalum markers are inserted in the pelvis during surgery. RSA X-rays and DEXA measurements conducted postoperatively, after 3 and 12 months. Follow-up visits and clinical examination at 3 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
