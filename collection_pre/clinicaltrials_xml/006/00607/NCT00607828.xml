	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic radiation therapy in treating patients with advanced liver cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the safety of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Secondary - To determine the maximum tolerated dose of SRT in these patients. - To determine the objective tumor response rate in terms of the percentage of tumor size change on CT, percentage of intensity change on MRI, and the percentage of change in alfa fetoprotein in patients treated with this therapy. - To determine the value of 4-dimensional CT in liver cancer planning in terms of the extent of liver motion (three dimensionally) and the percentage of patients requiring breath gating due to the amplitude of organ motion exceeding 1 cm in any dimension. - To determine the value of breath gating in liver cancer SRT in terms of the success rate of breath gating and the percentage of treatment time prolongation secondary to the gating. OUTLINE: Patients undergo hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 and 3 months.</detailed_description>
