	<brief_summary>Elevations of plasma cortisol, a stress hormone, during prior episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) appear to be responsible for the deficient responses during subsequent hypoglycemia. Our specific aim is to determine if dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a hormone with anti-corticosteroid actions, can prevent hypoglycemia associated autonomic failure in type 1 diabetic volunteers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DHEA is the acronym for dehydroepiandrosterone, a steroid hormone produced naturally from cholesterol in the adrenal glands of males and females. It is also sold as an over-the-counter dietary supplement, and seems to have anticorticosteroid effects. DHEA antagonizes the effects of corticosterone on hippocampal function in rats and reduces responses to neural stress in mice. In our lab we have found that administration of the DHEA to rats during antecedent hypoglycemia, preserves counter-regulatory responses to subsequent hypoglycemia. The purpose of this study is to determine if the same response occurs in humans.</detailed_description>
