	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to determine mechanisms leading to glutathione deficiency in low birth weight newborn babies. Compared to full term neonates, depletion in this population may be due to a decreased synthesis rate or to an enhanced utilization or a combination of both mechanisms.The protocol is constituted of two steps. The objective of the first step is to quantify the blood concentration of glutathione in the artery and the vein of umbilical cord in full term newborn babies. Objectives of the second step are to determine if the glutathione synthesis rate, measured in vitro, is lower in erythrocytes collected from umbilical cord blood of low weight newborn babies compared to full term newborn babies. In this case, the next objective will be to determine if the adjunction of an excess of cysteine in vitro can restore the glutathione synthesis rate in these cells.</brief_summary>
