	<brief_title>Safety of Ibritumomab Tiuxetan (Zevalin®) in Combination With a Fludarabine-based Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC) Regimen (ZEVALLO 2007)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The benefit of Zevalin® in the setting of autologous stem cell transplantation has been largely reported. The addition of Zevalin® to a fludarabine-based Reduced Intensity Conditioning regimen has been already evaluated in the setting of allo-SCT and the results reported so far seem to be promising without an overwhelming toxicity neither a delayed hematologic recovery. The assumption that the addition of Zevalin® to the conditioning regimen might improve lymphoma control and the demonstration that nucleoside analogs such as fludarabine synergize optimally with RIT led us to conduct this trial using the following preparative regimen: rituximab 250 mg/m² on days -21 and -14, Zevalin® 0,4 mCi/Kg body weight on day -14, fludarabine 30 mg/m² intravenously from days -6 to -2, Busulfan orally (4 mg/Kg body weight) or intravenously (0,8 mg/Kg body weight) on days -5 and -4 and ATG (Thymoglobulin®) 2,5 mg/Kg body weight intravenously on day -1. Cyclosporine A is administered at 2 or 3 mg/Kg body weight from day -1 to day 28 than followed by a dose reduction. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zevalin® in a Reduced Intensity Conditioning regimen followed by allogenic stem cell support in patients with aggressive lymphomas who are responsive to a salvage chemotherapy regimen Patients are followed from the beginning of the RIC regimen until day 365 for primary and secondary objectives of the study than on a regular basis depending on the practice of each centre. The evaluation includes physical examination (performance status, hematologic assessment, acute and chronic GVH disease), biologic tests (blood screening for blood count, renal and hepatic function, B and T-cell recovery, chimerism analysis, response assessment) and complementary examinations (marrow biopsies, tomography scan, positron emission tomography, …).</detailed_description>
