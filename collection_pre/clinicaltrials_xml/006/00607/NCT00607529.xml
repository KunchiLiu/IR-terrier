	<brief_summary>This study is being done to see if the Nova Creatinine Meter can give a correct measure of creatinine (a blood test used to measure kidney function) when the blood is taken from a capillary (smallest type of blood vessels). The Nova Creatinine Meter is a hand held device that can be used in a clinic to measure creatinine in about 50 seconds. Current laboratory creatinine testing can take up to an hour. Since chemotherapy patients need to have their creatinine measured prior to treatment, this meter could make testing easier and faster.</brief_summary>
