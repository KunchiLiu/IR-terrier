	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, capecitabine, and gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. External-beam radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Panitumumab may also stop the growth of pancreatic cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor and make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving panitumumab together with chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving panitumumab together with chemotherapy and external-beam radiation therapy works in treating patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Panitumumab, Chemotherapy, and External-Beam Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer That Cannot be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the 1-year survival rate in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer treated with panitumumab and continuous infusion fluorouracil administered concurrently with external-beam radiotherapy followed by gemcitabine and panitumumab. Secondary - To determine overall survival, time to disease progression, confirmed response rate, duration of response, and time to treatment failure in patients treated with this regimen. - To determine adverse events in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: - Panitumumab and chemoradiotherapy : Patients undergo external-beam radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-38. Patients also receive panitumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 15, and 29 and fluorouracil IV continuously over 24 hours daily OR oral capecitabine twice daily beginning on day 1 and continuing through the last day of radiotherapy. - Panitumumab and chemotherapy: Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of panitumumab and chemoradiotherapy, patients receive panitumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses. Patients then proceed to maintenance therapy. - Maintenance therapy: Patients receive panitumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
