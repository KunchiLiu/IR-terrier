	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new instrument that shines light and takes digital pictures of skin. The goal is to develop a technique that may enable fast and accurate detection of skin disorders and cancers for future clinical diagnosis and surgical use.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients undergoing shavebiopsy on an anatomical site that is readily accessible to the VivaScope 1500 (for example, chest, back, legs, arms, cheek, forehead). The additional 110 patients for this amendment will be imaged with the newly developed Vivascope 3000 handheld confocal microscope. Ability to sign informed consent. Age â‰¥ 18 years. Shavebiopsy located on a site that is not amenable to confocal imaging (for example, adjacent to the nose, ears or eyes, fingers, toes). Inability to give informed consent. Known hypersensitivity to adhesive rings. Inability to tolerate imaging procedure (i. e., remain relatively still for multiple short durations of 34 minutes).</criteria>
