	<brief_title>Human Milk Fortifier and Cytokine Profile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In very low birth weight (VLBW) infants and preterm infants human milk fortifier (HMF) is often added to breast milk feedings in order to add extra calories, vitamins, and minerals. It is well known that breast milk feedings are easier to digest and have immune benefits compared to formula feedings. Cytokines, marker of immune function, can be found in blood, stool, and breast milk. This study involves collection of blood and stool samples to monitor cytokines. The purpose of this study is to understand whether human milk fortifier alters infants' cytokines.</detailed_description>
