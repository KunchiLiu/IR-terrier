	<brief_summary>We are interested in whether bunionectomy can be used as a model to study the treatment of acute pain. It has been used to study the effect of Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory (NSAIDS) medications (such as ibuprofen) and other pain relieving drugs. We are interested to know if this model is useful to study other drugs for the treatment of acute pain. The other drugs being tested in this study are pregabalin and naproxen sodium. These drugs are approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This study is designed to test whether these two drugs are effective in treating pain after a bunionectomy.</brief_summary>
