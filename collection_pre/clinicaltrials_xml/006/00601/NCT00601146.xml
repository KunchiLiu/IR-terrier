	<brief_summary>This research study is being done because patients with a history of chest radiation treatment for Hodgkin's disease have been shown to be at increased risk for developing lung cancer a number of years out from treatment. The risk appears to be further increased among patients with a smoking history. Currently, the practice is to recommend annual low-dose chest CT scans in survivors of Hodgkin's disease who have received prior chest radiation treatment and who have at least a moderate smoking history. In this study, the CT scans will be read and interpreted by the study radiologist, and the results recorded in a consistent manner.</brief_summary>
