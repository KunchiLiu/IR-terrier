	<brief_title>Hypertonic Saline for Outpatient Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Santiago, Chile, a near collapse of health services is a notorious feature of every winter when vast numbers of small children line for attention because of respiratory distress caused by a probable RSV infection. Our study will examine if nebulized salbutamol diluted in hypertonic (3%), instead of normal (0.9%) saline, provides better relief in outpatients. If hypertonic saline proves safe and effective, the patients could be better managed and the pressure for attention diminished at a low cost, by a simple change in the saline ampule.</detailed_description>
