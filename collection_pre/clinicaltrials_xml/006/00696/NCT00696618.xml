	<brief_summary>This study is looking at 3 different types of enemas used before receptive anal intercourse in men who have sex with men (MSM). We are investigating whether the enemas cause any damage to the lining of the colon, how far up the colon the enemas travel after they are given, and how much study participants like using each of the enemas.</brief_summary>
