	<brief_summary>In this study, we will conduct a preliminary, yet comprehensive evaluation of Mindfulness and Yoga, as compared to an exercise and education-based stress-reduction program. and simultaneous evaluation of the effect of an 8 week program of Mindfulness, 12 weeks of Yoga practice, and 12 weeks of an exercise and education-based program. 105 otherwise healthy individuals, who have cardiovascular risk factors and mild to moderate stress or anxiety will be randomly assigned to one of the three intervention groups: an 8 week program of Mindfulness, 12 week program of Yoga practice, and 12 week exercise and education-based group program. All subjects will perform daily practice that will continue after the weekly sessions end, allowing a follow up assessment at 24 weeks. Self-reported mood and psychological distress and physiological indicators of function of the ANS and stress hormones will be assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Blood and urine samples will be collected at baseline and 8 weeks to determine levels inflammatory and atherosclerosis markers. We anticipate that the study will provide information on the efficacy of the Mindfulness and Yoga interventions as stress-reduction practices, variability in potential markers for activation of the brain/cardiovascular system connections, and preliminary estimates of effect size for each of these markers. Thus, the study will provide the data needed for designing a future study that will rigorously address these questions in a larger, randomized trial of Mindfulness and Yoga in patients with cardiovascular risk.</brief_summary>
