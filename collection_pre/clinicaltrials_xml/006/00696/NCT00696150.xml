	<brief_summary>Studies have suggested a link with effective pain relief and reduced illness and death in very unwell patients. This study will determine the most effective method of injecting local anaesthetic around the nerves which supply the hip joint. Local anaesthetic will be injected around the hips nerve supply using either ultrasound, loss of resistance or electrical nerve stimulator to guide the positioning of the needle on patients due for elective total hip replacement. The patient will then be observed for 30 minutes and the patient ability to move or feel the upper leg will recorded. A standard anaesthetic and a hip replacement operation will then be performed. Standard pain relief protocols will be used the operation and after the operation. After the operation we will record the amount of morphine used and how happy the patients have been with their treatment at 6 hours after the operation and at 24 hours after the operation. The first day the patient is able to walk on their new hip replacement will also be recorded.</brief_summary>
