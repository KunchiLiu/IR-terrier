	<brief_summary>This phase II study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bevacizumab treatment in conjunction with PDT at the low fluence rate compared with bevacizumab alone or combined with PDT at the standard fluence rate, in patients with all types of choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD. Hypothesis: bevacizumab in combination with PDT (low and standard fluence rate) will i) delay time to retreatment, ii) reduce the average number of treatments required compared to bevacizumab alone and iii) at low PDT fluence rate will improve long-term safety profile.</brief_summary>
