	<brief_summary>Delayed emesis following administration of carboplatin-based chemotherapy despite prophylaxis with standard antiemetic prophylaxis (5-HT3 and corticosteroid) remains a clinically significant and distressing problem for patients with cancer. The incidence of delayed emesis appears to be higher in women compared to men.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study of Delayed Nausea and Vomiting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients will be given the Functional Living Index- Emesis (FLIE), a standardized questionnaire. This is a self-administered questionnaire to assess the impact of nausea and vomiting on the patient's functional living, including physical activities, social and emotional function, and ability to enjoy food and drink. Patients will complete the questionnaire during the 5 days following carboplatin administration (at 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours and 96 hours) during their first and third cycles of chemotherapy. The questionnaire should take approximately 10 minutes or less to complete. Patients will also be interviewed by a trained CRA or research nurse over the telephone 24-48 hours following carboplatin administration in order to assess the severity of the delayed nausea and vomiting.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have newly diagnosed, histologically or cytologically proven cancer, and be scheduled to receive chemotherapy with carboplatin at AUC 5 or above. Patients should receive standard antiemetic prophylaxis prior to carboplatin administration, defined as 5HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone. We will include only patients whose standard care includes treatment with a carboplatincontaining regimen and who are not being treated with aprepitant (EmendÂ®). Age &gt;= 18. After being informed of the treatment involved, patients must give written consent. Entry to this study is open to both men and women and to all racial and ethnic subgroups. No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy within the last 5 years. Should not be pregnant.</criteria>
