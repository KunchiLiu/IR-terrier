	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Azilsartan Medoxomil in Participants With Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension affects approximately 50 million individuals in the United States. As the population ages, the prevalence of hypertension will continue to increase if broad and effective preventive measures are not implemented. According to the World Health Organization, hypertension is the most common attributable cause of preventable death in developed nations, as uncontrolled hypertension greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and renal failure. Despite the availability of antihypertensive treatments, hypertension remains inadequately controlled; only about one-third of patients continue to maintain control successfully. TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil) is an angiotensin II receptor blocker and this study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral azilsartan medoxomil compared to placebo and olmesartan in subjects with essential hypertension. Individuals who want to participate in this study will be required to provide written informed consent. Study participation is anticipated to be about 11 weeks. Multiple procedures will occur at each visit which may include fasting, blood collection, urine collection, vital signs including sitting blood pressure and pulse, body height and weight, physical examinations and electrocardiograms. Outside of the study center, participants will be required to wear an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device at 24 hour intervals.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Has essential hypertension (defined as sitting trough clinic systolic blood pressure between 150 and 180 mm Hg, inclusive at Day minus 1) and 24hour mean systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 130 mm Hg and less than or equal to 170 mm Hg at Day 1). 2. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active must agree to use adequate contraception, and can neither be pregnant nor lactating from Screening throughout the duration of the study. 3. Clinical laboratory evaluations (including clinical chemistry, hematology, and complete urinalysis) within the reference range for the testing laboratory or the results are deemed not clinically significant for inclusion into this study by the investigator. 4. The subject is willing to discontinue current antihypertensive medications at the Screening Day minus 21 visit. If the subject is on amlodipine prior to screening, the subject is willing to discontinue this medication at Screening Day minus 28. Exclusion Criteria 1. Sitting trough clinic diastolic blood pressure greater than 114 mm Hg at Day minus 1. 2. Baseline 24hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor reading of insufficient quality. 3. History of myocardial infarction, heart failure, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention, hypertensive encephalopathy, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischemic attack. 4. Clinically significant cardiac conduction defects (eg, third degree atrioventricular block, left bundle branch block, sick sinus syndrome, atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter). 5. Hemodynamically significant left ventricular outflow obstruction due to aortic valvular disease. 6. Secondary hypertension of any etiology. 7. Is noncompliant (less than 70% or greater than 130%) with study medication during Placebo RunIn Period. 8. Severe renal dysfunction or disease (based on calculated creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) at Screening. 9. Known or suspected unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis. 10. History of drug abuse (defined as illicit drug use) or a history of alcohol abuse (defined as regular or daily consumption of more than 2 alcoholic drinks per day) within the past 2 years. 11. History of cancer that has not been in remission for at least 5 years prior to the first dose of study drug. (This criterion does not apply to those subjects with basal cell or stage I squamous cell carcinoma of the skin). 12. Type 1 or poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (glycosylated hemoglobin greater than 8.0%) at Screening. 13. Alanine aminotransferase level greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal, active liver disease, or jaundice at Screening. 14. Hyperkalemia (defined as serum potassium greater than the upper limit of normal per the central laboratory) at Screening. 15. Upper arm circumference less than 24 cm or greater than 42 cm. 16. Works night (3rd) shift (defined as 11 PM to 7 AM). 17. Currently participating in another investigational study or has participated in an investigational study within 30 days prior to Screening. 18. Any other serious disease or condition at Screening (or Randomization) that would compromise subject safety, might affect life expectancy, or make it difficult to successfully manage and follow the subject according to the protocol. 19. Randomized in a previous azilsartan medoxomil study.</criteria>
