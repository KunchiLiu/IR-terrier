	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect data while monitoring muscles and nerves during spine surgery. The data being collected and analyzed will be used to learn more about how the body's nerves and muscles are distributed and develop a map of human muscle innervation patterns.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Direct Stimulation Of Spinal Nerve Roots To Determine Sensory And Motor Innervation Patterns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this large scale study it is proposed to examine root-to-muscle innervation directly, using the standard Intra-Operative Monitoring procedures during scheduled cervical and lumbar spinal surgeries. The study would directly map muscle and sensory distributions of nerve root innervations with no additional risk to patients.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients undergoing either cervical or lumbar cord procedures at Lahey Clinic and during which the surgeon has requested intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring. Surgery performed by a neurosurgeon Participant must be ≥ 18 years of age or ≤ 85 years of age Participant, or legally authorized representative, has been informed of the nature of the study and has provided written informed consent, approved by the Lahey Clinic IRB Past medical history significant for any of the following: Peripheral Neuropathy Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Neuromuscular disease that would interfere with intraoperative recordings The Investigator determines that the patient should not be included in the study for reason(s) not already specified</criteria>
