	<brief_summary>To investigate the efficacy and safety of a single injection of 150 Î¼g Corifollitropin Alfa (Organon 36286) to induce multifollicular development for controlled ovarian stimulation using daily recombinant FSH (recFSH) as a reference. The primary hypothesis is that a single injection of Corifollitropin Alfa is non-inferior to daily treatment with recFSH in initiating multifollicular growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of a Single Injection of Corifollitropin Alfa (Organon 36286) for Ovarian Stimulation Using Daily Recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) as Reference (P05787)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority clinical trial investigating the efficacy and safety of a new treatment regimen with Corifollitropin Alfa, a recombinant gonadotropin applied to initiate and sustain follicular stimulation in controlled ovarian stimulation for Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). For this regimen, participants receive a single injection of Corifollitropin Alfa and one week later, treatment is continued with daily recFSH up to the day of triggering final oocyte maturation. In the reference group participants receive daily injections of recFSH up to the day of triggering final oocyte maturation. Non-inferiority in ongoing pregnancy rates (assessed at least 10 weeks after embryo transfer) will be the primary endpoint for this trial. The number of oocytes retrieved will be analyzed as co-primary endpoint.</detailed_description>
