	<brief_title>MnSOD (Esophageal Protectant) to Prevent Esophagitis During Radiation/Chemotherapy Treatment for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I-II study evaluating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of swallowed MnSOD plasmid/liposome (PL) transgene given as protection against radiation-induced esophagitis during concurrent paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy with thoracic radiation in subjects with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Phase I of the study will assess the feasibility and safety of MnSOD PL by dose escalation in 3 cohorts of 3 chemoradiotherapy subjects each (Cohort1 = 0.3 mg/dose, Cohort2 = 3 mg/dose, Cohort3 = 30 mg/dose). The highest dose completed (as determined by toxicity monitoring for 8 weeks from initial treatment) will be the starting dose for Phase II. Phase II will examine the efficacy of MnSOD PL by assessing the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 esophagitis in 27 additional chemoradiotherapy subjects. Incidence of esophageal toxicity, as well as clinical response to the combination of chemoradiotherapy with MnSOD PL are the outcomes of interest.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically documented NSCLC including squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma (including bronchoalveolar cell), and large cell anaplastic carcinoma (including giant and clear cell carcinomas) and poorly differentiated nonsmall cell lung cancer. Totally resected tumors are excluded. Subjects must be without evidence of M0. Subjects with T1 or T2 disease with N2 or tumor stage 3, lymph node metastasis 12 ( stage 1) disease (Stage IIIA) are eligible if they are medically inoperable. Subjects with T4 with any N or any T with N3 disease are eligible. Radiographic evidence of mediastinal lymph nodes &gt;2.0 cm in the largest diameter is sufficient to stage N2 or N3 disease. If the largest mediastinal node is &lt; 2.0 cm in diameter and this is the basis for stage III disease, then at least one of the nodes must be proven positive cytologically or histologically. Subjects with tumors adjacent to a vertebral body are eligible as long as all gross disease can be encompassed in the radiation boost field. The boost volume must be limited to &lt; 50% of the ipsilateral lung volume. Subjects with a pleural effusion that is a transudate, cytologically negative and nonbloody are eligible if the radiation oncologists feel the tumor can still be encompassed within a reasonable field of radiotherapy. Exudative, bloody, or cytologically malignant effusions are ineligible. If a pleural effusion can be seen on the chest CT but not on chest Xray and is too small to tap, the subject will be eligible. Subjects must be deemed a suitable candidate for protocol treatment by both Radiation Oncology and Medical Oncology Subjects must have a Performance Status &gt; 70 (Karnofsky Performance Scale). Subjects Weight loss &lt; 10% in 3 months prior to diagnosis. Subjects must be male or female &gt; 18 years. Subjects must have had no prior systemic chemotherapy, radiation therapy to the thorax, or total surgical resection. At least 3 weeks since formal exploratory thoracotomy and the subject has recovered from surgery, or 1 week from diagnostic thoracoscopy. Laboratory values must be as follows: (See Section 6.1 of the full protocol for required timing): Granulocytes &gt; 2,000/ml, Platelets &gt; 100,000/ml, Hemoglobin* &gt; 8 mg/dl, Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x normal, Creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/n (24 hour or calculated, forced expiratory volume at one second &gt; 800 cc. Note: *Physician can maintain a subject's hemoglobin with the use of Erythropoetin or transfusions prophylactic use of GCSF (colony stimulating factor, is not permitted). Subjects must have a MRI or CT brain scan within 4 weeks prior to study entry to rule out asymptomatic brain metastases. Subjects must be informed of the investigational nature of the study and sign an informed consent form and have no serious medical or psychiatric illnesses that would prevent informed consent. No history of serious cardiac disease that is not adequately controlled. Female subjects must be nonpregnant and nonlactating. Female subjects of childbearing potential must implement an effective method of contraception during the study. All women of childbearing potential must have a prestudy negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study entry.
