	<brief_summary>Study Objective:To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Vascular Sealant compared with Gelfoam/Thrombin when used to seal bleeding anastomotic suture lines in patients undergoing vascular reconstructive surgery requiring placement of a PTFE graft (including extra-anatomic, infrainguinal bypass and arteriovenous (AV) access procedures). Study Design: The study is a multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial that will compare two methods for treating anastomotic leakage (bleeding). All subjects (n =151) will be randomized at a 3:1 ratio to receive either the investigational treatment (Vascular Sealant) or the control treatment (Gelfoam/Thrombin). Up to two (2) treatment sites may be evaluated for each subject. Subjects will be stratified by type of graft procedure: AV access graft or extra-anatomic and infra-inguinal graft. A minimum of 60 patients, and a maximum of 91 patients, will be enrolled in each stratum. Treatment randomization will be blocked by center and type of graft procedure (e.g., bypass or AV grafts). All subjects will undergo preoperative screening to determine eligibility and will be evaluated intraoperatively, at discharge or within 7 days of surgery, and 30 days post-procedure to monitor for hematologic disturbances, hemorrhagic events, wound complications and other potential acute post-operative adverse events. Up to ten (10) investigational sites will participate in the study. Enrollment is expected to take approximately 8 months for an anticipated duration of the clinical investigation of approximately 9 to 10 months. The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Vascular Sealant to Gelfoam/Thrombin when used to seal anastomotic suture lines in patients undergoing placement of PTFE vascular grafts (including extra-anatomic, infrainguinal bypass and arteriovenous access procedures).</brief_summary>
