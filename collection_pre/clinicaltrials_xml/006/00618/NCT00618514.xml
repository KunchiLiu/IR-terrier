	<brief_summary>This trial was designed as a prospective, multi-center, randomized clinical trial of the FDA-cleared Vari-Lase Bright Tip Fiber compared to commercially available standard bare-tip laser fiber (control) to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of laser ablation for the treatment of varicose veins associated with reflux within the great saphenous vein (GSV) and to provide additional data concerning patient satisfaction. Within this evaluation, subject limbs were randomized to one of two (2) treatment groups utilizing a 1:1 randomization ratio. If a subject required treatment of only one limb, that limb was randomized to a treatment group. If a subject required treatment of two limbs, the first limb was randomly assigned treatment and the second limb was assigned the other treatment (the opposite treatment of the other limb). The data was analyzed by treated limb (versus treated subject).All study data were analyzed under the principles of intent-to-treat, in which data are analyzed according to the assigned randomized group regardless of the treatment actually delivered. Subjects were followed at one week, one month, and six months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial was designed as a prospective, multi-center, randomized clinical trial of the FDA-cleared Vari-Lase Bright Tip Fiber compared to commercially available standard bare-tip laser fiber (control) to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of laser ablation for the treatment of varicose veins associated with reflux within the great saphenous vein (GSV) and to provide additional data concerning patient satisfaction. Subjects were pre-screened utilizing standard of care data (including documented evidence of reflux within the GSV) for the specified inclusion/exclusion criteria to ensure that they were eligible for treatment in the investigation. Prior to laser treatment and after signing an informed consent form, study eligibility assessments were completed including physical assessment of target limb(s), duplex ultrasound of GSV segment(s) targeted for treatment, symptom assessment, medical history, and digital photos of targeted limbs. Upon enrollment, targeted limbs were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive the Vari-lase Bright Tip Fiber or the control treatment. If the subject required treatment of two limbs, the first limb was randomized and the second limb was assigned the other treatment (the opposite treatment of the other limb). Immediately post procedure, subjects were assessed for adverse events and a physical assessment of the treated limb(s) was performed. Subjects were also asked to complete a subject pain and satisfaction questionnaire. Subjects were followed at one week, one month, and six months. Follow-up included a physical assessment of treated limb(s), symptom assessment, adverse event assessment, and completion of a subject pain and satisfaction questionnaire. Additionally, a duplex ultrasound assessment was conducted at one week and six months and digital photos were taken of the treated vein segment(s) at one week and one month. The data was analyzed by treated limb (versus treated subject). All study data were analyzed under the principles of intent-to-treat, in which data are analyzed according to the assigned randomized group regardless of the treatment actually delivered.</detailed_description>
