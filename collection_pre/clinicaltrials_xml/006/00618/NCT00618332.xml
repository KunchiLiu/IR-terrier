	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that those patients with purely seasonal allergic rhinitis will decongest better than those subjects with another cause contributing to their symptoms. These latter patients will not improve as well on an intranasal steroid as those who decongest well, potentially explaining the 60% response rate in prior studies.</brief_summary>
