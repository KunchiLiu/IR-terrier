	<brief_summary>To show that the use of intravenous levetiracetam(LEV;Keppra)for seizure prevention in patients in the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit will result in fewer side effects compared to the current standard of care anticonvulsant and will be at least as effective as the current standard of care in preventing clinical and sub-clinical seizure activity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To show that the use of intravenous levetiracetam(LEV;Keppra)for seizure prophylaxis in the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit will result in fewer adverse effects compared to the current standard of care anticonvulsant(phenytoin) and will be at least as effective as phenytoin in preventing clinical and sub-clinical seizure activity.</detailed_description>
