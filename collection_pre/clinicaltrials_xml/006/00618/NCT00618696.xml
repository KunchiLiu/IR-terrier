	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Radioactive monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody, can find cancer cells and either kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of a yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody and how much radiation is taken in by the organs in the body in treating patients with advanced leukemia or other hematologic disorder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Yttrium Y 90 Anti-CD45 Monoclonal Antibody AHN-12 in Treating Patients With Advanced Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To establish that a dose of 150 mg/m² of nonradiolabeled anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody AHN-12 results in normal biodistribution, normal-organ estimated radiation-absorbed dose of less than 20 Gy, and estimated radiation-absorbed dose of no more than 13 Gy to the red marrow. Secondary - To determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody AHN-12 (^90Y-AHN-12). - To determine the human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response. - To define, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of ^90Y-AHN-12. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody AHN-12 (^90Y-AHN-12). - Biodistribution: Patients receive nonradiolabeled monoclonal antibody AHN-12 IV and an imaging dose of indium Y 111 monoclonal antibody AHN-12 (^111In-AHN-12) IV over 10 minutes on day 0. Patients undergo whole-body gamma-camera imaging immediately following infusion, at 4-6 hours, and on days 1, 3, 4, and 7. Blood samples are collected prior to each imaging for dosimetry calculations and pharmacokinetics. Patients also undergo bone marrow biopsy 16-24 hours after infusion for dosimetry calculations. Patients with the expected biodistribution of ^111In-AHN-12, an estimated radiation-absorbed dose to the normal organ of &lt; 20 Gy, an estimated radiation-absorbed dose to the red marrow of ≤ 13 Gy, and a negative human anti-mouse antibody at day 7 proceed to the therapy portion. - Treatment: Patients receive nonradiolabeled anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody AHN-12 IV over 60 minutes and escalating therapy doses of yttrium Y 90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody AHN-12 (^90Y-AHN-12) IV over 10 minutes on day 7 or 8. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.</detailed_description>
