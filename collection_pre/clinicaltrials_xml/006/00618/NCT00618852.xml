	<brief_title>Using Furosemide to Prevent Fluid Overload During Red Blood Cell Transfusion in Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Red cell transfusion is a very common practice in neonates, particularly in preterm infants. It has been estimated that approximately 300,000 neonates undergo transfusions annually. The decision to administer a blood transfusion to a sick anemic neonate is made after consideration of multiple clinical factors, including: poor weight gain, oxygenation failure, and recurrent apnea and bradycardia. These decisions are also influenced by physician preferences. For many years, furosemide has been used routinely by physicians during and after blood transfusions in neonates and other age groups. The rationale behind this common practice is to reduce the vascular overload that may be imposed by the additional blood volume delivered during transfusion. This belief, however, lacks the support of scientific clinical evaluation.</detailed_description>
