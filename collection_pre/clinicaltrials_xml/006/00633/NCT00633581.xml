	<brief_title>Efficacy of Vitamin C Injection on Fatigue in Workers After Work</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies dealing with vitamin C were focusing on terminal cancer patients or those with chronic fatigue syndrome. Since used drug dosage and the ways of administering vitamin C were not identical, the results were not consistent throughout those studies. This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy of high dose vitamin C with parenteral supplement on relieving fatigue for apparently healthy volunteers.</detailed_description>
