	<brief_summary>Current therapy recommendations suggest a low protein diet to preserve residual renal function (RRF) before the start of dialysis, but a higher protein intake during dialysis to prevent protein-energy wasting (PEW). We conducted a randomized trial to test whether low protein intake also during treatment with peritoneal dialysis (PD) would be safe and associated with a preserved RRF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Protein-Restricted Diet on Nitrogen Balance and Residual Renal Function in Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dietary protein is the major source of nitrogen excreted as urea by the kidney, and a decreased protein intake has been associated with a retardation of kidney function loss in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. While a low protein diet is recommended to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients before the start of dialysis to preserve residual renal function(RRF), current therapy recommendations in dialysis are for a normal protein intake of no less than 1.2 g of protein/kg ideal body weight (IBW)/day to prevent protein-energy wasting (PEW). We hypothesized that a lower protein intake would be safe and able to slow the loss of RRF also in dialysis patients and conducted two prospective, randomized trials involving a total of 94 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients to test our hypothesis.</detailed_description>
