	<brief_summary>The simplicity of use and intuitive function of the McGrath video-laryngoscope suggests it may have a bigger role than as a back-up to conventional direct laryngoscopy and could possibly be the first-line laryngoscope for situations where difficult intubations are more likely or more hazardous. The incidence of difficult or failed intubation for an individual anaesthetist is related to their experience, decreasing as experience increases. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the McGrath laryngoscope when used by relatively inexperienced anaesthetists, who are those most likely to encounter difficulties. The null hypotheses to be tested is that there is no difference between the Macintosh and McGrath laryngoscope in terms of ease and success in intubation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomised Controlled Trial of Intubation With the McGrath Series 5 Video Laryngoscope vs the Macintosh Laryngoscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Adults (18 years and over) scheduled for elective surgery whose anaesthetic plan would normally include oral intubation using a Macintosh laryngoscope blade after induction of general anaesthesia and who have given valid informed consent. Patients requiring special techniques for intubation such as rapid sequence induction Adults who have learning difficulties Are unconscious or very severely ill Have a terminal illness; are in an emergency situation Have a mental illness Have dementia Prisoners Those who could be considered to have a particularly dependent relationship with the investigator and other vulnerable groups.</criteria>
