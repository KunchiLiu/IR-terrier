	<brief_title>Treatment Trial for Post-Thrombotic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post thrombotic syndrome (PTS) has a spectrum of disease manifestations ranging from minor skin discoloration to severe skin changes and venous ulcerations. Pain is often a prominent symptoms and PTS impairs patient quality of life. Prevention of PTS using compression stockings has been emphasized. There is a paucity of validated, effective treatments for PTS once the condition develops. While the pathophysiology of PTS is incompletely understood, chronic venous hypertension and insufficiency may increase the workload of the lymphatic system and result in over-capacitance with secondary damage and eventual lymphatic insufficiency. In selected patients with PTS, we have noted a symptomatic improvement in patients who receive lymphedema therapy to the limb. Complex lymphedema therapy (CLT) is a noninvasive treatment that includes four key components: meticulous skin care, manual lymph drainage, compression therapy, exercises and patient education for home management and continuation of the treatment. These techniques are designed to enhance lymph flow through intact cutaneous lymphatics and reduce swelling and restore function in the affected limb.</detailed_description>
