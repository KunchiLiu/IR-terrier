	<brief_summary>Apatinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), so it can inhibit tumor angiogenesis. This phase I study aims to determine the drug's toxicity and to find a dose level to be used in a phase II study in solid tumor patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Apatinib as an Inhibitor of Tumor Angiogenesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Apatinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at VEGFR (vasoendothelial growth factor receptor) to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. The anti-angiogenesis effect of apatinib has been viewed in preclinical tests (see protocol). This phase I clinical study is going to evaluate its toxicity and to find an appropriate dose level to be used in a phase II study in heavily treated solid tumor patients.</detailed_description>
