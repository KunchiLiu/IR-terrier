	<brief_title>Peptide Vaccine Focusing on Prevention of the Recurrence for Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DEP domain containing 1(DEPDC1) and M phase phosphoprotein 1(MPHOSPH1) have been identified using genome-wide expression profile analysis by the use of cDNA microarray in our previous studies. The investigators have determined the HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides derived from DEPDC1, DEPDC1-9-294, and MPHOSPH1, MPHOSPH1-9-278. These epitopes showed strong IFN-g production when stimulated with the appropriate targets expressed the appropriate protein and HLA-A*2402. Furthermore, when vaccinated these peptides, specific CTLs were determined after the vaccination. Therefore we focused on the prevention of the recurrence of the bladder cancer after surgery using these peptides.</detailed_description>
