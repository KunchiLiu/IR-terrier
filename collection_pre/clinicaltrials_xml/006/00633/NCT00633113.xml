	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the clinical, radiographic (x-ray) and cost effectiveness outcomes (cost relative to risks and benefits) of two different minimally invasive knee joint replacement surgical techniques. The primary study hypothesis is that in comparing total knee replacement performed with the two different surgical techniques that respect four minimally invasive surgery principles (low-profile instrumentation, "minimally invasive" incision, overall minimal knee surgical intervention), a faster return to function will result when the technique does not incise the tendon.</brief_summary>
