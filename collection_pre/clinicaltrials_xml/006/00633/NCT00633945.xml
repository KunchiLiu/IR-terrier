	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of lenalidomide (Revlimid®) in subjects with Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE). The study drug will be used in an off-label indication to treat 6 subjects for 12 months each. Men and women over the age of 18, who have a biopsy proven diagnosis of CLE and who have failed standard treatment, will be included in the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Lenalidomide (REVLIMID®) to Treat Subjects With Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a chronic and often disabling disease which affects the skin. Many patients experience scarring and inflammation of the skin, which often occur on the face. Moderate to severe CLE is most frequently treated with antimalarial drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, quinacrine or chloroquine. Up to 70% of CLE patients treated with antimalarials experience a beneficial clinical response, while the remainder of patients show no response or continue to experience progression of the disease. Thalidomide has been used successfully in such patients, with up to 75% clinical response rate in refractory CLE patients. However, thalidomide is a known teratogen and can cause severe birth defects, including short, malformed limbs and damage to peripheral nerves in the extremities, requiring patients to be monitored for pregnancy. In addition, up to 25% of patients on thalidomide develop peripheral neuropathy. A new drug, lenalidomide (REVLIMID®), an analogue of thalidomide, has been developed to treat neoplastic and inflammatory conditions, including various oncologic conditions such as multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome and solid tumors. Unlike thalidomide, lenalidomide (REVLIMID®) is not known to cause the extent of serious side effects caused by thalidomide; however, it must also be monitored for side effects and be distributed under the RevAssist program authorized by the drug manufacturer, Celgene Corporation. The primary goal of this investigator-initiated, small pilot study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of lenalidomide (REVLIMID®) in CLE subjects using measurements such as the CLASI (Cutaneous Lupus Activity and Severity Index). The study drug will be used in an off-label indication to treat 6 subjects, for whom lenalidomide (REVLIMID®) will be provided at no cost by the drug manufacturer. Men and women over the age of 18, who have a biopsy proven diagnosis of refractory CLE and who have failed standard treatment with hydroxychloroquine for up to three months, will be included in the study. Secondarily, the study will evaluate the biologic effects of lenalidomide on pathogenic and immunologic mechanisms of the CLE disease process during the treatment period by collecting skin specimens (biopsies) and blood samples.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must understand and voluntarily sign Informed Consent and HIPAA forms. Males and females over the age of 18 at the time of signing informed consent form. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements Subjects must have biopsy proven Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE) either in the form of Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE) or Subacute Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE), with or without systemic involvement. Subjects must have grade II erythema in at least three skin locations as defined by the Cutaneous Lupus Activity and Severity Index (CLASI). Subjects must have failed standard treatment with hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) for up to three months. Female subjects who are not pregnant. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 14 days prior to and again within 24 hours of starting lenalidomide and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before starting to take lenalidomide (Revlimid®). FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Males must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy. All subjects must be counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure. If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test is noted in a study subject or in the partner of a male study subject during study participation, the study drug must be discontinued immediately. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form. Female subjects who are pregnant, plan to be pregnant during the study, or who are breastfeeding. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk for study participation, or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days of baseline. Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide. The development of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while taking thalidomide or similar drugs. Prior history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Prior history of pulmonary embolus (PE). Known positive for HIV viral DNA by qPCR. Positive hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C. Platelet count &lt; 50,000/mcL. Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 750/mcL Lymphopenia &lt; 500/mcL. Have current signs or symptoms of severe progressive or uncontrolled renal disease (creatinine ≥1.5 x ULN). If female, unwillingness to use one highly effective method and one additional method of birth control. If male, unwillingness to use a latex condom during intercourse with females of childbearing potential. Continued therapy with thalidomide.</criteria>
