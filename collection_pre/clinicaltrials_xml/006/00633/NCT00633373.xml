	<brief_summary>Currently there are no approved therapies for lung transplant recipients in the United States (US). Treatment with CIS following lung transplantation has previously been demonstrated to result in a clinically meaningful improvement in survival and chronic rejection-free survival compared to placebo, but additional data supporting its use is needed prior to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. This treatment use protocol is a mechanism for providing eligible lung transplant recipients early access to CIS in advance of FDA approval.</brief_summary>
