	<criteria>Inclusion: Patients must satisfy all the following inclusion criteria in order to be eligible for the study: 1. Signed written informed consent 2. AJCC stage 3 or 4 histologically proven NSCLC not amenable to curative therapy and for whom erlotinib and bevacizumab therapy would be appropriate 3. Radiological assessment within 21 days prior to inclusion, if measurable disease is present 4. Age ≥ 18 years 5. ECOG performance status 0 or 1 6. Patient has received at least one standard platinumcontaining chemotherapy regimen appropriate for his/her lung cancer, in the opinion of the investigator, prior to enrollment. Exclusion: Patients with any of the following will be excluded from participation in the study: Disease 1. Squamous cell carcinoma, except for patients with no intrathoracic disease or small peripheral lesions only. 2. Known central nervous system (CNS) metastases (Note: patients with brain metastases which have been controlled for ≥ 4 months without the use of steroid are eligible). Prior Treatments 3.

Serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 x ULN and creatinine clearance (by CockcroftGault formula) &lt;60 mL/min Serum bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN Proteinuria: UPC ≥ 1.0 or ≥ 2+ proteinuria by urine dipstick, unless a 24hour urine demonstrates &lt;1.0 g/24 hours ALT or AST ≥ 2.5 x ULN (≥ 5 x ULN if liver metastases) Alkaline phosphatase ≥ 2.5 x ULN Albumin ≤ 2.5 g/L Women of child bearing potential: positive pregnancy test (serum). Other Conditions or Procedures 12. Any clinically significant adverse events from any prior chemotherapy, surgery or radiotherapy which has not yet resolved to CTCAE v3.0 grade ≤ 1 13. Known hypersensitivity to any oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), EGFRinhibitor or bevacizumab 14. Serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer or bone fracture 15. Patients with a history or current neoplasm other than the entry diagnosis, except for curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix and except for other cancers treated for cure and with a diseasefree survival greater than 5 years. 16. Pregnant or breastfeeding women 17. Men or women of childbearing potential who refuse or who are unable to use an acceptable means of contraception 18. History of clinically significant hemoptysis within 3 months prior to registration unless definitively treated with surgery or radiation 19.

(Note: testing for HIV infection of HBsAg is not part of the screening assessments performed by the central laboratory). 20. Preexisting autoimmune or antibodymediated diseases, including, but not limited to, the following: systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome and autoimmune thrombocytopenia 21. Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or other serious or acute internal bleeding within 6 months prior to registration 22. CNS bleeding; history or clinical evidence of CNS stroke (hemorrhagic or thrombotic) within the last 6 months 23. History of allogeneic organ transplant 24. Brain biopsy within 12 weeks of first study dosing 25.
