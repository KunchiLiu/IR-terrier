	<brief_summary>This is a multi-site collaborative study that will be done in the context of three Quebec hospitals' outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programs: Montreal Chest Institute; University of Laval, and Hopital Sacre-Coeur Montreal. The objectives are two-fold. First, to determine the Minimal Clinical Important Difference in intensity ratings of perceived breathlessness for each of the 3-min constant rate shuttle walking (3-MWT) and stair stepping (3-MST) protocols in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Second, to test the hypothesis that both the 3-MWT and 3-MST protocols are able to detect statistically significant and clinically-meaningful improvements in exertional breathlessness following an 7-12 week outpatient rehabilitative exercise training program in COPD.</brief_summary>
