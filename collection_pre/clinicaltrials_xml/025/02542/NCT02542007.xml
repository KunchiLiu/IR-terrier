	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of the Combo Bio-engineered Sirolimus-eluting Stent Versus the Nano Polymer-free Sirolimus-eluting Stent in the Treatment of Patients With de Novo Stenotic Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial which plans to enroll 436 subjects. All subjects enrolled will be randomly assigned to the test group (n=218) and the control group (n=218). Subjects in the test group and the control group will receive Combo stents and Nano stents respectively.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with clinical evidence of asymptomatic or symptomatic ischemic heart disease, stable or unstable angina, old myocardial infarction; De novo lesions of native coronary arteries (lesions number ≤2); Target lesion located in one or two different vessels. The number of target lesions in one vessel shall be no more than one; Target vessel diameter between 2.5 and 4.0 mm by visual estimation. Target lesion length ≤ 32mm by visual estimation, which can be covered by one Combo stent with length 38mm or one Nano stent with length 36mm. It is suggested that the selected stent size should cover at least 2 mm (by visual estimation) of normal tissue on each side of the lesion; Target lesion diameter stenosis ≥ 70% by visual estimation; Each target lesion is permitted to implant only one stent at most, except bailout stent; Patients is eligible for PCI and is an acceptable candidate for CABG; Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥40%; Patients who can understand the nature of the study, agree to participate and accept angiographic and clinical followup, and have provided written informed consent; Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within one week; Chronic total occlusion lesion (TIMI 0 flow), Left main disease, Ostial lesion, and/or triplevessel lesion that might require treatment, bifurcation lesions with a side branch diameter &gt;2.5mm or graft lesions; Heavily calcified or tortuous lesions which cannot be successfully predilated, and lesions which are not suitable for stent delivery and deployment; Instent restenosis; Thrombotic lesion; Patients who had received any other stent in the past six months; Patients with acute or chronic renal dysfunction (defined as creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dl); Patients with cardiogenic shock, acute infection, known bleeding or coagulation disorder, or with a history of active gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcer, cerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage and stroke within 6 months; Patients who are allergic to aspirin, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, ticlopidine, heparin, contrast agent, sirolimus, stainless steel , polymer, or with contraindication to aspirin or clopidogrel or ticagrelor; Patients who had previously received murine therapeutic antibodies and exhibited sensitization through the production of HAMA; Patients with a life expectancy less than 1year; Patients who had participated in another investigational drug or device trial that has not completed the primary endpoint; Patient who has received any organ transplant or is on a waiting list for any organ transplant; Patient is in the opinion of the investigator, unable to comply with the requirements of the study protocol</criteria>
