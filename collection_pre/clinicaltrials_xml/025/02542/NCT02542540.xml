	<brief_summary>Children with osteogenesis imperfecta are described as extremely sedentary and therefore fatigable, which strongly impacts their daily activities. The physical rehabilitation of these children is a fundamental aspect of treatment. It has been shown that playing Wii console causes the same increase in energy expenditure than practicing moderate exercise, while ensuring user safety. This type of physical exercise with this type of fun game console might have a role in the treatment of OI children on the physical side but also on the psychological side.</brief_summary>
