	<detailed_description>The management and treatment of adult diabetes is far from optimal. The most recent report from the National Diabetes Audit showed that only one in three people with diabetes are achieving recommended standards for controlling blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol levels; and only three in five received basic care processes to reduce their risk of diabetes-related complications such as blindness, amputation and kidney disease. Women did 15% worse than men, which may explain some of the reported higher excess risk of coronary heart disease and stroke, consequent to diabetes in women than men. More efficient and equitable care in people with diabetes could lead to substantial cost savings, and would improve the lives of women and men currently living with diabetes. The objective of this research isto evaluate the risk of cardiovascular events associated with medication use for controlling blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol levels in men and women with diabetes treated in primary care.</detailed_description>
