	<criteria>Recentlydiagnosed (within the last 6 months), histologicallydocumented, nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and/or oropharynx amenable to radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy as the definitive treatment modality. Clinical treatment plan calls for a minimum of 50 Gy cumulative radiation dose administered via continuous course of external beam irradiation to the oral cavity and/or oropharynx via intensitymodulated radiation therapy [IMRT] and/or imageguided radiation therapy [IGRT], combined with conventional or weekly/triweekly cisplatin or carboplatin chemotherapy regimen. Subject has received prior radiation to the head and neck region (+/ chemotherapy). Subject has had any other prior invasive malignancy, unless diseasefree for a minimum of 3 years. Subject has metastatic disease (M1) Stage IVC. Subject has a presence of mucosal ulceration or oral mucositis at screening or develops this prior to randomization, and/or has unhealed wounds remaining from surgical resection and/or excisional biopsy procedure. Subject is using a preexisting feeding tube for nutritional support at study entry.</criteria>
