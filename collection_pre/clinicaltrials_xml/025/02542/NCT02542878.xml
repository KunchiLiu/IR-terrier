	<brief_title>Effect of Myofascial Release by Foam Rolling on Back Muscles Endurance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Self-myofascial release performed with a foam roller is an incoming technique what is very popular in sport. Scientific literature currently suggests that the effects of self-myofascial release are mediated by the stimulation over neural and connective tissue. There is evidence that this stimulation could improve the maximum range of motion and decrease muscle soreness. Nonetheless, there is few evidence about the effects of self-myofascial release on muscle endurance. Given the increased use of autonomously (self-treatment) in the athlete population, this study aims to assess the effect of a low back short application (60 seconds) on the back extensor muscles endurance measured by the Biering-Sorensen test. With the obtained results we want to elaborate an evideced based recommendation about its use prior to physical activity or sports competition.</detailed_description>
