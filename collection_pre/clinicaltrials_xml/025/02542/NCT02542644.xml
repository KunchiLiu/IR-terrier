	<brief_summary>Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a progressive disease characterized by the loss of endothelial cells, thickening of Descemet's membrane and deposition of extracellular matrix in the form of guttae. This result in failure of the endothelium to support corneal deturgescence leading to corneal edema. Affected patients complain about blurred vision at early stages of the disease which can progress to blindness. The pathophysiology of the disease is still unclear, but several studies point towards a genetic susceptibility. Additional risk factors that have been identified are female sex, smoking and older age. While for a long time penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) was the only therapy available for affected patients, in the recent years less invasive methods such as descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) have been developed. In DMEK, only the Descemet's membrane and the endothelium is removed and replaced with the corresponding parts from a donor's cornea. For FECD, this brings the advantage that only the diseased part of the cornea is replaced. Graft detachment has been identified as the main complication following DMEK. In the investigators' study, an ultra high resolution OCT system will be used to detect graft detachment in patients with FECD after DMEK. With this technique, even small detachments can be visualized. The area of graft detachment will be evaluated at predefined time points after surgery and correlated to visual acuity. A follow-up of one year will be performed in order to investigate the predictive value of graft adherence status at several time points for visual outcome.</brief_summary>
