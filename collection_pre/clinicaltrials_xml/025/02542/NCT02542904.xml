	<brief_summary>Crohn's patients receiving ileocolonic resection are randomized into extensive mesenteric resection group and local mesenteric resection group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extensive Mesenteric Excision (EME) Versus Local Mesenteric Excision (LME) for Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomization was performed intraoperatively once the surgeon had determined that there were no other sites of disease and that either type of anastomosis could be performed safely. Computer generated randomization was carried out within strata using randomized permuted blocks to ensure balance of the groups. All surgery was performed by a single group of surgeons experienced in the surgical treatment of Crohn's disease. Surgery was performed open or laparoscopically depending on patient factors and surgeon preference. The resection was performed grossly normal resection margins, with side-to-side anastomosis. The presence of mesenteric marginal thickening with confirmation by naked eye assessment of the mucosal aspect of the bowel were used to establish the limits of the disease.</detailed_description>
