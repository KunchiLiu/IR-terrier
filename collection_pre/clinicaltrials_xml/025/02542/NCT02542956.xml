	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify the best pain management for patients undergoing abdominoplasty after massive weight loss or transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap for breast reconstruction. The investigator is conducting this study to compare the effectiveness of a continuous infusion pain pump versus a locally injectable long-acting anesthesia (DepoFoam bupivacaine) versus standard injectable anesthesia (bupivacaine) for post surgical pain control. These drugs and devices are approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for the purpose of pain control after surgery, and have been used for this purpose before.</brief_summary>
