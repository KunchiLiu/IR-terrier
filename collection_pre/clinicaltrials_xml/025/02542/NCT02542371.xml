	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure arterial 99mTc-Tilmanocept uptake using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) scanning in HIV infected subjects known to have subclinical coronary atherosclerosis as assessed by contrast-enhanced coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of 99mTc Tilmanocept for Imaging Arterial Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description: Patients with HIV have been shown to have increased atherosclerotic risk compared to age-matched controls, and this risk is thought to be related to increased systemic immune activation. Specifically, systemic immune activation may contribute to destabilizing coronary atherosclerotic plaque, leading to plaque rupture and myocardial infarction. This study is intended to measure arterial uptake of the macrophage specific marker 99mTc-Tilmanocept using single photon emission computed tomography, applied initially to a group of HIV-infected patients with known subclinical coronary atherosclerosis on CCTA. Moreover, traditional markers of CVD risk and inflammatory markers will be assessed in relation to CV imaging outcomes. Positive findings in the index HIV group with known subclinical atherosclerosis will prompt subsequent study of three comparison groups, as above.</detailed_description>
