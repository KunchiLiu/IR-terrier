	<brief_title>Endocan Predictive Value in Postcardiac Surgery Acute Respiratory Failure.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endocan is an endothelium derived soluble dermatan sulfate proteoglycan. Literature data shows that alterate levels of its blood concentration correlate with the onset of pulmonary failure in patients with major trauma and septic shock. In cardiac surgery respiratory failure and infections are threatening complications leading to mortality rates up to 80%. A rapid diagnosis and treatment of this pathology is crucial to improve the clinical outcome. Unfortunately specific data for the efficacy of Endocan predictive value in cardiac surgery patients are not available. The investigators aim to determinate if Endocan can be a helpful tool to identify patients developing acute respiratory failure after cardiac surgery and anticipate specific treatment in order to improve survival.</detailed_description>
