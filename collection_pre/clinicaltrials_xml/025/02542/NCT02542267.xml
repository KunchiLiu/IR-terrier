	<criteria>Patient has a previously implanted (&gt; 30 days) noncovered stent(s) located in the SFA Patient has lifestyle limiting claudication, resting leg pain or minor tissue loss (Rutherford Category 2 5) Patient demonstrates an Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) &lt;=0.9. If ABI &gt;0.9 or not measurable, patient is eligible for study if Toe Brachial Index is &lt;=0.5 Patient has &gt;=50% instent restenosis and / or an occlusion in a previously implanted (&gt;30 days) noncovered stent(s) located in the superficial femoral artery defined as beginning at least 1cm below the origin of the profunda femoris artery and ending at least 1cm above the intercondylar notch. Patient has a maximum total lesion length of 270mm, consisting of instent and adjacent occlusive disease Patient has a reference vessel diameter between 4.0 and 6.5mm Patient has at least one patent infrapopliteal runoff vessel (&lt;50% stenosis) not requiring reintervention Note: Additional Inclusion Criteria may apply Patient has a known allergy to stent graft components (nickeltitanium or expandedpolytetrafluoroethylene) Patient has a known intolerance to anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy Patient has known coagulation disorder, including hypercoagulability. Patient has major distal amputation (above the transmetatarsal) Patient has any previous surgery in the target vessel Patient has had previous target vessel instent restenosis treated by relining with another stent Patient has untreated flowlimiting aortoiliac stenotic disease Note: Additional Exclusion Criteria may apply</criteria>
