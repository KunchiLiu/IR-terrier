	<detailed_description>Background: Depression is a common mental disorder with a negative impact on mental well-being, quality of life, and social and work-related functioning both in the short and longer term. Additionally, depression is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, health care utilization and health care costs. On a population level, depression is one of the most costly diseases. The economic costs of depression were estimated at â‚¬136.3 billion (EU25) in 2010 in the EU and are still rising. European health care systems face the challenge of improving access to cost-effective treatments while simultaneously working to sustain budgetary stability in times of economic austerity. Internet-based depression treatment appears a very promising alternative to current routine depression treatment strategies. Meta-analyses have demonstrated the clinical effectiveness and potential cost-effectiveness of Internet-based treatment for depression in controlled research setting. Internet-based treatment thus has the potential to keep depression treatment affordable, as it enables mental health care providers to reach out to large populations needing depression treatment at a better cost-effectiveness than those of standard treatment as usual (TAU), but with similar levels of clinical efficacy and quality of care. The trials will be conducted in 8 European countries. Objective: To compare the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of blended Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) with treatments as usual (TAU)-face to face CBT in expert centres specialized in depression. Study design: The study is a two-arm randomized controlled non-inferiority and cost-effectiveness trial. The trial will be conducted in expert centres in France. A total of 150 patients with MDD will be assigned to one of two treatment arms: 1) blended CBT, 2) TAU. Respondents in both arms will be followed until 12 months after baseline (measures will be taken at baseline, 3 months, post- treatment (17 weeks), 6 months and 12 months).</detailed_description>
