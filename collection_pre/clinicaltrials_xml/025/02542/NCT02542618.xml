	<brief_summary>Background: Major depression is a common mental disorder with serious consequences. The societal costs of depression are high. Despite the existence of empirically-supported psychological therapies, many patients do not benefit from these treatments and relapse and recurrence percentages are high. Improvement of existing treatments or development of new and better treatments is badly needed. Inquiry Based Stress Reduction (IBSR) is a promising verbal therapy focusing on the inquiry of thoughts and could be a next step in improving psychotherapy for depression. Objective: The objective of the current study is to assess the effectiveness of IBSR. Research to date has shown that IBSR is effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. The investigators want to know if IBSR is more effective in reducing symptoms of depression than the best psychotherapeutic treatment for depression at this moment, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The investigators' secondary objective is to know more about the underlying mechanisms of change of these therapies. Study design: A randomized controlled intervention study. Study population: 88 patients with a mild to moderate depression as their principal diagnosis. Intervention: IBSR or CBT</brief_summary>
