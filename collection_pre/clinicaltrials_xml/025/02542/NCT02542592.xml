	<brief_summary>The study evaluates the pathophysiological effects of a single dose Methylprednisolone administered prior to total hip-arthroplasty (THA) surgery. The investigators examine the effect on immune signaling and recovery after surgery. Half of participants will receive intravenous Solu-Medrol 125 mg, while the other half will receive placebo. The investigators hypothesize that the group receiving Methylprednisolone will experience a positive modulation of the immune response and an enhanced recovery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Methylprednisolone on Immune Signaling in Hip-arthroplasty Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are well known. The beneficial effects on postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting are well-documented. Hip-arthroplasty surgery and the inflammatory stress response in general affect the potential of recovery. The basic physiological mechanisms behind restoration of recovery after surgery are still unresolved. The many different immune cells involved in the complex signal response enables wound healing and recovery, and the individual immune signal pattern might be able to predict recovery. The effects of glucocorticoids on this immune signal pattern is unknown and calls for further investigation. The study is to be considered as exploratory. This study is embedded in a primary study registrated as: NCT02445898 For further details please view the EudraCT registration: EudraCT nr.: 2015-000102-19</detailed_description>
