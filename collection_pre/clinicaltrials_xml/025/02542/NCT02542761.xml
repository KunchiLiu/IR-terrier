	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the functional performance of individuals with transtibial amputation using two types of prosthetic foot designs: carbon fiber vs. fiberglass composite.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recently, a new type of prosthetic foot has appeared on the market. This device is composed of a fiberglass composite material. Knowledge is lacking regarding the performance characteristics of this new device. Comprehensive studies are needed to form a solid basis for prosthetic prescription. The current study seeks to understand the experience of community-living, transtibial amputees using this prosthetic foot. Specifically, the biomechanical performance of this device will be compared to existing conventional DER technology in a controlled laboratory setting. The investigators hypothesize that the fiberglass composite material will provide more energy return and improved ankle kinematics performance.</detailed_description>
