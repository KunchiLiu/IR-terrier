	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, global, Phase III study to determine the efficacy and safety of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy versus platinum-based SoC chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) wild-type advanced or metastatic NSCLC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of 1st Line Therapy Study of Durvalumab With Tremelimumab Versus SoC in Non Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (NEPTUNE).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 to receive treatment with durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or SoC therapy. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of combination treatment compared with SoC in terms of Overall Survival (OS) in patients.</detailed_description>
