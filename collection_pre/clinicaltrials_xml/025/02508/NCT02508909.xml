	<brief_summary>Groin lymph node dissection for melanoma patients is burdened by high post-operative morbidity, mainly related to wound. This is a prospective pilot trial investigated feasibility and postoperative outcomes of videoscopic ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy in patients with inguinal lymph node melanoma metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Videoscopic Ilioinguinal Lymphadenectomy for Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Videoscopic ilioinguinal dissection is a two-stage procedure. Dissection is performed using an ultrasound dissector. The inguinal step is performed via three ports (one 3-5 cm above the apex of the femoral triangle, a second 5 cm medial to the adductors, and the third 5 cm lateral to the Sartorius muscle). After subcutaneous inflation, a formal inguinal lymph node (LN) dissection is performed, removing the contents of the femoral triangle, with incision and removal of the femoral fascia and proximal and distal ligation of the saphenous vein with vascular endostaplers and endoclips. The specimen is extracted using an endobag from the incision of SLNB, which is systematically removed, or through a small enlargement of the incision of the apex trocar for patients with clinically positive LNs. The iliac step starts with open insertion in the pro-peritoneal space of a Hasson trocar, followed by positioning of two additional trocars (5 and 10 mm respectively) just laterally of the umbilical pubic line. After creation of pneumo-pelvis, the iliac femoral vessels are identified, isolated and all the external iliac LNs removed. Afterwards, the obturator LNs are dissected off the obturator nerve. LNs are retrieved with an endobag or directly through the 10mm trocar after insertion of protective endotrocar. Two drains are positioned at the end of procedure in the obturator fossa and in the inguinal space, respectively. Intra-operative and early post-operative outcome (lenght of stay, complications, number of LNs) is recorded. Follow-up consists in detection of any recurrence, measurement of lymphedema of the leg and evaluation of quality of life</detailed_description>
