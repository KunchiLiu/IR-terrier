	<brief_summary>Since their appearance more than a decade ago, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors have demonstrated beneficial activity in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, more than one-third of patients present primary resistance, and one more third become resistant over time. One of the main factors associated with loss of response is the immunogenicity of anti-TNF biologics leading to the production of antibodies targetting the TNF inhibitor, namely anti-drug antibodies (ADAbs), that accelerate drug elimination from the serum and decrease its therapeutic activity. In this study the investigators propose a medico-economic evaluation of the mesurement of anti-TNF agents and anti-drug antibodies serum concentrations in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with anti-TNFalpha inhibitors. 280 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) will be included and randomized in 2 groups with or without drug and ADAbs monitoring. In the monitored group, in case of loss of response, the clinician will use biological informations to adapt the treatment following a simple treatment algorithm. In the unmonitored group, drug and ADAbs measurements will not be transmitted to the clinician. Clinical and economical benefits of the biological monitoring will be evaluated after a follow-up period of two years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medico-economic Evaluation of the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Anti-TNF-Î± Agents in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>280 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) will be recruted in 13 french centers and randomized in 2 groups with or without drug and ADAbs monitoring. Anti-TNF inhibitors and ADAbs will be simultaneously measured in the patients serum by ELISA (LisaTracker - Theradiag) at weeks 6 and 24, months 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. In the unmonitored group, drug and ADAbs measurements will not be transmitted to the clinician. In the monitored group, in case of loss of response the clinician will use immunomonitoring data to adapt the treatment following a simple treatment algorithm: - loss of response with therapeutic serum trough level of anti-TNF switch to another biologic - loss of response with subtherapeutic serum trough level of anti-TNF but without dectectable ADAbs increase doses and/or shorten interval between infusions - loss of rsponse with subtherapeutic serum trough level of anti-TNF and dectectable ADAbs switch to another anti-TNF if inefficient switch to another biologic. Clinical and economical benefits of the biological monitoring will be evaluated after a follow-up period of two years: - primary outcome: Cost-utility analysis of the immunomonitoring strategy using incremental cost effectivness ratio - secondary outcome: Evaluation of the quality of life (IBDQ score)</detailed_description>
