Subject is from a vulnerable population (including mentally disabled children), other than a pediatric population. 2. Subject requires surgery that could influence the study outcome. 3. Abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG). 4. Screening pulse oximetry reading of &lt;95% while awake. 5. Has presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or indications of hepatitis A, B or C. 6. Lab values greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal. 7. History of renal disease or bleeding or clotting disorders or conditions. 8. Known or suspected alcoholism, marijuana or illicit drug abuse or misuse within 2 years before screening. 9. Smoked or used nicotinecontaining products within 6 months prior to screening. 10.

A history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder requiring medication is acceptable. 11. Diagnosis of epilepsy or other seizure disorder. 12. Previous cardiothoracic surgery. 13. Conditions which might be specifically contraindicated or require caution while using OC, APAP, and/or ibuprofen. 14. Drug allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance including OC, APAP, ibuprofen or excipients, or any opioid drug product. 15. Donated or had significant loss of whole blood (480 mL or more) within 30 days of or plans to donate blood or plasma during the course of the study. 16. Pathologic, iatrogenic or surgical condition that would compromise subject's ability to swallow, absorb, metabolize, or excrete XARTEMIS XR. 17. History of a GI event within 6 months prior to screening. 18. Subject has used any product containing OC or APAP within 48 hours prior to the first dose of XARTEMIS XR. 19. Any other medical condition, abnormal vital sign (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate), body temperature, pulse oximetry; or any physical examination or ECG finding at screening which would preclude safe participation in a clinical study. 20. Received any investigational product or device within 30 days before screening, or is scheduled to receive an investigational device or another investigational drug during the course of this study.</criteria>
