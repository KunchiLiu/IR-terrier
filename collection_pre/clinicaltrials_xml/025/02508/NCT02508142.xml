	<brief_title>Analgesic Efficacy of Intravenous Hyoscine-N-Butylbromide (HNB) in Abdominal Colic Associated With Acute Gastroenteritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute gastroenteritis is a frequent cause of emergency department (ED) presentation. Mainstays of ED treatment are rehydration and antiemetics when needed. Since crampy abdominal pain accompanies (diarrhea) acute gastroenteritis in 67-90% of patients, emergency physicians may have to deal with spasmodic colics in these patients. Hyoscine-N-butylbromide (HNB), is an anticholinergic agent which has been in use as an antispasmodic agent for sixty years all over the world. It has been studied and revealed various efficacy for several conditions (e.g; biliary colic, renal colic, endoscopic interventions, radiologic interventions, during labor, nonspecific abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome). HNB is commonly used for symptomatic relief of abdominal cramps associated with acute gastroenteritis in the EDs, whereas the literature lacks evidence regarding its efficacy and safety for this condition. The aim of this study is to assess the analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous 20 mg hyoscine-n-butylbromide versus placebo in patients with abdominal colic associated with acute gastroenteritis in the emergency department.</detailed_description>
