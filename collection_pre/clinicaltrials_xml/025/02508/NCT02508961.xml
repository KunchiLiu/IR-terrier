	<brief_summary>The study will be a pragmatic, single blind, randomised, controlled feasibility study, comparing 6 months of web-based physiotherapy plus usual care with usual care alone in pwMS. The study will recruit 90 pwMS from three UK Centres (30 from each centre); NHS Ayrshire and Arran, NHS Lothian, and Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial examining the effectiveness of a six-month web-based physiotherapy programme and usual care compared to usual care alone, in people moderately affected by MS and to gather essential information for the planning of a definitive trial, which would evaluate both clinical and cost effectiveness of the intervention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following baseline assessments, both groups will be given an appointment with the physiotherapist to agree shared goals and to devise an individualised exercise programme based upon their needs and treatment goals. Participants will then be randomised to one of two groups. Participants randomised to the intervention group will receive their individualised exercise programme delivered via the web-based physio website. Participants will be asked to complete their exercise programme at least twice weekly. They will receive weekly standardised phone calls from the physiotherapist for the first two weeks of the programme. Every two weeks thereafter for the remainder of the 6 month intervention period the physiotherapist will review the exercise diary of each participant and remotely alter the participant's exercise programme as appropriate, by changing any combination of exercises, level of difficulty or number of repetitions. The number and type of exercises within the programme and duration to complete the exercise programme will be documented. Participants will be informed of any changes by standardised email. Participants randomised to the control group will receive a print out exercise sheet of their individualised exercise programme. Participants will be asked to complete their exercise programme at least twice weekly. Compliance will be captured using a home exercise diary. Participants will also receive a weekly phone call from the physiotherapist for the first two weeks to check on progress.</detailed_description>
