	<brief_summary>This is a phase I randomized, double blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the ID93 recombinant protein antigen alone or formulated with GLA-SE or AP10-602 adjuvant in 70 healthy adults 18-49 years of age. Subjects will receive a total of 3 doses administered intramuscularly on Days 1, 29 and 57. Subjects will be monitored for approximately 422 days (365 days following the third study injection), including safety laboratory analyses done just prior to and 7 days following each study injection. Blood samples will be obtained for immunological assays (Luminex, intracellular cytokine staining at Days 1 and 71, and antibody analysis at Days 1 and 85). The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 10 µg ID93 + 5 or 10 µg AP10-602 compared to 10 µg ID93 + 5 µg GLA-SE and 10 µg ID93 alone following three consecutive intramuscular injections administered on Days 1, 29 and 57.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of the Vaccine Candidates ID93 + AP10-602 and ID93 + GLA-SE Administered Intramuscularly in Healthy Adult Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TB causes significant morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Strains of Mtb are becoming increasingly resistant to antimycobacterial drugs and therapy is often associated with poor compliance, which increases the likelihood of antimicrobial resistance. The current licensed BCG vaccine does not prevent reactivation or reinfection in adults so there is a great need for a more effective vaccine. ID93 is a recombinant antigen that, when mixed with the adjuvants GLA-SE and AP10-602, shows great promise in eliciting what is thought to be an important Th1 T cell response and limits the bacterial burden in Mtb challenged animals. This study is a phase I randomized, double blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the ID93 recombinant protein antigen alone or formulated with GLA-SE or AP10-602. This study will enroll 70 healthy males and non-pregnant females subjects, aged 18 to 49. Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized to ID93 alone, ID93 + GLA-SE, or ID93 + AP10-602 at either dose level. Study injections will be performed and subjects will be observed in clinic for 30 minutes. All subjects will complete a written subject memory aid that solicits local and systemic reactogenicity adverse events for 7 days following each study injection. After subjects are reevaluated to ensure they continue to meet eligibility criteria they will undergo second and third study injections on Days 29 and 57. General safety will be evaluated on Days 1, 3, 8, 29, 31, 36, 57, 59, 64, 71, 85, 169, and 422 for each subject. The occurrence of serious adverse events and the new onset of any adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be collected throughout the study period (approximately 422 days). Each subject's duration of participation will be about 15 months. The Primary Objective is : To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 10 µg ID93 + 5 or 10 µg AP10-602 compared to 10 µg ID93 + 5 µg GLA-SE and 10 µg ID93 alone following three consecutive intramuscular injections administered on Days 1, 29 and 57. The Secondary Objective is: To assess the immunogenicity of 10 µg ID93 + 5 or 10 µg AP10-602 compared to 10 µg ID93 + 5 µg GLA-SE and 10 µg ID93 alone by quantifying T cell responses and IgG antibody responses to ID93 at specified time points.</detailed_description>
