Does not have a usual primary care provider(PCP) at baseline Has not seen a doctor for an annual physical within the last year not including annual required physical for work at baseline TIPs Inclusion: Between 21 to 85 years of age Male Planning on remaining in NYC for at least 1 year, (with no vacations or trips to exceed one month) Licensed taxi driver for at least two years Leases taxi from NYC garage Speaks English, (English proficiency required for TIPs training) Willing and able to attend in person TIPs training sessions As per study team judgment, based upon the TIPs screening tool, is socially active among fellow taxi drivers, cares about health issues, and wants to help others improve their health Garage Exclusion: Does not agree to sign enrollment form Driver Exclusion: Parttime driver (drives fewer than 5 full shifts per week) Although it is highly unlikely for NYC taxi drivers to work for multiple garages at study baseline, drivers may switch jobs and/or their garage base affiliation while participating in this study. New jobs and/or garage base affiliations will be tracked during followup assessments and noted for potential limitations with study retention and intervention contamination. Drivers will be allowed to continue the study even if they are no longer working with the initial garage base.</criteria>
