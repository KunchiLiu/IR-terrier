	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and antineoplastic activity of BLU-285, administered orally (PO), in adult patients with unresectable GIST or other relapsed or refractory solid tumors. The study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation part (Part 1) and an expansion part (Part 2).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>For Part 1: Histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed diagnosis of unresectable GIST or another advanced solid tumor. Patients with unresectable GIST must have disease that has progressed following imatinib and at least 1 of the following: sunitinib, regorafenib, sorafenib, dasatinib, pazopanib or an experimental agent that targets KIT, or disease with a D842 mutation in the PDGFRα gene. Patients with an advanced solid tumor other than GIST must have relapsed or refractory disease without an available effective therapy. OR For Part 2: Group 1: Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of unresectable GIST that has progressed following imatinib and at least 1 of the following: sunitinib, regorafenib, sorafenib, dasatinib, pazopanib, or an experimental agent that targets KIT, and the patient does not have a D842V mutation in PDGFRα. Group 2: Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of unresectable GIST with a D842V mutation in the PDGFRα gene. The PDGFRα mutation will be identified by local or central assessment, either in an archival tissue sample or a new tumor biopsy obtained prior to treatment with BLU285. Groups 1 and 2: A tumor sample (archival tissue or a new tumor biopsy) has been submitted for mutational testing.
