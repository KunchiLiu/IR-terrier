	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the safety of transplantation with a haploidentical donor peripheral blood stem cell graft depleted of TCRαβ+ cells and CD19+ cells in conjunction with the immunomodulating drug, Zoledronate, given in the post-transplant period to treat pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies or high risk solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TCRαβ+/CD19+ Depleted Haploidentical HSCT + Zoledronate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>REDUCED-INTENSITY CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) intravenously (IV) on days -12 to -9, fludarabine phosphate IV on days -8 to -5, thiotepa IV twice daily (BID) on day -4, and melphalan IV on days -3 to -2. PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo TCR-αβ+ and CD19+ depleted haploidentical donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. ZOLEDRONATE ADMINISTRATION: Patients receive zoledronate IV after transplant as determined by their assigned treatment group (Cohort). Patients in Cohort A do not receive zoledronate. Follow-up assessments will occur after transplantation.</detailed_description>
