	<brief_title>Effect of Administration of Rifaximin on the Portal Pressure of Patients With Liver Cirrhosis and Esophageal Varices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is well recognized that the gut flora may play an important role in the development of complications of liver cirrhosis, such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and variceal bleeding, which are are directly caused or aggravated by the translocation of enteric bacteria or their products into the blood of cirrhotic patients.Preliminary studies have shown that selective intestinal decontamination appears to ameliorate the hyperdynamic circulatory state of cirrhosis. The investigators hypothesize that a modulation of gut microbiota by administering a non-adsorbable antibiotic, in addition to beta-blockers, can be a safe strategy to reduce the portal pressure, influencing favorably hemodynamics of portal circulation. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate if in patients with liver cirrhosis and esophageal varices at high risk of bleeding, Rifaximin, administered in addition to standard therapy with beta - blockers (propranolol), for a time of 60 days: leads to a significant reduction of Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (it will be assessed by hepatic vein catheterization), 2) modify the intestinal flora in favor of specific families of bacteria (it will be assessed by fecal microbiota analysis), 3) change systemic inflammatory responses (it will be assessed by serum pro-inflammatory cytokines) 4) change in cognitive functions (it will be assessed by neuropsychological and electroencephalogram evaluations).</detailed_description>
