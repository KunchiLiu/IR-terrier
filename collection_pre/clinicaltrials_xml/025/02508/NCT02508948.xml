	<brief_summary>To further examine current intubation practice among critically ill patients who are in need of endotracheal intubation, the investigators plan to perform a prospective cross-sectional study of adult critically ill patients who needed endotracheal intubation at participating sites between August 1st, 2015 to August 1st, 2016. The investigators aim to describe the current intubation practice among the participating sites with a description of complications that may have surfaced during the peri-intubation period and to isolate predictive factors of these complications. In this study, the primary aim is to describe, through a prospective cross-sectional study, the current intubation practice of adult critically ill patients undergoing endotracheal intubations with secondary aims exploring complications that may emerge during the peri-intubation period and to isolate predictive factors of these complications. This information will generate hypotheses which will lead to further study with the ultimate impact of reducing patient-related outcomes such as morbidity and mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endotracheal Intubation Among the Critically Ill: HEMAIR Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1: To describe the current intubation practice among the participating sites by collecting data on both airway management and hemodynamics during the peri-intubation period defined as 60 minutes pre- and post-intubation in adult critically ill patients. Aim 2: To report the incidence of immediate (within 30 minutes after intubation) complications defined as the following: 1) cardiac arrest or death; 2) cardiovascular collapse (defined as a sustained decrease (&gt;30 minutes) in mean arterial pressure &lt; 65 mmHg or systolic arterial pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg despite 1000-2000 liters of fluid loading [crystalloid and/or colloid solution] and/or the requirement of any vasoactive agent); 3) hypoxemia (decrease in pulse oximetry to oxygen saturation &lt; 90% during attempts); 4) hypotension (mean arterial pressure &lt;65 mmHg or systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg occurring at any time); 5) difficult intubation (three or more attempts at laryngoscopy to place the endotracheal tube into the trachea and/or &gt;10 minutes using conventional laryngoscopy and/or the need for another operator); 6) aspiration; 7) esophageal intubation [immediate and delayed]; 8) dental injury; 9) and supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmia (without loss of pulse); 10) vomiting; 11) oral or laryngeal trauma; 12) laryngospasm; 13) pneumothorax; 14) malignant hyperthermia; 15) medication error; 16) mainstem intubation; 17) nasal bleeding; 18) other. Aim3: To isolate predictive factors of immediate airway (hypoxemia/difficult intubation) and hemodynamic (cardiovascular collapse/hypotension) complications.</detailed_description>
