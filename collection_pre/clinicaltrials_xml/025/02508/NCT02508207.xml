	<criteria>Male and female subjects Homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation Confirmed diagnosis of CF by sweat chloride testing FEV1 ≥40% and ≤90% of predicted normal for age, sex, and height at Screening Visit Stable CF disease as judged by the investigator. History of any comorbidity that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the subject. An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation, or changes in therapy for pulmonary disease within 28 days before Day 1 History or evidence of clinically significant findings on ophthalmologic examination during the Screening Period. History of solid organ or hematological transplantation Pregnant or nursing females Subjects who have had radiation exposure within 1 year before the first MCC procedure that would cause them to exceed federal regulations by participating in this study In the opinion of the investigator, unable to adequately perform inhalation maneuvers during the MCC procedures</criteria>
