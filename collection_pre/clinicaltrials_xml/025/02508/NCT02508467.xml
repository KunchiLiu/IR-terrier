	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antineoplastic activity of BLU- 554 administered orally in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation part (Part 1) and an expansion part (Part 2) exploring both a once daily (qd) and twice daily (bid) dosing schedule.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Confirmed diagnosis of HCC by histological examination or by noninvasive criteria according to European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) or American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) guidelines. Patient has unresectable disease and has been previously treated with sorafenib, has declined treatment with sorafenib, or does not have access to sorafenib. OR In Part 1 only, confirmed diagnosis of a relapsed or refractory advanced solid tumor other than HCC that has evidence of aberrant FGF19/FGFR4 pathway activity [e.g. tumor or blood/plasma alterations including, but not limited to, 11q13.1 locus (FGF19/CCND1 (cyclin D1)) amplification/copy number gain] ChildPugh class A with no clinically apparent ascites Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 01 For Part 1, willing to provide archived tumor tissue (if available) and willing to undergo pre and ontreatment tumor biopsy (if considered safe and medically feasible by the treating investigator) For Part 2, all patients must have an FGF19 IHC result available. Only FGF19 IHC positive HCC patients will be eligible for Part 2 of the bid dosing schedule.
