	<brief_summary>The Resilience Alliance is a skill-based staff development intervention for child protective staff that focuses on improving job satisfaction, resilience, optimism and social support, while decreasing attrition, stress reactivity and burnout. The investigators believe that the intervention will enhance the capacity of child welfare workers to care for themselves, which will result in them providing better care for the children and families involved with the child welfare system. The Resiliance Alliance will be implemented in two child protective offices, Manhattan Zone C and Brooklyn Zone B. Staff from two additional offices (Staten Island Zone A and Brooklyn Zone C) will serve as a control group. A web-based survey will be administered in the group receiving the Resiliance Alliance intervention prior to intervention, at completion of the intervention, and 3 months post completion. The control group will be given a two-part training (3 hours in total) on secondary traumatic stress. The control group will then be asked to complete the same survey as the intervention group.</brief_summary>
