	<brief_title>Phase I/II Trial of Alectinib and Bevacizumab in Patients With Advanced, Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)-Positive, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. - A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose(s) of the investigational intervention to use for further studies. - Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. - "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied. - In this research study, the investigators are investigating the combination of two study drugs: alectinib and bevacizumab. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved alectinib as a treatment for any disease. It has been found that some people with NSCLC have a change (mutation) in a certain gene called the anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) gene. This mutated gene helps cancer cells grow. -- Alectinib belongs to a class of drugs designed to inhibit ALK. This drug has been used in other research studies. Information from those other research studies suggests that alectinib may be effective in killing cancer cells that have changes in ALK. Only participants with changes in the ALK gene will be allowed to participate in this study. In this research study, Alectinib will be combined with Bevacizumab. -- Bevacizumab (also called Avastin) works by slowing or stopping the growth of cells in cancer tumors by decreasing the blood supply of the tumors. If blood supply is decreased, oxygen and nutrients that are needed for tumor growth are decreased. The FDA has approved Bevacizumab as a treatment option for your disease The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Alectinib and Bevacizumab. The investigators will also determine how effective this combination is in participants with advanced, ALK-positive NSCLC with a focus on participants with brain metastases.</detailed_description>
