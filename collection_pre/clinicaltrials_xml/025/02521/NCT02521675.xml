	<brief_summary>There is no specific recommendations on the adjustments of the insulin treatment in the event of physical activity (PA) in T1D patients treated on insulin pump therapy. Patients often prefer additional carbohydrates intake rather than the reduction of their insulin doses because of the lack of specific algorithms. The DIABRASPORT 2 study aims to demonstrate that using algorithms DIABRASPORT, during a week of physical activity (PA), the incidence of hypoglycaemia is not different from that obtained during a week of rest without physical activity. It is a multi-center European, controlled, randomized, cross-over, study, in 100 T1D patients practicing an occasional AP. 25 centers involved in this study. After agreeing to participate in the study, patients will read the information leaflet, ask questions to the investigator physician and they will date and sign the consent form. The investigator physician will do the same. They will be then drawn randomly via the electronic CRF (eCRF) to determine the order in which they will realize the rest vs DIABRASPORT sessions. The study will take place in 5 weeks: During the weeks Baseline and Diabrasport, patients will have to make 3 physical activity of 30 to 60 minutes separated by at least 24 hours: - moderate activity 3 hours after lunch - intense activity 3 hours after lunch - activity moderate 90 min after lunch They will use their usual algorithms (Cho intake or adjustment of the dose of insulin) during the week Baseline and they will use the Diabrasport algorithm during the week Diabrasport. Patients will be equipped with a holter Glycemic iPro2, Medtronic, whose data are hidden. During the week of rest, patients should do no physical activity during the week. They will be equipped with the Glycemic holter. Patients will have to fill a food survey the days they practice PA. Between each period, the patient must respect a period of wash-out for one week at least, during which he will be asked to not practice physical activity. Validation of algorithms simple, easy to implement, adaptable by patients, could help to improve balance metabolic and practice of sport among the T1D.</brief_summary>
