	<brief_title>Determination of Analgesic Effect From One Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation(TMS)Treatment Following Vaginal Reconstructive Surgery.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the amount of opiate and pain medication administered in the week following surgery. Subjects will receive an identical pain control regimen. Participants will undergo TMS motor threshold assessment at the ETSU Innovation Lab prior to the planned surgery. At this appointment a baseline Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Center for Epidemiological Studies 10-item Depression scale (CES-D) and visual analog scale (VAS) ratings of pain and mood will be obtained.VAS ratings will also be done each evening over the following week. One day after surgery, the subject will return to the Innovation lab for TMS. A total of 22 subjects will be recruited for the study. At the return visit, 11 will receive 40 minutes of 10 Hz repetitive TMS at 120% of rMT (4-second stimulation trains with 26-second interstimulus intervals). The other 11 participants will receive sham treatment under identical settings. Participants, medical staff providing clinical care to patients and raters will not know whether participants receive real or sham TMS. Patients will keep a log of pain medications used over the following week in addition to the VAS ratings. Follow-up will occur one week after the TMS therapy. The subject will turn in logs and repeat BDI and CES-D scales.</detailed_description>
