	<brief_summary>The study is intended to assess the safety and performance of the Vadoâ„¢ Steerable Sheath in facilitating ease of access to the pulmonary veins (PV) for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). The study will be a prospective, single-center, non-randomized investigation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Performance Study to Evaluate Access to Pulmonary Veins for Treatment of Paroxysmal AF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design for this study involves the sequential enrollment of patients with documented paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who have had two (2) or more AF episodes for at least 30 seconds in length within six (6) months prior to enrollment. Target population shall be selected from the treatable AF population that meets both inclusion/exclusion criteria.It is intended that the Vado Steerable Sheath will be used as part of standard clinical workflow procedures, with no procedural deviations relative to other procedures requiring steerable sheaths. Individual subjects will be studied during mapping and ablation procedures and followed until release from hospital post procedure per institutional standard of care.</detailed_description>
