	<brief_title>A New Track Ablation Device for Liver Biopsy: A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: - Percutaneous biopsy for hepatic masses has a potential risk of bleeding and peritoneal tumor seeding. - A new device for biopsy track ablation has been invented to reduce the risk of bleeding and peritoneal tumor seeding. Method: - Routine percutaneous biopsy for hepatic masses is performed. - Immediate after obtaining tissue, biopsy needle track is ablated with a new biopsy tract ablator. - Immediate (with ultrasound) and 24 hours (with CT scan) after procedure, occurrence of complications is evaluated.</detailed_description>
