	<brief_summary>Preterm birth is defined as a birth occurring before the completion of 37 weeks gestation. The incidence of preterm birth in Israel in the last years is around 7-8%. Despite various diagnostic modalities as well as newly therapeutic approaches the incidence of preterm birth remains unchanged and is considered to be the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. In the last decade, small RNAs have emerged as an important player in both physiological and pathophysiological responses. These single strands, non-coding regulatory RNA molecules are responsible for post transcriptional regulation of target genes. Hence, may provide a new opportunity for biomarkers discovery in the field of preterm birth. The main objective of this study is to identify a distinctive expression profile of maternal circulating RNAs that will be used as biomarkers for preterm birth.</brief_summary>
