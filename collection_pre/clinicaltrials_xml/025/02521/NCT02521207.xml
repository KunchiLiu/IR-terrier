	<brief_summary>The study will compare the study drug to an already marketed formulation of prescription strength ibuprofen (Brufen速 the reference product) by looking at how the drug is taken up by the body and also by performing a specialist procedure called an endoscopy (or more specifically, a gastroscopy). The safety and tolerability of the study drug will also be assessed. The study will consist of 2 parts involving up to 54 healthy male and female subjects. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either the study drug or reference product. Part 1 will be a cross over study in which up to 10 subjects will receive a single dose of 800 mg study drug OXP001 or Brufen速 on Day 1, then a single dose of 800 mg study drug OXP001 or Brufen速 on Day 4. Part 1 will assess bioavailability and involve an interim decision on progression to Part 2. In Part 2, up to 44 subjects will receive a dose of 800 mg OXP001 or Brufen速 three times daily for 7 days in order to assess pharmacokinetics and stomach irritation using endoscopy.</brief_summary>
