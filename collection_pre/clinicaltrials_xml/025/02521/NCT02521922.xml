	<brief_title>Vital Signs Patch Early Feasibility and Usability Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this clinical feasibility study is to evaluate the feasibility of the Vital Signs Patch System (VSP). The VSP will be incorporated into the study site's Information Technology infrastructure and worn by in-patients for a minimum of 3 days and for the duration of their hospital stay up to 7 days. The VSP will take and monitor vital signs in addition to the normal equipment the facility uses to monitor and take vital signs. This study will not be assessing safety and no comparator groups will be used. As this study will not be treating any particular disease or condition, no randomization or blinding is required. Subjects will be chosen as they are admitted in accordance with the general population characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria and willingness to sign the Informed Consent. This clinical study involves a device with no additional drugs administered. During this study, a single VSP System patch will be worn for up to 48 hours. The first patch will be placed using the NEHB configuration. After the first 48 hours, the NEHB-configured patch will be replaced with a new patch in the PAL configuration. The second patch can remain on the subject for the duration of the subject's hospital stay, or up to seven (7) consecutive days. Individual patient use will determine the duration of time that the second patch can be worn.</detailed_description>
