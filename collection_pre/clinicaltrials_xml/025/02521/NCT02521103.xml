	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective, open-label, post-market, non-randomized, multi-center clinical evaluation of the Triathlon TS Total Knee System with Triathlon Tritanium Cone Augments for revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in a consecutive series of patients who meet the eligibility criteria. The revision rate of the Triathlon Tritanium Cone Augments is expected to be less than 2.8% for aseptic loosening of either the Femoral or the Tibial Cone Augments at 2 years postoperative.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patient has signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) approved, study specific Informed Patient Consent Form. Patient is a male or nonpregnant female, skeletally mature and age 18 years or older at time of study device implantation. Patient is a candidate for revision of all femoral and tibial components of a total knee replacement. Patient is willing and able to comply with postoperative scheduled clinical and radiographic evaluations and rehabilitation. Patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) â‰¥ 40. Patient has an active or suspected latent infection in or about the affected knee joint at time of study device implantation. Patient has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficiency, which limits the ability to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the device. Patient is diagnosed with a systemic disease (e.g. Lupus Erythematosus) or a metabolic disorder (e.g. Paget's disease) leading to progressive bone deterioration. Patient is immunologically suppressed or receiving steroids in excess of normal physiological requirements (e.g. &gt; 30 days). Patient has a failed unicondylar knee prosthesis. Patient has a known sensitivity to device materials. Patient is a prisoner.</criteria>
