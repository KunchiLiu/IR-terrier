	<brief_summary>Free gingival grafts are important to increase zone of attached gingiva and root coverage. This case series reveals role of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) as adjunctive therapy in palatal wound healing. The superior healing observed at the PRF membrane sites supports its use in accelerating soft-tissue healing. PRF membrane as a palatal bandage is an efficacious approach to protect the raw wound area of a palatal donor site to reduce healing time and patient discomfort.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjunctive Role of PRF After Free Gingival Graft Harvesting - Case Series</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction: Free gingival grafts are one of the common treatment modalities used to increase the zone of keratinized tissue (KT) around implants or prior to ridge augmentation and root coverage. The palatal donor sites had many complications as pain, discomfort and healing by secondary intention. Platelets Rich Fibrin (PRF) is a second generation of platelets concentrate full of growth factors fasten the healing and decrease the pain. Materials and methods: Ten patients requiring augmentation of KT participated in this case series. The palatal donor sites of 7 of these patients were covered with PRF membranes with a new suturing technique without palatal stent, the other 3 had palatal stent. Palatal tissue will examined clinically after 3, 7, 10 and 14 days. Considerably very fast healing with 0 pain score was observed during one week in the group with PRF.</detailed_description>
