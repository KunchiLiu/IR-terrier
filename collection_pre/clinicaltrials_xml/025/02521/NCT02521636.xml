	<brief_summary>Investigators propose to conduct a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter assessing the interests of an antibiotic protocol guided by serum procalcitonin (PCT) on morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU) for acute exacerbation with or without associated pneumonia. The main objective is to show in patients hospitalized in intensive care for acute exacerbation of COPD with or without pneumonia, safety, defined as a lack of difference in mortality at 3 months, an antibiotic strategy guided by the PCT in the ICU.</brief_summary>
