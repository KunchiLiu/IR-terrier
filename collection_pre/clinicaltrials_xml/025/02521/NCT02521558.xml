	<brief_summary>The current study will examine the use of a mobile electronic application used to deliver cognitive rehabilitation to patients with mild cognitive impairment due (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and patients with mild AD. Patients will be given a specific cognitive rehabilitation program on their mobile device (iPad) with specific tasks for them to complete. The goal of this study is to determine if a) patients are able to use and adhere to a cognitive rehabilitation program delivered to their mobile device and b) to determine if patients can improve their language, attention, and memory by completing cognitive rehabilitation tasks assigned to them.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In the current study, the investigators are examining the use of a mobile electronic application used to deliver cognitive rehabilitation tasks to patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, and patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. An estimated 100 patients will be enrolled into the study (~50 patients with mild cognitive impairment, ~50 patients with Alzheimer's disease). Participants will either receive memory tasks designed to help stabilize or improve memory (Intervention Group) or a set of word or math puzzles (Control Group). Participants will complete memory tasks or puzzles for a six month period. The investigators will conduct pre- and post- neuropsychological testing to assess changes in cognitive status (e.g., memory, language, executive functioning) in the intervention group. Neuropsychological tests assessing changes to cognition will be completed prior to participant assignment to the Intervention or Control Group. Both groups will then be assessed again using neuropsychological tests. The investigators will also assess changes in performance on cognitive rehabilitation tests over the six month period to determine the efficacy of these tasks.</detailed_description>
