	<brief_summary>This was a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, dose-finding, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of F-627 compared to Filgrastim in women with breast cancer receiving myelotoxic chemotherapy. Subjects would be randomized to one of three arms, which were 10 mg/dose of F-627, 20 mg/dose of F-627 or Filgrastim, in an equal ratio.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II, Dose-finding Study of F-627 in Patients With Breast Cancer Receiving Myelotoxic Chemotherapy.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II study was conducted at 16 clinical centers in China and planned to enroll 150 women with breast cancer who will receive chemotherapy that includes up to 4 cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, 100 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2, respectively. Subjects would be randomized to one of three arms, which were 10 mg/dose of F-627, 20 mg/dose of F-627 or Filgrastim, in an equal ratio on Day 1 of the study. Patients will remain on their randomized study drug dose and regimen for each of the following 3 chemotherapy cycles. The chemotherapy to be administered for chemotherapy cycles 2-4 should be the same therapy administered to the subject on Day1. Chemotherapy will be administrated through intravenous IV) injection on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle and be repeated every 3 weeks for up to four cycles unless a dose delay is necessary. Approximately 48 hours after chemotherapy completion in cycle (day 3 of the cycle), patients will either receive a subcutaneous (SC) injection of F-627 (either 10 mg/dose or 20 mg/dose) or 5 μg/kg/dose filgrastim used up to two weeks or stopped while ANC more than 5 × 109/L. To track ANC concentration post chemotherapy, subjects returned to their study site for blood draws either daily (Cycle 1) or 3 times per week (every other day; Cycles 2-4) until ANC levels reached ≥2.0 × 109/L, post-nadir, and then every 3 days until the next chemotherapy cycle. All subjects returned for an End of Study visit approximately 3 weeks after their final study drug administration (Study Day 84) and had a follow-up phone call 30 days after the last study drug.</detailed_description>
