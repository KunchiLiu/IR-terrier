	<brief_summary>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most prevalent endocrine disorder in reproductive age women. PCOS is usually characterized by an excessive androgen production, menstrual irregularities, and polycystic ovaries. Women with PCOS are often obese and have a varying degree of insulin resistance (IR). Weight reduction constitutes the initial treatment for these patients. Metformin has proven to be useful in IR and is frequently used in PCOS. However metformin use may be accompanied by gastrointestinal discomfort, and a high abandon rate. Other therapeutic alternatives such as magnesium and polyunsaturated fatty acids have been used in other IR states and may be useful in PCOS. The aim of this study is to asses the efficacy of these alternatives in obese PCOS patients.</brief_summary>
