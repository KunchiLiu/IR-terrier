	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies the safety of and how well aspirin works in preventing Barrett's esophagus from returning after it has been successfully eliminated by radiofrequency ablation. Studying samples of tissue from patients with Barrett's esophagus for the levels of a specific protein that is linked to developing Barrett's esophagus may help doctors learn whether aspirin can prevent it from returning after it has been successfully treated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aspirin in Preventing Disease Recurrence in Patients With Barrett Esophagus After Successful Elimination by Radiofrequency Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To conduct a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled phase II chemoprevention trial, investigating whether supplementation with aspirin 325 mg/day for 12 months is safe and reduces the expression of CDX2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (a biomarker which has been associated with the risk of developing Barrett's esophagus [BE]) in comparison to placebo after successful radiofrequency ablation (RFA). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess safety at 12 months. II. To assess differences in the expression of CDX2 at 18 months, activation status of NF-kB by assessing levels of total and phosphorylated (phospho)-p65 and cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of phospho-p65 which is likely to be affected by aspirin. III. To assess the prostanoid marker, prostaglandin E2, and prostaglandin synthases, which are known to respond to aspirin and to correlation with clinicopathological factors in the esophageal cancer. IV. To assess differences in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines known to induce activation of NFkB, i.e., TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-23 will be measured. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients receive aspirin orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 months. ARM B: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 12 months. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months.</detailed_description>

participants may take Tylenol and nonNSAID pain relievers Current or planned use of anticoagulant drugs such as: warfarin, heparin, low molecular weight heparin, Plavix, or Aggrenox throughout the course of the study Individuals taking the drugs listed below may not be randomized unless they are willing to stop the medications (and possibly change to alternative nonexcluded medications to treat the same conditions) no less than 3 months prior to starting aspirin or placebo on this study; consultation with the participant's primary care provider will be obtained prior to stopping any agent; the use of the following drugs or drug classes is prohibited during aspirin/placebo treatment: NSAIDs: such as aspirin, Naprosyn, ketorolac and others NSAIDs COX2 inhibitors: such as celecoxib, rofecoxib Valproic acid Sulfinpyrazone Probenecid Corticosteroids (other than shortterm use defined as less than 2 weeks) Platelet aggregation inhibitors, except in a monitored antithrombotic regimen Methotrexate (MTX) Vaccines containing live viruses Gingko Individuals with uncontrolled renal insufficiency or renal failure Participants with prior fundoplication, bariatric surgery or any other major upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgery;
