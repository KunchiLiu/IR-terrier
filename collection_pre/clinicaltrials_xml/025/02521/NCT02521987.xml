	<brief_title>Port Size and Post-Operative Pain Perception by Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Minimally invasive approaches trade a single longer incision for 4-5 smaller incisions that allow abdominal access and abdominal insufflation through "ports". The increase in operative times is mostly due to the need to pass suture, needles, cameras and instruments through the abdominal ports. While, it is intuitive that smaller abdominal ports will result in less pain at the incision site, the port size is also limited by instrument size and the size of the needle. When ports are smaller, it can take a little more time for a needle or instrument to be passed into the port. There is a paucity of research comparing different port sizes as they relate to participate pain and operative time especially in a randomized controlled trial setting. The investigators goal would be to determine if there is a difference in pain perception by patients when the assistant port size varies by 50% (8 mm to 12 mm).</detailed_description>
