Based on randomization in first intervention session, one side receives MBB and the other side takes PDI and in second session the pattern reverses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medial Branch Block vs Para-spinal Muscle Injection in Patients With Non-specific Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain relief following medial branch block (MBB) might be due to facet joints desensitization and/or myofascial trigger points' desensitization. Patients will be randomized to two groups. The first group receives MBB in one side and paravertebral deep intramuscular (PDI) injection in the other side of the back. Next week the pattern of injection will be reversed so the side which had received MBB will take PDI injection and PDI side will take MBB. Second group takes the intervention in reverse order.</detailed_description>
