	<brief_summary>In the last few years, acute renal injury (AKI) definition has been significantly changed. In the light of the data obtained from multicenter international studies, acute renal injury was redefined according to RIFLE, AKIN and KDIGO criteria. The common criteria of all three criteria in acute renal failure is the increment of level of creatinine as 0.3 mg/dL or 50 % increment of respective basal value of serum creatinine. In the current study, older than 40 years patients with no specific gender, who will stay at least one night in hospital will be included and cardiovascular and urological surgery patients and patients with known renal insufficiency will be excluded. It was aimed to measure serum creatinine levels in all included patients at baseline and up to 24h after surgery and will be determined acute kidney injury incidence and risk factors according to new criteria.</brief_summary>
