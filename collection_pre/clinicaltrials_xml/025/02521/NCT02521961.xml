	<brief_title>Support Group Program in Improving Quality of Life in Underserved Urban Latina Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the effect of the support program for Latina breast cancer survivors using validated measures of health-related quality of life. II. Evaluate the effect of the support program for Latina breast cancer survivors using validated measures of general distress. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. A brief qualitative assessment will evaluate the perception of the program among intervention participants using a brief survey. OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Participants attend support group sessions over 1-1.5 hours once weekly for 10 weeks. The sessions include facilitated discussions among participants about the following topics: stress management and emotional coping strategies, nutrition and physical activity, sexuality and body image, medical advocacy, self-care and social support. Participants receive a binder in which the rationale for each topic, techniques learned, and activities completed during each session will be summarized and are shown a Chair-robics digital video disc (DVD). ARM II: Participants receive one phone call to arrange a follow-up with the promotora, a note acknowledging their participation in the study, and a community resource booklet. Participants are then yoked into one of the 3 intervention groups and asked to attend a 30 minute session similar to Arm I.</detailed_description>
