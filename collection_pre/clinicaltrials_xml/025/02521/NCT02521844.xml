	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1A/B study consisting of two parts. Part A is a non-randomised, open-label, sequential evaluation of the safety, pharmacokinetics, MTD, and RD of ETC 1922159 in patients with advanced or metastatic, or unresectable solid malignancies, for whom no approved treatment option or standard of care is available. Dose escalation, with the goal of identifying the MTD and RD, will be guided by an oCRM model with a cohort size of one patient. Part B will be a non-randomised, non-comparative, open-label evaluation of the safety and tolerability of the RD of ETC 1922159 in patients with advanced or metastatic, or unresectable solid malignancies, for whom no approved treatment option or standard of care is available, with a molecular phenotype that is expected to make them sensitive to PORCN inhibitor treatment. It is anticipated that the study will take approximately 30 months to complete (approximately 18 months for Part A and approximately 12 months for Part B).</brief_summary>
