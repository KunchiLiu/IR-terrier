	<brief_summary>Background: Posterior spinal fusion (PSF) in children with cerebral palsy (CP) carries a high risk of complications and mortality. Complication rates have been reported as high as 45%, and infection rates typically reported at 15%. Efforts to improve efficiency by reducing operative time and blood loss could decrease these risks. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of utilizing two attending surgeons on blood loss, operative time, and complications in this population. Methods: This is a prospective, matched cohort analysis with a consecutive series of patients with CP who underwent PSF, with two attending surgeons, in 2012. These are matched with a control group that had a single-surgeon team (operative dates 2008-2010), assisted by a resident, PA, or RN-FA. The groups are compared using paired Student T-tests and chi square tests (significance set a p&lt;0.05).</brief_summary>
