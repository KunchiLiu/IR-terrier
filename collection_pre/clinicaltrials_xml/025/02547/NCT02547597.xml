	<brief_summary>There are few data regarding anti-anginal effects between beta-blockers with and without vasodilating property. Beta-blocker without vasodilating property is generally known to have unfavorable effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. Therefore, the investigators compared carvedilol and atenolol on anti-anginal and metabolic effects in patient with stable angina pectoris.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Carvedilol and Atenolol on Anti-anginal and Metabolic Effects in Patients With Stable Angina Pectoris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have demonstrated that beta-blockers are effective in reducing not only ischemia but also cardiovascular mortality following myocardial infarction. And, recent guidelines have suggested the potential for use of beta-blockers as first-line agents in chronic stable angina. However, beta-blockers are a diverse class with different mechanisms of action and physiological effects. Various pharmacologic properties that characterize beta-blockers include cardioselectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and concomitant vasodilating alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, which might exhibit differential anti-anginal efficacies. In addition, traditional beta-blockers, particularly nonvasodilating beta-blockers, have been reported to have negative metabolic effects, including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. These unfavorable effects of beta-blockers should be considered in patients with stable angina pectoris, because the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease is associated with abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism. Carvedilol, a newer vasodilating beta-blocker, has been shown to differ from traditional beta-blockers in terms of metabolic effects in patients with hypertension and diabetes. However, few data regarding comparative anti-anginal and metabolic effects between beta-blockers with and without vasodilating property have been reported, particularly in patients with angina pectoris. In this study, we simultaneously compared anti-anginal and metabolic effects of carvedilol and atenolol in patients with stable angina pectoris.</detailed_description>
