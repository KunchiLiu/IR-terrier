	<brief_summary>Preliminary data show that high flow nasal air has been shown to reduce promote heat exchange due to evaporation of nasal mucus by the air flow resulting in heat loss. It is unclear whether unidirectional nasal airflow is well tolerated in healthy individuals. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that dry high flow nasal air will be sufficiently tolerated in healthy adults.</brief_summary>
