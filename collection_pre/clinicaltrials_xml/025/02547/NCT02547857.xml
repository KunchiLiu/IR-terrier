	<brief_title>Transvaginal Pelvic Ultrasound in the ED</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic ultrasound is frequently performed in the ED in non-pregnant women to assess for ovarian pathology. During the pelvic examination a transvaginal ultrasound probe is used to visualize ovarian size, determine echotexture, assess whether ovarian tenderness is present, and sometimes measure ovarian blood flow. Though pelvic ultrasound is used in the Hennepin County Medical Center ED routinely, there is a paucity of literature assessing it's utility. This observational study will help determine the usefulness of this imaging modality, and how often it changes management in clinical practice. Specifically, this study will attempt to determine how often transvaginal ultrasound identifies the structures of interest, and then will correlate these findings with the final ED diagnosis. If a formal ultrasound is obtained, the findings of the ED ultrasound will also be compared to the findings of the formal ultrasound. The treating physicians will be queried the diagnosis and management plans before and after the pelvic US to ascertain changes in management.</detailed_description>
