	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1, single-center, placeb-controlled, double-blind study. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and immunogenicity of an oral vaccine tablet to prevent seasonal influenza B tested at two dose levels (low and high dose). The study will enroll 27 subjects in the low dose cohorts (3 sentinel open label subjects followed by 24 subjects (randomized 2:1 to vaccine vs placebo, respectively). Subsequently, 27 subjects will be enrolled in the high dose cohort in a similar manner as to the low dose cohort. Safety and immunogenicity will be evaluated at Day 28. Long term safety follow-up will be evaluated through 1 year post vaccination.</brief_summary>
