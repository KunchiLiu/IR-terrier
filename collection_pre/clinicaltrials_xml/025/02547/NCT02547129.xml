	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Male or female age 18 to 100 years of age. 2. Preoperative diagnosis of bacterial infection by culture which would include a preoperative aspiration and at least three intraoperative cultures. The preoperative aspiration would also be sent for a cell count with differential. All patients would have an ESR and CRP drawn in the preoperative phase. Patients with a negative preoperative aspiration, but an actively draining wound or draining sinus tract, would be considered as infected. Intraoperative histopathology would also be obtained in all cases of infected total knee replacement at the time of the resection. 3. Intact extensor mechanism. 4. Adequate soft tissue envelope (no requirement for soft tissue coverage such as a muscle flap or skin graft) 5. Adequate bone stock for knee reconstruction 6. Medical fitness for staged knee reconstruction Exclusion Criteria 1. Known Atypical infection (mycobacterial or fungal) 2. Extensor mechanism disruption 3. Inadequate soft tissue envelope requiring muscle flap or skin grafting 4. Inadequate bone stock (T3 or F3 by the AORI classification) 5. Medical status precluding staged knee reconstruction 6. Requirement for hinged knee reconstruction at the time of reimplantation 7. Pregnant women for women of child bearing age, a negative pregnancy test will be needed prior to enrollment to the study.</criteria>
