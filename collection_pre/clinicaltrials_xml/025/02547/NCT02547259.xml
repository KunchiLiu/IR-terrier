	<brief_summary>Currently there is uncertainty on how schizophrenic patients feel pain. Pain has several components including cognitive behavior which allow humans to perceive it as a negative emotion. It is difficult to say precisely what are the differences in cognitive processing between the emotional component of pain and painless another negative emotion (eg fear). However, pain and negative emotion have some neural networks together and there are many common ways between emotional processing (pain or negative) and storing information (limbic system).</brief_summary>

Upon the occurrence of a word, patient/healthy volunteer must press the 'L' key if they think they have learned the word or the "D" key on the keyboard if they feel that they have not learned this word. - Group 2: words to negative sense will be shown on a screen, one at a time for 5 seconds. Patient or healthy volunteer need to retain them. Then these same words, mixed with others that patient/healthy volunteer will not learn, will again be displayed on the computer screen one at a time for 5 seconds. Upon the occurrence of a word, patient/healthy volunteer must press the 'L' key if they think they have learned the word or the "D" key on the keyboard if they feel that they have not learned this word. 15 schizophrenic will be included in group 1 and 15 other schizophrenics in group 2. 15 Healthy volunteer will be included in group 1 and 15 other Healthy volunteer in group 2.</detailed_description>
