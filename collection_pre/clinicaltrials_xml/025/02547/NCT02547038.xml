	<brief_title>Comparing the Efficacy of Reverse Hybrid Therapy and Bismuth Quadruple Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 14-day hybrid therapy invented by our study group appears very promising in H. pylori eradication, achieving excellent eradication rates of 99% and 97% according to per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses, respectively. Recently, the investigators demonstrated that the eradication rate of reverse hybrid therapy was higher than that of standard triple therapy. However, whether reverse hybrid therapy achieves a higher eradication rate than bismuth quadruple therapy remained unanswered.</detailed_description>
