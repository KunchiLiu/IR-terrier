	<brief_summary>Nasal colonization with S. aureus is a risk factor for infection with this bacterium. A methodologically well conducted study of S. aureus bacteremia showed that 80% of S. aureus bacteremia with are due to the strain isolated in the nasal level. However, as part of a study coordinated by the CHU of Saint-Etienne, less than 50% of infections in prosthetic orthopedic devices have been linked to nasal carriage . Outside of exogenous infections, intestinal colonization with S. aureus could be an alternative source of endogenous infections with the waning of orthopedic surgery. In the general population, considering that about one third of the subjects were colonized with S. aureus nasal level and 1 in 5 in the intestine However the proportion of exclusive intestinal porting is not well known . This study will analyze, among ICU patients, porting S. aureus nasal and rectal level. It will better clarify the relationship between nasal and rectal ports and the risk of developing an infection.</brief_summary>
