	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Carboplatin and Docetaxel in Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether neoadjuvant docetaxel and carboplatin will increase the pCR rate in TNBC compared to historical controls. Pathologic complete response (pCR) will be defined as no residual invasive breast cancer in the breast and ipsilateral axillary lymph node (ypT0-is ypN0).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patients must be 18 years of age or older. All patients must be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Breast cancer must be ERnegative, and HER2 negative according to CAP/ASCO biomarkers testing guidelines. Tumors may be PgR positive with an Allred score of less than 5. Primary breast tumor size at least 2 cm in one dimension by clinical or radiographic exam. Patients who have multicentric breast cancer are eligible if each lesion is ERnegative and HER2negative. In that case, one lesion needs to be identified as the index lesion to be followed for clinical response. The index lesion must also be the lesion from which core biopsies are obtained. Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below: Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,200/mcl Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcl Serum bilirubin ≤ institutional 1.5 times ULN AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 1.5 times ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN Women of childbearing potential (defined as women under the age of 55 with intact ovaries and uterus) must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. They must also have a negative urine pregnancy test within 7 days of starting treatment. Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document and follow study procedures including willingness to undergo study biopsies. Any prior systemic therapy for breast cancer within 5 years. A history of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with known bilateral invasive breast cancer. Patients with contralateral in situ breast carcinoma are eligible. Inflammatory breast cancer. Patients with confirmed stage IV disease. Currently receiving any other investigational agents. A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to docetaxel or carboplatin. Known to be seropositive for HIV, HCV, or HBV. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. If the patient is otherwise not deemed a good study candidate by sole discretion of the principal investigator. Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.</criteria>
