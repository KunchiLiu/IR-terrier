	<detailed_description>They are categorized into three groups: (1) patients who have positive result of culture with equal to or more than three susceptible antibiotics are treated by non-bismuth quadruple therapy (rabeprazole 20 mg q.d.s. and three effective antibiotics), (2) patients who have positive result of culture with one or two susceptible antibiotics are treated by bismuth-containing therapy (rabeprazole 20 mg q.d.s., bismuth subcitrate 120 mg q.d.s. and all the effective antibiotics), and (3) patients who have negative result of culture or whose culture data are unavailable will be treated by (rabeprazole 20 mg q.d.s, amoxicillin 500 mg q.d.s., tetracycline 500 mg q.d.s. and levofloxacin 500 mg o.d.) for 14 days.</detailed_description>
