	<brief_summary>Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside of the uterus.Endometriosis affects 5%-15% of women in the reproductive age. Deep endometriosis is mostly defined as a single endometrial nodule, located in the vesico-uterine fold or close to the distal 20 cm of the large bowel. Current guidelines recommends that laparoscopy with histology should be done to diagnose endometriosis. Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) has been used as a GI tract endoscopy additive tool in recent years, providing in-vivo cellular-level imaging, a concept known as "optical biopsy". considering the rectal bleeding that occurs in patients suffering from bowel endometriosis, usually with a normal mucosa seen at standard endoscopy (personal data), we hypothesized that there might be histological architectural changes in the vessels or the mucosa/sub mucosa in bowel endometriosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside of the uterus, most commonly over the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, recto-sigmoid colon and the uterine myometrium.Endometriosis affects 5%-15% of women in the reproductive age causing pelvic or abdominal pain, infertility and occasionally rectal bleeding (if involving the bowel). Deep endometriosis is mostly defined as a single endometrial nodule, usually larger than 1 cm which is located in the vesico-uterine fold or close to the distal 20 cm of the large bowel. Those lesions usually infiltrate at least 5 mm into the tissue involved. The gold standard of diagnosis is histological proven endometriosis, usually obtained during explorative laparoscopy. Other imaging tests that aid in the diagnosis are trans-vaginal or trans-rectal sonography (TRUS), MRI &amp; CT. Current guidelines recommends that laparoscopy with histology should be done to diagnose endometriosis. Negative (normal) laparoscopy is highly accurate in excluding endometriosis, but a positive laparoscopy (i.e. with macroscopic findings) without biopsy has a limited value. In practice, many clinicians refrain from taking biopsies due-to the risk of bowel surgery, particularly on an un-prepared bowel.
