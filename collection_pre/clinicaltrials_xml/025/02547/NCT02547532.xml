	<brief_summary>In the context of the increasing evidence of the pathogenetic role of microbiome in COPD, our aim is to determine the total and specific bacterial and viral load in sputa from patients with COPD due to AATD and to correlate these findings with cellular, biochemical and immunological characteristics of sputa. These quantitative data obtained from sputum will be analyzed in the context of the clinical and physiological parameters of the patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>diagnosis of COPD and a clinical stable condition, i.e. at least three months from the last AECOPD and/or antibiotic treatment. For patients with AATD this condition will be diagnosed by laboratory tests showing low levels of AAT and genotyping of AATDrelated genes. . The presence of important comorbidities (diabetes, systemic or organ infections, immunodeficiency, tumors, moderatesevere heart failure) will be considered as exclusion criteria.</criteria>
