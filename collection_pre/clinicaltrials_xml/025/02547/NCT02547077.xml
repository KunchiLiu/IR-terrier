	<brief_title>Use of 2-octylcyanoacrylate (Dermabond) Versus 5-0 Fast Absorbing Gut During Cutaneous Wound Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of 2-octylcyanoacrylate during repair of linear cutaneous surgery wounds improves scar cosmesis compared to wound closure with 5-0 fast absorbing gut. The investigators will use a split wound model, where half of the wound is treated with 2-octylcyanoacrylate and the other half is repaired with 5-0 fast absorbing gut. Three-months post-surgery, the scar will be measured via the physician observer scar assessment scale, a validated scar instrument. The scar width, and adverse events will also be recorded.</detailed_description>
