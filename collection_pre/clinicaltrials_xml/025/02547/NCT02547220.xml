	<criteria>1. Be &gt;=18 and &lt;=70 years of age. 2. Weigh &gt;=45 kg with a body mass index (BMI) &lt;35 kg/m^2 at screening. 3. Have HLA DSA identified at the time of diagnosis of AMR. If it is anticipated that the local DSA results will not be available within the screening period, previously obtained local DSA results can be used to assess eligibility, if obtained after kidney transplant and within 30 days prior to the qualifying AMR episode. In any instance, a local DSA test should still be performed at the time of AMR diagnosis. 4. Have a first qualifying episode of AMR in the subject's current renal allograft between 72 hours and 12 months after transplant defined by a renal allograft biopsy demonstrating neutrophil and/or monocyte infiltration in the PTC and/or glomeruli with or without evidence of C4d deposition by immunohistopathology according to 2013 Banff criteria. 5. Have achieved adequate renal function defined as: PreAMR baseline eGFRMDRD &gt;=20 mL/min/1.72m^2 for a qualifying AMR episode occurring &lt;=21 days after transplant or preAMR baseline eGFRMDRD &gt;=30 mL/min/1.72m^2 for a qualifying AMR episode occurring &gt;21 days after transplant. The preAMR baseline is the highest eGFRMDRD value obtained following the kidney transplant and within 30 days prior to the qualifying AMR episode. If more than 1 eGFRMDRD value is available, a mean of the 2 highest values (at least 1 day apart and both prior to the AMR episode) will be used as the preAMR baseline value. If no eGFRMDRD was obtained within 30 days prior to biopsy, it can be evaluated within a 60 day period. 6. Receive first dose of investigational product after 7 days after the kidney transplant procedure and within 7 days after the qualifying renal allograft biopsy procedure that was positive for AMR. 7. Be informed of the nature of the study and provide written informed consent before any studyspecific procedures are performed. 8. If female and of childbearing potential, must have a negative urine pregnancy test confirmed by a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (betaHCG) pregnancy test at the Screening Visit and must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the Day 1 visit. 9. Agree to comply with any applicable contraceptive requirements of the protocol. 1. Have received pediatric en bloc kidney transplant. 2. Have focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type 1,(including C3 glomerulopathy), "dense deposit disease", or thrombotic microangiopathy as the cause of native kidney failure. 3. Have prior or concurrent nonrenal solid organ transplant or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or have more than 2 completed kidney transplant procedures. 4. Have a known neoplastic lesion in the transplanted allograft. 5. Have, any ongoing infection that causes hemodynamic compromise or as determined by the investigator, any surgical or medical condition that could interfere with the administration of investigational product, interpretation of study results, or could compromise patient safety, including (as determined by the transplanting surgeon and documented in the operative report) any major technical complications of the renal artery, renal vein, or ureteral anastomosis. 6. Have ongoing treatment for HCV infection. 7. Have had a recent myocardial infarction (MI) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the past 6 months. 8. Have a history of abnormal bleeding, clotting, or any coagulopathy (excluding a history of clotted hemodialysis access or superficial thrombophlebitis in the absence of medically confirmed coagulopathy). 9. Have a history of allergic reaction to CINRYZE or other blood products. 10. Have had any change in androgen therapy (eg, danazol, oxandrolone, stanozolol, testosterone), tranexamic acid, epsilonaminocaproic acid, or other fibrinolytics within 3 months before the first dose of investigational product. 11. Have participated in the active dosing phase of any other investigational drug study within 30 days prior to dosing with investigational product. 12. Have any of the following local laboratory values prior to dosing with investigational product: Within 24 hours prior to subject dosing, white blood cell (WBC) count &lt;0.5×10^9/L or &gt;20×10^9/L (the value of &gt;20×10^9/L should be excluded if obtained during steroid treatment) Within 72 hours prior to subject dosing platelet count &lt; 25×10^9/L or &gt;600×10^9/L 13. Be pregnant or breastfeeding. 14. Have received any of the following agents within 1 month prior to the first dose of investigational product: Sucrosecontaining IVIg Any C1 INH (plasmaderived [eg, CINRYZE®, Berinert®, Cetor®] or recombinant [eg, Rhucin®]) Eculizumab (Soliris®) Ecallantide (Kalbitor®)</criteria>
