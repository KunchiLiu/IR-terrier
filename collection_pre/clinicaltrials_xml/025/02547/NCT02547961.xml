	<detailed_description>By enrolling patients with advanced HER2 positive breast cancer adapted to enrolled criteria, this study will document for the first time the safety and the short and long term efficacy of HER2-CAR-T cell infusion for advanced HER2 positive breast cancer.The CAR consists of a HER-2 targeting antibody scFv with two intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3 zeta and CD28. Autologous T cells will be gene-engineered with the CAR gene using a retrovirus vector. Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy.</detailed_description>

Patients must have an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group )performance status of 02； 5. Patients must have evidence of adequate bone marrow reserve, hepatic and renal function as evidenced by the following laboratory parameters: Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1500/mm3. Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm3. Hemoglobin greater than 10g/dl (patients may receive transfusions to meet this parameter). Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times upper limits of normal.

Seronegative for active hepatitis B, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody. Patients must be willing to practice birth control during and for four months following treatment.NOTE:women of childbearing age must have evidence of negative pregnancy test. Patients must be willing to sign an informed consent. 1. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (&gt; 160/95), unstable coronary disease evidenced by uncontrolled arrhythmias, unstable angina, decompensated congestive heart failure (&gt; New York Heart Association Class II), or myocardial infarction within 6 months of study will be excluded. 2.Patients with any of the follo wing pulmonary function abnormalities will be excluded: FEV(forced expiratory volume), &lt; 30% predicted; DLCO (diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide) &lt; 30% predicted (postbronchodilator); Oxygen Saturation less than 90% on room air. 3.Patients with severe liver and kidney dysfunction or consciousness disorders will be excluded. 4.Pregnant and/or lactating women will be excluded. 5.Patients with active infections, including HIV, will be excluded, due to unknown effects of the vaccine on lymphoid precursors. 6.Patients with any type of primary immunodeficiencies will be excluded from the study. 7.Patients requiring corticosteroids (other than inhaled) will be excluded. 8.Patients with history of T cell tumors will be excluded. 9.Patients who are participating or participated any other clinical trials in latest 30 days will be excluded.</criteria>
