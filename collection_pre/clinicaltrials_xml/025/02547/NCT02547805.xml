	<brief_title>Evaluate the Effect of ALLN-177 in Reducing Urinary Oxalate in Patients With Secondary Hyperoxaluria and Kidney Stones Over 28 Days</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of ALLN 177 compared with placebo in reducing the urinary excretion of oxalate in subjects with secondary hyperoxaluria and kidney stones. ALLN-177 is an orally administered form of oxalate decarboxylase. The goal of therapy with ALLN-177 is to reduce urinary oxalate excretion by decreasing the absorption of oxalate from the gastrointestinal tract. Eligible subjects will be randomized to 28 days of treatment with ALLN-177 (7,500 units) or placebo three times daily with meals. Urinary oxalate excretion will be assessed by 24-hr urine collections throughout the study. The study allows for approximately 66 subjects. The number of enrolled subjects may be increased to a maximum of 100 following an interim analysis.</detailed_description>
