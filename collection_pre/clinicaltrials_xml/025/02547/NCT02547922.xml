	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, multicentre, multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two intravenous (IV) treatment regimens of anifrolumab versus placebo while taking standard of care (SOC) treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids in adult subjects with active proliferative lupus nephritis (LN).</detailed_description>

Positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test (1:40 or higher) or 2. Elevated antidsDNA antibodies at screening (reported as equivocal or positive results), as per the centrallaboratory; or 3. AntiSmith antibody at screening elevated to above normal (ie, positive or equivocal results) as per the central laboratory 3. Class III (±Class V) or Class IV (±Class V) LN according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) or 2003 ISN/RPS classification based on a renal biopsy obtained within 12 weeks prior to signing the ICF or during the screening period: 4. Urine protein to creatinine ratio &gt;1 gm/gm (113.17 mg/mmol), obtained on a 24hour urine collection at screening 5. Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥35 mL/min/1.73 m2 6. Must not have active or latent TB on either chest radiograph or by Quantiferon gold test 7. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum betahCG test at screening and negative urine pregnancy test prior to the first dose of sponsorprovided MMF. Main 1. Receipt of any investigational product (small molecule or biologic) or commercially available biologic agent within four weeks or 5 half lives prior to signing of the ICF, whichever is greater 2. Pure Class V membranous LN on a renal biopsy obtained within 12 weeks prior to signing ICF or during the screening period 3. Known intolerance to ≤1.0 gm/day of MMF 4. History of dialysis within 12 months prior to signing the ICF or expected need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or renal transplant) within a 6 month period after enrolment 5. Subjects, who at the time of signing the ICF, received any of the following immunosuppressive therapies after their qualifying biopsy (b) Oral corticosteroids &gt;0.5 mg/kg/day for more than 8 weeks or (c) Oral or IV pulse methylprednisolone &gt;3.0 gm (cumulative dose) or (d) IV cyclophosphamide &gt;2 pulses of highdose (≥0.5 gm/m2) or &gt;4 doses of low dose (500 mg every 2 weeks) or (e) Average MMF &gt;2.5 gm/day (&gt;1800 mg/day of entericcoated mycophenolate sodium) for more than 8 weeks or (f) Tacrolimus &gt;4 mg/day for more than 8 weeks 6. Major surgery within 8 weeks before signing the ICF or major surgery planned during the study period 7. History of any nonSLE disease that has required treatment with oral or parenteral corticosteroids for more than a total of 2 weeks within the last 24 weeks prior to signing the ICF 8. Confirmed positive test for hepatitis B or hepatitis C 9. Any severe herpes infection at any time prior to randomization 10. Opportunistic infection requiring hospitalisation or parenteral antimicrobial treatment within 3 years prior to randomization (vaginal, oral and skin candidiasis is not an exclusionreason). 11. History of cancer, apart from: 1. Squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin that has been successfully treated 2. Cervical cancer in situ that has been successfully treated</criteria>
