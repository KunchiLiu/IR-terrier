	<detailed_description>Currently, considerable data on RDN have been obtained from Western populations, while the clinical outcomes of RDN in East Asian populations are seldom reported. Therefore, the purpose was to evaluate 6-month outcomes of RDN for the treatment of resistant hypertension in Chinese patients.In a prospective single-center cohort study, 50 Chinese patients with resistant hypertension would be recruited to undergo RDN by LEPU Renal denervation system, which was similar to Symplicity the Symplicity renal-denervation system (Medtronic). The primary effectiveness endpoint was change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at six months as measured by office-based blood pressure assessment and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring following therapeutic renal denervation compared to baseline. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of Major Adverse Event (MAE) through 6 months , including severe renal artery dissection/stenosis(&gt;60%) that required stenting or surgery, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, death.</detailed_description>
