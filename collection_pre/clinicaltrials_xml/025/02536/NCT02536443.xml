	<detailed_description>The Contemporary Modalities In Treatment of Heart Failure Registry (COMMIT-HF) is a single-center observational study that is underway in the 3rd Chair and Department of Cardiology of Silesian Center for Heart Diseases in Zabrze, Poland. Data collection is patient-based (not event-based). The main objective of the COMMIT-HF Registry is to clarify the overall clinical characteristics of systolic heart failure patients, their demographics and clinical profile, current management, in-hospital outcomes and long-term follow-up, with regard to the administered treatment. The study population is formed by all-comer patients hospitalized in cardiology wards and intensive cardiac care units with a diagnosis of systolic heart failure. For the purpose of this study heart failure is defined as a set of symptoms resulting from myocardial systolic function impairment, confirmed in resting transthoracic echocardiography with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35%. Patients with acute coronary syndromes are excluded from the analysis. Complete patient demographics; medical history, complete hospitalization data (diagnostic and therapeutic) and in-hospital results are collected in an electronic form by the attending physician. The patients are under constant follow-up for all cause mortality and major adverse events.</detailed_description>
