	<brief_summary>This Phase I, open-label, randomized, 3-period crossover study was designed to determine the relative bioavailability of ipatasertib administered as capsule and tablet formulations to healthy volunteers. In addition, the influence of food on ipatasertib exposure will also be determined. Participants will be randomized to one of six treatment sequences to receive three treatments of a single oral administration of ipatasertib in, 1) tablet formulation in the fasted state, 2) capsule formulation in the fasted state or 3) tablet formulation in the fed state. Pharmacokinetics will be assessed, and standard physical and clinical evaluations will be performed throughout the study. Time on study is expected to be 3 weeks.</brief_summary>
