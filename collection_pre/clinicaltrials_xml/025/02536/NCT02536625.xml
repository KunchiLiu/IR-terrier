	<brief_summary>NK (Natural Killer) cells are important in the fight against tumor, especially for the control of cancer metastasis. The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate the impact on lymphocytes NK functions and development of an everolimus treatment in women treated for a metastatic breast cancer. In particular, the study of lymphocytes NK functions and development under everolimus treatment could permit to validate an early biomarker of the impact of everolimus on these NK cells.</brief_summary>
