	<brief_summary>The main aim is to assess the effectiveness of introducing a standardized intervention program for treatment of fracture patients as measured by changes in the fracture rates and the mortality.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A fracture liaison service model of care is widely recommended but data on its effectiveness regarding reduced re-fracture risk and fractures related mortality are scarce. The investigators therefore aim to assess the risk of subsequent non-vertebral fractures and mortality over two years after a nonvertebral fracture in patients who present to hospitals with a standardized intervention program and hospitals without, where patients will undergo standard fracture care. Seven hospitals will be Stepped Wedge Cluster Randomized to a standardized intervention program from 2015 to 2016, with follow-up throughout 2018. The effect of the intervention will be measured by comparing the intervention population with the remaining population by using patient registries. Additional research questions will be answered based on data collected from FLS patients at 6 of 7 hospitals.</detailed_description>
