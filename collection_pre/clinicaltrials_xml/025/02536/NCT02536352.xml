	<brief_title>Effect of Supplementation of Fluoride on Maternal Periodontal Health, Preterm Delivery, and Perinatal Well-Being</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that preterm birth affects nearly 500,000 babies, or 1 in every 8 deliveries in the United States each year. These statistics emphasize the significance of implementing a safe and effective therapy into routine clinical care aimed at reducing the rate of preterm birth. There has been evidence to suggest that fluoride supplementation to women during pregnancy can provide several medical benefits in addition to a reduction in dental caries. Critical among these from a perinatal perspective is a decrease in preterm birth rate, increased birth weight and length, and improved growth and development of the infant. Fluoride is recognized by the Food and Nutrition Board of the American Academy of Sciences and the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) as a nutrient due to its association with the important in reduction of dental caries. The majority of fluoride in foods is bound and not bioavailable, and is most effectively supplied by supplement and by dissolving it in water. Upon entering the mother's body during pregnancy, fluoride is taken up in maternal bones and excreted by the kidneys. Therefore, there is no available fluoride for the fetus during pregnancy. When supplied during pregnancy in small aliquots, as with water fluoridation, the fluoride is so rapidly taken up in the mother's bones and excreted by her kidneys that the fetus is denied a meaningful amount of fluoride unless it is supplied in a pulse dose by supplement. Since 1997, the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board recommends 3 mg/day for Adequate Intake in pregnancy and deems 10 mg/day as the Upper Limit. After several papers elucidating an association between poor dentition, periodontal disease, and preterm birth, subsequent RCT's of regular periodontal scaling and treatment during pregnancy are still inconclusive in regards to preterm birth. The investigators hypothesize that fluoride supplementation during pregnancy may have a beneficial effect on the natural microbiome of the maternal oral cavity and genital tract, capable of protecting against transient bacteremia and ascending infection, respectively, which are known antecedents to both preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes. The investigators predict that the testing and analysis of these specimens will demonstrate microbiome changes toward a more favorable profile not associated with preterm birth. The proposed randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial aims to confirm the efficacy of fluoride supplementation in pregnancy to extend length of gestation and increase overall perinatal well-being, and to confirm transplacental transfer of supplemental fluoride. This research may also identify other beneficial maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with the administration of fluoride during the perinatal period by attempting to characterize and compare the microbiomes of the maternal oral cavity and genital tracts between supplemented and unsupplemented gravidas.</detailed_description>
