	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of IV L-arginine hydrochloride therapy in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and vaso-occlusive pain events (VOE). Specifically, the impact on total opioid use (mg/kg) over the duration of their emergency department (ED) visit and hospital stay will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
