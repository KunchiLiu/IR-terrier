	<brief_summary>This study is looking to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin (LTLD) administered in combination with MR-HIFU in children with relapsed/refractory solid tumors, which may include but are not limited to rhabdomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas, Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, hepatic tumors, and germ cell tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study of Lyso-thermosensitive Liposomal Doxorubicin and MR-HIFU for Pediatric Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is phase 1 trial of LTLD with MR-HIFU induced heating in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory solid tumors. Part A of the trial will be a traditional dose escalation study to determine the pediatric MTD/RP2D of LTLD combined with MR-HIFU ablation which allows for release of doxorubicin in the ablation zone and peri-ablation margins. Part B of the trial will combine LTLD at the MTD/RP2D with MR-HIFU induced mild hyperthermia (MHT) in an expanded cohort.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Part A: ≤21 years of age Part B: ≤ 30 years of age. Histologically confirmed malignant solid tumor. Patient must have at least one tumor located in areas accessible to HIFU, which will be defined as the target lesion(s). Radiographically evaluable or measurable solid tumor target lesion(s). Malignant tumor that is relapsed or refractory and with no other potentially curative treatment options available. Must have completed an appropriate washout period from prior therapy. Karnofsky or Lansky performance level ≥ 50%. Must have appropriate hematologic, hepatic and renal function. Adequate cardiac function with ejection fraction &gt; 50% Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness. Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Target lesions that are pulmonary primary tumors or metastases. Implant or prosthesis or scar tissue within the path of the HIFU beam. Target lesion &lt;1 cm from nerve plexus, spinal canal, and bowel. Lesion in the skull. Inability to undergo MRI and/or contraindication for MRI. Inability to tolerate stationary position during HIFU. Previous history of hypersensitivity to doxorubicin or its liposomal formulations.</criteria>
