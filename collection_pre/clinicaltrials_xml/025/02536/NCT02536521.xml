	<brief_summary>This prospective observational study aimed to identify the intraoperative variables to predict the hemodynamic change according to intra-abdominal pressure in the children undergoing laparoscopic surgery. The intraoperative variables includes Pulse pressure variation (PPV), systolic pressure variation (SPV), stoke volume variation (SVV), Pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform amplitude (â–³POP),and pleth variability index (PVI).</brief_summary>
