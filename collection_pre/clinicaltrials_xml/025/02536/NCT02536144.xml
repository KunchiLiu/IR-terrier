	<brief_title>The Clinical Application of MCCES in Examination of Human Colon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the Western world. The screening tests include flexible sigmoidoscopy, optical colonoscopy (OC), double-contrast barium enema , or CT colonography . Such screening can reduce CRC incidence and mortality but its effectiveness depends on its quality, ease of use, and patient adherence .Colon capsule endoscopy(CCE) is being actively evaluated as an emerging complementary or alternative procedure for evaluation of the colon. magnetic -controlled capsule endoscopy system is a new ingestible colon capsule robot provided by Chongqing Jinshan Science &amp; Technology. While Screening the colon, the capsule is drove by magnetic-manipulator outside the body, which means it can move from the cecum to anus step by step under the control of the doctor. However, there's little data report on this colon capsule robot system in clinical application. The investigators plan to conduct this prospective study to determine the feasibility and safety of magnetic-controlled capsule endoscopy system in examination of human colon under the real time monitoring by colonoscopy.</detailed_description>
