	<brief_summary>This international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase II clinical trial with the primary objective of demonstrating the superiority of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant over placebo plus fulvestrant in prolonging progression free survival (PFS) in post-menopausal women with hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative metastatic or locally relapsed breast cancer whose disease has progressed after prior endocrine therapy (1st or 2nd line).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palbociclib in Molecularly Characterized ER-positive/HER2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on the efficacy data for palbociclib in both the preclinical and the clinical setting, it is hypothesized that the addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant will result in prolongation of PFS for women with ER positive, HER2 negative, endocrine pretreated, metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer, as compared to the PFS achieved by placebo plus fulvestrant. The trial is included in the AURORA program conducted by the Breast International Group (BIG), an international study aiming to collect and characterize biological samples, including metastatic tissue, from patients with advanced breast cancer. Detailed molecular information will be available to identify putative biomarkers of response to study regimens. The trial will provide an important addition to the current knowledge on predictive biomarkers to palbociclib by providing extensive molecular characterization of the metastatic disease and of circulating biomarkers that might be better suited for retrospective biologic correlative studies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female gender Age ≥ 18 years Postmenopausal, defined as women with: Prior bilateral surgical oophorectomy; or Amenorrhea and age ≥ 60 years; or Age &lt; 60 years and amenorrhea for 12 or more consecutive months in the absence of alternative pathological or physiological cause and FSH and serum estradiol levels within the laboratory's reference ranges for postmenopausal women. Endocrine resistant disease, defined as one of: Relapse while on adjuvant endocrine therapy; Relapse within 12 months after completion of adjuvant endocrine therapy; Progression of disease under first line endocrine therapy for metastatic and/or locoregionally advanced breast cancer. Successful enrollment in the AURORA program of BIG. ER positive tumor, as assessed by AURORA central laboratory. HER2negative tumor, as assessed by AURORA central laboratory. ECOG Performance Status 01. Measurable or nonmeasurable but evaluable disease according to RECIST 1.1. Written Informed Consent (IC) for screening procedures. The patient has been informed of and agrees to data transfer and handling, in accordance with national data protection guidelines. Life expectancy &gt;3 months. Hematological status: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L Platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Hepatic status: Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN). AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 × ULN; if the patient has liver metastases, ALT and AST must be ≤ 5 × ULN. Glucose in normal range, or wellcontrolled diabetes defined as an HbA1c level ≤ 7.5%. Renal status: Creatinine ≤ 1.5 ×ULN or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min. International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 × ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulant. Ability to swallow oral medication. Prior use of fulvestrant or any CDK inhibitor. Prior chemotherapy for metastatic or locally relapsed disease. Previous or current nonbreast malignancies within the last 5 years, with the exception of in situ carcinoma of the cervix, and adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Known active uncontrolled or symptomatic CNS metastases, carcinomatous meningitis or leptomeningeal disease as indicated by clinical symptoms, cerebral edema, and/or progressive growth. Any of the following in the previous 6 months: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina pectoris, ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE grade ≥2, atrial fibrillation of any grade, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA functional classification ≥3), cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack, or symptomatic pulmonary embolism. QTc exceeding 480msec, family or personal history of long or short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome or known history of QTc prolongation, or Torsade de Pointes (TdP). Uncontrolled electrolyte disorders that can reinforce the QTprolonging effect of the drug (e.g., hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomag¬nesemia). Known history of HIV seropositivity. HIV screening is not required at baseline. Uncontrolled diabetes defined as HbA1c level &gt; 7.5%. Concurrent disease or familial, sociological or geographical condition that would make the patient inappropriate for trial participation or any serious medical disorder that would interfere with the patient's safety. Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prevent the understanding or rendering of Informed Consent. Known abnormalities in coagulation such as bleeding diathesis, or treatment with anticoagulants precluding intramuscular injections of fulvestrant. Treatment with an investigational agent in the 4 weeks before randomization. Concurrent treatment with any of the drugs not permitted Adverse events (except alopecia) from previous systemic cancer therapy, radiotherapy or surgery have not recovered to CTCAE v4.0 grade 1 or resolved prior to randomization.</criteria>
