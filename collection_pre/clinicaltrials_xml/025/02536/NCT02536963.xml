	<brief_summary>Amblyopia ("lazy eye") and strabismus (misaligned eyes) are medical eye conditions that combine as the leading causes of preventable vision loss in children. They are irreversible if not detected and corrected by the age of seven, however half of all cases are missed because the conditions do not always manifest themselves and pediatricians are unable to reliably detect the conditions. The current health care system badly needs an accurate and effective approach toward detecting amblyopia and strabismus in preschool children. The study will be conducted in busy, ethnically and racially diverse primary care sites operated by the Kaiser Permanente system and compare the outcomes of testing with a Pediatric Vision Scanner with outcomes the current standard of care.</brief_summary>
