	<criteria>Established diagnosis of primary femorotibial OA in the target knee for at least 6 months (clinical and radiographic [xray] criteria) Radiographic [xray] disease Stage 2 or 3 in the target knee according to the KellgrenLawrence grading of knee OA Screening pain visual analog scale (VAS) score in the required range for the target knee while on oral symptomatic treatment (if required) at study start Total WOMAC score in the required range for the target knee while on symptomatic oral treatment (if required) at study start Willingness to omit the following for 24 hours prior to all Study Visits, excluding the Screening Visit: 1. Pain medications 2. Medications or supplements for the treatment of OA 3. Participation in a formalized inoffice and/or supervised OA disease program (e.g., a prescribed patient education program, physiotherapy, etc.) Full understanding of the requirements of the study and willingness to comply with all study visits and assessments Women who are pregnant or lactating Women of childbearing potential (i.e., who are not surgically sterile or postmenopausal as defined by no menstrual periods for 12 consecutive months and no other biological or physiological cause for amenorrhea can be identified); males who are sexually active and have a partner who is capable of becoming pregnant, neither of which have had surgery to become sterilized, who are not using an effective method of birth control (e.g., surgicallyimplanted hormonal therapy, intrauterine devices or oral birth control with barrier method) Body mass index (BMI) &gt;40 Partial or complete joint replacement in the target knee Previous exposure to SM04690 Major surgery (e.g., interventional arthroscopy) in the target knee within 12 months prior to any study injection Any planned or elective surgery during the study period Significant and clinically evident misalignment of the target knee, as determined by the Investigator History of malignancy within the last 5 years; however, subjects with prior history of in situ cancer or basal or squamous cell skin cancer are eligible. Subjects with other malignancies are eligible if they have been continuously disease free for at least 5 years prior to any study injection Comorbid conditions that could affect pain assessment of the target knee, including, but not limited to, inflammatory rheumatic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetic neuropathy, pseudogout, gout, and fibromyalgia Participation in a clinical research trial that included the receipt of an investigational product or any experimental therapeutic procedure within 12 weeks prior to any study injection Treatment of the target knee with systemic or intraarticular corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) within 2 months prior to study start Viscosupplementation (e.g., hyaluronic acid) in the target knee within 6 months prior to study start Effusion of the target knee requiring aspiration within 3 months prior to study start Use of electrotherapy or acupuncture for OA within 4 weeks prior to study start Any known active infections, including suspicion of intraarticular infection, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, and/or infections that may compromise the immune system such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Subjects taking prescription medications for OA who have not maintained a stable therapeutic regimen for a minimum of 3 months prior to study start Subjects requiring the chronic use of the following medications: 1. Opioids, both oral (e.g., tramadol) and transdermal (e.g., fentanyl patches) formulations 2. Centrally acting analgesics (e.g., duloxetine) 3. Glucocorticoids (e.g., methylprednisolone) administered by any route, with exception of intranasal and ophthalmic solutions Any chronic condition that has not been well controlled or subjects with a chronic condition who have not maintained a stable therapeutic regimen of a prescription therapy for a minimum of 3 months prior to study start</criteria>
