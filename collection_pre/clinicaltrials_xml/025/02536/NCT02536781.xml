	<brief_title>Efficacy of Anthocyanin Mouthrinse for Oral Anti-inflammation From Orthodontic Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple inflammatory lesions caused from orthodontic treatments are commonly found in these patients and the irritations from the insertion of the orthodontic wire are hard to apply the topical cream or gel. Standard treatment to prevent oral mucosal irritation caused from orthodontic brackets and wires is an orthodontic wax to cover the appliances. However, the covering wax is just a prophylactic measure to protect the mucosal irritation. Thus, the patients still need a specific treatment for their oral inflammatory condition. Developing a product that can treat entire inflammatory areas in oral cavity, promote oral hygiene, and anti-fungal would be beneficial and useful for the orthodontic treatment. Anthocyanins, one of a natural compound from red, blue, purple vegetables, fruits, and flowers, have many beneficial effects including anti-inflammation and the most important effect superior to steroid usage is anti-candidiasis. Interesting in anthocyanins as the natural treatment, has drawn attention due to the benefits in oral inflammation. Previous study on the effect of a topical anthocyanin gel demonstrated positive effect of topical anthocyanins gel against oral inflammation in human subjects at 6 weeks. Unfortunately, anthocyanin is not stable and easily to be degraded. Therefore, stabilized anthocyanin oral formulation needs to be developed and the formulation needs to provide stable and active anthocyanins in suitable oral formula. This study aims to prepare and investigate effects of anthocyanin complex in order to formulate the mouthrinse for anti-inflammation caused by orthodontic treatment. Thus, to prepare and investigate the effects of anthocyanin activities after forming complexation in order to formulate the mouthrinse would be evaluated. In addition, the examination of anti-oral inflammation caused by orthodontic treatment by anthocyanin complex in clinical trial will be conducted.</detailed_description>
