	<brief_summary>The Keystone Heart TriGuard™ HDH is an aortic embolism deflection device intended to reduce the amount of embolic material that may enter the carotid, subclavian, and vertebral arteries during transcatheter heart valve implantation. The objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the TriGuard™ HDH embolic deflection device in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), in comparison with an active control group of patients undergoing unprotected TAVI. Subjects with indications for TAVI and who meet study eligibility criteria will be randomized 2:1 to one of two treatment arms: 1) Intervention: Embolic protection device (TriGuard™) with transcatheter aortic valve implantation or 2) Control: Unprotected transcatheter aortic valve implantation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must meet ALL of the following criteria: General Inclusion Criteria 1. The patient is a male or nonpregnant female ≥18 years of age 2. The patient meets indications for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) 3. The patient is willing to comply with protocolspecified followup evaluations 4. The patient, or legally authorized representative, has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent, approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC). Potential Subjects will be excluded if ANY of the following criteria apply: General Exclusion Criteria 1. Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) via the transaxillary, transsubclavian, or transaortic route 2. Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) via the transapical approach due to friable or mobile atherosclerotic plaque in the aortic arch 3. Patients with a previously implanted prosthetic aortic valve (i.e., planned valveinvalve transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)) 4. Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year following index procedure. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done within 14 days prior to index procedure per site standard test 5. Patients with known diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 72 hours preceding the index procedure (according to definition) or AMI &gt;72 hours preceding the index procedure, in whom Creatine Kinase (CK) and CKMB have not returned to within normal limits at the time of procedure, or patients who are currently experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with newonset AMI, such as nitrateunresponsive prolonged chest pain 6. Patients with a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or patients in whom antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated, patients who will refuse transfusion, or patients with an active peptic ulcer or history of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within the prior 3 months 7. Patients with known mental or physical illness or known history of substance abuse that may cause noncompliance with the protocol, confound the data interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy of less than one year 8. Patients with severe allergy or known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin/bivalirudin, clopidogrel, nitinol, stainless steel alloy, and/or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated 9. Patients with a history of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the prior 6 months 10. Patients with renal failure (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate [eGFR] &lt;30 mL/min, calculated from serum creatinine by the CockcroftGault formula) 11. Patients with hepatic failure (ChildPugh class C) 12. Patients with hypercoagulable states that cannot be corrected by additional periprocedural heparin 13. Patients presenting with cardiogenic shock at the time of the index procedure 14. Patients with severe peripheral arterial, abdominal aortic, or thoracic aortic disease that precludes delivery sheath vascular access 15. Patients in whom the aortic arch, innominate artery ostium, or proximal innominate artery is heavily calcified, severely atheromatous, or severely tortuous 16. Patients with an innominate artery ostium diameter &lt;10 mm or &gt;25 mm 17. Patients with a transverse aortic diameter &gt;43 18. Patients with anatomic irregularities of the innominate artery that could prevent positioning of the TriGuard upper stabilizer and compromise stability of the device 19. Patients with any other condition that would prevent adherence to the TriGuard HDH Instructions for Use 20. Patients with contraindication to cerebral MRI 21. Patients who have a planned treatment with any other investigational device or procedure during the study period 22. Patients planned to undergo any other cardiac surgical or interventional procedure (e.g., concurrent coronary revascularization) during the TAVI procedure or within 10 days prior to the TAVI procedure. NOTE: Diagnostic cardiac catheterization is permitted within 10 day prior to the TAVI procedure</criteria>
