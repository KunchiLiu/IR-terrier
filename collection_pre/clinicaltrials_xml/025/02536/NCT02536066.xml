	<brief_summary>The postprandial blood glucose concentration is an important risk factor for development of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Previous studies have shown that one bout of moderate or light post-meal physical activity effectively blunts the postprandial increase in blood glucose after carbohydrate intake. Pre-meal exercise does not generate such effect. Thus, the effect of exercise on postprandial glycemia depend on the timing of exercise. Even very light physical activity decreases postprandial glycemia when performed in the postprandial period. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether such activity performed each day for 12 weeks would influence blood variables related to glycemic control. METHODS 40 subjects being ethnic Norwegians or of South Asian origin were randomized into an intervention or a control group. They were previously diagnosed as hyperglycemic, or with high risk of type 2 diabetes according to Ramachandran's risc score. Control subjects were told to maintain their usual physical activity patterns during the study period, while the intervention subjects were instructed to undertake a minimum of 30 minutes of daily post-meal physical activity in addition to their usual activity patterns. Venous blood samples were taken before and after the 12 week intervention period. Plasma was analyzed for HbA1c and for fasting and 2hour (OGTT) values of glucose, insulin and c-peptide. The subjects kept a physical activity diary, answered questionnaires and used accelerometers to determine the level of physical activity.</brief_summary>
