Subjects receiving 1 or more of these vaccinations during screening must have at least 2 weeks between the vaccination(s) and the date of randomization at Day 1. Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply Active clinically significant CNS SLE Initiation or change in dose of antimalarial treatment after the screening visit Within 2 weeks prior to Screening or during Screening: use of oral corticosteroids greater than (&gt;) 40 mg daily prednisone equivalent, use of any injectable corticosteroids, or change in dose of corticosteroids Within 2 weeks prior to Screening, initiation or change in dose of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Within 2 months prior to Screening or during Screening: initiation of or change in dose of methotrexate, mycophenolate (mofetil or sodium), or azathioprine Within 2 months prior to Screening or during Screening, use of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, leflunomide, abatacept, antitumor necrosis factor alpha agents, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, or other diseasemodifying, immunosuppressive, or immunomodulatory therapies not otherwise specified in protocol Within 6 months prior to Screening or during Screening: use of cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil Within 12 months prior to screening or during screening: use of rituximab, belimumab, or any other B celldepleting or modulating therapies Within 1 month prior to Screening or during Screening, vaccination with live or liveattenuated virus vaccine. Active clinically significant viral, bacterial or fungal infection, or any serious episode of infection requiring hospitalization within the last 6 months Estimated glomerular filtration rate by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation of less than (&lt;) 60 milliliter per minute per 1.73 square meter (mL/min/1.73 m^2), or recent decline in kidney function, or proteinuria &gt;= 3 gram per day (g/day) (spot urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt;= 3 mg/mg) Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply</criteria>
