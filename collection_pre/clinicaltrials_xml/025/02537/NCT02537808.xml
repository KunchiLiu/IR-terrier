	<brief_title>Non-interventional Study of Lenalidomide / Dexamethasone as First Line Therapy in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The introduction of new drugs that can be differently combined with conventional chemotherapy or low-dose dexamethasone has changed substantially the treatment paradigm for patients with multiple myeloma. A variety of treatment options is now available for elderly patients. To compare the efficacy and safety of continuous lenalidomide in combination with low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) until progression vs. Rd for 18 cycles/72 weeks (Rd18) vs. melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (MPT) for 12 cycles/72 weeks a multicenter, open-label phase III study (MM-020/IFM 07-01, FIRST trial) was performed in transplant ineligible patients. After market approval of lenalidomide for previously untreated transplant-ineligible patients with multiple myeloma, the purpose of the FIRST-NIS is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and quality of life of lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone as first line treatment of multiple myeloma in a real life setting.</detailed_description>
