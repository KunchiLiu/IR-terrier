	<detailed_description>SATURN is a prospective cohort study of patients with moderately-severe to severe spinal cord injury, defined as American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale A and B, who are treated with open-label NeuroAiD for 6 months in addition to standard care and followed for 24 months. Anonymized data will be prospectively collected at baseline and months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 using a secured online system and will include information on demographics, main diagnostics, neurological and functional state, treatment compliance, concomitant therapies, and side effects, if any.</detailed_description>
