	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of changing the amounts of resistant starch, whey protein and sugar on the blood glucose and insulin responses elicited by energy bars. The investigators also compared the glucose and insulin responses to the rates at which the food bars were digested in-vitro (in the test tube). The investigators thought increasing resistant starch and reducing sugar would reduce the glucose and insulin responses, and that adding protein would reduce glucose and increase insulin. The investigators also thought the glucose and insulin responses in people would be related to the rate of digestion of the food bars in-vitro.</brief_summary>
