	<brief_summary>In this proposed study the investigators will combine gemcitabine and cisplatin with talazoparib to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of this combination regimen. After determination of the RP2D patients with lung cancer whose tumors carry molecular alterations in DNA repair pathway genes will be enrolled to an expansion cohort to determine anti-tumor efficacy. Tissue samples of patients with confirmed partial response, complete response, and non-responders will be obtained for whole exome, and transcriptome sequencing to characterize the genetic alterations associated with response to therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor for which no curative standard treatment options exist and for which gemcitabine and cisplatin is a suitable treatment regimen. After the determination of the maximum tolerated dose, an expansion cohort of 20 patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer whose tumors demonstrate variants in DNA repair pathway genes will be enrolled. Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan, as ≥ 20 mm by chest xray, or ≥ 10 mm with calipers by clinical exam. Prior treatment for this disease is allowed if it has been completed at least 2 weeks prior to study enrollment and if all treatmentrelated toxicities are resolved. Prior exposure to a PARP inhibitor is allowed for patients in the dosefinding portion of the study. At least 18 years of age. ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below: Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3.0 x IULN Creatinine ≤ IULN OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal Tissue available for sequencing (either archival tissue or readily accessible tumor for fresh routine biopsy). Able to swallow tablets. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable). A history of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Received any other investigational agent within 2 weeks of starting the first dose on study. Symptomatic brain metastases. Known brain metastases are allowed if asymptomatic and previously treated. Patients must be at least 4 weeks postbrain radiation therapy. A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to cisplatin, gemcitabine, talazoparib, or other agents used in the study. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active coronary artery disease, uncontrolled seizure, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry. Known HIVpositivity.</criteria>
