	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of recurrent caries around the different types of restorative materials (composites, amalgam, ceramics, crowns, etc.) and to better characterize recurrent caries lesions in terms of location and size of the lesions and type, material and age of the restoration.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The data will be collected from patients who are visiting the dental clinic for a check-up. These data will be retrieved in the patient records. In particular the clinical (mouth) exam and the radiographic images ('RX-bite-wings'), which are routinely taken during these check-up consultations, will be used for the evaluation of recurrent caries. Information regarding medical background, oral hygiene, sugar eating habits and possible parafunctional activities will also be gathered from the patient files. In addition, caries risk of the patients will be assessed using commercial kits for analysis of their saliva (Saliva-Check Buffer, GC, Tokyo, Japan) and dental plaque (Tri Plaque ID Gel, GC, Tokyo, Japan), which are a part of the routine care of the patients at the clinic.</detailed_description>
