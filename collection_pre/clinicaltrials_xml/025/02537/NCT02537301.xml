	<brief_summary>Group chat through the platform of mobile social networking provides an easily accessible, real-time and interactive channel for communication. With the help of mobile social app, a group of doctors with similar interests can share valuable cases, important papers and opinions through multiple media types (texts, images, and videos). It remains unknown what activities of Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography(ERCP) doctors on a group-chat platform are. In the beginning of 2013, a chatting group on Wechat (the most popular mobile social app in China), focusing on ERCP, was created. All the doctors who received and finished their ERCP training in Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases were invited to join in the platform. The contents in the chatting group were analyzed. The relationships between the chatting activities of ERCP doctors and the performance of ERCP (such as case volume, cannulation success rate and PEP etc.) were investigated.</brief_summary>
