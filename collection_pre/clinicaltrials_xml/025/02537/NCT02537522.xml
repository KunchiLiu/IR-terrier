	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and receive a fully executed copy of the form. The subject must be no less than 18 and no more than 45 years of age with no presbyopic add. The subject must be willing and able to adhere to the instructions set out in the protocol. The subject must be an adapted soft contact lens wearer in both eyes. The subject must be willing to wear the study contact lenses up to 14 hours/day. The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in the range of 1.00 Diopters (D) to 6.00 D in each eye. The subject must have refractive cylinder less than or equal to 1.00 D in each eye. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 (6/9) or better in each eye. The subject must require a visual correction in both eyes (no monofit or monovision allowed). The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any type). Current 1DAY ACUVUE® TruEye® wearers Anisometropia of 1.00 D or greater Any Ocular or systemic allergies or diseases which might interfere with contact lens wear. Any Systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication which might interfere with contact lens wear. Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal staining, or any other abnormalities of the cornea which would contraindicate contact lens wear. Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) tarsal abnormalities or bulbar injection which might interfere with contact lens wear. Any ocular infection Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact lens wear Pregnancy or lactation Diabetes Infectious diseases (e.g. hepatitis, tuberculosis) or an immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV).
