	<detailed_description>This is a cross-sectional observational study designed to provide real-life data on the current management of dyslipidemia in high cardiovascular risk patients in routine clinical practice. Canadian guidelines recommend a target for LDL-C of ≤2.0 mmol/L (or ≥50% decrease) after treatment initiation in high-risk patients. The recommended first line treatment is statin therapy. Available data clearly indicates that up to 50% of high risk patients do not achieve this important target because of statin inadequacy or intolerance leading to non-adherence. Therefore this program aims to provide further insights into the challenges Canadian physicians face in helping their high risk patients achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C.</detailed_description>
