	<brief_summary>Preoperative midnight NPO is a traditional method for preventing aspiration during general anesthesia. However, recent studies reported that drinking carbohydrate beverage, three hours prior the surgery helps reducing patients starving, uncomfortment, and fatigue without other complication. QOR 40 is developed for evaluating patients' recovery condition regarding physical, psychological, and social aspects. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery(ERAS) is a concept for reducing patients' hospital stay and helping recovery. Studies showed that drinking carbohydrate beverage made better recovery of bowel function and shorter hospital stay in colorectal surgeries. However, the effect of carbohydrate drink for laparoscopic surgery is not yet proved. Therefore, the investigators will show the effect of carbohydrate drinking through this study.</brief_summary>
