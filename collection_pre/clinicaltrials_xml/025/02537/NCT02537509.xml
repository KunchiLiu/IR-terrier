	<brief_title>PRAgmatic Trial in Atopic Dermatitis Testing Long-term Control Effectiveness of New Phototherapy Regimen During Winter Coupled With Oral Vitamin D Supplementation vs. Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The major therapeutic challenge in patient with Atopic Dermatitis is long-term control of disease activity (LTC), for which the current TAT-based pro-active strategy does not meet all the needs. Phototherapy is a good candidate: it is widely used as a second-line treatment in AD with demonstrated efficacy. However, only short-term control has been evaluated; and only 2-3 times a week intensive schedules have been tested and are used in current practice. A novel phototherapy regimen would be required for disease LTC, allowing a trade-off between disease control, UV-induced risks, and patient adherence. Vitamin D supplementation is another good candidate: several studies have shown lower serum levels of vitamin D to be correlated with more severe AD; and three short-term, low-power low-quality, placebo-controlled randomised trials testing vitamin D supplementation yielded conflicting results, leaving its therapeutic efficacy undecided for short-term control, and unknown for LTC.</detailed_description>
