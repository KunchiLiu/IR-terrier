	<brief_summary>The aim of the investigators' study was to evaluate oral and non carbapenem antimicrobial agents which can be used in outpatient for the treatment of non-bacteremic acute pyelonephritis caused by Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase Escherichia coli. This study was conducted to compare the clinical and bacteriological outcomes of patients with non-bacteremic acute pyelonephritis caused by Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase Escherichia coli who were treated with intravenous (IV) carbapenems followed by oral sitafloxacin or IV ertapenem.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A prospective randomized controlled trial of patients with a presumptive diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis caused by Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase-producing pathogen was performed. Carbapenems was initially given to all patients. After day 3, patients were randomized to receive either oral sitafloxacin (100 mg twice daily) or intravenous ertapenem. The regular course of treatment was completed within 10 days.</detailed_description>
