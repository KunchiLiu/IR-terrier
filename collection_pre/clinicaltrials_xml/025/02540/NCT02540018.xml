	<brief_summary>The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the novel Luminor® paclitaxel drug‐eluting balloon (iVascular, S.L.U., Barcelona, Spain) in inhibiting restenosis and in ensuring long‐term patency.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Paclitaxel-coated Luminor® Balloon Catheter Versus Uncoated Balloon Catheter in the Arteria Femoralis Superficialis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational medical device represents the Paclitaxel drug-eluting Luminor®-35 balloon catheter which is based on a proprietary transfertech coating technology. This has been engineered to improve clinical efficacy by optimizing coating properties and device functionalities. This allows a homogeneous and precise Paclitaxel concentration of 3 μg/mm2 on the PTA balloon surface. The balloon dilatation procedure, including deployment to the target lesion and balloon inflation, deflation and retrieval, is performed under fluoroscopic observation. All sites shall have access to an emergency unit to perform also interventions as bypass surgery e.g. in case of failed percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). The patient is positioned on the angiographic table and draped in a sterile fashion. The standard vascular access represents the ipsilateral or contralateral femoral artery in accordance to the target vessel. The endovascular procedure can be performed in a direct antegrade or a cross-over retrograde technique. An introducer sheath will be inserted over a guidewire. 5.000 I.U. heparin is injected i.a. to pre-vent peri-procedural thrombotic events. Alternative peri-procedural anti-coagulation regimens may be applied if justified by individual patient requirements. An endoluminal guidewire passage of the stenotic and occlusive femoro-popliteal lesion is mandatory for study inclusion. A POBA PTA balloon of appropriate balloon diameter and length, and catheter working length is selected according to the characteristics of the target vessel and lesion for the pre-dilation and assessed by angiography (DSA or XA). A ruler has to be adjacent to the target vessel. After pre-dilatation of the target lesion an angiographic assessment will be performed (DSA or XA). A ruler has to be adjacent to the target vessel. Randomization will be performed by envelope pull. The treatment group represents the Lumi-nor® DEB and the control group POBA applying a CE-marked non-drug-eluting PTA balloon catheter. In patients with peripheral artery disease, quantitative vascular angiography (QVA) is essential for the analysis of the degree of the arterial stenosis. For quantitative assessment of stenotic lesions, the residual lumen at the lesion site is compared with the lumen at a reference site. QVA will be assessed by an independent core lab. The assessment during the angioplasty is performed pre- and post-procedure, at 6 months follow-up and any unscheduled procedure if necessary. Follow-up (FU) assessments will occur at pre-discharge, 6 months and 12 months following the study procedure.</detailed_description>
