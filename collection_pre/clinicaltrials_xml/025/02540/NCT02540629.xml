	<brief_title>Implementation of Gold Standard EMS CPR Programs for 2% Improvement in Survival Rates of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in a Metropolitan City</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project aims to implement gold standard emergency medical services (EMS) cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) programs, which will result in increased bystander CPR, reduced EMS response time, and high quality CPR during prehospital resuscitation through a bundled approach including 1) dispatcher-assisted CPR (DA-CPR), 2) multi-tiered response team CPR, and 3) feedback CPR. The DA-CPR program aims to contribute to improved bystander CPR rate and reduced EMS response time interval through rigorous monitoring of cardiac arrest detection at primary call receiving stage as well as increased number of dispatcher-assisted CPR instruction initiation in the target time of 90 seconds. The Team CPR protocol will render synergetic efforts among participating EMS personnel from both basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS) units within the new tiered dispatch system and subsequently deliver uninterrupted CPR to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients before hospital arrival. The feedback CPR monitoring and quality assurance program will contribute to high quality CPR delivered to the patients on the scene as well as during transport.</detailed_description>
