	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Positive Prevention PLUS Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A clustered randomized controlled trial (CRCT) was employed where participating high school sites were randomly assigned either to a treatment group that implemented the Positive Prevention PLUS program or a control group. Students completed a self-administered survey at baseline (prior to program implementation) and a 6 month follow-up survey (post program implementation). Eligible students in the sample included all male and female 9th-grade students from 21 high schools enrolled in mandatory 9th-grade health, science, or physical education classes, to which the district assigns students randomly. Of the 7,042 eligible students, 4,267 received parental consent and were enrolled in the study. Outcome variables include initiation of sexual activity, ever been pregnant, and birth control use.</detailed_description>
