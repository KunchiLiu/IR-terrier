	<brief_summary>The investigators will extract single cells and analyze the molecular composition of single cells as well as bulks using the latest protocols for single cell and bulk genomics analyses including genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses using the latest available protocols. A broad list of such example protocols are listed below. The samples and their molecular characterization (including sequencing &amp; molecular levels) will serve as the basis for development of methods for single cells analysis. The developed methods are aimed at genomic transcriptomic, epigenetic, or proteomics analysis of single cells and share the same structure: the measured feature will be translated to a DNA library which will represent the feature by a dedicated assay. This library alongside with proper mathematical analysis of the sequencing results will be performed in order to conclude the desired feature. The general structure of such protocols is described in our review paper (Single-cell sequencing-based technologies will revolutionize whole-organism science, E. Shapiro, T. Biezuner &amp; S.Linnarsson, Nature Reviews Genetics 14, 618-630, 2013) which is attached to our proposal. In addition, the researchers will use sequencing based methods (existing and future developed) in order to compare single cells and bulks from different tissues and/or different time points from the same donor in order to measure genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic diversity.</brief_summary>
