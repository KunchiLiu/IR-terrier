	<brief_summary>This study will look at how pre-test anxiety levels affect the reproducibility of symptoms during routine urodynamic testing in women. Urodynamics is a test that assesses the function of the lower urinary tract, including the bladder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Do Patient Anxiety Levels Decrease Urodynamic Test Reproducibility?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The results of urodynamic tests often determine treatment for patients, which may include bladder retraining, medication and/or surgery. Thus, it is important for the results of urodynamics to be accurate and representative of the patient's symptoms outside of the clinic. Pre-test anxiety levels in women undergoing urodynamics will be measured using a validated questionnaire HADS (Hospital anxiety and depression scale). The patient, prior to their routine urodynamics test, will fill out this self-administered questionnaire. Reproducibility of patient symptoms will be measured using a non-validated quantitative bladder test assessment. The patient will fill out this self-administered quantitative bladder assessment after their urodynamics test. The pre-test anxiety and symptom reproducibility variables will be correlated against each other to assess whether there is correlation between the two. A Spearman Rho test will be used to assess the strength of the relationship.</detailed_description>
