	<brief_summary>This Phase II study aims to ascertain the effectiveness of HD-tDCS for adjunctive treatment of anomia in chronic aphasia post stroke. Furthermore, it will help explore factors such as alternate outcome measures, subject selection criteria, and benefits of extended treatment duration. These results will be compared to an existing trial using conventional non-targeted tDCS with the same design and outcomes. Patients will be treated with HD-tDCS while performing computerized anomia treatment. The basis behind this method is that language therapy is mediated by cortical areas that are most effectively activated during the training tasks, thus increasing electric stimulation in these areas may improve learning outcomes. To better understand the long term benefits of the adjunctive treatment, patients will be screened again four weeks and six months after study using the same anomia tests. If HD-tDCS shows promising results in increasing the learning outcomes of anomia treatment, a Phase III trial can be considered.</brief_summary>
