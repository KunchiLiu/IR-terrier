	<brief_summary>Stroke is a neurovascular event characterized by impaired blood supply to the brain due to rupture or obstruction of certain cerebral arteries, which often results in hemiparesis and can affect individuals of any age and sex, being prevalent in the elderly population. Among the main treatments available for stroke rehabilitation, most of them demands an appropriate structure and high-qualified personnel. Searching for more affordable treatment options, several studies suggest the use of mental practice with motor imagery as a potential therapeutic tool, since it can be performed at any place or any time the patient wishes, including their own homes. Motor imagery can be defined as the covert cognitive process of imagining a movement of your own body(-part) without actually moving that body(-part). Within this context, the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of mental practice for mobility, gait function and speed and muscle strength of the lower limb in subacute post-stroke hemiparesis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Post-stroke patients will be invited to participate after hospital discharge, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, after acceptance, participants will be randomized (block strategy) into two groups: Control group (Physiotherapy and Cognitive mental exercise) and Intervention group (Physiotherapy and Mental Practice group). At baseline, 4 weeks (end of intervention) and 6 weeks, participants will be evaluated through the following tests: Timed-Up and Go test, 5-Meter Walk Test, TUG-ABS, WHOQOL-Bref, DASS-21 and muscle strength.</detailed_description>
