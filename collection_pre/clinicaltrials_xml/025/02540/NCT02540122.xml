	<criteria>The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and receive a fully executed copy of the form. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical protocol. The subject must be at least 18 and not more than 70 years of age. The subject's refractive cylinder must be &lt; 1.00 Diopters (D) in each eye. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye. The subject must be either a neophyte or a habitual and adapted wearer of soft contact lenses in both eyes. The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any type). The subject must demonstrate adequate mobility and 20/30 vision oculus dexter (OD) and oculus sinister (OS) with the study contact lenses. Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will be discontinued). Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens wear. Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication that may interfere with contact lens wear. Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia. Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laserassisted insitu keratomileusis (LASIK), etc.). Any grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lensrelated corneal inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear. Any ocular infection. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact lens wear. Monovision or multifocal contact lens correction. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14 days prior to study enrollment. History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus. Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or a contagious immunosuppressive disease (e.g., HIV, by self report). Suspicion of or recent history of alcohol or substance abuse. History of serious mental illness. History of seizures. Employee of investigational clinic (e.g., Investigator, Coordinator, Technician)</criteria>
