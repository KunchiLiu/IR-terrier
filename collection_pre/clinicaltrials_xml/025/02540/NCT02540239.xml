	<brief_title>Premedication Simethione Improves Visibility During Bowel Cleansing for Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this randomized controlled study, consecutive outpatients scheduled for elective colonoscopy were randomized into two groups. Group A patients (n = 300) used only 2 L PEG before colonoscopy. Patients in group B (n = 300) were additionally advised to simeticone plus 2 L PEG, The overall quality of colonoscopy cleaning was evaluated using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale by a single endoscopist who was blinded to the intervention. Visibility was blindly assessed for the amount of air bubbles and adenoma detection rate (ADR). Difficulty of procedure, and adverse events were also evaluated.</detailed_description>
