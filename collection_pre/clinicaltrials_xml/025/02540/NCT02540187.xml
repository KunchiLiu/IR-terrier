	<brief_summary>Haemophilia is a rare and serious congenital defect of blood coagulation due to a genetic mutation on a sexual chromosome. It affects quasi-essentially the men and it is responsible for bleeding. There are two types of haemophilia: Haemophilia A, (85 % of cases), due to a factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency and Haemophilia B (15 % of cases) due to factor IX (FIX) deficiency. According to the intensity of the defect, there are three forms of haemophilia: severe (FVIII or FIX lower than 1 %), moderate (factor level between 1 and 5 %), minor (factor level between 5 and 40 %). For a same level of factor VIII or IX, hemorrhagic manifestations are variable from one patient to the other. Moreover, several studies showed that haemophilic B patients bleed less and consume fewer anti-hemophilic concentrate that haemophilic A patients. The main inhibitors of the coagulation are antithrombin, Protein C-Protein S-Thrombomodulin system, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). TFPI is the specific and exclusive inhibitor of tissue factor pathway that is the main way by which plasmatic coagulation starts. TFPI is a potent direct inhibitor of factor Xa and Xa-dependent inhibitor of the VIIa-Tissue Factor (TF) complex. In hemophilic patient, the production of Xa by the amplification pathway being strongly altered because of factor VIII or IX deficiency, thrombin generation (via Xa) comes exclusively from TFPI regulated tissue factor pathway. We can thus say that if haemophilic patients bleed, it is also because of the presence of TFPI that inhibits at the same time Xa and the complex TF-VIIa as soon as factor Xa is generated.</brief_summary>
