	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the activity of Sym004, a recombinant antibody mixture that specifically binds to EGFR, in patients diagnosed with recurrent glioblastoma whose tumor is EGFR amplified. This is a phase 2 study that will accrue a total of 61 patients with WHO grade IV recurrent malignant glioma (glioblastoma or gliosarcoma) in two cohorts to assess the efficacy of Sym004.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study of Sym004 for Adult Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to assess the activity of Sym004, a recombinant antibody mixture that specifically binds to EGFR, in patients diagnosed with recurrent glioblastoma whose tumor is EGFR amplified. The primary objective is to assess the activity of Sym004 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma that are either non bevacizumab failures (Cohort 1) or who have previously failed bevacizumab (Cohort 2), in terms of 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6). Secondary objectives include: 1. Determine the safety of Sym004 in recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) patients; 2. Estimate response rate (RR) within the two cohorts of recurrent GBM patients; 3. Describe overall survival (OS) within the two cohorts of recurrent GBM patients; 4. Describe overall median progress free survival (PFS) within the two cohorts of recurrent GBM patients. This is a phase 2 study that will accrue a total of 61 patients with WHO grade IV recurrent malignant glioma (glioblastoma or gliosarcoma) in two cohorts to assess the efficacy of Sym004. Both cohorts will accrue simultaneously, with 36 subjects in Cohort 1 and 25 subjects in Cohort 2. Sym004 will be dosed at 18 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. A treatment cycle will be 4 weeks. For the primary objective, progression free survival, based upon the Kaplan-Meier estimator, the percentage of patients who are alive and progression-free 6 months after initiation of Sym004 treatment will be estimated. For the secondary objectives, within each cohort, the percentage of patients who experience grade 3, 4, or 5 adverse events that are possibly, probably, and definitely related to protocol treatment will be estimated. Second, within each cohort, radiographic response rate will be estimated as the percentage of treated patients with a complete or partial response. An exact binomial confidence interval will be generated. Interim analyses that focus on the physiologic consequences of Sym004 treatment will be conducted after 19 total patients across both cohorts have been treated with Sym004. The most likely risks include skin reactions, electrolyte imbalance (especially low Mg, Ca, and K), diarrhea, generalized weakness, secondary skin and nail infection, nausea and vomiting, infusion-treated hypersensitivity reaction, and inflammation of mucous membranes.</detailed_description>

Urine dipstick for proteinuria &lt; 2+ unless a 24hour urine protein &lt;1 g of protein is demonstrated; 10. Adequate liver function as indicated by the following: 1. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.6 mg/dL; 2. Aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) ≤ 2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN); 11. Magnesium ≥ 0.9 mg/dL; 12.

If the patient is a sexually active female of child bearing potential whose partner is male, or if the patient is a sexually active male whose partner is a female of child bearing potential, the patient must agree to use appropriate contraceptive measures for the duration of the treatment of the tumor and for 6 months afterwards as stated in the informed consent. Female patients of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 48 hours of starting study treatment; 16.
