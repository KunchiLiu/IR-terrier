	<brief_summary>Physicians in general are at risk for burnout, and this risk is heightened among women, particularly mothers. In a randomized design, central hypotheses in this study are that mothers who attend our 12-week Relational Psychotherapy Mothers Group (RPMG) intervention will show significantly greater decreases in stress, depression, burnout, and associated risk biomarker indices, as compared to comparison controls (who would meet in unstructured gatherings, for an hour a week for 12 weeks). Additionally the investigators hypothesize that the gains would be maintained three months after the intervention is completed.</brief_summary>

Exclusion criteria Participation in this study is open to all Mayo physician mothers with a child under the age of 18 years.
