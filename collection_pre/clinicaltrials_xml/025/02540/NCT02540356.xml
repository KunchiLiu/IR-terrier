	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAX69 monotherapy given either as intraperitoneal (IP) infusion (Single-Route Arm); or as IP infusion after intravenous (IV) infusion (IV+IP) (Double-Route Arm), and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for each Arm separately, in subjects with refractory ovarian cancer and recurrent malignant ascites. In both Arms, the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of BAX69 will be characterized, and pharmacodynamics (PD) markers will be explored in plasma and ascites. Two expansion cohorts will further assess the tolerability of the RP2D and explore clinical signs of efficacy.</brief_summary>
