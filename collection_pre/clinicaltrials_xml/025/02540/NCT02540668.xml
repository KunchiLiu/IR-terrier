	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at how much warfarin gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it when given both with and without AZD3293. Another purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of warfarin therapy to prevent blood clots when given with AZD3293 by measuring international normalized ratio (INR). INR measures the time it takes for blood to clot and compares it to an average. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected. The study will last about 5 weeks from the first dose to follow-up for each participant.</brief_summary>
