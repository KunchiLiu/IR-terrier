	<brief_title>Long Acting Insulin Glargine Titration Web Tool (LTHome) vs Enhanced Usual Therapy of Glargine Titration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INNOVATE is a 12 week, parallel, open-label, randomized, multi-center study evaluating use, safety and effectiveness of a web based tool (LTHome) vs. enhanced usual therapy (EUT) of glargine titration in T2DM patients. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness LTHome versus EUT of glargine titration in people with T2DM patients on basal insulin not meeting local targets or patients requiring basal initiation. Success will be measured by the percentage of subjects reaching Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) guideline targets. The efficacy objective is to demonstrate that the percentage (%) of subjects to reach FPG target by titration of insulin glargine using the LTHome tool with dose adjustment advice is not inferior to the % of subjects to reach FPG target using Enhanced Usual Therapy glargine titration during study participation (LTHome vs. EUT treatments). The secondary objectives of this study are to assess safety, effectiveness, satisfaction and adherence of LTHome use versus Enhanced Usual Therapy glargine titration.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) between 18 and 75 years old (inclusively) with BMI ≤ 45 kg/m2. Signed written informed consent Patients scheduled to: initiate basal insulin treatment or increase their dose of current basal insulin therapy, independently of study participation, because of : • inadequate blood glucose control If on basal therapy at screening, must be using a stable dose of insulin glargine x 1 week prior to randomization Patients with poor blood glucose control defined by: HbA1c level between &gt; 7% at screening AND mean FPG &gt; 7 mmol/l as determined by most recent selfmeasured blood glucose in 3 of 7 days prior to randomization Patients proficient in computer literacy Patient is able and willing to monitor glucose with a home glucose monitor, and consistently record his/her blood glucose and insulin doses in a patient diary/web tool. Any technical/administrative reason that makes it impossible to include the patient in the study, including closing enrollment due to full enrollment Patient who has previously participated in any clinical trial investigating the LTHome algorithm Patient who withdraws consent during screening (starting from signed informed consent form) Use of systemic steroids in the last 90 days Conditions/situations: Patients with short life expectancy (less than 1 year) Type 1 diabetes mellitus Patients with conditions/concomitant diseases making them nonevaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint Clinically significant cardiac disease, retinopathy, hepatic, renal dysfunction or relevant other major diseases as determined by Principal Investigator or designee. Unstable oral antihyperglycemic drugs and/or GlucagonLike Peptide Receptor (GLP1R) Agonists therapy during the 4 week period prior to screening Impossibility to meet specific protocol requirements (e.g. ability to perform blood glucose measurements, manage their own insulin glargine administration or deemed unlikely to safely manage insulin dosage on guidance by their HCP) Patient is a primary relative of the Investigator or any SubInvestigator, research assistant, pharmacist, study coordinator, or other staff or is directly involved in the conduct of the protocol Patients with hypoglycemia unawareness, severe hypoglycemic episode in the last 90 days or hospitalization (for any reason) in the last 30 days Cognitive disorder, dementia or any neurologic disorder, that would affect patient's ability to participate in the study, or patients who have no legal capacity or are under guardianship Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women of childbearing potential not protected by highly effective method(s) of birth control (as defined in the informed consent form and/or in a local protocol addendum) and who are unwilling or unable to be tested for pregnancy. Patients who are using, or need to start using, mealtime (Bolus) insulin during the timeframe of the study. Night shift workers</criteria>
