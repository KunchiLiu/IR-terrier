	<criteria>The following criteria must have been met at the initial start of aflibercept treatment (i.e. start of aflibercept treatment at least 1 year before this study): Subject had primary subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesions secondary to nAMD, including juxtafoveal lesions that affect the fovea, as evidenced by fluorescein angiography/photography (FA/FP) of the study eye within 3 weeks before the initiation of aflibercept treatment. The area of CNV occupied at least 50% of the total lesion within 3 weeks before the initiation of aflibercept treatment. Documented bestcorrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/40 to 20/320 (letter score of 73 to 25) in the study eye at the initiation of treatment. Men and women &gt;= 51 years of age The subject's history of aflibercept treatment meets ALL of the following: Treatment in the study eye was initiated with three monthly (1 week/+2 weeks) doses of 2 mg aflibercept and improvements of visual and anatomic outcomes were observed Following the above initiation phase, the intervals between treatments were between 6 weeks and 12 weeks Any prior or concomitant therapy with an investigational or approved agent to treat neovascular AMD in the study eye other than aflibercept. Total lesion size &gt; 12 disc areas (30.5 mm2, including blood, scars and neovascularization) as assessed by fluorescein angiography (FA) in the study eye Subretinal hemorrhage that was: 1. 50% or more of the total lesion area, or 2. if the blood was under the fovea, and 3. the blood under the fovea was 1 or more disc areas in size in the study eye. Scar or fibrosis making up more than 50% of the total lesion in the study eye. Scar, fibrosis, or atrophy involving the center of the fovea in the study eye. Presence of retinal pigment epithelial tears or rips involving the macula in the study eye. Causes of CNV other than AMD in the study eye.</criteria>
