	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to analyse the on-going coagulation process after aSAH. For investigation the investigators use the rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) which is a point-of-care test using a variety of activators to provide a targeted and a dynamic analysis of coagulation cascade. This is a prospective, observational clinical study done in 16 aSAH patients treated in Tampere University Hospital intensive care unit and 16 control patients (elective craniotomy due to non-ruptured intracranial aneurysm.</brief_summary>
