	<brief_summary>Purpose: The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of a multi-component balance &amp; resistance training [RT] intervention on physical function, balance, &amp; falls in older [≥ 65 y/o] community dwelling heart failure [HF] patients. The study aims: 1] Pilot test multi-component balance activities &amp; RT intervention on primary outcomes. 2] Explore perceptions related to outcomes &amp; the intervention through focus groups. 3] Generate pilot data on adherence. 4] Generate pilot data on feasibility of conducting the BASIC Training intervention. Background/Significance: Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths in this group. Fall risks are even greater for those with HF due to decreased exercise capacity, loss of skeletal muscle &amp; medication side effects. Though RT is effective for improving skeletal muscle, it has only a modest effect on improving balance, which is comprised of peripheral sensory input central integration, &amp; motor output. A multi-component intervention focusing on balance retraining &amp; strengthening the muscles supporting static/dynamic balance &amp; functional mobility is necessary. Methods: Design - Randomized, two-group with wait list control, repeated measures experimental design. Sample/ Setting - 40-50 participants recruited from medical center heart failure clinic; supervised group sessions conducted in center's health &amp; wellness center. Procedures - Participants will be randomized to intervention group or wait list control group. Focus groups pre/post intervention. The intervention will be administered in 1x per week supervised group sessions &amp; 2x a week home sessions. Instruments - 30 Second Sit-to-St&amp;, Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance, Activity Specific Balance Confidence Scale, Timed Up &amp; Go, Dynamic Gait Index. Analysis Plan: Aim 1- independent t-test to compare change scores from baseline to the end of the first 12 week period for the intervention group with the wait list control group. A second analysis will combine data from the delayed intervention period for the wait list control group with that from the first 12 week period for the intervention group to test change. Supplemental analysis, involving only data from intervention group, will test whether change is sustained at 24 weeks. Aim 2 - thematic analysis conducted with focus group data. Aim 3 - adherence assessed by group session attendance &amp; home activities completed. Aim 4 - assess &amp; report logistics of conducting the study. Nursing Relevance/Implications: This pilot study will initiate the process of developing a targeted intervention to induce changes in elderly HF patients to prevent future falls; thus reducing costs, physical &amp; emotional burdens related to falls; &amp; effect a major difference in the quality of life for this population.</brief_summary>
