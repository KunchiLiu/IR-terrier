	<brief_summary>Over the last two decades, considerable progress has been made in the management of myocardial infarction, both in the acute phase and in monitoring beyond the hospital phase. However changing practices in the "real world" and their impact on prognosis in the medium and long term patients admitted to the intensive care unit for acute myocardial infarction are relatively little studied exhaustively. The study of clinical, biological and genetic characteristics of patients and their conditions of care, help to identify patients at risk for increased morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction and could be the basis for the subsequent realization of specific studies on the optimal therapeutic management of the disease according to the different risk profiles.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter observational study, given to 300 prospective medical facilities, including a clinic or intensive care unit entitled to receive emergency acute coronary syndromes. Patients will be recruited consecutively during a period of 2 months. Annual follow-ups will be conducted during 10 years of clinical research technicians of the French Society of Cardiology, mail and / or telephone contact with the municipalities of birth, treating physicians and patients. The ambition of the 2015 Observatory of the French Society of Cardiology is through a photograph "scale" of the practices in France at present, to ensure consistency in the quality of care for hospitalized patients heart attack; the investigation will emphasize the strengths but also the weaknesses of our health care system so that should improve. Finally, the observation of a large population of the real world will give the opportunity to assess the interactions between the different types of treatments used and check their possible synergy or incompatibilities.</detailed_description>
