	<brief_summary>Target controlled infusion with remifentanil is widely used during cardiac surgery, wich is performed using the Minto model. It was derived from patients undergoing general surgery. However, pharmacokinetics of remifentanil can be changed during cardiopulmonary bypass. The investigators tested whether Minto model for target controlled infusion produces constant plasma remifentanil concentration during the cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
