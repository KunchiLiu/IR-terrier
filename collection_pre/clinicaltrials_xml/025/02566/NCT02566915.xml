	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the application of Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP) on Dynamic Hyperinflation, dyspnea and exercise tolerance in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Initially will be collected clinical and anthropometric data of the participants, and they are packaged in self-evaluation form. The evaluation of pulmonary function at rest (spirometry, body plethysmography and lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide) will be rescued from patient charts. When carried out for over six months, will be repeated by the researchers. Patients will conduct incremental CPET of 5-10W / min limited by symptoms (FEV1 &lt;1L - 5W or FEV1&gt; 1L - 10W) (Visit 1). After a period of 2-7 days the CPET will be performed submaximal with 75% of the peak load reached in the incremental CPET (visits 2 and 3). The application of EPAP (10cmH2O) via face mask (Vital RHDSON SignsÂ®, New Jersey, USA) will be randomized with the help of opaque envelopes to be given in one visit. During the visit without EPAP will be maintained using the facial mask applied without resistance. IC serial measurements will be carried out before, during and immediately after the exercise. Participants will be instructed to maintain the use of long-acting bronchodilator as prescribed by the medical assistant usually before the methodological stages of the study.</detailed_description>
