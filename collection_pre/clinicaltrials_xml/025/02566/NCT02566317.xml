	<detailed_description>With traditional approaches to increasing MVPA (moderate to vigorous physical activity) in the workplace being unsustainable due to the requirement of deliberate and dedicated time away from work, this group-randomized trial will test the efficacy of sit-stand workstations on decreasing sitting time and increasing light-intensity physical activity (LPA) in a highly generalizable sample of office worksites using a multi-level intervention with high potential for dissemination.</detailed_description>
