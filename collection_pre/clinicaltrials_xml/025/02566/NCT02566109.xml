	<brief_summary>The overall of this proposal is to test in community hospitals the utility of a 10-min magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan protocol combined with proprietary image analysis algorithms for detecting early cardiovascular (CV) injury during receipt of chemotherapy for breast cancer (BrC) and lymphoma. This technology provides health-care delivery systems with a time-efficient method to identify those at risk of a future CV event so that prevention can be implemented to prolong survival and reduce morbidity in cancer survivors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Community Hospital Identification of High CV Risk Patients During Cancer Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While recent research indicates that conventional MRI, advanced echocardiography (global longitudinal strain and 3D) and serum biomarkers can detect CV injury early after receipt of Chemotherapy, these methods require lengthy and difficult examinations that are not routinely executed in community hospitals where the majority of patients with BrC &amp; lymphoma are treated. Yet, 1-month deteriorations in traditional 45-min MRI measures are known to forecast 6-month subclinical deteriorations in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) that are associated with CV events. At the same time, new observational data indicate therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors/statins administered early during receipt of Chemotherapy may prevent subsequent cardiac dysfunction and CV events. Our MRI fast scanning techniques remedy these community hospital implementation obstacles. In this proposal, the investigators propose to test the utility of these fast scans within an existing funded randomized clinical trial R01HL118740 of generic atorvastatin that is researching methods to prevent cardiotoxicity in patients treated with Chemotherapy for BrC and lymphoma (taking advantage of significant existing clinical trial resources). This study allows us to address our over-arching goal: to determine the optimal implementation (alone or in combination with other tests) of our proprietary MRI processes for forecasting CV injury in patients treated with Chemotherapy in community hospitals through performance of a Phase II comparative effectiveness study within an ongoing clinical trial.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Newly diagnosed Stage IIII breast cancer (including inflammatory and newly diagnosed recurrent breast cancer) or lymphoma with a &gt; 2 year life expectancy Scheduled to receive chemotherapy with an Anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) = or &gt; 21 years of age Prior cancers allowed if no evidence of disease ECOG 0 or 1 Enrollment in NCI Protocol #: WF 98213. Patients must receive Fast MRI and 3D ECHO along with Baseline (98213) MRI prior to first chemotherapy treatment. Patients with ferromagnetic cerebral aneurysm clips or other intraorbital/intracranial metal; pacemakers, defibrillators, functioning neurostimulator devices or other implanted electronic devices. Most breast tissue expanders are not allowed. (If uncertain, inform the MRI tech to confirm eligibility status.) Unable to provide informed consent Symptomatic Claustrophobia Pregnant or breasting feeding. Due to unknown risks and potential harm to the unborn fetus a negative serum pregnancy test within 10 days prior to registration is required in patients with childbearing potential. For this reason patients of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence (not having sex), oral contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), DeProvera, tubal ligation, or vasectomy of the partner (with confirmed negative sperm counts) in a monogamous relationship (same partner). An acceptable, although less reliable method involves the careful use of condoms and spermicidal foam or gel and/or cervical cap or sponge prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately.</criteria>
