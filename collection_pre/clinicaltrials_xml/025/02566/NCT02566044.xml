	<brief_summary>This is a study of multiple doses of inhaled QBW276 in patients with cystic fibrosis on top of standard of care. The study will be divided into 3 Cohorts. Cohorts 1 and 2 are designed to be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm, multiple dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of inhaled QBW276 over 1 week (cohort 1) or 2 weeks (cohort 2) in patients with cystic fibrosis regardless of their genotype. In contrast, cohort 3 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, multiple dose study to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of inhaled QBW276 over 4 weeks in patients with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. The primary rationale for cohort 3 will be to assess efficacy in a high unmet need cystic fibrosis patient population.</brief_summary>
