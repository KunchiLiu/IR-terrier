	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to determine the cause of failure of orthopaedic implants using multi-disciplinary analysis of data from patients who have undergone revision.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis of Specimens From Patients With Orthopaedic Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following tests will then be arranged: - Tribological assessment. The investigators will measure the wear of the explants using: 1) 'out of roundness'; and 2) Coordinate measuring. Semi-quantitative assessment of damage to the explants will also be conducted - Histological assessment. Tissue sent in formalin may determine the biomarker of diagnosis of metal ion synovitis where applicable - Metal ion measurement in body fluids where applicable (in patients with metal implants) - Diamond Light Source (this was approved in the 1st amendment). The tests will involve subjecting formalin fixed tissue to the high energy electron beam of the Diamond Light Source - Destructive testing of the implant is allowed by the patient (after all non-destructive tests have been performed) - Protein analysis of fluid and tissue if provided - Titanium levels from blood samples if provided - Gene expression testing to assess and understand mechanism of inflammation where applicable</detailed_description>
