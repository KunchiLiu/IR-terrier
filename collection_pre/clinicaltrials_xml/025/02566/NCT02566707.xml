	<brief_summary>During the past years the treatment of HIV-1 infection has transformed towards chronic treatment. Patients are being treated with antiretroviral drugs for many years and become older. The risk of developing side-effects due to long term antiretroviral therapy is therefore more and more likely. New alternative once-daily maintenance regimes are needed for those who are extensively pre-treated and experience side-effects or toxicity on standard treatment combinations. A possible once-daily, fully active maintenance regimen is the combination of atazanavir (unboosted), dolutegravir and lamivudine (PRADAII regimen). This combination is expected to be a safe, once-daily maintenance regimen with a favorable side-effect profile. The combination suits patients with intolerance and/or resistance to NRTIs, NNRTIs and ritonavir, who have a suppressed viral load. However, for this new combination the pharmacokinetic profile is unknown and there are no data on short-term and long-term safety and efficacy. This study wille therefore asses the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy in a small number of HIV-1 infected patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIVinfected as documented by positive HIV antibody test and confirmed by Western Blot. Subject is in need for a switch in maintenance regimen due to adverse effects, toxicities, simplification and/or resistance. Subject is at least 18 years of age at the day of screening. Subject is able and willing to sign the Informed Consent Form prior to screening evaluations. HIV1 RNA &lt; 40 copies/mL for at least 6 months on antiretroviral therapy prior to inclusion. Subject has no documented resistance mutations to PIs, INSTIs or lamivudine. Documented history of sensitivity/idiosyncrasy to medicinal products or excipients. Relevant history or current condition that might interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion. Inability to understand the nature and extent of the trial and the procedures required. Pregnant female (as confirmed by an HCG test performed less than 3 weeks before the first dose) or breastfeeding female. Abnormal serum transaminases determined as levels being &gt; 5 times upper limit of normal. Renal failure determined as an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt; 50 ml/min (MDRDbased).
