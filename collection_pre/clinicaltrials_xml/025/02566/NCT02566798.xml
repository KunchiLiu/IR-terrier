	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that affects a growing proportion of the population. There is currently no treatment to halt this process. The aim of the research is in particular to find treatments targeting the molecular origins of osteoarthritis focusing especially on the inflammatory component of the disease. That is why research is looking to the development of preventive treatments like nutraceuticals. This project aims to determine the anti-inflammatory properties of sera of patients who received supplementation of their diet with an extract of grape and olive: the Oléogrape®SEED. Sera and synovial fluid will be collected during visits for hyaluronic acid injections in OA patients. These sera will be tested in vitro in a model of inflamed chondrocytes.</brief_summary>
