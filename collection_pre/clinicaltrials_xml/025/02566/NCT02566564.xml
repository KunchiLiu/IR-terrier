Patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, hepatitis C antibody, or for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), tuberculosis. Patients who had a corticosteroid injection in the knee to be studied within 3 months prior to baseline or are planned to get a corticosteroid injection within 4 weeks following the injection of MTX071. Vaccination within 60 days prior to study medication administration. Systemic immunosuppressant agent within 6 months prior to study medication administration Experimental agent within 30 days or ten halflives, whichever is longer, prior to study medication administration.
