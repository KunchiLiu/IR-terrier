	<brief_title>Effect of Pre-Treatment With Cromolyn or Albuterol on Response to PUL-042 Inhalation Solution (PUL-042)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy subjects (8 per cohort) will be randomized to either pre-treatment or no pre-treatment (4 per group). The initial cohort will receive pre-treatment with cromolyn sodium. Subjects will be followed for 2 weeks for safety and tolerability, undergo a 2 week washout period and then be assigned to the alternative treatment (i.e., subjects who received cromolyn sodium prior to PUL-042 inhalation solution will not receive pretreatment) and then followed for an additional 2 weeks. Subsequent cohort will receive pre-treatment with albuterol sulfate in a like manner.</detailed_description>
