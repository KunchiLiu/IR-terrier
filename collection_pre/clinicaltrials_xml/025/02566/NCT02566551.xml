	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective randomized controlled study is to compare the improvement of symptoms from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and the improvement of QoL, in patients undergoing prostatic artery embolization (PAE) or conventional transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Controlled Randomized Study of PAE vs TURP for BPH Treatment.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this prospective randomized controlled study is to compare the improvement of symptoms from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the improvement of QoL assessed by QoL questionnaire in patients undergoing prostatic artery embolization (PAE) to patients of similar characteristics undergoing conventional transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).</detailed_description>
