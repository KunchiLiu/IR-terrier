	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of Chondron(autologous cultured Chondrocyte) by comparing between Chondron implantation and Microfracture.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>the Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of Chondron Compared With Mircrofracture of Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is an open clinical trial. Among the patients who received autologous cartilage cell graft using CHONDRON (autologous cartilage cells) in the past (investigational group) or microfracture (control group), the subjects who agreed to participate in the trial voluntarily will undergo the screening process that assesses the suitability of the subjects to the clinical trial and participate in the clinical trial. During the clinical trial period, the subjects should follow the instruction of clinician in charge. Hospital visit is total 2 times* regularly. At the visit, to evaluate the efficacy according to the protocol, the subject will be examined by clinicians, MRI test, and X-ray. If the selection time and the visit time are same, hospital visit will be one time*.</detailed_description>
