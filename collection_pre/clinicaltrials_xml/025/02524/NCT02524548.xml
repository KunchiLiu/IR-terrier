	<brief_title>SMS Reminders to Improve Medication Adherence of Aromatase Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective randomised controlled parallel trial of SMS reminder versus standard care to investigate whether SMS reminder improves adherence to oral aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy amongst women with breast cancer at 1-year follow-up. All subjects will be randomised to receive either SMS reminder or standard care in a 1:1 ratio. Balanced permuted block randomisation will be implemented with random varying of block sizes of 4 or 6. The sample size is estimated based on the primary endpoint of medication adherence (as measured via SMAQ) at 1-year. Assuming that the proportion of medication adherence in the intervention and control groups are 80% and 60% respectively, then based on a 5% significance level and a power of 90%, a minimum sample of 240 subjects (i.e. 120 per group) will be required. Further assuming an attrition rate of 10%, the anticipated trial size is 280 overall. The assessment of medication adherence at 1-year (as measured via SMAQ) between the SMS reminder and control groups will be made using chi-square test, with treatment effect quantified using the odds ratio estimate and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Adjustment for potential confounders will be made using the logistic regression where appropriate. Other measures of adherence such as the 1-year medication possession ratio (MPR), proportion of days covered (PDC), and pill count will be compared between treatment arms via the t- test, with adjustment for confounders made via the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The assessment of multiple dependent secondary outcome variables involving estrone, estradiol and androstenedione levels will be made using the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The treatment effect will be quantified based on mean differences in hormone levels between groups and its 95% CI, adjusted for the respective baseline levels. The assessment of knowledge, attitude, behavior, as well as barrier and facilitating factors between the intervention and control groups will be made using chi-square test, with treatment effect quantified based on odds ratio estimate and its 95% CI. Further adjustment for baseline scores and other potential confounders will be made using the logistic regression where appropriate. Additionally, the investigators will compare the 4 different measures of adherence in a separate paper, to determine which of these provide a more meaningful or reliable information in the local context based on sensitivity analysis. All analyses will be performed according to intention-to-treat using STATA, assuming a two-sided test at the 5% level of significance.</detailed_description>
