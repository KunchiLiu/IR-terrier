	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study. MSI-1436 will be administered as a single intravenous infusion twice a week for 3 weeks on a 4-week cycle. Subjects will be enrolled according to a standard Phase I Fibonacci design to receive MSI-1436. Drug infusions will last approximately 2 hours. If a subject has a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at any time during the study, MSI-1436 will be held and either re-started or discontinued in that subject as per the Dose Adjustments and Toxicities Guidelines.</detailed_description>
