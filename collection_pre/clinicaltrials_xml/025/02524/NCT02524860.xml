	<brief_title>Targeted Prostate Biopsy Using a Novel MRI-Ultrasound Fusion Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the Focal-Fusion Bx device at finding clinically relevant prostate cancer. A multiparametric MRI examination will be carried out prior to study enrollment. Probable cancerous regions (regions of interest, ROI) will be identified, and these ROIs will be used as targets during the biopsy. Three prostate sampling methods will be conducted in the same session on all patients. These include: i) Focal-Fusion Bx targeted biopsy ii) Cognitive fusion targeted biopsy and iii) Systematic (untargeted) biopsy. Trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging will be conducted with BK Flex Focus Ultrasound system (Analogic Corporation, Peabody, MA). Primary hypothesis: The technique used to acquire the biopsy samples will impact the proportion of clinically relevant cancers by improving the specificity of detecting clinically significant cancers. It is hypothesized that Focal-Fusion Bx biopsies will diagnose more high risk cancers and fewer low-risk cancers than non-targeted systematic biopsies.</detailed_description>
