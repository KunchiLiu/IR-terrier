	<brief_summary>The main objectives for this study are: 1. To investigate three novel, non-invasive ocular measurements in a cross-sectional study of participants with various neurodegenerative dementias against standard cognitive assessments and brain imaging measures; and 2. To assess the potential utility of ocular assessments for early detection in the pre-dementia, i.e. the so-called Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BEAM: Brain-Eye Amyloid Memory Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses: 1. Retinal correlations with neurodegeneration: a) Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) pattern will differ in subjects in the MCI and early stages of LBD spectrum, AD, and VCI, relative to normal elders. i) RNFL thinning around the optic disc and macular thinning will correlate with hippocampal atrophy and with the cortical thickness signature of MCI and AD. ii) If detected in the other disorders, RNFL thinning will also correlate with this topographical AD pattern of atrophy. iii) Retinal and cortical thinning will correlate with brain amyloid on PET. iv) Selective peripapillary RNFL thinning in the superior and inferior quadrants described in MCI/milder AD cases will correlate with precuneus and lingual gyrus cortical thinning respectively. b) Retinal artery narrowing will correlate with presence of covert lacunar infarcts and retinal venular widening with moderate to severe periventricular white matter hyperintensities. 2. AD-linked Aβ-related pathology will be evident in the ocular lenses in MCI-AD subjects and in other cases associated with brain amyloidosis (i.e. subset of LBD spectrum and VCI), which will be confirmed by amyloid PET imaging. Design: This is a three-year cross-sectional rater-blinded observational study consisting of a 30 month enrolment period followed by up to six months of data cleaning and analysis. Three hundred and twenty (320) subjects with normal cognition, MCI, AD, LBD spectrum, and subcortical VCI will be recruited from the five memory clinic partners of the Toronto Dementia Research Alliance (TDRA) and the University of Toronto movement disorder and stroke prevention clinics. All patients involved in the study will undergo SD-OCT and FLES ocular assessments, eye tracking, gait and balance assessments, blood draw for genomics and fluid biomarkers, neuropsychological assessment, brain MRI and brain amyloid PET. A subset will undergo SV-OCT. Study Procedures Overview The study procedures are listed below in the recommended order of assessment but may be performed in any sequence (with specific exceptions as described). Multiple assessments may be performed on the same day for participant convenience. All of the study procedures should be completed within 3 months of screening, with the exception of the FLES, which may be completed within 6 months of screening if necessary. Screening Visit. Consent. The study will be explained and written informed consent for participation will be obtained from the patient or his/her substitute decision maker and the participant's study partner (if applicable). Screening. The general and disease-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed. The LEAP-Q questionnaire will be administered to assess language history and English proficiency. If the MMSE and/or MoCA has not been administered within the past three months, it will be administered at the screening visit. Information on the patient's concomitant medications, medical, surgical, and ophthalmological history and family health history will be collected, as well as information on both the patient's and the study partner's demographics. The patient's corrected near visual acuity will be checked using a handheld pocket size Snellen eye chart. Auditory acuity at various frequencies will be assessed using an audiometer. Fasting blood will be drawn for analysis of HbA1c, CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, urea, lipid profile, glucose, liver function (AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin), homocysteine, B12 and TSH. Blood will also be drawn for genomics and fluid biomarkers. Genomics and Fluid Biomarkers. Blood samples for genetic testing including apoliprotein E4 status, as well as for proteomic, lipidomic and other fluid biomarkers of neurodegeneration and vascular disease, will be collected for each participant. All samples should be taken after a 10 hour fast; if not possible, the participant should have a light meal only. Samples should be collected between 8am and 10am, in order to minimize circadian variations in biomarker levels. Neuropsychological Battery and Questionnaires. A comprehensive neurocognitive battery (three to four hours long, depending on the participant's level of impairment) will be administered in the morning. Where possible, the FLES ointment will be administered in the afternoon of the same visit (see below). In between applications of the ointment, mood, behaviour and functional questionnaires will be administered to participants and their caregivers. If the FLES ointment is not applied, the questionnaires will be administered following the neuropsychological battery. This assessment may take place over several days if necessary, not to exceed two weeks from the start to the end. (Note: In order to assess whether normal control participants meet the inclusion criterion of normal scores on the study neuropsychological battery, these participants must have the cognitive assessment as the first step after screening. If their scores are within normal limits, they will proceed to the rest of the study assessments.) SD-OCT at Kensington Eye Institute. Assessments to meet ocular criteria will include visual acuity, intra-ocular pressure (IOP) measurement and a non-mydriatic fundus camera recording, performed by a certified ophthalmic technician. This will help rule out glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). If no pathologies are found, the patients will undergo SD-OCT to determine retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. FLES Ointment. The FLES ointment will be administered in the afternoon the day before the FLES procedure. It will be administered three times in one of the participant's eyes, with two hour breaks between each application. It may be scheduled for the afternoon following the neuropsychological testing or a different assessment, or independent of any other assessment. FLES at Kensington Eye Institute. This assessment will be scheduled for the morning after the application of the FLES ointment and should be combined with SD-OCT assessment if possible. The measurement session will consist of 5 scans and will take approximately 10 minutes. Neurological Exam. Vital signs will be measured and a neurological examination will be performed. Gait and Balance. Information on aid use and balance will be collected using questionnaires. Participants' leg length, calf circumference, height, and weight will be measured and recorded. Standing balance will be assessed in four conditions using force plates to measure sway. Gait will be assessed in three blocks with the participants wearing hip and ankle accelerometers, and vertical transitions will be assessed using a sit-to-stand procedure with both force plates and accelerometers. These assessments will take up to one hour to complete. Participants who are unable to complete these assessments will be allowed to continue participation in the study. Eye Tracking. Participants will be asked to look at a computer monitor and perform three sets of tasks (pro-saccade, anti-saccade, and dynamic free viewing) while a specialized camera tracks and records their eye movements. Participants who are unable to complete these assessments will be allowed to continue participation in the study. SV-OCT at Sunnybrook. SV-OCT will be done in subsamples with high SVD vs. minimal SVD loads on study MRI or previous clinical MRI or CT. MRI. Participants will undergo a one hour 3T quantitative research MRI protocol including structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state fMRI. Amyloid PET. Participants will undergo a brain amyloid PET scan using 18F-Flutemetamol.</detailed_description>
