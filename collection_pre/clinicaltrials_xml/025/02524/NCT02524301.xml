	<brief_summary>The place of opioid system in anorexia nervosa (AN) physiopathology is still unclear. Conflicting results were published on cerebral spinal fluid or peripheral levels in anorexia nervosa. However, no data have been reported on opioid cerebral activity. Diprenorphine is a ligand with non-selective binding to opiate receptors µ, κ and δ capable to assess the interaction between endogenous opioids and their receptors.</brief_summary>
