	<brief_summary>Cardiological examination is one of the major directions in nuclear medicine for detection of myocardial ischemia in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. In Caen, they constitute 20% of the activity of nuclear medicine. It is evaluating a new versatile innovative technology (IQ-SPECT) for performing rapid nuclear cardiological examinations (4 minutes) and quality on a SCINTI-CT camera for correcting the mitigation. This technical solution IQ-SPECT was made available to the nuclear medicine department in August 2011. To date, apart from the work on heart ghosts and one publication in abstract form in 2009, no other study have been published. The goal of the study is to study the technical performance of the innovative technology IQ-SPECT during a SCINTI-CT imaging in patients suspected of coronary disease .</brief_summary>
