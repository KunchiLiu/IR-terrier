	<brief_summary>This is an observational prospective study. Patients diagnosed with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stage IC or higher) since 2008 will be asked to participate in this study by signing an informed consent. Tumour samples will be reviewed to confirm the diagnosis and to select the best regions for tissue sampling to perform the following molecular studies: array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization and Next Generation Sequencing. Detected mutations will be analysed by Sanger sequencing. FISH probes will be designed and tested on the samples.</brief_summary>
