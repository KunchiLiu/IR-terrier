	<brief_title>Effect Evaluation of Independent Medical Evaluation (IME) in Norway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized controlled trial in a Norwegian context, involving an effect evaluation, a cost-benefit evaluation and a qualitative evaluation. Independent medical evaluation (IME) will be compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Independent medical evaluation (IME) will comprise a consultation with an independent general practitioner (IME GP) who will assess whether the sick listed worker has been given eligible and available opportunities in return to work follow-up in Norway. The independent medical evaluation general practitioner (IME GP) will write a short report that is sent to the treating general practitioner as input from a colleague. The report can be used in the follow-up of the sick listed participant. The participants in the treatment as usual (TAU) group will not receive any other follow-up than normal follow-up by the treating general practitioner. The qualitative evaluation will be conducted to gain insight into the experiences of the general practitioners and the participants.</detailed_description>
