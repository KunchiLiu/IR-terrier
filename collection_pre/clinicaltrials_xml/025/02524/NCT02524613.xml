	<brief_summary>Bone marrow biopsy is a frequently performed procedure to diagnose and evaluate hematologic diseases. It is estimated that over 700,000 bone marrow procedures (BMP's) are performed annually in the U.S. Most of them are performed by practicing hematologists/oncologists in their offices or hospitals. However, a significant number are performed by hematologists-in-training (H-I-T's) in teaching hospitals. However, the incidences of complications associated with bone marrow biopsy are largely unknown. This study has two goals: 1. The first goal is to objectively determine by CT and clinical assessment, the actual risk to patients of the bone marrow biopsy and the rate of pelvic injury in an unselected group of hematology patients requiring a bone marrow biopsy, as performed by hematologist-in-training. 2. The second goal is to determine the quality of bone marrow biopsies obtained, using the lateral angulation technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Bone Marrow Biopsy Safety and Efficacy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Subjects must have a hematological or oncological condition which requires a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy procedure, and no alternative procedures are available for diagnosis, staging, monitoring or follow up of their disease. 2. Subjects must be able to understand the risks/benefits and provide written informed consent to participate in the study, and be willing to participate in all required study activities for the duration of the study. 3. Subjects must be 40 years of age or older. 1. Patients unable to give consent because they are decisionally impaired or have a language barrier that cannot be overcome. 2. Psychiatric or cognitive illness or recreational drug/alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator would effect subject safety and/or compliance. 3. Patients with uncontrolled bleeding disorders. 4. Pregnant and lactating females (due to radiation exposure during the CT scans).</criteria>
