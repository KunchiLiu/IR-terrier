	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the mechanisms of chronotropic incompetence (inability to increase heart rate with exercise) in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The investigators will test both central command regulation and cardiac beta-receptor sensitivity over control of heart rate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronotropic Incompetence in Patients With HFpEF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About half of all elderly patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure have apparently normal systolic function, so called "heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction" or HFpEF. To date, no effective therapy for HFpEF has been found, in part because of failure to discern key pathophysiologic pathways. Although HFpEF is a complex disease with multiple pathophysiologic pathways leading to the phenotype of heart failure, virtually all proposed mechanisms involve some impairment of diastolic function - the inability of the heart to fill adequately at a low enough pressure to avoid congestion which during physical activity or exercise, prevent an increase in heart rate. A number of studies have purported the inability to increase heart rate (chronotropic incompetence) is responsible for the diminished exercise capacity. Alternatively, the investigators hypothesize that the stiff, slowly relaxing heart of patients with HFpEF causes a marked elevation in pulmonary capillary pressure during exercise which leads to premature fatigue prior to achieving maximal heart rate, thus causing apparent "chronotropic incompetence".</detailed_description>
