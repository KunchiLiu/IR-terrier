	<brief_summary>Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a prevalent condition among VA patients, but many current treatment options have limited effectiveness. In addition to chronic pain, people with chronic low back pain experience increased disability, psychological symptoms such as depression, and reduced health-related quality of life. This randomized controlled study will examine the impact of yoga therapy for improving function and decreasing pain in VA patients with chronic low back pain. Although not every VA patient with chronic low back pain will choose to do yoga, it is an inexpensive treatment modality that is increasingly appealing to many VA patients. If yoga is effective, it could become an additional low-cost option that the VA can offer to better serve Veterans with chronic low back pain.</brief_summary>
