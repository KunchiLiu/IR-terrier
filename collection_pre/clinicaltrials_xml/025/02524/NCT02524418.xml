	<brief_summary>This is a prospective evaluation of the clinical utility of the new cholangioscopy platform SpyGlass DS. The aims of this study are to prospectively document the clinical utility and technical aspects of ERCP with cholangioscopy and/or pancreatoscopy in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic-biliary disorders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Utility of ERCP Guided Cholangiopancreatoscopy With the SpyGlass DS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cholangioscopy allows for direct visualization of the bile and pancreatic duct. In 2006, the SpyGlass Direct Visualization System for per-oral cholangiopancreatoscopy was introduced and since then has been shown to provide incremental diagnostic and therapeutic benefits. The main limitations of the original SpyGlass platform are fiber optic visualization system, limited tip angulation, square cut Spy scope tip, and complex multi-component setup. A new generation cholangioscopy platform, SpyGlass DS is currently in clinical use. The new system addresses many of the shortcomings of old platform including digital optics, improved tip angulation, tapered tip and simplified set up. It is unclear at this time whether this technical improvement will translate into better outcomes. Therefore, the investigators want to study the clinical utility of SpyGlass DS by prospectively collecting data on the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing cholangioscopy with Spyglass DS as part of their routine medical care.</detailed_description>
