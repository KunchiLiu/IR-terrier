	<brief_summary>Regardless of age, the quality of hospital care, the confidence that the young can have in the health care team, joining parents are pivotal elements and influence followed. Family support is all the more important as 14% of young people realize a new suicidal act within three months of hospitalization for attempted suicide, and that the essential predictors appear to be the young age and quality of intra-family relationships. The main objective of this study is to determine, through the construction of an instrument to quantify the therapeutic alliance, defined by the characteristics of the mobilization of the entourage and the mutual commitments in the care of nursing teams and the entourage, the role of early therapeutic alliance with the entourage of suicidal youth 13-40 years, whether primosuicidants or repeat offenders, on short and medium term recurrences and early mortality.</brief_summary>
