	<detailed_description>Pain levels were assessed by Puntillo scale (behavioral observation scale) which has ranges; 0-1 "no pain", 2-4 "aching" 5-7 "moderate pain" 8-10 and "severe pain". Patient stress levels were evaluated by: a) scale I.C.U.E.S.S. which evaluated environmental stress during their stay in hospital and takes values; 40-80 "no environmental stress" 81-120 "mild to moderate environmental stress," 121-160 " Moderate to severe environmental stress ", b) three questions of self- experienced feelings (with a score of 0 = None and 10 = Completely) like "How sad you feel right now?" "How stress do you feel right now?" "How optimist do you feel right now about the future?" The data collected in three phases: a) the day of hospitalization, b) the day of surgery, and c) the third postoperative day or before discharge. Depression levels were evaluated with Zung scale (Zung self-rating depression scale), which assesses depression levels with a score 25-49 for "normal level mood," 50-59 for "mild depression", 60-69 for "moderate depression" and 70 + for "severe depression".</detailed_description>
