	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study of the efficacy of UVADEX® (methoxsalen) Sterile Solution in conjunction with THERAKOS® CELLEX® Photopheresis Systems in pediatric patients with steroid-refractory aGvHD. The study is composed of Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up Periods.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>UVADEX® and ECP for the Treatment of Pediatric Patients With Steroid Refractory Acute Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening: After the informed consent/assent form (ICF) is signed, the screening assessments will be performed in a single visit to establish the eligibility of the patient, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as aGvHD grading. Scheduling of the first week of ECP treatments and the arrangements for availability of typed and cross-matched donor packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for transfusion, if required, will be made in advance of patients entering the Treatment Period. Treatment Period: Once eligibility is established, patients will enter the 12-week ECP Treatment Period. The availability of typed and cross-matched donor PRBCs for transfusion during treatment, if needed, should be established prior to the scheduling of ECP treatments. Patients will be allowed to continue standard aGvHD prophylaxis regimens (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil) without the addition of new therapies. Patients will be allowed to discontinue prophylaxis regimens for reasons of toxicity, and will also be allowed to switch to another prophylaxis medication within the same class (e.g., the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus) for reasons of toxicity. All patients enrolled in this trial will have received corticosteroids for the treatment of aGvHD. After entering the treatment period on study, tapering of steroids by total weekly decrements of 12.5% to 25% of the steroid dose at initiation of ECP therapy is permitted after a sustained response of aGvHD has been observed for at least 3 consecutive days, with the suggested goal to decrease the starting steroid dose by at least 50% 4 weeks after initiation of ECP. Follow-Up Period: After completion of the 12-week Treatment Period, patients may continue ECP treatment on commercial product at the Principal Investigator's discretion. Acute GvHD status will be assessed 4 weeks after completion of the Treatment Period. Patient survival will be assessed by passive follow-up (chart review) 26 weeks after initiation of ECP treatment.</detailed_description>
