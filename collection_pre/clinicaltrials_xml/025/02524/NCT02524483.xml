	<brief_summary>Background: Outcomes from the investigators' recent exploratory investigation suggested that a high dosage of challenging physical therapy exercises can result in clinically relevant improvements in the postural balance and walking speed of individuals with MS. Objective: The investigators anticipated that the promising results were due to the novel challenging postural balance and mobility exercises. The purpose of this investigation was to test this notion by evaluating the mobility and postural balance improvements that could be achieved in a cohort of individuals with MS who participated in a therapeutic protocol that consisted of activity based exercises, and a cohort of individuals with MS that participated in the challenging physical therapy protocol.</brief_summary>
