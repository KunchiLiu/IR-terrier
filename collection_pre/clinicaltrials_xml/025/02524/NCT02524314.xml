	<criteria>FractureSpecific Inclusion Criteria 1. Radiographconfirmed diagnosis of acute, single isolated fracture of the humerus. AO classification 11A1, 11A2 and 11B1, 11B2 and 12A1,12A2 and 12B1, 12B2 and 13A1,13A2 and 13B1, 13B2. 2. Fracture is closed, Gustilo Type I or IIA. General Inclusion Criteria 3. Skeletally mature men and women, 61 years of age or older at time of index injury. 4. Willing and able to understand and sign the informed consent. FractureSpecific Exclusion Criteria 1. Index treatment is greater than 14 days post fracture. 2. Open fractures with severe contamination. 3. Extremely comminuted fractures where insufficient holding power of the balloon on the intramedullary canal is probable. 4. Marked bone loss or bone resorption: patients, who due to a prior delayed union or nonunion of the bones or other illnesses, may not be able to have their fracture adequately reduced prior to placement of the IlluminOssdevice. This could leave bone void spaces that would preclude the device from maintaining alignment of the fractured bone. 5. Previous fracture of affected limb. General Exclusion Criteria 6. Contralateral fracture of the forearm or humerus. 7. Active or incompletely treated infections that could involve the site where the device will be implanted. 8. Distant foci of infections that may spread to the implant site. 9. Uncooperative patients or patients who are incapable of following directions (for example as a consequence of a neurological or psychiatric disorder). 10. Concomitant metabolic disorders that may impair bone formation. 11. Osteomalacia. 12. Allergic to implant materials or dental glue. 13. Vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, or neuromuscular disease. 14. Polytrauma patients. 15. Life expectancy less than one year due to concurrent illness.</criteria>
