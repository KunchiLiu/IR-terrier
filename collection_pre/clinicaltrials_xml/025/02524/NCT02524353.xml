	<brief_summary>Countless studies are performed to quantify the severity of heart disease and its influence on the respiratory system, checking that their heart conditions and the surgical process determine pulmonary complications, one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery . After surgical procedures, there is a reduction of the residual volume (RV), total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC) and functional residual capacity (FRC), leading to the formation of atelectasis, with alterations in the ventilation-perfusion ( V / Q), the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2) and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO 2). Pulmonary function is impaired in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery, due to various factors common to this major surgery that will drive the patient to develop respiratory complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia. Physical therapy plays an important role in the treatment of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, both in the preoperative period and postoperative, in order to prevent or minimize the respiratory complications. Follow-up studies on cardiac rehabilitation quantify the quality of all the activities necessary to ensure to patients with heart disease patients the best physical , mental and social conditions so that consequently they are able , with its effort to regain a normal position in the community and lead a active and productive life over time, therefore, the clinical changes resulting from an extensive cardiac surgery are already highly dedicated described in literature but which daily life factors or rehabilitation interventions that the patient will take in the late postoperative period that really assisted in his complete recovery and inclusion into society they are still not well elucidated , so it is appropriate to carry out this project due to the fact exposed to up. The project to be developed whose main justification clarify issues related to the return or preservation of the individual feature that undergoes extensive cardiac procedure , as well as incidence of mortality after 12 months of the procedure. The current literature does not expressed clearly, possible impacts on functionality and return the daily activities of the individual in the late postoperative period , since such malfunctions in the immediate post operative period are already fully understood.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Follow-up Study of Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Will be held during the period from August to November 2015, quantitative descriptive transversal study with patients in the late postoperative period and who underwent cardiac surgery in a hospital of medium complexity in state of sao paulo , Brazil in the period to one year of the procedure. Patients will be recruited via contact by phone to attend in place with certain pre scheduled time for carrying out assessments relevant to the study. Evaluations shall be performed in hospital in predetermined track, under the sun and accompanied by the examiners. All individuals will be properly oriented and participate in the activities after signing the informed consent (Informed Consent and Informed). Will be held primarily refers to report cards and progress retroactive filled by students physiotherapy course that evaluated the functional condition and respiratory muscle strength of these individuals included in the study at the time of hospital discharge in cardiac surgical post (last year). The purpose of the consultation of these records is to determine the functional clinical characteristics of these individuals soon after surgery to corroborate the results of these same tests in these patients one year after participants' surgery as well being able to quantify the influence of a number of situations that occurred in the lives of these individuals who may modify in any way the current situation both clinical and social thereof. These evaluation sheets are filed at the physiotherapy clinic. After consulting retroactive chips, a full interview will be held with the participant, assessing quality of life through specific scores (SF-36), evaluation of daily living habits, social life, work life, independence, recurrent admissions this the participation period of rehabilitation programs and cease habits like smoking, drinking and physical inactivity. The clinical trials will be conducted: quantification of inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength through the determination of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP.) And maximal expiratory pressure (MEP.) Using the device which measures and submaximal functional testing through the application of Walk Test 6 minutes (TC6`). The patient will be taken to the track to be traveled for the test and hemodynamic data were to be collected at rest, during and after the test are: blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation. The patient should be instructed to walk as fast as you can without running, as recommended by the American ThoracicSociety, on a track of 30 meters, marked every 3 meters, with the turning point. By completing the six minutes, the patient should stop immediately. In this way it will be measured the total distance covered by the patient and again all variables at the time of arrest. The parameters checked during the whole test should be noted , as the distance traveled in meters. At the end of quantification of clinical and epidemiological data, previous history and current data comparison will be made in order to determine the physical and functional characteristics of these patients in monitoring the late postoperative period .</detailed_description>
