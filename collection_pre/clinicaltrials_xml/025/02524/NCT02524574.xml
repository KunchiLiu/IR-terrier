	<brief_summary>In patients with heart failure, the drive to the effort has demonstrated its safety and its interest. Patients with heart failure, endothelium-dependent peripheral vasodilatation is impaired by decreased activity of endothelial NO synthase. The rehabilitation training significantly improves peripheral endothelial function, and this improvement is correlated to the increase in exercise capacity. The impact on coronary endothelial function remains poorly documented, especially in non-ischemic dilated heart disease. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation on the restoration of coronary endothelial function in cardiac failure patient evaluated with Tomography Positron Emission 15O-H2O.</brief_summary>
