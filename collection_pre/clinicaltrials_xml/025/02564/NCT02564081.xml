	<brief_summary>Recent research suggests that the skeletal muscles and the fibrous connective tissue form a body-wide network of myofascial chains. A systematic analysis of dissection studies suggests that fascia links at least a variety of muscles to myofascial chains (Wilke et al. 2015). As fascia can modify its stiffness, strain transmission along these meridians is supposable (Norton-Old et al. 2013). Tensile transmission along myofascial chains might contribute to the proper functioning of the movement system. However, despite solid evidence from in vitro studies, scarce data is available concerning the in vivo behavior of the meridians. The present study is conducted to resolve this research deficit and to elucidate whether stretching of the lower limb muscles increases neck mobility. Healthy subjects (n = 3 x 20) participate in the randomized controlled trial. One group performs three 30 s bouts of static stretching for the gastrocnemius and the hamstrings respectively. A control group remains inactive for the same time. Participants of the third group perform 6x30 s bouts of static stretching of the cervical spine in zhe sagittal plane (flexion only). Pre and post intervention as well as 5 min after the intervention, maximal cervical range of motion (ROM) in flexion/extension, lateral flexion and rotation was assessed using an ultrasonic movement analysis system.</brief_summary>
