	<brief_summary>The current study proposes to investigate the effects of chronic snus use on the blood vessels. Several cardiovascular endpoints are measured using various methods in healthy daily snus users as well as in healthy matched controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Effects of Chronic Snus Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Swedish moist oral snuff known as "snus" has previously been found primarily in Scandinavia. In Sweden approximately 1 in 5 men are habitual users of snus. It is estimated that 3-4% of the female population are regular users. However, the last few years has seen a shift in the global tobacco industry towards finding novel ways of entering the smokeless tobacco (ST) markets. In the United States both Camel and Marlboro brands, among others, have launched an array of ST products similar to Swedish snus. Since its launch in 2007, the US snus market has continued to grow at an exponential rate and now sells approximately 50 million cans a year. Smoking has been studied extensively and been undoubtedly linked to a range of detrimental health effects, including cardiovascular disease. As snus has until recently been available in a limited Scandinavian market, few experimental and epidemiological studies have been performed. A recent meta-analysis found snus to be associated with heart failure and higher risk of fatal myocardial infarctions and stroke. Following myocardial infarction, discontinuation of snus use was associated with a 50% decreased risk of mortality. With new emerging markets worldwide publicizing the product as a discrete and healthier alternative to cigarettes, it has become all the more imperative to study the health effects of this smokeless tobacco. Using well validated methods the investigators intend to study the possible effects of chronic snus use on vascular endothelial function, thrombosis, circulating microparticles in blood and arterial stiffness.</detailed_description>
