	<brief_summary>In human volunteers intranasal administration of oxytocin significantly increases parasympathetic and decreases sympathetic cardiac control. OSA is a very prevalent disease with high cardiovascular risk factors, yet this disease remains very poorly treated. This proposal, based on the current literature and new basic science results detailed above on the role of oxytocin in cardiovascular control, will test if oxytocin administration improves adverse cardiovascular events during the recurrent nocturnal apneas in patients with OSA. This project will lay the groundwork and provide preliminary data to obtain NIH funding to test this important hypotheses more thoroughly and in larger clinical trials. This study will explore if intranasal oxytocin has any positive cardiovascular benefits in patients with sleep apnea.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project will test the following hypothesis: To test this specific aim we will examine the changes in heart rate in a group of patients that have recently been diagnosed with OSA. The following approach will be taken for the two study cohorts listed below: Cohort A: 10 Subjects 1. 10 subjects that have recently undergone a standard "in the sleep-lab" diagnostic polysomnography (per standard of care medical guidelines, and not for research purposes) and have been diagnosed with OSA will be recruited into the research study to assess the beneficial effects of oxytocin treatment. 2. For research: These 10 subjects will undergo another "in the sleep-lab" diagnostic polysomnography that is identical to the one that they had for standard of care to diagnose OSA. This polysomnography that is performed for research will be funded externally by the investigating group. If subjects are female and of child bearing potential, then their birth control method for the duration of the study will be recorded, and a urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to the PSG. 3. Within one hour prior to the research polysomnography the subjects will be given oxytocin (40 International Units, (IU) intranasally. 4. The following 4 outcome measurements will be compared between the two sequential diagnostic polysomnographies (initial without, and second with oxytocin) in the same subjects: i. basal heart rate before sleep (primary outcome) ii. mean changes in heart rate with apneic and hypopneic events (primary outcome) iii. apnea-hypopnea index (secondary outcome) iv. percentage of time spent by the patient with oxygen saturations: &gt; 90%, &gt; 80% but &lt; 90%, and &lt; 80% (secondary outcome) The intranasal oxytocin dose is 40 IU. The drug will be stored in the Investigational Drug Pharmacy according to the vendor's recommendations. Polysomnography (PSG) is a comprehensive recording of the biophysiological changes that occur during sleep. It is usually performed at night, when most people sleep, though some labs can accommodate shift workers and people with circadian rhythm sleep disorders and do the test at other times of the day. The PSG monitors many body functions including brain (EEG), eye movements (EOG), muscle activity or skeletal muscle activation (EMG) and heart rhythm (ECG) during sleep. After the identification of the sleep disorder sleep apnea in the 1970s, respiratory airflow and respiratory effort indicators were added, along with peripheral pulse oximetry. Cohort B: 10 Subjects Once enrollment in Cohort A is complete, then enrollment into Cohort B will begin. 1. 10 Subjects that have recently undergone either a standard "in the sleep-lab" diagnostic polysomnography (per standard of care medical guidelines, and not for research purposes) or an "at home" PSG test and have been diagnosed with OSA will be recruited into the research study where we will assess the beneficial effects of oxytocin treatment. 2. For research: These 10 subjects will undergo an "in the sleep-lab" diagnostic polysomnography that would be identical to the one they had for standard of care medical guidelines if they were diagnosed with OSA "in the sleep-lab". This research polysomnography should be performed within 4 weeks of their OSA diagnosis PSG. This PSG that is being performed for research will be funded externally by the investigating group. If subjects are female and of child bearing potential, then their birth control method for the duration of the study will be recorded, and a urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to the PSG. 3. Subjects will be randomized by the Investigational Drug Services Pharmacy of the MFA to be administered either Oxytocin (40 IU) or placebo within one hour prior to beginning the study polysomnography. a. Both the polysomnography technician, the patient, and all research staff will be blinded to this randomization. The only un-blinded personnel will be the IDS pharmacy staff. 4. Subjects will then return within 4 weeks to have a second research study polysomnography performed by the sleep-lab. This polysomnography that is being performed for research will be funded externally by the investigating group. 5. Subjects will be administered the intervention that they did not received during the first research PSG study within one hour prior to beginning the second polysomnography. Either Oxytocin (40 IU) or placebo. 1. Both the polysomnography technician, the patient, and all research staff will be blinded to this randomization. The only un-blinded personnel will be the IDS pharmacy staff. For example: If at study polysomnography 1 a subject is randomized to receive placebo 1 hour prior to the start of the polysomnography, then at study polysomnography 2 the subject will be administered oxytocin (40 IU) 1 hour prior to the start of the polysomnography. 6. The following 4 outcome measurements will be compared between the two sequential diagnostic PSGs (initial standard of care without oxytocin, and second for research with oxytocin) in the same subjects: i. basal heart rate before sleep (primary outcome) ii. mean changes in heart rate with apneic and hypopneic events (primary outcome) iii. apnea-hypopnea index (secondary outcome) iv. percentage of time spent by the patient with oxygen saturations: &gt; 90%, &gt; 80% but &lt; 90%, and &lt; 80% (secondary outcome) The intranasal oxytocin dose is 40 IU. The drug will be stored in the Investigational Drug Pharmacy according to the vendor's recommendations.

Menopause . can be assumed to have occurred in a woman when there is either: 1. Appropriate medical documentation of prior complete bilateral oophorectomy OR 2.
