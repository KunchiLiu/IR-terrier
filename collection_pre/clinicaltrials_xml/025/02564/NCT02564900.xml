	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, two-part, multiple study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DS-8201a in patients with advanced solid malignant tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of DS-8201a in Subjects With Advanced Solid Malignant Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is one single group of participants in two periods. It is therefore not randomized. The dosage strength will change during the study but all participants will receive the same study drug DS-8201a. So the study is not a true 2 arm study, it is a 2 part study.</detailed_description>
