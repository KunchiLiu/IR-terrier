	<brief_summary>Cyanotic congenital cardiac patients require higher hemoglobin concentrations (red blood cell levels) for optimal oxygen delivery to the body. Prophylactic erythropoietin (EPO) and iron can prevent and/or decrease the amount of blood transfusions needed in this population. We seek to investigate if EPO and iron make a clinically significant difference in the number of transfusions given to these patients and the morbidity associated with it.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erythropoietin to Prevent Unnecessary Transfusions In Patients With Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease - A Prospective Control Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital heart disease occurs in about 1% of all live births. Cyanotic cardiac lesions in particular are at risk for significant mortality and morbidity because of their reduced ability to provide adequate oxygenation to the body and the brain. Many experts believe that to have adequate oxygen carrying capacity that these infants should ideally have a hemoglobin level greater than 13 g/dL. Many of these patients require blood transfusions prior to surgery to provide adequate oxygenation. The cause for this is likely multifactorial including normal neonatal physiology, frequent lab draws, and co-morbidities. Although rare, the morbidity due to transfusions can be devastating to this population including transmitted infections, transfusion reactions, extra hospitalizations, and antigen sensitization that would complicate heart transplant if needed. There are centers in the United States that have developed protocols using erythropoietin to minimize blood product transfusions before and after surgery, also referred to as "bloodless surgery". There have been retrospective studies evaluating the success of these protocols, but there are no randomized controlled prospective studies that the investigators have studying the effects of erythropoietin effects in patients with cyanotic heart disease in regards to transfusion prevention. Congenital cyanotic cardiac patients require higher hemoglobin concentrations for optimal oxygen delivery. Prophylactic erythropoietin can prevent and/or decrease the amount of blood transfusions needed prior to surgery. The researchers seek to investigate if erythropoietin makes a clinically significant difference in the number of transfusions given to these patients and the morbidity associated with it.</detailed_description>
