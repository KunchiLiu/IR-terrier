	<brief_summary>The study is defined in 3 stages of in vitro assays : Phase 1 : Secretion of NETs in response to lung disease and their secretion of factors. This is a transversal study in which we compare : - Producing NETs (DNA and proteases ) by neutrophils purified from sputum and blood of patients - Producing NETs (DNA and proteases ) by purified neutrophils in the blood of patients and blood of control subjects Phase 2: Mechanisms of activation of NETs secretory pathways . This phase will identify receptors (TLR ) involved in the secretion of NETs and analyze the involvement of dependent transduction pathways calcium and PKC . It will be performed on control blood neutrophils. Phase 3: Analysis of cell death ( NETose ) This is a transversal study that will analyze : the mode of cell death of neutrophils purified blood and sputum of patients and control blood neutrophils by flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy .</brief_summary>
