	<brief_summary>Stroke is a frequently occurring and common diseases in nervous system,and most of the survivors will remain disorders of motor,sensory and cognition function.Stem cell transplantation provides a promising approach for rehabilitation. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safy of the transplantation of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with chronic stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation for Chronic Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke is a frequently occurring and common diseases in nervous system,and most of the survivors will remain disorders of motor,sensory and cognition function.It will brought heavy burden to patients themselves,their family and society.Drugs,rehabilitation excise and hyperbaric oxygen will improve functions after acute stroke.However,in the chronic ischemic stroke,there was few methods to improve the functions.In recently research,stem cell will be a new methods to improve the neural function after through differentiate to nervous cells and secrete some neurotrophic factors to repair the damage. In this study, the investigators will assess the safety and feasibility of intracerebral transplantation of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with chronic ischemic stroke. The neurological outcome will be determined after transplantation.</detailed_description>
