	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical implementation of a new percutaneous prosthetic attachment system by determining the resident microbial ecology of the implant exit site and to simultaneously study the systemic and local stomal immune responses. This study will follow 10 patients implanted with percutaneous osseointegrated prosthetics (POPs) for a period of one year. Two state-of-the-art, pre- and post-surgery bacterial monitoring technologies will be used; these procedures are intended to facilitate the early prediction, detection, and treatment of infection, as well as to provide follow-up data that can potentially be used to advantageously manipulate the stomal microbial environment in future clinical trials. Commensal skin bacteria colonize all stomas. Colonization does not necessarily result in infection. Over time, the presence of this skin penetrating foreign object (implant) will cause measurable changes in the bacterial population (microbiota) at and around the POP exit site. It is anticipated that the evolving microbiota, in concert with measurable changes in the local and systemic cytokine responses, will reveal patterns associated with mutualistic-commensal bacteria and/or pathogenic bacteria related to the stages of chronic wound healing. These patterns could be used to determine the presence of a stable uninfected stoma or the progression of a stomal infection. Hopefully, this information will allow timely intervention to prevent infection, i.e. by detecting early stages of infection or discerning common patterns of stable mutualistic-commensal bacterial strains, effective intervention protocols (antibiotics, probiotics or manipulation of the stomal and skin microbiota) may be developed to avoid patient morbidity and assure implant survival.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Percutaneous osseointegrated prosthetic (POP) attachment (i.e., the direct skeletal attachment of artificial limbs) is a rapidly evolving technology. This follows over a decade of successful European trials that largely involved transfemoral amputees. This information together with the translational animal studies have made it possible to commence an Early Feasibility Device Exemption (IDE) Pilot Program under the direction of the FDA. Ten transfemoral amputees, selected from the Veteran and active military populations will receive a novel POP device. The objective of this study is to follow 10 patients implanted with a POP for a period of one year. All stomas are colonized by local skin bacteria; colonization does not necessarily result in infection. Over time, the presence of this skin penetrating foreign object (implant) will cause measurable changes in the bacterial population (microbiota) at and around the PODS exit site. It is anticipated that the evolving microbiota, in concert with measurable changes in the local and systemic cytokine responses, will reveal patterns associated with mutualistic-commensal bacteria and/or pathogenic bacteria related to the stages of chronic wound healing. These patterns could be used to determine the presence of a stable uninfected stoma or the progression of a stomal infection. Hopefully, this information will allow timely intervention to prevent infection, i.e. by detecting early stages of infection or discerning common patterns of stable mutualistic-commensal bacterial strains, effective intervention protocols (antibiotics, probiotics or manipulation of the stomal and skin microbiota) may be developed to avoid patient morbidity and assure implant survival. The study aims will test the following: Aim 1: Determine and characterize the microbiota in the region surrounding the skin/implant interface. Sampling will take place over all stages of wound healing and stomal maturation and will begin with Stage 1 and Stage 2 surgeries, as well as at defined time points, and collection sites (i.e., the stoma, ipsilateral and contralateral thigh skin) for up to one year post surgery. This will be carried-out by using a specific swabbing technique to collect bacterial and fungal DNA and to amplify and sequence bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal 18S rRNA genes. AIM 2: Compare the expression patterns of the local and systemic inflammatory biomarkers over time and determine if there is a correlation with the microbiota pattern to diagnose the state of wound healing at the skin/implant interface and the systemic response to a potentially life-long chronic wound. The measurements of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, found in the stomal exudate (local biomarkers) and blood serum (systemic biomarkers), along with evolving microbiota profiles (Aim #1) will help to better characterize the homeostatic state of the stoma and subsequent optimum wound care therapies. The ability to predict infection and to avoid it without the use of antibiotics would be of great value to future clinical trials. Assuming the success of this feasibility pilot trial, it is anticipated that the trial will be expanded to include 200 patients.</detailed_description>
