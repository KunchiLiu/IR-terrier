	<brief_summary>Pediatric obesity has become a critical health problem worldwide, increasing the premature onset of obesity-related morbidities. This phenomenon has induce an increase in the incidence of serious health complications starting in childhood and adolescence. Lifestyle interventions, including diet and regular physical activity, are the cornerstone of current medical management. Unfortunately, these interventions are often ineffective in providing a meaningful and long-lasting weight loss necessary to change health outcomes. It has been demonstrated that an early intervention in obesity in children and adolescents, inducing weight loss by performing bariatric surgery in carefully selected patients, can dramatically reduce the risk of adulthood obesity and obesity-related diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recent evidence suggest that bariatric surgery can improve metabolic complications and liver involvement in patients affected by morbid obesity.</brief_summary>
