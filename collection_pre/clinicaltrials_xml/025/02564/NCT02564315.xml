	<brief_summary>Relapse after a serious quit attempt occurs in 70-90% of smokers who try to quit smoking. This study utilizes a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design - - an innovative multi-phase approach - - to test post-relapse treatments designed to assist smokers to make a new, successful quit attempt. This study will test Relapse Recovery (RR) treatments that are applied at two stages following relapse: 1) RR Preparation Phase treatments for smokers who relapse after an initial quit attempt, and 2) RR Cessation Phase treatments for relapsed smokers who decide to make a new quit attempt. Smokers motivated to quit smoking will make an initial quit attempt in the Quit Phase (cessation medication + counseling). Participants who relapse will be randomized to one of three RR Preparation Phase treatments (Behavioral [Smoking] Reduction Counseling + the Nicotine Mini-Lozenge; Recycling Counseling that encourages participants to quit again as soon as possible; and Preparation Phase Control). RR Preparation Phase participants (other than controls) who elect to try a new quit attempt will be randomized to one of four RR Cessation Phase treatments based on a 2X2 fully-crossed factorial design testing two factors: Supportive Counseling (vs. Brief Information) and Skill Training (vs. Brief Information). All RR Cessation Phase participants will receive 8 weeks of combination nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine patch + nicotine mini-lozenge). The investigators hypothesize that RR Preparation Phase Reduction treatment will significantly increase long-term abstinence rates relative to the Preparation Phase Control condition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Long-Term Quitting (Smoking Cessation) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to identify effective Relapse Recovery (RR) treatments to assist smokers who relapse after an initial quit attempt. The study will use a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design with three phases. In a SMART design, randomization occurs at more than one stage, with randomization at a later stage based on response to treatment at an earlier stage. The three phases in this SMART study are as follows: 1. Phase 1 consists of the Quit Phase in which all participants (smokers motivated to quit smoking) will be offered evidence-based cessation treatment (cessation medication plus counseling). Participants who relapse will be eligible to proceed to the next phase which involves Relapse Recovery (RR) Preparation treatment. 2. Phase 2 consists of RR Preparation Phase treatments in which relapsed participants from the Quit Phase will be randomized to three arms: (a) Recycling Counseling (where participants are encouraged to quit again as soon as possible); (b) Behavioral Reduction Counseling + Nicotine Mini-Lozenge (which targets smoking reduction and preparation for a new quit attempt); and (c) Preparation Phase Control (continuation of Quit Phase treatment plus advice to seek additional help from the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line or their clinic care provider). 3. Phase 3 consists of RR Cessation Phase treatments in which non-control (i.e. Recycling or Behavioral Reduction) Preparation Phase participants who elect to make a new quit attempt will be randomized to one of four treatment conditions in a 2X2 fully-crossed factorial design: (a) Supportive Counseling + Skill Training; (b) Supportive Counseling + Brief Information; (c) Skill Training + Brief Information; and (d) Brief Information Only. All participants will receive 8 weeks of combination nicotine replacement therapy (Nicotine Patch + Nicotine Mini-Lozenge). Brief Information will consist of generic information about the importance of taking the medication and how to use it, information about side effects/safety and what to do in case of problems, and participants will also be given encouragement. Smoking status will be assessed 14 months after randomization to RR Preparation Phase treatment. The investigators hypothesize that 7-day point point-prevalence abstinence rates will be 15% for the Preparation Phase Control condition, 25% for the Recycling condition, and 35% for the Behavioral Reduction condition. The investigators propose that any increase in abstinence of 15% or higher would be clinically significant. The investigators did not power the study to demonstrate a significant difference between the two active RR Preparation Phase treatments. Therefore, the investigators anticipate that only the RR Behavioral Reduction treatment will significantly increase long-term abstinence rates (primary outcome: Biochemically-confirmed 7-Day Point Prevalence Abstinence at 14 Months post-randomization to Phase 2 Preparation treatment) over those produced by the Preparation Phase Control condition. Because of limitations in statistical power, analyses of RR Cessation Phase treatments will be exploratory only (secondary outcome: Self-Reported 7-Day Point Prevalence Abstinence at 26 Weeks post-randomization to Phase 3 Cessation treatment).</detailed_description>
