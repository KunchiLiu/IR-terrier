	<brief_summary>Exploratory proof of concept study to determine whether intranasal administration of QR-010 in subjects with cystic fibrosis, homozygous or compound heterozygous for the ΔF508 mutation, can increase the function of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Study to Evaluate QR-010 in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis ΔF508 CFTR Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, multi-center, exploratory study to estimate the effect of intranasal administration of QR-010 on the nasal mucosa in the restoration of CFTR function, as measured by nasal potential difference (NPD), in the nasal epithelium of adult subjects with CF who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for the ΔF508 CFTR mutation.</detailed_description>
