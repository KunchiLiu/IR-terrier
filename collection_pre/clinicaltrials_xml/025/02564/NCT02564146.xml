	<brief_summary>ALPACA is an interventional, multicentre, open-label, randomized active-controlled phase II trial with two arms. To estimate the treatment effect on overall survival, feasibility, efficacy and safety of alternating treatment cycles of gemcitabine monotherapy followed by nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine relative to standard continuing nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine cycles in first-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer in patients having received 3 cycles of induction therapy with standard nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Patients with islet cell neoplasms are excluded. Karnofsky Perfomance Status (KPS) ≥ 70% At least one unidimensionally measurable lesion as assessed by CT scan or Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST1.1 ), Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (Upper Limit of Normal). Patients with a biliary stent may be included provided that bilirubin level after stent insertion decreased to ≤ 1.5 x ULN and there is no cholangitis. Adequate renal, hepatic and bone marrow function, defined as Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min according to CKDEPI formula (Chronic kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) AST/GOT and/or ALT/GPT ≤ 2.5 x ULN and ≤ 5.0 x ULN in case of liver metastasis Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Haemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Platelets ≥ 100 x 100 x 10^9/L Females of Childbearing Potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days of the first application of study treatment and they must agree to undergo further pregnancy tests before randomization and at the end of treatment visit and FCBP must either agree to use and be able to take effective contraceptive birth control measures (Pearl Index &lt; 1) or agree to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse during the course of the study and for at least 1 month after last application of study treatment. A female subject is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she is age ≥ 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for ≥ 2 years, or unless she is surgically sterile. Males must agree not to father a child during the course of the trial and for at least 6 months after last administration of study drugs. Signed and dated informed consent before the start of any specific protocol procedures Patient's legal capacity to consent to study participation Missing histological or cytological confirmation of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas Locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma without metastases Any previous radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy or investigational therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease. (Prior adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine or fluoropyrimidine in curative intent is allowed if terminated more than 6 months before first application of study treatment. Previous palliative radiotherapy of bonemetastases for alleviation of pain is permitted provided that irradiated bone metastases are no target lesions.) Known brain metastase/brain metastases. Brain imaging is required in symptomatic patients to rule out brain metastases, but is not required in asymptomatic patients. Preexisting peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 2 according to CTCAE version 4 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) • Medical history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pulmonary fibrosis Patients with high cardiovascular risk, including, but not limited to, recent coronary stenting or myocardial infarction in the past year. Uncontrolled severe illness or medical condition (including uncontrolled diabetes mellitus) Any other severe concomitant disease or disorder, which could influence patient's ability to participate in the study and his/her safety during the study or interfere with interpretation of study results e.g. severe hepatic, renal, pulmonary, metabolic, or psychiatric disorders Previous or concurrent tumor other than underlying tumor disease (pancreatic cancer) with the exception of cervical cancer in situ, adequately treated basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder tumors (Ta, Tis, and T1) or any curatively treated tumors &gt; 5 years prior to enrolment Hypersensitivity against nabpaclitaxel, gemcitabine, or any excipients of these drugs Continuing abuse of alcohol, drugs, or medical drugs Pregnant females, breast feeding females or females of childbearing potential unable to perform adequate contraceptive measures or practice complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse Participation in any other clinical trial or treatment with any experimental drug within 28 days before enrolment to the study or during study participation until the end of treatment visit.</criteria>
