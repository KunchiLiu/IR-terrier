	<brief_summary>The investigators will conduct a 8-week proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial to provide preliminary evidence of efficacy of Fit Brains (Rosetta Stone Canada) training -- a mobile cognitive training program -- on cognitive and brain plasticity in older adults. The investigators will also explore whether Fit Brains training paired with a brief bout of exercise would enhance the potential cognitive benefits of Fit Brains.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Brain Training in Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will look at the effect of FBT on cognitive function in older adults. Additionally, the investigators aim to explore whether a single bout of aerobic exercise prior to Fit Brains training would magnify the training effect on both cognitive and brain outcomes. Objectives: 1) To compare the effect of Fit Brains training (FBT) and the effect of a single bout of aerobic exercise prior to FBT (Ex-FBT) with a Balanced And Tone (BAT; control) program on cognitive performance in both older adults; 2) To explore the effect of FBT and Ex-FBT with BAT on brain structure and function i; 3) To explore whether the intervention effects (i.e., FBT and Ex-FBT) are moderated by cognitive status (i.e., MCI or not); and 4) To explore whether Ex-FBT has additional benefits compared with FBT. Research Method: The investigators will conduct an 8-week proof-of-concept, assessor single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 75 older adults (i.e., 25 in each experimental group). A subset of participants will perform MRI scans at baseline and 8-weeks. To reduce bias, all assessors will be blinded to group allocation of participants. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups (i.e., FBT, Ex-FBT, or SCT). Participants in the FBT group will be required to attend 3 formal training sessions per week, for 8 weeks, at the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health. Each session will be for 60 minutes. Additionally, the participants will be asked to complete 3 additional one-hour training sessions at home per week. Thus, the participants will complete a total of 48 hours of cognitive training over 8 weeks. Participants who are randomized to Ex-FBT will be required to attend 3 formal training sessions per week, for 8 weeks, at the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health. Each session will be for 1 hour. The participants will start the training with a 15-minute walk outside. The 15-minute walk is followed by a 45-minute FBT session (FBT program). Additionally, participants will be asked to complete 3 additional 1-hour training sessions at home (i.e., 15-minute walk followed by 45-minutes of FBT training). Thus, the participants will complete a total of 48 hours of cognitive + walking training over 8 weeks. Participants who are randomly assigned to the BAT group will be required to attend 3 formal training sessions per week, for 8 weeks, at both the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health and the Centre for Hip Health and Mobility. Specifically, the participants will complete a total of 8 hours of sham cognitive training, 8 hours of sham exercise training (Centre for Hip Health and Mobility) and 8 hours of education over the 8 weeks. Thus, the participants will complete a total of 24 hours of sham training over 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
