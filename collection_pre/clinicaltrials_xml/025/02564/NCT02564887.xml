	<brief_summary>Patients with head and neck cancer treated with chemoradiation, often develop a treatment associated dysphagia. The common complaint is foods sticking in the pharynx. This study seeks to test the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI) in the management of treatment induced dysphagia following chemoradiation for oral, pharyngeal, laryngeal, hypopharyngeal cancer. This pilot study seeks to compare standard exercise therapy plus IOPI to standard exercise alone to determine if recovery is enhanced and to determine if rate of recovery is accelerated.</brief_summary>
