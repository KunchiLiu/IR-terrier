	<brief_title>MRI-Based Active Surveillance to Avoid the Risks of Serial Biopsies in Men With Low-Risk Prostate Ca</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an unblinded, randomized trial of TRUS biopsy-based active surveillance versus mpMRI-based active surveillance. Patients on the TRUS biopsy-based arm will undergo annual systematic biopsies without any MRI staging or guidance. Patients on the mpMRI- based arm will undergo annual mpMRI surveillance imaging, with image-guided targeted biopsies only as indicated by radiographic findings.</detailed_description>
