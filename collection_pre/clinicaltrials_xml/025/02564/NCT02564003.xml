	<brief_summary>The pharmacokinetics of oxycodone is well characterized in children older than six months of age. However, only one study has been published with children younger than six months, concluding that unexplained inter-individual variability is pronounced in the youngest children. The aim of the current study was to quantify oxycodone pharmacokinetics in children ranging from preterm newborn infants to children up to two years of age.</brief_summary>
