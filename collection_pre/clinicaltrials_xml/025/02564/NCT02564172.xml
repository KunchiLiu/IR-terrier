	<brief_summary>Pudendal neuralgia is a frequent diagnosis in pain clinics. This perineal pain has devastating effects on patient's quality of life. Today, 30% of patients are refractory to pain management and surgical procedure. The neuropathic characteristics of the pain in these patients lead us to test the efficiency of spinal cord stimulation at conus medullaris level. In our published preliminary study involving 27 patients with refractory pudendal neuralgia, we demonstrated that 74% of patients implanted with stimulation electrodes at the conus medullaris responded to stimulation. The primary objective of the present trial is to assess through a randomized, parallel group design, the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation at the conus medullaris using pentapolar surgical lead ((TM)Penta, St Jude medical ANS) versus medical treatment alone on sitting time in refractory pudendal neuralgia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conus Medullaris Stimulation With 5 Columns Lead Versus Medical Treatment in Refractory Pudendal Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this national multicenter prospective open label trial, patients will be randomized 1:1 to experimental group (CMS group : Conus Medullaris Stimulation using pentapolar surgical lead, plus optimal medical management) or to control group (OMM group : optimal medical management alone) and followed for 12 months, in intention to treat. 42 patients suffering of refractory pudendal neuralgia will be included. Optimal medical management will be prescribed by algologists in both groups according to patient pain relief.</detailed_description>
