	<brief_summary>Often the less experienced as medical students are charged with the role as camera navigator and assistant during laparoscopic surgery. Camera navigation is generally considered an easy skill, but it requires specific psychomotor and visuospatial skills. Simulation-based training can improve surgical skills, but little is known on how to optimally structure a training program to acquire camera navigation skills. The objective of this trial is to examine if simulation-based laparoscopic camera navigation skills transfer to the operating room after practicing one of two fundamentally different laparoscopic tasks on a simulator. The first group practice a procedure on a virtual reality simulator, the second group practice camera navigation on a virtual reality simulator and the third group receive no training. All participants are tested as camera navigators and assistants during a procedure in the operating room.</brief_summary>
