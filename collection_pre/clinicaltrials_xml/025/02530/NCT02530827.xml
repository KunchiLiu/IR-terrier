	<brief_summary>Background: Several studies have reported increased resting energy expenditure (REE) in people living with HIV/AIDS possibly due to changes in body composition that occurs in HIV lipodystrophy syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the use of lipid-lowering drugs in resting energy expenditure (REE) and total energy expenditure (TEE) in patients seropositive for HIV in treatment of lipodystrophy.</brief_summary>
