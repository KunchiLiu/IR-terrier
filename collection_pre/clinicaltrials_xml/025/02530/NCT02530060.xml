	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of rilpivirine/Tenofovir/Emtricitabine (RPV/TFV/FTC) after a single-oral administration of Complera (the fixed-dose combination of RPV, FTC, Tenefovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF]) to healthy Japanese adult male participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Rilpivirine/Tenofovir/Emtricitabine After a Single-Oral Administration in Healthy Japanese Adult Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, open-label, single oral dose study in healthy Japanese adult male participants. The study consists of 3 phases; a screening phase up to 27 days (Day -28 to Day -2), an in-patient phase from Day -1 to Day 3 (dosing day is Day 1), and a follow-up assessment phase from Day 4 to the last follow-up assessment scheduled on Day 15 or at the time of early withdrawal. All participants will receive a single oral dose of one Complera tablet on Day 1 within 5 minutes after completion of the standardized breakfast. Pharmacokinetics of RPV/TFV/FTC will be assessed as the primary objective of the study. Safety of each participant will be assessed throughout the study.</detailed_description>
