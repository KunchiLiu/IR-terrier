	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how well photoacoustic imaging works in detecting ovarian or fallopian tube cancer. Photoacoustic imaging is an imaging method that uses lasers to light up tissue, and then converts the light information into ultrasound images. Photoacoustic imaging can provide images of the structure of tissues, as well as their function and the levels of molecules, such as the flow of blood in blood vessels and the level of oxygen in the blood. Photoacoustic imaging may help doctors determine whether a mass is benign (non-cancerous) or cancerous based on the molecular differences between cancer and normal tissue. It may be more accurate and less expensive than other imaging methods, and does not expose patients to radiation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the performance of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in detection of ovarian cancer in a clinical setting and to help improve the design of the next generation hand held PAI probe. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate vasculature and oxygen saturation in lesions based on PAI-measurements. OUTLINE: Patients undergo PAI over 15-30 minutes prior to the ovarian excision.</detailed_description>
