	<brief_title>A Tolerance Trial of Cinobufacini Injection Intraperitoneal Perfusion on Digestive System Cancer With Ascites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the tolerance and safety of cinobufacini injection intraperitoneal treatment on digestive system cancer patients with malignant ascites, and propose dosage regimens for future clinical trials. A single-arm, non-randomized, open, drug tolerance trial will be conducted. The clinical trial is divided into two parts, including single and successive administration.The single administration includes 7 groups, dose is escalated from 15ml to 180ml, with 2-6 patients per dose level. Central venous catheters will be preserved for drainage of ascites, after the drainage of most of ascites, we will slowly inject a dilute concentration of cinobufacini injection with escalated dosage through the catheters. This treatment will be given only once, and the volunteers will be observed for 24 hours. Then we will evaluate the observation indexes, including adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram, blood routine, urine routine, hepatic and renal function, etc. The successive administration includes 2 groups, according to the result of single administration, choose the second largest tolerance dose to conduct the 1st group of successive administration. If there are significant adverse effects, then drop to a lower dose to conduct the 2nd group; if the trial shows no adverse effects, it upgrades to a higher dose (the maximum tolerated dose) to conduct the 2nd group. The treatment will be given 3 times a week, 2 weeks as a period. Adverse effects will be evaluated during and after treatment.</detailed_description>
