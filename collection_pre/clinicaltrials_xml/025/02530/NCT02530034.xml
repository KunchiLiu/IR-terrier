	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of Hu8F4 that can be given to patients with advanced leukemia. This is the first study using Hu8F4 in humans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of Hu8F4 in Patients With Advanced Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of Hu8F4 based on when you join this study. Up to 5 dose levels of Hu8F4 will be tested. One (1)-6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of Hu8F4 is found. Once the highest tolerable dose is found, additional participants will be enrolled so that at least 6 participants with each cancer type are enrolled. Additional 3 groups of 10 participants each may be added for a specific leukemia type in "expansion groups" after the highest tolerable dose is found. Study Drug Administration: You will receive the Hu8F4 by vein over about 30 minutes on Days 0, 7, 14, and 21 of each 28-day cycle. Study Visits: Before you take the study drug you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration. To collect a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate, an area of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle. During Week 1 of Cycle 1: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If these tests have been performed within 3 days, they do not need to be repeated. - If you can have children, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn before you receive the study drug for testing for the effects of Hu8F4 and to test for antibodies to Hu8F4. Antibodies are created by the immune system and may attack foreign cells or substances, such as the study drug. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing 7 times over the 24 hours after the dose. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. On Days 2-14 of Cycles 1 and 2, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK testing. During Weeks 2-4 of Cycle 1, blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check for effects of Hu8F4, and to test for antibodies to Hu8F4. During Week 4 of Cycle 1, you will have bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease. During Week 1 of Cycle 2: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If these tests have been performed within 3 days, they do not need to be repeated. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check for the effects of Hu8F4 and for antibody testing. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn 7 times over the 24 hours after you receive the study drug for PK testing. During Weeks 2-4 of Cycles 2 and 3, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. At Week 2 of Cycle 2, this blood will also be used to check for antibodies to Hu8F4. During Week 1 of Cycle 3: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If these tests have been performed within 3 days, they do not need to be repeated. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check for the effects of Hu8F4. During Week 1 of Cycles 4 and beyond: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check for the effects of Hu8F4. Every 2-4 weeks of Cycles 4 and beyond, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Every 1-3 cycles, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease. Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. End of treatment: Once you are no longer taking the study drug, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to test for antibodies to Hu8F4. This is an investigational study. Hu8F4 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with any of the following diagnoses are eligible: 1) Highrisk MDS [i.e. refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB1 or RAEB2) by WHO classification, or any WHO subset with IPSS intermediate2 or high, or any patients that has failed prior therapy with hypomethylating agents], 2) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML); 3) Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by WHO classification; 4) Chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase (CMLBP); Patients with myelofibrosis are also eligible 2. Patients must have relapsed/refractory disease. Patients with secondary AML (including those progressing from MDS or myeloproliferative neoplasm MPN, and those with AML secondary to chemotherapy or radiotherapy for other malignancies) are eligible whether they have received prior therapy for AML or not 3. Age &gt;/= 18 years 4. ECOG performance status of 02 5. The effects of Hu8F4 on a fetus or nursing child are unknown. Women of childbearing potential (i.e., women who are premenopausal or not surgically sterile) must use acceptable contraceptive methods (abstinence, intrauterine device [IUD], oral contraceptive or double barrier device), and must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this trial. Nursing patients are excluded. Sexually active men must also use acceptable contraceptive methods for the duration of time on study 6. Patients must have HLAA2 phenotype 7. Must be able and willing to give written informed consent 8. In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to time of study drug administration should be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents, or at least 5 halflives for noncytotoxic agents. Exceptions are 1) hydroxyurea that requires no washout prior to the start of Hu8F4, and 2) up to 2 doses of singleagent cytarabine (up to 3 grams/m2) given for palliative purposes for which a washout of &gt;/=48 hrs is required 9. Clinically significant toxicities from prior chemotherapy must not be greater than grade 1 10. Patients must have the following clinical laboratory values unless considered due to leukemic organ involvement: a). Serum creatinine &lt;/= 2.0 mg/dl. b). Total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5x the upper limit of normal unless considered due to Gilbert's syndrome. c). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;/= 3x the upper limit of normal unless considered due to leukemic involvement. 1. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to uncontrolled infection, psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with study requirements, or active heart disease including confirmed myocardial infarction within previous 3 months, symptomatic coronary artery disease, clinically significant arrhythmias not controlled by medication, or uncontrolled congestive heart failure NY Heart Association class III or IV 2. Patients with current active malignancies or any remission for &lt;24 months, except patients with carcinoma in situ or with nonmelanoma skin cancer who may have active disease or be in remission for less than 6 months 3. Patients receiving any other standard or investigational treatment for their hematologic malignancy 4. Patients who have had any major surgical procedure within 14 days of Day 1 5.
