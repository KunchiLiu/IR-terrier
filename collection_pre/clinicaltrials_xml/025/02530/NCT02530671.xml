	<brief_summary>Background: Clinical studies have explored the relationship between toothbrushing and the development of recession, but relevant recession data for the multi-directional power toothbrush (PT) are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of brushing with either a multi-directional power toothbrush (PT) or an ADA (American Dental Association) reference manual toothbrush (MT) on pre-existing mid-buccal gingival recession (Pre-GR) over 12 months Methods: This was a 12-month, prospective, single-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled clinical study. Healthy participants without periodontitis but with at least 2 teeth showing Pre-GR ≥2mm were randomized to a group either brushing with a MT or a PT. The primary outcome parameter was the change at sites with Pre-GR ≥2mm. All recession measurements were performed by one calibrated examiner at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes were changes of recession at all buccal sites (with or without pre-GR), changes in the percentage of recession sites demonstrating a change of ≥1mm as well as changes in pocket probing depths.</brief_summary>
