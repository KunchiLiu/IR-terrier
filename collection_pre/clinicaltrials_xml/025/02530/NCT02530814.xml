	<brief_summary>In the Lake Apopka, Florida area for over 50 years starting in the 1940s, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) including 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dieldrin, chlordane, toxaphene and more recently methoxychlor were sprayed on farmlands in order to control pests and to improve crop harvests. For most of those years, the farmworkers were exposed to the pesticides as part of their work. Because of their lipophilic (fat soluble) nature, these organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are readily taken up into the body and not readily eliminated. Therefore, they can be detected in exposed individuals for many years after the exposure. There is some evidence that certain OCPs can cause or exacerbate medical problems in sensitive individuals. For example, exposure to some OCPs has been associated with development of Parkinsonism. Exposure to other OCPs has been associated with development of lupus erythematosus, an auto-immune disease. Other adverse effects of exposure to OCPs are endocrine disruption because some OCPs mimic estrogens and others mimic androgens, or may have mixed interactions with steroid receptors. In this research study the investigators aim is to test the blood from former farmworkers during the 1940s through the late 1970s who reside in the Lake Apopka area for OCPs and for the auto-antibodies. In addition, questionnaires will provide insight on their health status and health concerns.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Organochlorine Pesticide Exposure in Residents Near Lake Apopka</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this research study, a onetime blood test will be collected from former farmworkers during the 1940s through the late 1970s who reside in the Lake Apopka area for OCPs and for the auto-antibodies. In addition, questionnaires will provide insight on their health status and health concerns. The investigators will collect existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) which has monitored the pesticide exposure (with the exception of toxaphene) of people older than 8 years, so there is information on the range of concentrations of these chemicals in the blood of Americans. This data will be use as the control group for comparison with the values found for OCP concentrations.</detailed_description>
