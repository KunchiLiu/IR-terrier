	<detailed_description>QoLiCOL is an explorative, prospective, longitudinal, non-interventional, international, multicenter study of health-related quality of life, physical symptoms, functional impairments and socioeconomic burden in colon cancer patients. All patients presenting at participating hospitals during the recruitment period with a newly diagnosed rectal cancer, regardless of stage and planned treatment, will be eligible for inclusion.

Clinical data, including recurrence, surgical treatment, oncologic result (pathology report) and adjuvant treatment will be collected from the national quality registry for rectal cancer in Denmark and Sweden.
