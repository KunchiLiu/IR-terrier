	<brief_summary>To identify outcome measures for cancer control in Head and Neck cancer patient populations at the University of Pennsylvania (HUP, PAH, Presby) by administering various functional outcome surveys and questionnaires about their reconstructive surgery. We hope to ultimately develop a QOL indicator that will reflect the impact of reconstructive surgery on patient's quality of life, and help with therapeutic interventions and explanation of expectations prior to surgery.</brief_summary>
