	<brief_title>Feasibility of the UriCap-F for Urine Collection in Hospitalized Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following various disease conditions such as trauma, orthopaedic surgery, and infections etc., patients may be bedridden and unable to void in a bedpan or to make their way to the toilet. For lack of a better solution for urinary management, indwelling catheter and diaper use is common in hospitalized patients. There is no externally applied urine collection device on the market today for women. In such situations an indwelling catheter is often placed to relieve patients while they are incapacitated, despite lack of urinary retention. Indwelling catheters, although effective, are associated with discomfort, pain, and urinary tract infections. In other cases diapers or absorbent pads may be used. These may be associated with skin irritation and infection. The study will evaluate the UriCap-F, non-invasive urine collection devices for women, in hospitalized patients who are able to void or who are incontinent of urine</detailed_description>
