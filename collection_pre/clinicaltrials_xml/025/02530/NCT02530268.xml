	<brief_title>The Corrona, LLC Spondyloarthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis (SpA/PsA) Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The epidemiology of SpA is less certain than that of RA, partly related to a lack of understanding in the general medical community of the varied clinical presentations of the various SpA subsets, as well as evolving criteria for disease classification. A recent estimate of the prevalence of all forms of SpA in the US is between 0.3 and 1.3% of the general population.1 A more recent NHANES study suggests though a potentially higher prevalence with up to 1.4% having axial spondyloarthritis. 2 Given that the high estimate for axial SpA of 1.4% could even be an underestimate and given the known prolonged delay of diagnosis and misdiagnosis, it is all the more important to learn about the disease and its management via registry data in order to educate potential stakeholders. Data from the SPARK survey, conducted by Abbott in rheumatology practices in North America and Europe, suggested that SpA represents 40% of inflammatory arthritis managed in surveyed rheumatology practices in the US. Of these patients, 36% had PsA, 23% AS, 18% "Undifferentiated SpA", and 12% each Reactive and Inflammatory Bowel-Related SpA.3 It is likely that those patients classified as "undifferentiated" will be classified as either "axialSpA" or "peripheral SpA" by the new ASAS criteria for these conditions.4,5 There is a significant unmet need to develop clinical registry data on the presentation, natural history, management, and outcomes of SpA. There is no large clinical registry of SpA patients seen in general rheumatology practices. It is anticipated that CORRONA's registry will supplement information gathered in other programs and potentially represent a more general rheumatology spectrum of SpA patients representative of the general population. Corrona's objective is to create a national cohort of Spondyloarthritis patients cared for by rheumatologists to better understand the epidemiology and natural history of the disease, comorbidities, current treatment practices, response to therapy and outcomes related to medication therapy. The primary goal of the registry is to systematically collect and analyze longitudinal outcomes associated with spondyloarthritis. This includes assessing baseline characteristics, and trends in patient characteristics and treatment patterns. Corrona will evaluate prevalence rates of comorbidities and the burden of disease in the population. The registry is designed as a prospective, multicenter, observational registry for patients with spondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis. It will obtain longitudinal follow-up information via data collected from both patients and their treating rheumatologists every 6 months. The registry will gather data on disease duration, prognosis, disease severity and activity, medical comorbidities, surgeries, hospitalizations, use of medications and laboratory and imaging data. After the enrollment visit, SpA patients and physicians will complete follow-up questionnaires during regularly scheduled clinical encounters. The goal is to collect data from patients and providers at six month intervals, not to exceed 2 visits in any 12 month period. Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the subject, or be discovered as a result of general questioning by the Principal Investigator. During all CORRONA related visits with the Principal Investigator, subjects will be questioned regarding the occurrence of adverse events.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female patients with all forms of SpA, including those who meet the 1984 Modified New York Criteria for Ankylosing Spondylitis, the 2009 ASAS Criteria for Azial Spondyloarthritis, the 2010 ASAS Criteria for Peripheral Arthritis or the CASPAR for psoriatic arthritis. Patients with other forms of overlapping nonautoimmune arthritis, such as osteoarthritis or gout, will be allowed, but will have these forms of arthritis clearly distinguished from their SpA manifestations. Patients aged less than 18 at the time of enrollment into the registry. Patients unable or unwilling to consent to participation in the registry. Patients with RA, SLE, or other forms of autoimmune inflammatory arthritis.</criteria>
