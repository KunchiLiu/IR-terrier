	<brief_summary>Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in healthy male and female volunteers. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 7 treatment cohorts (Cohorts 1 - 7) of 8 subjects each, to receive either Q203 or placebo (6 active treatment : 2 placebo) in a fasting state. Dose escalation to the next cohort may be considered when at least 6 out of 8 subjects, in a cohort, completes all procedures and none of the subjects has a clinically significant adverse event (AE) that is being followed, or at the discretion of the PI if no drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) have occurred. A food effect cohort will be enrolled to test administration of Q203 in a fed state, at 100 mg dose level (this dose level may change based on PK analysis results). Subjects who received 100mg dose in a fasting state will return and receive the second dose, with food. Subjects will be followed up for AEs, SAE or pregnancy for 30 days postdrug administration.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in healthy male and female volunteers. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 7 treatment cohorts (Cohorts 1 - 7) of 8 subjects each, to receive either Q203 or placebo in a fasting state. Every attempt will be made to include at least 2 females in each cohort, at least one of whom will be assigned to receive Q203. Dose escalation to the next cohort may be considered when at least 6 out of 8 subjects, in a cohort, completes all procedures and none of the subjects has a clinically significant adverse event (AE) that is being followed, or at the discretion of the PI if no drug-related SAEs have occurred. A food effect cohort will be enrolled to test administration of Q203 in a fed state, at 100 mg dose level (this dose level may change based on PK analysis results). Subjects who received 100mg dose in a fasting state will return and receive the second dose, with food. In this cohort, all eight subjects will proceed to receive either Q203 or placebo in a six to two ratio (six active treatment : 2 placebo). Every attempt will be made to include at least 2 females in this cohort, at least one of whom will be assigned to receive Q203. Subjects will be followed up for AEs, SAE or pregnancy for 30 days postdrug administration.</detailed_description>
