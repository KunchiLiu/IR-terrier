	<brief_summary>The goal of this new lupus research study is two-fold: first, to understand the genetic associations found between people's DNA and this disease, and second, to apply this understanding to drug development efforts with the investigator's partners at Pfizer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lupus is a difficult disease to diagnose and one that's difficult to manage, given the lack of specific medicines to treat lupus and the side-effects of current medications. The investigators believe genetics may play a critical role in developing better lupus diagnoses and treatments. If individuals are eligible to participate, the investigators will send a 23andMe DNA saliva kit at no cost. Participants will be asked to take a 15 minute online survey with questions about their lupus experience, symptoms and response to treatments, in addition to five additional bi-monthly short surveys and one final study survey during the 12-month participation.
