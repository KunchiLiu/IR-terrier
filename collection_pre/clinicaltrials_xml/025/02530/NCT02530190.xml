	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized clinical trial examining the effectiveness of massage and intermittent pneumatic compression on recovery from a 161-km ultramarathon. Participants of the 2015 161-km Western States Endurance Run were randomized to a 20-minute post-race intervention of massage, intermittent pneumatic compression or supine rest. Each subject completed two 400 m runs at maximum speed before the race, and on days 3 and 5 after the race, and also provided muscle pain and soreness ratings and overall muscular fatigue scores before and for 7 days after the race.</detailed_description>
