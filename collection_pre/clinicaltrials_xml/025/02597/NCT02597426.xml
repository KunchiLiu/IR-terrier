	<brief_summary>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a type of head and neck cancer. The last three decades of research in head and neck radiation oncology have largely focused on improvements in survival, which have mostly come at the cost of long term toxicity for surviving patients. This is an observational study that is being done to learn about the long-term symptoms and side effects that survivors of nasopharyngeal cancer may have following radiation treatment. This study will include assessment of patient report outcomes, physician-graded adverse events, neurocognitive assessment and endocrine and hearing testing</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Post IMRT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to provide comprehensive cross sectional information on the late toxicities following radical chemoradiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in patients who are disease free with a minimum of four years follow-up and who were treated with contemporary radiotherapy techniques (IMRT). This is an observational cross-sectional study which will aim to define the late effects in this population, investigating both well known toxicities identified from studies using earlier radiotherapy techniques (2D and 3D radiotherapy) as well as toxicities which have not been well defined in the current literature and which may be under-recognized and under treated (pituitary function and neurocognitive outcomes). This study will assess survivors at a single time point four years after completion of their treatment who are disease free. This comprehensive review will include demographic data, clinical assessment, biochemical assessment of hormonal (pituitary and thyroid) function, patient reported outcomes, and quality of life and neurocognitive questionnaires. This study will attempt to comprehensively review these toxicities in a contemporary patient group with modern radiotherapy techniques in an attempt to bridge the gap between current recommended follow up protocols and the actual challenges faced by long term survivors. Some of these factors will be correlated with radiation doses received by the patient to inform on radiation dose thresholds for appropriate toxicities (hypothalamic-pituitary, thyroid, temporal lobe necrosis, neurocognitive performance). Patients will be offered follow-up, if required with appropriate personnel if appropriate, including neuropsychology, endocrinology and otoloryngology.</detailed_description>
