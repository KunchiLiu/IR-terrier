	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Effect of Intravenous Lidocaine on Propofol Requirement in Facial Plastic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies reported the usefulness of intravenous lidocaine as a coadjuvant agent during general anesthesia. We thought that there would be an interaction between intravenous lidocaine and hypnotic agent requirement. However, there is no data regarding the effect of systemic lidocaine during MAC. We, thus, would like to perform a randomized, double-blinded pilot study to evaluate the effect of intravenous lidocaine on propofol requirement during BIS guided MAC in facial plastic surgery.</detailed_description>
