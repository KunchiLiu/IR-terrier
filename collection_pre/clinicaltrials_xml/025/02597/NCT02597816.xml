	<brief_summary>Congenital uterine anomalies are found in 8% of infertile women and 24.5% of infertile women with a history of recurrent miscarriage, with septate and sub-septate uterus being the most common anomalies in these women, Also, septate uterus is the commonest anomaly found in infertile women requiring assisted reproductive technology. Published data showed improved Cumulative pregnancy rate and live birth rate, and a significant reduction in Miscarriage rate in In Vitro Fertilization women after hysteroscopic metroplasty of both small and large septate compared to non-operated women. Investigators hypothesized that trans-vaginal three Dimensional Ultrasound will be superior to Hystro-salpingography for the differentiation between arcuate and septate uterus in infertile women scheduled for In Vitro Fertilization.</brief_summary>
