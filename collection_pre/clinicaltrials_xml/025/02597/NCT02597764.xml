	<brief_summary>Urination is a result of a complex neuro-muscular coordination which involves the action and arrangement of different parts of nervous systems as well as the muscular structure of the lower part of the urinary system. When there is an abnormal pattern in bladder and bowel habits without any known neuronal lesions, the condition is called bladder and bowel disorder (BBD). The symptoms can range from the feeling of rushing to the toilet, urinary accidents to urinating much less than expected during the day. The standard treatment for most cases of BBD starts with Standard Urotherapy (SU) which is a beneficial basic and harmless form of treatment widely used for all children with BBD. SU involves explaining of the problem to the children and their parents by the doctors and educating them on proper voiding mechanisms, sitting, and standing positions as well as how and when to void. The purpose of this study is to explore the possibility of testing the additive effectiveness of Diaphragmatic Breathing exercise (DB) as an alternative and harmless additional treatment to SU in children with BBD.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Children with bladder and bowel disorders (BBD) will be diagnosed by the attending pediatric urologists via a combination of thorough clinical history, physical examination, BBD Questionnaire, uroflowmetric evaluation, and voiding and stool diary. 1. Known anatomic or neurological lower urinary tract abnormalities such as posterior urethral valve, urethral obstruction or stricture, ectopic ureters, congenital abnormalities of the spinal cord, or any previous surgery of the lower urinary tract. 2. Current use of medication or treatments which affects bladder or ANS function. These include anticholinergics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and neuromodulators. 3. Any conditions or disorders that would affect the cardiovascular system or the activity of the ANS. 4. Serious pulmonary issues or diaphragmatic problems that would interfere with the practice of diaphragmatic breathing technique. 5. Psychological/behavioral abnormalities severe enough to prevent the cooperation of the child with the study coordinator or the urologist. 6. Inability to provide consent. 7. Inability to speak and/or understand in English.</criteria>
