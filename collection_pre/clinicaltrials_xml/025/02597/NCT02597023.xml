	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of supplementation with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, mitoquinone (MitoQ), for improving physiological function (vascular, motor, and cognitive) in middle-aged and older adults.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overall, the proposed research project has the long-term potential to influence clinical practice by establishing novel therapies for treating multiple domains of age-associated physiological dysfunction and thereby reducing the risk of clinical disease and disability.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women will be confirmed as postmenopausal (either natural or surgical) based on cessation of menses for &gt;1 year. Ability to provide informed consent Baseline brachial flowmediated dilation (FMD) &lt; 6%Î” (rationale: noninvasive screening to ensure exclusion of subjects with exceptionally high baseline endothelial function. Ability to perform motor and cognitive tests (e.g., can rise from a chair, walk for 2 min, climb 10 stairs) Willing to accept random assignment to condition Current smoking Having past or present alcohol dependence or abuse, as defined by the American Psychiatry Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Body mass index (BMI) &gt;40 kg/m2 (FMD measurements can be inaccurate in severely obese patients) Chronic clinical diseases (e.g., coronary artery/peripheral artery/cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis, neurological disorders or diseases that may affect motor/cognitive functions [multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, polio, Alzheimer's disease, dementia or other brain diseases of aging]), except hypertension and hyperlipidemia Regular vigorous aerobic/endurance exercise (&gt;3 vigorous bouts/week). Not weight stable in the prior 3 months (&gt;2 kg weight change) or unwilling to remain weight stable throughout study (rationale: recent weight change or weight loss can influence vascular function. Current treatment or recent cessation (&lt; 3 mo) of hormone replacement therapy Moderate or severe peripheral artery disease (anklebrachial index &lt;0.7). A graded exercise test will be performed by all subjects, if there is physician concern or an adverse event, the subject will not participate in a maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) test (this will be determined in accordance with stated contraindications for exercise testing provided by the American Heart Association). Thyroid disease that is not controlled by medications or &lt;3 month's use of a particular medication and/or dosage (uncontrolled thyroid diseases are associated with alterations in vascular function).</criteria>
