	<brief_summary>This research study will evaluate a standalone software application and is designed to standardize and validate new neurocognitive screening testing for children aged 6 through 11, and adolescents and adults ages 12 through 75. The purpose of this study is to evaluate recently developed computerized tasks sensitive to changes in neurocognitive performance after a concussion. These tests were designed to help measure the effects of concussion on cognitive processes (e.g., memory, attention, brain speed) and visual functioning.</brief_summary>
