	<criteria>Have type 2 diabetes mellitus (based on the World Health Organization's [WHO] diagnostic criteria) Have been treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor, with or without metformin, for at least 3 months prior to study entry (minimum required doses for that period for allowed SGLT2 inhibitors: empagliflozin 10 mg, dapagliflozin 5 or 10 mg [per countryspecific label], canagliflozin 100 mg); minimum required dose for metformin, if used, is ≥1500 mg/day and must be reached (or highest tolerated dose which is acceptable with documented gastrointestinal [GI] intolerability) Daily doses of all allowed oral antihyperglycemia agent (OAMs) must have been stable for at least 12 weeks (±3 days) prior to randomization (study enrollment); daily doses of SGLT2 inhibitor and metformin, if used, will be considered stable during this period if: all prescribed daily doses were in the range between the minimum required dose and maximumapproved dose per countryspecific label; and &gt;90% of prescribed daily doses were equal to the dose at randomization Have HbA1c ≥7.0% and ≤9.5% at study entry and approximately 1 week prior to randomization Have body mass index (BMI) ≤45 kilograms per meter squared (kg/m^2) and agree to not initiate a diet and/or exercise program during the study with the intent of reducing body weight other than the lifestyle and dietary measures for diabetes treatment Have type 1 diabetes mellitus Have been treated with ANY other OAMs (other than SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin), glucagonlike peptide1 receptor agonist (GLP1 RA), pramlintide or insulin 3 months prior to study entry, or between study entry and randomization; or initiate metformin between study entry and randomization; shortterm use of insulin for acute care (≤14 days) during the 3month period prior to entry is not exclusionary Have any condition that is a contraindication for use of the GLP1 RA class or the SGLT2 inhibitor class (per countryspecific labels) at study entry or develop such condition between study entry and randomization Have acute or chronic hepatitis, signs and symptoms of any other liver disease other than nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or alanine transaminase (ALT) level &gt;2.5 times the upper limit of the reference range, as determined by the central laboratory at study entry; participants with NAFLD are eligible for participation in this trial Had chronic or acute pancreatitis any time prior to study entry Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;45 milliliters(mL)/minute/1.73m^2, calculated by the Chronic Kidney DiseaseEpidemiology (CKDEPI) equation, as determined by the central laboratory at study entry and confirmed at lead in Have any self or family history of type 2A or type 2B multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN 2A or 2B) in the absence of known Ccell hyperplasia (this exclusion includes participants with a family history of MEN 2A or 2B, whose family history for the syndrome is rearranged during transfect [RET] negative; the only exception for this exclusion will be for participants whose family members with MEN 2A or 2B have a known RET mutation and the potential participant for the study is negative for the RET mutation) Have any self or family history of medullary Ccell hyperplasia, focal hyperplasia, carcinoma (including sporadic, familial, or part of MEN 2A or 2B syndrome) Have a serum calcitonin ≥20 picograms/mL as determined by the central laboratory at study entry</criteria>
