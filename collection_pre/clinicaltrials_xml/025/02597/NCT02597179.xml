	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate and analyse genomic profiles in patient with breast cancer who failed standard treatment, refractory and young breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genome Sequencing in Refractory Breast Cancer to Molecular Targeted Therapy and Young Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis is that genomic profiling measured by CancerSCAN, cfDNA, Whole exome sequencing (WES), Whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS), FACS(Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting), cytokine and immunologic signature analysis would be helpful to find out tolerance for chemotherapy and innovate new therapeutic strategies.</detailed_description>
