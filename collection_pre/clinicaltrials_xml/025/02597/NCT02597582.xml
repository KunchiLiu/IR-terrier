	<brief_title>LigaSure Small Jaw® Versus Conventional Neck Dissection in Head and Neck Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We compared the differences in perioperative and postoperative variables between LigaSure Small Jaw®-assisted and conventional neck dissection in head and neck cancer patients. Patients who were scheduled to undergo neck dissection due to head and neck cancer were eligible for this study. After receiving a detailed explanation, all patients signed an informed consent form before randomization. The study group were treated using the LigaSure vessel sealing system (Small Jaw®; Covidien, Colorado, USA) for dissection and hemostasis throughout the whole procedures during neck dissection. Relevant data included tumor-related variables, perioperative parameters, postoperative drainage status, postoperative subjective pain, and analgesic consumption amount were recorded and analyzed.</detailed_description>
