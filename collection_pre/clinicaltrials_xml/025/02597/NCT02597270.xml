	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe the genetic diversity of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4a protease and NS5A protein of HCV in participants with chronic disease naive-drug or previously failed to double therapy (Peg-interferon and Ribavirin) and to identify the frequency of natural polymorphisms in HCV NS3/4a protease and NS5A protein that are associated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)-resistance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Observational/Non-interventional, Study of NS3/4a Protease and NS5A Protein of Hepatitis C Virus in Brazilian Participants With Chronic HCV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, observational/non-interventional, cross-sectional study to describe the genetic diversity of and to identify the natural polymorphisms in HCV NS3/4a protease and NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus in Brazilian participants with chronic HCV infection. Brazilian participants with Genotype 1 HCV infection treatment naive participants or previously failed to double therapy (Peg-interferon-α and Ribavirin) will be included in the trial and will constitute the trial population.</detailed_description>
