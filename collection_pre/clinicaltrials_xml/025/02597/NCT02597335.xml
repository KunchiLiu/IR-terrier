	<brief_summary>This trial develops a non invasive diagnostic approach of IDH1 mutated gliomas combining mutation detection from free plasmatic DNA, D-2HG dosage in urine samples, and D-2HG detection by Brain Spectro MRI. In group 1 (25 patients), patients with presumed grade II-III gliomas candidate to surgery will undergo spectro MRI, plasma, urine dosages. Results will then be confronted to tumor mutational status and D-2HG. In group 2 (15 patients), patients with known IDH1 mutation will undergo spectro MRI, plasma, urine dosages overtime in order to correlate results with the response to treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non Invasive Detection of IDH1/2 Mutation in Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this trial is to develop and validate a non invasive diagnostic approach of IDH1 mutated gliomas. It will evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of D-2HG detection by Brain Spectro MRI. This approach will be coupled with mutation detection from free plasmatic DNA and D-2HG dosage in urine samples. The primary end-point is the quantification of D-2HG by spectro-MRI, and the correlation with the dosage of D-2HG in the tumor fragment, and the mutational status (group 1: 25 patients). The secondary endpoints include: 1. longitudinal analysis Spectro-MRI overtime (12 months) correlation with radiological evolution and the response to treatment (group 2: 15 patients) 2. Differentiation of tumor recurrence from radiation induced changes 3. Confrontation of Spectro-MRI, D-2HG dosages and IDH mutation detection from plasma DNA, and elaboration of a combined score of prediction</detailed_description>
