	<brief_title>Short-term Efficacy of Intravitreal Afilibercept Depending on Subtypes of Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy: Polypoidal Choroidal Neovascularization or Idiopathic Choroidal Vasculopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subjects were classified into two subtypes (type 1 and type 2 polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy) based on the presence or the absence of both of a feeder and a draining vessels on indocyanine green angiography.
