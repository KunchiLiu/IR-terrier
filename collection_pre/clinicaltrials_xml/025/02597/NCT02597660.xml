	<brief_summary>Patellar tendinopathy is one of the most frequent causes of non-traumatic knee pain and reduced function in patients. Standard treatment options for patellar tendinopathies include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, cryotherapy, manual therapy, eccentric exercises, and ultrasound. Unfortunately many patients fail to respond to these therapies and return to normal activity levels, and recurrence rates for those who do respond are unacceptably high. Many patients who fail to respond display persistent degenerative changes on imaging studies suggesting a failure to regenerate the pathological tissue. Developing new therapies that can directly promote the synthesis of new, healthy extracellular matrix tissue could therefore address an important therapeutic need and make a substantial improvement in our ability to effectively treat patellar tendinopathy and reduce recurrence rates. Somatropin (human growth hormone of recombinant DNA origin) has been shown to increase protein synthesis and matrix production when delivered directly into the tendon. This study will evaluate the ability of somatropin to improve clinical outcomes and tissue quality in patients with chronic tendinopathy.</brief_summary>
