	<brief_title>Different Stimuli of Transcutaneous Electric Acupoint Stimulation(TEAS) on Acupuncture Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical technique that involves the insertion of needles at acupoints to treat diseases by Jingluo (the system of meridians, through which energy is thought to ﬂow through the body in Chinese medicine). It is usually applied to relieve pain. Several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture on the consumption of intra-operative anaesthetics and on drug-related side-effects, with promising results. Compared with acupuncture or electroacupuncture, transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation(TEAS) is a non-invasive technique and has some advantages, including no risk of infections or needle-induced contagious disease and reduced fear of stimulation. It can potentially be applied by any anaesthetist or pre-operative personnel with minimal training.Thus, investigators conducted this controlled, prospective, double-blinded clinical trial to investigate whether treating by transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation combined with general anesthetic during peri-operative could alleviate the dosage of anesthetic drugs compared with control and sham group.</detailed_description>
