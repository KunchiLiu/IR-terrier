	<detailed_description>Acute consumption of dietary nitrate (as beetroot juice) has been shown to decrease systemic blood pressure in multiple populations including newly diagnosed, untreated hypertensives. The additional effect in hypertensives on blood pressure lowering medications is uncertain. The investigators hypothesize that chronic nitrate consumption might decrease blood pressure in hypertensives who are suboptimally controlled on at least one blood pressure medication compared to a placebo beetroot juice. This study is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, crossover trial. At baseline, mid-point and endpoint ambulatory blood pressure will be assessed in conjunction with demographics and blood draw. After baseline measures, each subject will be randomized to consume nitrate rich beetroot juice for 7 consecutive days when assessments will be repeated followed by 7 days of placebo and endpoint assessments or the converse.</detailed_description>
