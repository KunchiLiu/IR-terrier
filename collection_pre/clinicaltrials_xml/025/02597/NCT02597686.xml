	<brief_summary>When the investigators are caught up in emotions, it is by stepping back (or decentering) that the investigators are able to see the situation from another perspective. Individuals with emotional disorders, however, can have difficulties in being able to do this. Research has shown that improving an individual's ability to step back from their emotions and take perspective is possible and can have beneficial effects on depressive symptomatology (Self Distancing and Perspective Broadening [SDPB] training). The SDPB training package involves two techniques: 1) stepping back from situations using mental imagery (building a mental picture of the situation and changing the distance to it) and, 2) reframing situations using perspective broadening reappraisals (giving new meanings to situations). The training package trains these SDPB techniques using an individual's memories and every day events. The fortnightly training comprises of two one to one sessions and daily homework for a week in between.The SDPB training package is aimed at improving an individual's ability to step back from, and put a new meaning to emotional events that take place in their lives. The prospective pilot study aims to investigate whether the SDPB training package reduces symptomatology and improves these abilities in individuals who experience both depressive and manic episodes (Bipolar Disorder [BD]). BD has a cumulative lifetime prevalence ranging from 1.52% across Europe and is treated with moderate success using Cognitive Behavioural therapy (CBT). However, 'moderate success' is considerably low compared to other mental health problems and CBT can be time time consuming, expensive, and cognitively demanding (requiring a high level of functioning of one or more cognitive functions). Accordingly, BD may be one of the emotional disorders in greatest need of novel and evidence based treatments.</brief_summary>
