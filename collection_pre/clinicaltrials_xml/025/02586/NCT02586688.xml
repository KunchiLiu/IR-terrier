	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of NeuroStar® Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Therapy in Depressed Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the antidepressant effects of daily, active TMS (when compared with sham treatment) in adolescents meeting criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, single or recurrent episode (Phase I). Secondary: To evaluate the acute and long term safety of TMS treatment in adolescent MDD subjects. To evaluate the durability of benefit of TMS treatment over the course of 6 months in subjects who received clinical benefit from acute treatment course(s) (Phase III). To evaluate the benefit of daily, active, open-label TMS in Phase I subjects who did not receive protocol-defined clinical benefit; as new acute treatment (sham to active) or as extended treatment course (blinded active to open label active) (Phase II).</detailed_description>
