	<brief_summary>Colic, or inconsolable crying and fussing, affects around 20% of babies who are 3 months of age or younger. To date, there are no known treatments that have been found to help reduce colic and its symptoms in babies. The investigators would like to see whether a baby formula that contains a prebiotic will lead to the same improvements in babies with colic. The investigators will test this by giving some babies a formula with the prebiotic and other babies a placebo formula.</brief_summary>
