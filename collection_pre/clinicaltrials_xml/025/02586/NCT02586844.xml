	<brief_title>Prospective Comprehensive Molecular Profiling In Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this prospective study the aim is to obtain fresh tumor biopsies and three blood samples from patients with a confirmed histological or cytological diagnosis of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) or well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). Eligible population includes: NETs and PanNETs patients who have undergone or are undergoing treatment with targeted therapies and have shown prolonged clinical benefit, and NETs and PanNETs patients who have been treated with these agents and just recently progressed. RNA and DNA from fresh tumor biopsies and from mononuclear blood cells will be subjected to transcriptome sequencing and DNA sequencing analyses to evaluate possible genes of interest and related targetable pathways. Moreover, archived tumor samples will be requested from all patients to perform additional genomic testing. Remaining RNA and DNA will be banked for additional exploratory analyses (e.g. further genomic testing, or DNA copy number analysis, or epigenetic evaluations).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years. Histological or cytological proof of NETs or PanNETs. At least one biopsiable lesion deemed medically accessible and safe to biopsy. Current/recent treatment with targeted therapies with confirmed clinical benefit; confirmed progression disease to targeted therapies at the time of study enrollment. Fulfills local institution's laboratory parameters for tumor biopsy. Willingness and ability of patient to provide signed voluntary informed consent. Any condition that could interfere with their ability to provide informed consent such as dementia or severe cognitive impairment.
