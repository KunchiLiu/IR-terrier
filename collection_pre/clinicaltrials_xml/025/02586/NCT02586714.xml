	<detailed_description>This study examined the relationships between maternal body composition, placental function, and fetal nutrition and body composition, and sought to determine the most accurate method of maternal body composition analysis in late pregnancy. This project integrates body composition analysis, nutrition, and metabolic factors to study the impact of maternal body composition and diet on placental function and fetal growth. Research Project: The proposed enrollment of 41 pregnant women at term (&gt;37 weeks gestation) was completed in September 2013. The subjects underwent four body composition measurements (bioelectrical impedance, skin-fold thickness, BodPod, and deuterium dilution) and dietary surveys along with a fasting blood draw. The subjects returned 2 weeks postpartum for repeat measurements along with a DEXA scan.</detailed_description>
