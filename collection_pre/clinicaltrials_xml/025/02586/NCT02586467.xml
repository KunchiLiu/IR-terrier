	<brief_summary>Over 35,000 Canadians, 65% of men and 72% of women aged 31-50 years fail to consume the recommended number of milk and milk product servings (â‰¤2 servings per day). Given the wide range of health benefits associated with increased dietary intake of milk and milk products the objectives of this study were to conduct a prospective, 5-arm randomised controlled trial in order to test the effectiveness of a variety of messages for increasing milk and milk product consumption in men and women aged 30-50 years old. The five arms consisted of 4 messages that contained slightly different content specifically: 1) gain-framed message condition, 2) loss-framed message condition, 3) self-regulatory efficacy-enhancing message condition, 4) gain-framed and self-regulatory efficacy-enhancing message condition and 5) loss-framed plus self-regulatory efficacy-enhancing message condition. It was hypothesised that those who receive self-regulatory efficacy-enhancing information would consume more dairy than those who received messages without such information. Second, those who received gain-framed messages would consume more dairy as compared to those who received loss-framed messages. Third, those who received gain-framed messages that include self-regulatory efficacy-enhancing information would consume the most dairy in comparison to the other four conditions.</brief_summary>
