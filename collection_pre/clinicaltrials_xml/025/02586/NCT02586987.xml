	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-centre, drug combination study of double and triple combination oral selumetinib (AZD6244 Hyd-sulfate) plus intravenous (IV) MEDI4736 and oral selumetinib plus IV MEDI4736 and IV tremelimumab in patients with advanced solid tumours refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists. The safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumour activity of ascending doses of Selumetinib (AZD6244 Hyd-sulfate) in Combination with MEDI4736 and Selumetinib in Combination with MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab will be investigated. Once safety and tolerability have been established for the relevant dose, expansion cohorts will commence in order to further evaluate safety, tolerability, and provide a preliminary evaluation of the mechanism of action and anti-tumour activity of the drug combination. Mandatory paired biopsy expansion cohorts will be tumour-type specific. Expansion cohorts will open independently for double and triple combination treatments.</detailed_description>

Females should not be breastfeeding and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing if of childbearing potential or must have evidence of nonchildbearing potential by fulfilling 1 of the criteria below at screening. Postmenopausal defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments Women &lt;50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments. The levels of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) must also be in the postmenopausal range (as per the institution) Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilisation by hysterectomy and / or bilateral oophorectomy and/or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation 7. Male patients should be willing to use barrier contraception ie, condoms plus spermicide 8. Mandatory provision of tumour tissue sample available at study entry for exploratory biomarker research. Cytology samples for this exploratory biomarker research will not be acceptable Patients must not enter the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are fulfilled 1. Previous enrolment in the present study 2. Treatment with any of the following: Cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anticancer drugs within 28 days of the 1st dose of study treatment or any investigational agents within 5 halflives of the product MEDI4736 or selumetinib in the present study (ie, dosing with MEDI4736 or selumetinib previously initiated in this study) Major surgical procedure, (excluding placement of vascular access) or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of the 1st dose of study treatment, or have an anticipated need for major surgery during the study Palliative radiotherapy with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks or radiotherapy with a limited field of radiation for palliation within 2 weeks of the 1st dose of study treatment Prior exposure to immunemediated therapy, including, but not limited to, other antiCTLA 4 (Cytotoxic Tlymphocyte antigen4), antiPD1 (Programmed cell death 1), antiPDL1 (Programmed cell death ligand 1), or antiPDL2 (Programmed cell death ligand 2) antibodies, including therapeutic anticancer vaccines Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP. Concurrent enrolment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational (noninterventional) clinical study or during the followup period of an interventional study 3. Any unresolved toxicity NCI CTCAE (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade ≥2 from previous anticancer therapy with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion criteria Patients with Grade ≥2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a casebycase basis and may be included after consultation with the medical monitor Patients with irreversible toxicity not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by treatment with selumetinib, MEDI4736 or tremelimumab may be included after consultation with the medical monitor 4. History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and brain metastases or spinal cord compression. Patients with suspected brain metastases at screening should have a CT / MRI of the brain prior to study entry 5.
