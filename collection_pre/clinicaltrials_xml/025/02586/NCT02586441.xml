	<brief_summary>The BIS Index, one of the VISTA Monitor output parameters, may be used as an aid in monitoring the effects of certain anesthetic agents;and its usage with certain anesthetic agents may be associated with a reduction in primary anesthetic use and a reduction in emergence and recovery time. However, this equipment does not give the proper anesthetic depth index is a number of experimental results have been reported. Therefore, the investigators study that the BIS VISTA receives an electroencephalogram (EEG) obtained through the depth of anesthesia monitors brain waves to collect statistical data, through mathematical analysis to analyze the exact correlation between the patient's brain waves and the depth of anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of EEG With Respect to the Change of Depth of Anesthesia During General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General anesthesia is accompanied during surgery gives a lot of satisfaction and impact on surgical outcomes of patients depending on the dose of the anesthetic, as well as operation time and intensity. The BIS Index, one of the VISTA Monitor output parameters, may be used as an aid in monitoring the effects of certain anesthetic agents;and its usage with certain anesthetic agents may be associated with a reduction in primary anesthetic use and a reduction in emergence and recovery time. However, this equipment does not give the proper anesthetic depth index is a number of experimental results have been reported.
