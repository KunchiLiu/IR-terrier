	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the MLN-DEXAMETHASONE, MLN-DEXAMETHASONE-CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, MLN-DEXAMETHASONE-BENDAMUSTINE or MLN- THALIDOMIDE-DEXAMETHASONE induction combinations, followed by MLN maintenance in newly diagnosed elderly Multiple Myeloma patients. 260 patients, males and females, older than 65 years old or younger but considered not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and transplantation, enrolled in different sites, will take part in this study. The duration of the study is approximately 5 years.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements. Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future medical care. Female patient is either postmenopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use two acceptable methods of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study. Male patient agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception (i.e., condom or abstinence) for the duration of the study. Newly diagnosed MM based on standard CRAB criteria (see Appendix 12.2). Age ≥ 65 years old or younger not eligible for transplantation. Patient has measurable disease, defined as follows: any quantifiable serum monoclonal protein (Mprotein) value (generally, but not necessarily, ≥ 0.5 g/dL of Mprotein) and, where applicable, urine lightchain excretion of &gt;200 mg/24 hours. For patients with oligo or nonsecretory MM, it is required that they have measurable plasmacytoma &gt; 2 cm as determined by clinical examination or applicable radiographs (i.e. MRI, CTScan) or an abnormal free light chain ratio (n.v.: 0.261.65). We anticipate that less than 10% of patients admitted to this study will be oligo or nonsecretory MM with free light chains only in order to maximize interpretation of benefit results Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and/or other performance status 0, 1, or 2 Clinical laboratory values within 30 days of enrolment: platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/mm3 (Platelet transfusions to help patients meet eligibility criteria are not allowed within 3 days before study enrollment) haemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x109/mm3 AST and ALT ≤ 3 times the upper limit of normal total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal clearance creatinine ≥ 30 ml/min Pregnant or lactating females. Serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality or psychiatric illness that prevented the subject from the enrolment or place the subject at unacceptable risk. Previous treatment with antimyeloma therapy (does not include radiotherapy, bisphosphonates, or a single short course of steroid &lt; to the equivalent of dexamethasone 40 mg/day for 4 days) Clinical active infectious hepatitis type A, B, C or HIV (HBVDNA and HCVRNA will be analysed to evaluate the cell proliferation of virus; antiHIV antibody must be negative). Acute active infection requiring antibiotics or infiltrative pulmonary disease Peripheral neuropathy or neuropatic pain grade 2 or higher, as defined by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) 4.03 Contraindication to any of the required drugs or supportive treatments Invasive malignancy within the past 3 years Systemic treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 (fluvoxamine, enoxacin), strong inhibitors of CYP3A (clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, voriconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, posaconazole) or strong CYP3A inducers (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital), or use of Ginkgo biloba or St. John's wort within 14 days before the first dose of study treatment (see Appendix 12.12). Diagnosis of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, primary amyloidosis, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myeloproliferative syndrome. Evidence of current uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions, including uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months. Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the various formulations.</criteria>
