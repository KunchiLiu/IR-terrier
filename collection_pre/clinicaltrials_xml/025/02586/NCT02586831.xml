	<brief_summary>To assess whether there is a difference in endogenous insulin secretion, measured as stimulated C-peptide secretion (area under the curve during a 4-hour mixed meal tolerance test), at the 1 year visit, for study subjects receiving combinational therapy versus those receiving placebo. The study will also examine the effect of the proposed treatments on immunological outcomes, specifically proportion of regulatory T cells at the 1 year visit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diabetes Islet Preservation Immune Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a critical need to test therapies that afford long-lasting immunomodulation through the combined use of short courses of depleting agents, more chronic use of drugs that promote immunoregulation and critically control the rebounding effector populations, together with interventions that quell inflammation and support beta cell function and glucose metabolism. Such combined regimens would rely on lower doses of many of these agents, for increased safety and tolerability. Here, we propose a combinatorial regimen based on the administration of drugs that are already FDA approved and marketed, all of which have been used in clinical trials in patients with T1D, alone or in some combination. This trial will test if the regimen proposed, for the first time combining all of these agents, will be successful in preserving insulin secretion in recent onset type 1 diabetes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible to participate in this study: 1. Subject must be able to understand and provide informed consent. 2. Males and females, 1835 years of age. 3. New onset T1D for no longer than 120 days at the time of randomization. 4. Affected by T1D, according to ADA standard criteria, and confirmed by positivity of at least one T1Dassociated autoantibody, to GAD65, IA2, ZnT8, or insulin autoantibodies (if patient has been treated with insulin for less than 2 weeks). 5. Being on insulin therapy. 6. Stimulated Cpeptide peak level &gt;0.2 nmol/L at the baseline 1 visit MMTT. 7. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test upon study entry. 8. Female (and male) subjects with reproductive potential must agree to use two FDA approved methods of birth control for the entire duration of the study. 9. Adequate venous access to support study required blood draws. Potential participants must not meet any of the following exclusion criteria: 1. Inability or unwillingness of a participant to give written informed consent or comply with study protocol. 2. BMI&gt;30 Kg/m2. 3. Contraindications to ATG, GCSF, exenatide, etanercept and IL2 (as per package insert, e.g., knowledge of hypersensitivity to drugs or its excipients). 4. Uncompensated heart failure, fluid overload, myocardial infarction or liver disease or severe impairment of a vital organ within the last 6 weeks before enrollment. 5. Any of the following laboratory findings: hemoglobin &lt;10.0 g/dL; leukocytes &lt;3,000/μL; neutrophils &lt;1,500/μL; lymphocytes &lt;800/μL; platelets &lt;100,000/μL. 6. Any sign or diagnosis of significant chronic active infection (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis, EBV, or CMV), or screening laboratory evidence consistent with a significant chronic active infection (such as positive for HIV, IGRA test for TB, or hepatitis BC). 7. Ongoing acute infections, e.g., acute respiratory tract urinary tract, or gastrointestinal tract infections. 8. Ongoing or anticipated use of diabetes medications other than insulin. 9. Current or ongoing use of noninsulin pharmaceuticals that affect glycemic control within prior 7 days of screening. 10. Current or prior use of immunomodulators or systemic steroids in the last 2 months that could potentially affect diabetes or immunologic status. 11. Recent recipient of any licensed or investigational live attenuated vaccine(s) within 6 weeks of randomization. 12. Use of investigational drugs within 3 months of participation. 13. Concomitant therapy with immunosuppressive drugs, immunomodulators, or cytotoxic agents, or previous therapy less than 3 months from randomization. 14. History or diagnosis of malignancy. Any history of gastroparesis or other severe gastrointestinal disease, pancreatitis, thyroid nodules or malignancy with the exception of a history of localized basal cell carcinoma. 15. Presence of an allograft. 16. AST, ALT or Alkaline Phosphatase &gt;2 times upper limit of normal or total bilirubin &gt;1.5 times upper limit of normal. 17. Current, diagnosed, mental illness or current, diagnosed or selfreported drug or alcohol abuse; or any situation that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the participant's ability to comply with study requirements. 18. Pregnancy or ongoing breastfeeding for women; unwillingness or inability of both females and males of childbearing age to use a reliable and effective form of contraception, for the entire duration of the study. 19. Past or current medical problems, or findings from physical examination, or laboratory testing, that are not listed above which, in the opinion of the investigator, may pose additional risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the participant's ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or interpretation of the data obtained.</criteria>
