	<brief_summary>This is a Phase Ib, open-label study of single and repeat doses of obinutuzumab administered as intravenous (IV) infusion in adults with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Participants will be enrolled into two cohorts receiving either one (Cohort 1) or two or more (Cohort 2) obinutuzumab infusions. Both cohorts will receive standard pretreatments to reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions (IRRs). In Cohort 1, 5 participants will receive single dose obinutuzumab IV infusion on Day 1. Following review of Cohort 1 aggregated safety data up to 4 weeks post dose for the last participant of cohort 1, cohort 2 will be allowed to proceed. In Cohort 2, 20 participants will receive obinutuzumab IV infusion on Days 1 and 15. Participants who qualify for transplantation and receive a compatible kidney offer after inclusion in Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 will receive two additional infusions (one at the time of transplantation and second at Week 24 post-transplantation) of obinutuzumab. Assessment of the safety and tolerability of the obinutuzumab regimen will be conducted at Week 24 of the desensitization phase and at Week 28 post-transplantation. All participants will be monitored for a minimum of 12 months following the last obinutuzumab infusion.</brief_summary>
