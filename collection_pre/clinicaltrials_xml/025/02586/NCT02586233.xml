	<criteria>Men and women 18 years of age and older. Subjects have a clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (including lacunar stroke) supported by computed topography or magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects have stroke symptoms onset within 4.5 to 12 hours before initiation of study drug administration. For subjects with a wakeup stroke, symptoms onset time refers to the last time the subject was known to be well. Subjects have a NIHSS score of â‰¥ 2. Subjects, (or their legally authorized representativewhere applicable and based on countryspecific practice), must give written informed consent to participate in the study prior to participating in any studyrelated procedures. A separate written informed consent is required for collecting a blood sample for genotyping. Subjects have been treated or are anticipated to be treated with tissue plasminogen activator and/or endovascular thrombectomy during current stroke. Eligible subjects declining these treatments can be enrolled to this study. Subjects have evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on noncontrast computed tomography (CT) (or magnetic resonance [MR]). Subjects have symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage, even with normal CT. Subjects have an Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) &lt; 6. Subjects have prior nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (excluding microhemorrahages observed in imaging). Subjects have known arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm. Subjects have evidence of active bleeding. Subjects have platelet count &lt; 100,000. Subjects have International Normalized Ratio &gt; 1.7. Subjects have used unfractionated heparin within 24 hours prior to treatment and have an elevated partial thromboplastin time. Subjects have used a nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or other factor Xa inhibitors within 24 hours prior to treatment. Subjects have used fondaparinux or low molecular weight heparin at an anticoagulation dose within 24 hours prior to treatment. Subjects with anticipated use of an anticoagulation dose of heparin, or fondaparinux or low molecular weight heparin, or nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or other factor Xa inhibitors within 48 hours of randomization. Low dose heparin or low molecular weight heparin at a preventive dose are allowed from 24 hours after treatment start and after confirmation of no intracranial bleeding on the 24hours repeat brain imaging. Subjects have blood pressure &gt; 185/110 mmHg, or require aggressive medication to maintain blood pressure below this limit (routine medical treatment is allowed to lower the blood pressure below this limit). Subjects have had intracranial surgery, clinically significant head trauma (in the opinion of Principal Investigator), Alteplase treatment, or a previous stroke within 1 month. Subjects have had major surgery within 14 days. Subjects have had gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding in the last 21 days. Subjects have had a lumbar puncture (or epidural steroid injection) within 14 days. Subjects have a preexisting disability classified by mRS &gt; 2. Subjects have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Subjects have baseline hemoglobin &lt; 10.5 g/dL. Subjects have a positive pregnancy test. Serum or urine pregnancy tests will be performed (according to sitespecific practice) in women of childbearing potential (childbearing potential is assumed in women up to 55 years of age). Subject is currently participating in another investigational study or has participated in an investigational drug study within 30 days or 5 halflives of that investigational drug prior to administration of the study drug. Subject is an employee or an immediate family member of an employee of the Sponsor, the CRO ((INC Research), or the Site. Any other reason, in the opinion of the Investigator, which precludes subject participation in the study.</criteria>
