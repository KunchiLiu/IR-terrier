	<brief_title>Evolution of the PR Interval in Patients Implanted With a Pacemaker Using the SafeR Mode</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational trial aims to study the evolution of the PR interval in patients implanted with a dual chamber pacemaker with the SafeR mode. The investigators will assess the prevalence and the incidence of PR lengthening and the investigators will study the long PR interval management by physicians, depending on the data embedded in the pacemaker.</detailed_description>
