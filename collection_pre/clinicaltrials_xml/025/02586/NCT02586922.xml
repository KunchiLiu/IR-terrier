	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine cut-off values for fetal lung volume by VOCAL and pulmonary artery resistance index by pulsed Doppler in fetuses of diabetic mothers, and correlate the results with postnatal respiratory distress of the term neonates.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fetal Lung Volume and Pulmonary Artery Resistance Index Measurement in Term Diabetic Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research question: Can the assessment of fetal lung volume by Virtual Organ Computed-aided Analysis (VOCAL) and pulmonary artery resistance index by pulsed Doppler predict neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in term fetuses of diabetic mothers? Research hypothesis: The assessment of fetal lung volume by VOCAL and pulmonary artery resistance index by pulsed Doppler can predict neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in term fetuses of diabetic mothers.</detailed_description>
