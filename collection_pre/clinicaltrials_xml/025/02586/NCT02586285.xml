	<brief_title>Effect of S-Adenosyl Methionine Treatment on Recurrence After Curative Resection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is now a major health problem. Although the recent advances in treatment of HCC have significantly improved the prognosis of patients with HCC, the overall survival rate is still unsatisfactory; the 5-year survival rate is only 50-70% even after curative treatment such as hepatic resection and percutaneous radiofrequency ablation. One of the reasons for the poor prognosis of HCC is its high rate of recurrence.However,anti-relapse treatment remains a pressing work to do. In recent years, some study reported that S-Adenosyl Methionine had an impact on promoting apoptosis and inhibiting the growth on breast cancer, colon cancer,gastric cancer and liver cancer in vitro and vivo. In this study, we aim to examine whether S-Adenosyl Methionine have an effect on improving patients' recurrence after curative resection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</detailed_description>
