	<brief_title>Effect of RVX000222 on Time to Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in High-Risk T2DM Subjects With CAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority (75%) of deaths in subjects with diabetes mellitus (DM) are due to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent studies suggest a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) rate of &gt;11% over 18 months in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) despite a baseline LDL-C of &lt;2.1 mmol/L. Bromodomains (BRDs) are a family of evolutionary conserved protein-interaction modules that play key functions in chromatin organization and regulation of gene transcription. One recognized family of bromodomain-containing proteins is the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family. BET inhibition represents a novel, epigenetic approach to treat CAD. RVX000222 affects biological processes important in atherosclerosis and acute coronary events via selective inhibition of BET proteins. RVX000222 is available as a capsule formulation with standard excipients and established stability. The BETonMACE study will focus on prevention of subsequent MACE in subjects with CAD and DM with high intensity statin therapy as co-medication.</detailed_description>
