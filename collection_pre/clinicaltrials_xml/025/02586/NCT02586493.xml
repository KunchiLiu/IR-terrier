	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The mainstay for treatment involves the use of inhaled medications, including short and/or long-acting bronchodilators along with inhaled corticosteroids. For inhaled medications, the choice of inhalation device is an important consideration because an inadequate technique reduces the effects of inhalation. Therefore, the development of an easy-to-use inhaler that delivers the drug to the lungs effectively, is important. This study will assess the correct use of the ELLIPTA inhaler by subjects with COPD and to assess ease of use of the ELLIPTA inhaler, as rated by those subjects determined to be using the inhaler correctly. Study will be divided into two visits i.e. Screening/Visit 1 (day 1) and Visit 2 (Day 28 +/-2) with a phone call on Day 8+/-2 days of Visit 1 to assess safety. In this multi-center, single-arm, randomised (to receive one of two versions of the ELLIPTA inhaler Ease of Use questionnaires), open-label, placebo study, only subjects who are have never used the ELLIPTA inhaler before and have an established diagnosis of COPD and receiving COPD therapy and are able to demonstrate correct use of the ELLIPTA inhaler at Visit 1 will be considered eligible to participate in this study. Approximately 252 subjects will be screened with an expectation of 208 subjects completing the study while demonstrating correct ELLIPTA inhaler use at visit 2.

	<criteria>Age: &gt;=40 years of age at Visit 1 Diagnosis of COPD with a documented history of COPD for at least one year, in accordance with the definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society. Severity of Disease: Post albuterol/salbutamol forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/ forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio &lt;0.70 and FEV1 &lt;=70% of predicted obtained within two years of Visit 1. Smoking History: Current or former (defined as subjects who have quit smoking for at least 3 months prior to Screening/Visit 1) cigarette smokers with a &gt;10 packyear smoking history (Number of pack years = [number of cigarettes per day divided by 20] x number of years smoked [e.g., 10 packyears is equal to 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years]). Current COPD Therapy: Currently receiving maintenance (with one or more longacting bronchodilators, such as a longacting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA; also known as a longacting anticholinergic) or longacting beta 2agonist (LABA) inhaler therapy (with no prior or ongoing use of ELLIPTA inhaler) for the treatment of COPD. Subjects must be able to continue using their currently prescribed COPD maintenance inhaler therapy throughout the study and as needed short acting betaadrenergic agonist (SABA) for rescue use. Ability to Use Inhalers: Subject must be able to demonstrate correct use of ELLIPTA inhaler within three attempts at Visit 1. Males Females who are not pregnant or not planning a pregnancy during the study or not lactating. Informed Consent: Capable of giving signed and dated written informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in the protocol. Subject understands and is willing, able, and likely to comply with study procedures and restrictions. Subject must be able to read, comprehend, and record information in English. A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply Asthma: Subjects with a current primary diagnosis of asthma. COPD medications: Receiving only inhaled shortacting betaadrenergic agonists, i.e., albuterol as their daily COPD therapy (as needed [prn] or regularly scheduled); Has changed maintenance COPD treatment within 4 weeks prior to Screening/Visit 1 or plans to change COPD treatment within 4 weeks of Visit 1. COPD/Exacerbations/Hospitalization: Subjects that have experienced a COPD exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids (oral, parenteral or depot) and/or antibiotics within four weeks of Visit 1. A subject must not have had any hospitalization for COPD within three months prior to Visit 1; Subjects with uncontrolled COPD, in the investigator's judgment that would affect subject's ability to evaluate "ease of use and correct use". Other Respiratory Disorders: Subjects with other respiratory disorders, including active tuberculosis, lung cancer, bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung diseases or other active pulmonary diseases. Lung Resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior to Screening/Visit 1. Oxygen: Use of longterm oxygen therapy (LTOT; defined as oxygen therapy prescribed for greater than 12 hours per day) or nocturnal oxygen. Other Disease Abnormalities: Historical or current evidence of clinically significant or rapidly progressing or unstable cardiovascular, neurological, renal, hepatic, immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which would affect the analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study; Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease, intellectual deficiency, poor motivation or other conditions that will limit the validity of informed consent to participate in the study. Compliance: Subjects at risk of noncompliance, or unable to comply with the study procedures, or unable to continue their current COPD medications. Alcohol and Drug Abuse: A known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse within the last 2 years. A history of hypersensitivity to any components of the study inhaler (e.g., lactose, magnesium stearate). In addition, patients with a history of severe milk protein allergy that, in the opinion of the study physician, contraindicates participation will also be excluded. Prior or Ongoing use of the ELLIPTA inhaler (including both investigational and commercially available product). Investigational Product: Subjects who have received an investigational drug and/or medical device within 30 days of entry into this study (Screening/Visit 1), or within five drug halflives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer.</criteria>
