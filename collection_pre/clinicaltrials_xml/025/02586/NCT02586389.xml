	<brief_title>Specimen Collection From Patients With Non-Hematologic Cancer for Use in Development of a Liquid Biopsy Assay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-significant risk multicenter, longitudinal specimen collection study. At the Baseline Visit, whole blood will be collected to be paired with either a previously collected tumor biopsy tissue sample or a prospectively collected tumor tissue sample. Whole blood samples will also be collected longitudinally at Interim visits for up to 5 years. Interim visits will be on a schedule dictated by their physician's standard-of-care management protocol. No more than 100mL of blood will be collected per month. Tumor tissue from recurrences will be collected for the duration of subject participation (after the Baseline Visit).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subject is 18 years of age or older; Subject is willing to provide written informed consent; Subject has a diagnosis of a nonhematologic cancer, has tumor in the body, and has either; 1. residual tumor tissue available for testing by the Sponsor; or 2. genomic profiling results from an IVD or LDT assay performed on tumor biopsy tissue; or 3. an invasive procedure (biopsy, surgery) scheduled following the Baseline Visit from which residual tumor tissue can be available for testing by the Sponsor. Subject is able, in the professional opinion of the investigator, to provide whole blood at the Baseline Visit and at the Interim Visits. Underwent curativeintent surgery for management of the presently diagnosed tumor, at any time prior to the Baseline Visit. Underwent targeted or nontargeted chemotherapy, hormone receptor blocking therapy, or radiation therapy prior to the Baseline Visit. Underwent an invasive procedure (biopsy, surgery, thermal ablation) in the 7 days prior to any blood collection (baseline or followup). Any medical or mental condition that would interfere with the subjects' ability to willingly give written informed consent.</criteria>
