	<brief_title>University of Michigan Youth Violence Prevention Emergency Department Brief Intervention (Project Sync)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Emergency Department (ED) based study will test the effectiveness of a tailored therapist delivered motivational interviewing intervention, and an informational pamphlet control condition (IC) on reducing violence in 14-20 year olds who present to the Hurley Medical Center (HMC). Eligible adolescents at the Hurley Medical Center (HMC) emergency department (ED) (based on eligibility criteria) will complete a computerized online survey. The goal of the intervention was to examine ways to reduce and prevention youth violence using techniques to change behavior in a respectful, non-confrontational, and non-judgmental manner. This one-on one counseling approach emphasizes individual choice and responsibility and differentiates between future goals/values and current behavior. At 2-months following their ED visit, eligible adolescents (both from the intervention group and control group) will meet with a research assistant and self-administer an online computerized follow-up survey. An online survey tool will be used for baseline, follow up and post-test surveys. Participants will self-administer the survey at the time of follow up, post-test and baseline.</detailed_description>
