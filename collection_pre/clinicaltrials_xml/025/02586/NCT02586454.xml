	<brief_summary>Patients who have undergone laparotomies often require multimodal postoperative pain regimes. In recent years, abdominal wall blocks have been included to become part of this in order to overcome side effects of systemic opioids and complications from epidural analgesia. Borglum popularised a new approach on abdominal wall blocks by introducing the transmuscular quadratus lumborum (QL) block. Transmuscular QL block is thought to be effective against somatic and visceral pain as local anaesthetic tends to spread from the site of injection to thoracic paravertebral spaces where the sympathetic chain lies. The objective of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of transmuscular QL block in patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) by measuring cumulative opioid consumption, pain score at rest and on movement 24 hours after TAH. Our hypothesis is patients given transmuscular QL block will have lower cumulative opioid consumption.</brief_summary>
