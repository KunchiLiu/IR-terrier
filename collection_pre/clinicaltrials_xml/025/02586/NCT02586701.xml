	<brief_summary>Investigation into prehabilitation by increasing the supervision of exercise in patients undergoing colorectal resection for cancer and comparing with patients involved in a rehabilitation group receiving exercise after surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supervised Versus Non-supervised Exercise on Adherence and Functional Outcomes in Colorectal Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aims of this research project are the following: To determine to what extent a structured multimodal prehabilitation regimen, which includes aerobic and resistance exercise, nutritional supplementation and psychological coping strategies, initiated before surgery, and continued while in hospital and after surgery, optimizes the recovery of functional walking capacity following colorectal resection for cancer. To understand which measures of immediate surgical recovery are sensitive to prehabilitation interventions and predict change in later outcome measures.</detailed_description>
