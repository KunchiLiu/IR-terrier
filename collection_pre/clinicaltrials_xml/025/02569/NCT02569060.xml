	<brief_title>Feeding America Intervention Trial for Health--Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For adults with diabetes mellitus, diabetes self-management education (DSME) is critical to achieving long-term control of blood sugar levels (glycemic control) and preventing diabetes-associated complications. This education is often difficult to access for highly vulnerable and marginalized adults in the United States. Furthermore, foods for a diabetic diet are often out of reach for food insecure households. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which food banks and food pantries can help reach this population with effective DSME, food, and access to primary health care. The investigators' primary outcome of interest is HbA1c improvement in the intervention group compared to a wait-listed control group of food pantry clients living with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.</detailed_description>
