Laboratory parameters as specified below: Hematologic: Platelet count &gt;40x10^9/L (may be posttransfusion); absolute neutrophil count &gt;1.0x10^9/L (growth factor use is allowed to bring pretreatment neutrophils to &gt;1.0x10^9 cells/L if marrow infiltration is involved). Hepatic: Total bilirubin &lt;3 x upper limit normal (ULN); and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤3xULN. Renal: Creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min (as estimated by the Cockcroft Gault equation or as measured by nuclear medicine scan or 24 hour urine collection); subjects requiring hemodialysis will be excluded. Anticipated survival of at least 6 months. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2. Female subjects of childbearing potential and nonsterile males must agree to practice at least one of the following methods of birth control with partner(s) throughout the study and for ≥3 months after discontinuing BGB3111 or ≥18 months following obinutuzumab treatment, whichever is longer: total abstinence from sexual intercourse, double barrier contraception, intra uterine device (IUD) or hormonal contraceptive initiated at least 3 months prior to first administration of study drug. Male subjects must not donate sperm from first study drug administration, until 3 months after BGB3111 discontinuation or 18 months following obinutuzumab treatment, whichever is longer. Known central nervous system lymphoma or leukemia. Known prolymphocytic leukemia or history of, or currently suspected, Richter's syndrome. Uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia or idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura. History of significant cardiovascular disease. Severe or debilitating pulmonary disease. History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to monoclonal antibody therapy. Prior BTK inhibitor treatment. Using medications which are strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitors and strong CYP3A inducers. Vaccination with a live vaccine within 28 days of the initiation of treatment. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation within 6 months, or has active graft versus host disease (GvHD) requiring ongoing immunosuppression. Receipt of the following treatment prior to first administration of BGB 3111, corticosteroids given with antineoplastic intent within 7 days, chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks, monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks. Participate in any investigational drug study within 28 days of study entry, or not recovered from nonhematologic toxicity of any prior chemotherapy up to ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia). History of other active malignancies within 2 years of study entry. Major surgery in the past 4 weeks. Active symptomatic fungal, bacterial and/or viral infection including evidence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV 1) seropositive status. Inability to comply with the study procedures. Pregnant or nursing women. Any illness or condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect the safety of treatment or evaluation of any study's endpoints.</criteria>
