	<brief_summary>The Objectives of this study is to determine the effect(s) of daily non-caloric artificial sweetener (NAS) consumption (sucralose or aspartame) on the composition of the bacteria and also to determine the changes in glucose metabolism.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Artificial Sweeteners on Gut Microbiota and Glucose Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial will be 12 weeks randomized, cross-over and double blinded with 2 treatment intervention ( sucralose and aspartame) , there will be a run in period (4 weeks), then phase 1 treatment period for two weeks followed by four weeks washout period then phase 2 treatment period(2 weeks). Healthy, normglycemic (&lt;5.6 mmol/L) males and females ( 12 of each) of age 20-30 y with a body mass index (BMI) 2-25 kg/m2 will be recruited. Each participants will be given the dose of sweetener aspartame or sucralose during the treatment phase in a double-blind procedure. the participant will be asked to consume the sweetener in a mixed flavoured beverage during each visit in the treatment phase. Blood and stool sample collection will take place before the run-in period, and after the washout period, as well as after each two-week treatment period. glucose measurement: Capillary blood will be collected during each visit by registered nurse. Blood will be collected at fasting and at 12,30,45,60,90 and 120 minutes after the participants drink a glucose drink (75g glucose) for Oral glucose tolerance test. a food frequency questionnaire will be given to each participant in order to estimate how often each sweetener is consumed on a daily basis. Participants will also be asked to complete weekly food diaries of food and drink consumption.</detailed_description>
