	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to learn about the patient and provider perceptions, priorities, preferences, and willingness to use/prescribe anticoagulation as a stroke prevention therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation. Qualitative interviews will be performed with atrial fibrillation patients and providers caring for atrial fibrillation patients. The investigators want to understand the factors that influence decision-making about anticoagulation medications, and to gain insight into patients' and providers' knowledge of the risk of stroke and bleeding associated with oral anticoagulation. This feedback will help provide better education to providers caring for patients with atrial fibrillation and better care to patients with atrial fibrillation by developing tools to optimize the appropriate use of oral anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
