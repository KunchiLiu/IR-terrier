Acceptable forms of contraception include implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, an intrauterine device, a vasectomized partner, an exclusively female partner, and doublebarrier methods. 3. If male (with female partner), a subject must agree to practice a reliable form of contraception or abstinence during the study. 4.

Have migraine with or without aura; if with aura, the aura cannot last longer than 60 minutes 1. Minors, even if they are in specified study age range 2. Medication overuse headache as defined by ICHD II: Opioids ≥ 10 days a month during the 90 days prior to screening Combination medications (e.g., Fiorinal®) ≥ 10 days a month during the 90 days prior to screening Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other simple medications &gt; 14 days a month during the 90 days prior to screening Triptans or ergots ≥ 10 days a month during the 90 days prior to screening 3. Subjects treated with onabotulinumtoxin A (Botox®) or other botulinum toxin treatment; or history of receiving such treatment during the 180 days prior to screening 4.

Subjects with hemiplegic or basilar migraine or other forms of neurologically complicated migraine 7. Subjects who have prolonged aura (i.e., more than 1 hour) 8. Cerebrovascular disease including but not limited to a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) 9. A history of migralepsy (seizure following a migraine) or a concurrent diagnosis of seizure disorder 10. Subjects who cannot differentiate between a migraine headache and tensiontype or cluster headache or other types of headache 11. Subjects with a history of more than occasional (based on Investigator's judgment) tensiontype headache (distinct from migraine headache days count). 12. Subjects with a history of cluster headaches 13. Subjects with the diagnosis of "probable migraine" (ICHD II) 14. Ischemic coronary artery disease (CAD): including but not limited to angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction or documented silent ischemia or coronary artery vasospasm, including Prinzmetal's angina 15. Subjects with WolffParkinsonWhite syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders 16. Subjects with a history of congenital heart disease 17. A history of uncontrolled hypertension or screening systolic/diastolic &gt; 140/90 mmHg 18. Have peripheral vascular disease including but not limited to ischemic bowel disease (IBD) and Raynaud's disease. 19. Any abnormal physiology and/or pathology which, in the opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor, which would be contraindicated for study participation and would not allow the objectives of the study to be met 20. Subjects who show any clinical laboratory or electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality that in the opinion of the Investigator would endanger the subject or interfere with the study conduct. If the results of the clinical laboratory or ECG are outside of normal reference range the subject may still be enrolled but only if these findings are determined to be not clinically significant by the Investigator. This determination must be recorded in the subject's source document prior to enrolment. 21. Fridericia's corrected QT (QTcF) interval greater than 450 msec 22. Severe renal impairment (creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl) 23. Serum total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL 24. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal 25. Subjects with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &gt; 7.0%, or with diabetes mellitus requiring insulin 26. A history of alcohol or substance use disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition V (DSMV) (including marijuana) within 1 year prior to screening 27.

Subjects who have received treatment with an investigational drug or device within 30 days of the screening visit or participated in a central nervous system clinical trial in the 3 months prior to screening 30. Subjects with any other medical condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator and/or Medical Monitor, would confound the objectives of the study (e.g., positive screening test for human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis B surface antigen positive or hepatitis C positive, a known history of systemic lupus erythematosis) 31. Subjects who plan to donate blood, sperm, or oocytes during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study medication 32. Subjects who are employees or immediate relatives of the employees of the Sponsor, any of its affiliates or partners, or of the study center</criteria>
