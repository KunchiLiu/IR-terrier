	<brief_title>Oral Sodium Fusidate (CEM-102) for the Treatment of Staphylococcal Bone or Joint Infections in Subjects for Whom Chronic Antibiotic Suppressive Therapy is Indicated</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CEM-102 for chronic antibiotic suppressive therapy of bone or joint infections. Subjects enrolling in this study must have a refractory staphylococcal bone or joint infection that requires suppressive antibiotic therapy (e.g. having an infection that cannot be managed by complete removal of the infected bone or foreign material, a refractory infection not responding to previous treatment, or not being a candidate for long-term intravenous antibiotic therapy).</detailed_description>
