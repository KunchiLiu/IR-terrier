	<criteria>I 1. Subject has provided written consent. 2. In the Investigator's opinion, the subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions, and protocol stated restrictions and is likely to complete the study as planned. 3. Male or female, 1870 years of age. 4. Body mass index (BMI) 1835 kg/m^2, inclusive. 5. A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (βhuman chorionic gonadotropin) pregnancy test at screening. 6. Female subjects must either: not be of childbearing potential defined as: i. Postmenopausal for at least 12 months (i.e., 2 years of amenorrhea without an alternative medical cause) and a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range (per reference laboratory), OR ii. Surgically sterile (e.g., underwent total hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral tubal clips without reversal operation), or otherwise incapable of becoming pregnant, OR be of childbearing potential AND not heterosexually active (e.g., abstinent or homosexual) from screening until 6 months after study drug administration (or longer, if dictated by local regulations), OR if heterosexually active have a vasectomized partner (confirmed sterile per verbal account of the subject), OR using an acceptable method of birth control from screening and agree to continue to use the same method of contraception throughout the study and for 6 months after study drug administration (or longer, if dictated by local regulations). Oral hormone based contraceptives are not allowed from 14 days before the planned study drug administration until 6 months after the last dose of treatment due to the potential for drugdrug interactions which might undermine their efficacy. An IUD, being either hormonal (i.e., IUS*) or nonhormonal, is considered highly effective and reliable; therefore subjects using an IUD/IUS are not required to use additional contraceptive methods (no doublebarrier method is required). Other nonoral hormonebased contraception methods (e.g., injectable, implants, transdermal system, vaginal ring) may be continued, but as the interaction of the study drug with hormonebased contraception is unknown, these methods are not considered to be reliable and therefore subjects should use a doublebarrier method (e.g., male condom+either diaphragm or cervical cap with or without spermicide). An IUS does not rely on systemic plasma concentrations and is therefore not expected to be impacted by a potential DDI. Note 1: Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Note 2: A male and female condom should not be used together due to risk of breakage or damage caused by latex friction. 7. A postmenopausal female who is receiving hormone replacement therapy and is willing to discontinue hormone therapy 30 days before study drug dosing and agrees to remain off hormone replacement therapy for the duration of the study may be eligible for study participation. Male subjects must either: be surgically sterile (had a vasectomy), or otherwise incapable of fathering a child, OR not be heterosexually active (e.g., abstinent or homosexual) from enrollment (Day 1) in the study until at least 6 months after study drug administration, OR if heterosexually active: have a partner who is postmenopausal (2 years amenorrhea), surgically sterile (e.g., has had a total hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral tubal clips without reversal operation), or otherwise incapable of becoming pregnant OR be practicing an acceptable method of birth control from enrollment in the study (Day 1) and agree to continue to use the same method of contraception throughout the study and for at least 6 months after study drug administration (or longer, if dictated by local regulations). An acceptable method of birth control for male subjects is a doublebarrier method (e.g., male condom+either diaphragm or cervical cap with or without spermicide). Note: Male subjects with a female partner who uses hormonal contraceptives (oral, injectable, implants) or a hormonal (IUS) or nonhormonal IUD and male subjects who are vasectomized or otherwise incapable of fathering a child are not required to use additional contraceptive methods. Note 1: Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Note 2: A male and female condom should not be used together due to risk of breakage or damage caused by latex friction. NOTE: Contraceptive use by men and women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for subjects participating in clinical studies if these are stricter than what is proposed in these inclusion criteria 8. Subjects must agree to refrain from sperm/egg donation from start of dosing through 6 months after the completion of study drug administration. 9. GT1a or 1b or GT2 or 3 CHC, depending on cohort, with positive HCV antibody and a positive HCV RNA at screening including documentation of CHC infection for at least 6 months. Genotype testing must occur at a screening visit. NOTE: GT1 patients are eligible for inclusion even if they cannot be successfully subtyped unless a specific subtype is required for a cohort. 10. Screening HCV RNA viral load ≥50,000 IU/mL, except for subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Child Pugh Class A) who may have HCV RNA viral load ≥10^4 IU/mL. 11. No prior treatment for CHC (defined as no prior exposure to any approved or investigational drug including directacting antivirals, and interferonbased treatments) 12. Fibroscan, collected within 6 months of baseline visit, with liver stiffness score ≤12.5 kPa to be eligible (except for subjects with cirrhosis, see below). • Subjects with compensated cirrhosis must meet the ChildPugh Class A definition (see Appendix G) and at least one of the following criteria: i. Liver biopsy result indicating the presence of cirrhosis (e.g., Metavir F4; Ishak &gt;5) or ii. Fibroscan evaluation with a liver stiffness score &gt;12.5 kPa 13. Subject is otherwise in good health as deemed by the investigator, based on the findings of a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECG. 14. Willing to avoid prolonged sun exposure and use of tanning devices while taking SMV and through 4 weeks of follow up. Subjects should also be advised to use a broadspectrum sunscreen and lip balm of at least sun protection factor &gt;30 to help protect against potential sunburn. 1. Pregnant, planning on becoming pregnant (during treatment and up to 6 months after the EOT), or breastfeeding female subject, or male subject whose female partner is pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant (during treatment and up to 6 months after the EOT) 2. Other than CHC with or without compensated cirrhosis, clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic, neurologic, thyroid or any other medical illness or psychiatric disorder, as determined by the Investigator and/or Sponsor's Medical Monitor. 3. History or other clinical evidence of significant or unstable cardiac disease (e.g., angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, diastolic dysfunction, significant arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, and/or clinically significant ECG abnormalities), moderate to severe valvular disease or uncontrolled hypertension at screening. 4. Screening echocardiogram ejection fraction &lt;55% or any other echocardiographic finding suggestive of clinically relevant cardiomyopathy. 5. Creatinine clearance of &lt;60 mL/min (CockcroftGault). 6. Positive test for HAV IgM, HBsAg, or HIV Ab. 7. Abnormal screening laboratory results that are considered clinically significant by the investigator. 8. History of clinical hepatic decompensation, e.g., variceal bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy or active jaundice (within last year). 9. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the study's objectives or the wellbeing of the subject or prevent the subject from meeting the study requirements. 10. Participation in an investigational drug trial or having received an investigational vaccine within 30 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to study medication. 11. Clinically significant abnormal screening ECG findings (e.g., PR &gt;200 msec, QRS interval &gt;120 msec or corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;450 msec for male subjects and &gt;470 msec for female subjects), based on an average of triplicate ECGs. Any evidence of heart block or bundle branch block is also exclusionary. 12. History or family history of abnormal ECG intervals, for example prolonged QT syndrome (torsade de pointes) or sudden cardiac death. 13. The subject has a positive prestudy drug screen, including methadone unless the drug is prescribed by the subject's physician.
