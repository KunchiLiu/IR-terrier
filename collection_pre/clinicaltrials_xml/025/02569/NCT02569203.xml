	<brief_summary>To determine whether high-protein (24% of total calorie from protein) enteral nutrition of immune modulating nutrients (eg, ω-3 fatty acids and antioxidants) enriched with β-glucan stimulates immune functions compared with standard enteral nutrition (control: 20% of total calorie from protein) or high-protein (24% of total calorie from protein) enteral nutrition of immune modulating nutrients without β-glucan in critically ill patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Immune-enhancing Enteral Nutrition on Immunomodulation in Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine whether high-protein (24% of total calorie from protein) enteral nutrition of immune modulating nutrients (eg, ω-3 fatty acids and antioxidants) enriched with β-glucan stimulates immune functions compared with standard enteral nutrition (control: 20% of total calorie from protein) or high-protein (24% of total calorie from protein) enteral nutrition of immune modulating nutrients without β-glucan in critically ill patients. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, 30 patients consumed 1 of 3 enteral nutrition: control, enteral nutrition of immune modulating nutrients enriched with β-glucan (250mg/L) or enteral nutrition of immune modulating nutrients without β-glucan. Enteral nutrition was initiated within 24 hours of ICU admission and continued during the ICU stay for a 7 days.</detailed_description>
