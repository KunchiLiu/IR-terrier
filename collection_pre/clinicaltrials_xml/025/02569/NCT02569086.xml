	<brief_summary>Antibiotic dosing in severe septic patients poses a challenge for clinicians due to the pharmacokinetic changes seen in this population. Piperacillin/tazobactam is often used for empirical treatment, and initial appropriate dosing is crucial for reducing mortality. The investigators aim is to determined the pharmacokinetic profile of piperacillin 4g every 8 hour in 20 patients treated empirically for severe sepsis. A PK population model will be established with the dual purpose to assess current standard treatment and to simulate alternative dosing regimens and modes of administration. Time above the minimal inhibitory concentration (T&gt;MIC) predicted for each patient will be evaluated against MIC for pathogens detected. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) targets evaluated are 100% f T&gt;MIC and 50% fT&gt;4xMIC. Only patients who are prescribed piperacillin empirically by the treating physician are enrolled in the study. The investigators have no influence on the choice of treatment prescribed to the patient.</brief_summary>
