	<brief_summary>Arteriosclerotic vascular-related diseases have become a serious threat to human health. The prevention and reversal of vascular events has become an important direction of medicine. Early vascular disease detection system includes pulse wave velocity (PWV), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR), flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), ankle-brachial index (ABI), insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), hypersensitivity C- reactive protein (hs-CRP), plasma homocysteine (Hcy), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), uric acid (UA), and so on. However, there is no international and domestic comprehensive study on simple and practical evaluation system by jointing application of these evaluation indexes to detect vascular disease. Combined evaluation function can simultaneously detect and evaluate vascular abnormalities, make up a single indicator shortcoming in clinical applications from multiple levels of vascular structure and function. However, all indicators testing not only cause time consuming, but also increase the burden on patients, resulting unnecessary waste of medical resources. Thus, the present study was to select appropriate indicators and effective joint, and establish the rating system, using the vascular system to predict the incidence of terminal events, and compare this system with the previous scoring system such as FRS (Framingham Risk Score) pros and cons.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aimed to establish vascular disease early detection system and scoring systems by comprehensive vascular disease risk factors and vascular function evaluation index. And prevention of vascular-related diseases, high-risk groups through positive lifestyle changes: such as lipid-lowering, smoking cessation, reversing early vascular lesions, to avoid end-stage vascular events. 1. Detection of vascular function indicators include: PWV, IMT, CFVR, FMD, CAVI, ABI, LDL-C, HOMA-IR, hs-CRP, Hcy, BNP, UA and so on. 2. Design the questionnaire: surveying the lifestyle, personal history, family history of the study population. 3. Follow-up:2 years of observation, recording the end time of vascular events, including cardiovascular events (acute myocardial infarction, angina, coronary reperfusion therapy), stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease. 4. Statistics: Complex the factors of vascular disease, screen for an effective indicator to predict cardiovascular events, and based on the weight of the different factors, the establish the rating system, use the system to predict the incidence of vascular events terminal, and compare the system with the previous scoring system such as FRS (Framingham Risk Score).</detailed_description>
