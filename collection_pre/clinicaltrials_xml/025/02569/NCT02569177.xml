	<brief_summary>Myocardial infarction and subsequent myocardial injury after cardiac surgery occurs in 7-15% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and is associated with an increased length of stay, and reduced short- and long-term survival. Cardiac troponin is considered to be a cornerstone in the diagnosis of a myocardial infarction. Heart-type Fatty Acid-Binding Protein (H-FABP) is a new sensitive biomarker for myocardial injury. The effectiveness of using the combination of H-FABP with Troponin to diagnose myocardial injury within 6 hours after the onset of ischemia is well reported. Previous studies in non-surgical patients have associated increased H-FABP with an increased risk of subsequent death and major cardiac events. The prognostic value in cardiac surgery patients has not been studied extensively. The objective is to estimate the association between biomarkers of myocardial injury and myocardial infarction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Myocardial infarction will be established with both a new and very early marker of myocardial injury (Heart-type Fatty Acid Binding Proteins) as well as to a known early marker of such injury (Cardiac troponin).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific aims: 1. To obtain an estimate of the association between a new very early marker of postoperative myocardial injury H-FABP and postoperative myocardial infarction. 2. To obtain an estimate of the association between cTn-I and postoperative myocardial infarction. 3. To obtain an estimate of the correlation between H-FABP elevation and cTn-I elevation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</detailed_description>
