	<brief_title>Low-dose IL-2 ( Interleukin-2) Treatment in Macrophage Activation Syndrome（MAS）</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autoimmune-associated macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), also known as secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), is a rapidly progressing life-threatening disease. VP16 (Etoposide) is a well-known standard therapy, but is associated with substantial adverse effects, especially myelosuppression and infections , while steroids and ciclosporin (CSA) are not always efficient in this disease. The investigators hypothesized that low- dose IL-2 could be a novel therapy in MAS. This clinical study will test the efficacy and safety of low dose IL-2 treatment in MAS. The investigators perform a single-centre pilot trial with rhIL-2 in MAS. The investigators evaluate the effectiveness and safeness of low-dose IL-2 for MAS.</detailed_description>
