	<brief_summary>Exertional angina is common symptom in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Although reduced myocardial flow reserve is one of the proposed explanations for angina, little is known about the pathophysiology. This study aimed that adenosine-stress cardiac magnetic resonance can be used for the assessment of myocardial perfusion reserve and suggest the pathophysiology of development of angina in patients with severe AS without obstructive CAD.</brief_summary>
