	<brief_title>Comparison of Intubating Condition of the Mcgrath Videolaryngoscope With and Without Muscle Relaxant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty-four patients with ASA classification I-II, who required oroendotracheal tube intubation, were studied in this prospective, double-blinded, randomized, clinical trial. Anesthesia was induced using fentanyl 1.5 mcg/kg, xylocaine 1.5 mg/kg and propofol 3 mg/kg. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups to receive either rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg or saline intravenously. The Mcgrath® VL intubation was initiated after 90s, when the patients were fully relaxed. The primary outcome was to compare tracheal intubating conditions between two groups. The secondary outcomes were the success rate in the first attempt intubation, time to intubation, the required propofol dose for intubation and anesthetic complications. Statistical analyses were performed using the R program version 2.14.2. The level of statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.</detailed_description>
