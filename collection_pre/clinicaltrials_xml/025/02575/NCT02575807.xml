	<brief_summary>This 2-part, phase 1/2 trial examines the side effects of cancer immunotherapy with CRS-207 alone and in combination with epacadostat (INCB024360), an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) inhibitor, and to see how well they work in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer who progressed on a platinum-based chemotherapy within 6 months. CRS-207 is a weakened (attenuated) form of Listeria monocytogenes that has been genetically modified to reduce its ability to cause disease, while maintaining its ability to stimulate potent immune response to kill tumor cells. Epacadostat is a potent, highly selective IDO1 inhibitor which stimulates immune cell activation in tumors.</brief_summary>
