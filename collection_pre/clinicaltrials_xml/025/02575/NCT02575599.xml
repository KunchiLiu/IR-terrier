	<brief_title>Web-based Guided Self-Determination Intervention for Adults With Type 2 Diabetes in General Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Web-based self-management programs have the potential to support adults with type 2 diabetes in managing their disease condition. However, improving health care outcomes through self-management interventions have shown somewhat ambiguous results. Therefore, it is suggested that interventions should be theory-based and incorporate well-defined counselling methods and techniques for behavioural change. To meet these challenges, the overall aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a theory-driven web-based Guided Self-Determination intervention among adults with type 2 diabetes in general practice in order to enable adults with diabetes to use their individual resources to self-manage their condition and reach treatment goals. A complex intervention design based on the framework of UK Medical Research Council is employed as a guide for developing and evaluating the intervention. This study consists of three phases: 1. the modelling phase adapting the original Guided Self-Determination program to adults with type 2 diabetes, using a qualitative design 2. feasibility assessment of the adapted intervention on the web, employing qualitative and quantitative methods and 3. evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention on diabetes self-management behaviours and HbA1c, using a quasi-experimental design. The two first phases will provide important information about the development of the intervention and its acceptability, whereas the third phase will assess the effect on health care outcomes of this systematically developed intervention.</detailed_description>
