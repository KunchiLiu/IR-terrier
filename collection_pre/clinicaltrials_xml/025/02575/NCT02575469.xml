	<brief_summary>Exercise capacity is a key factor to evaluate and treat patients in different diseases (e.g. ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis). The best way to measure exercise capacity is to perform a cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Normal/reference values in health and disease relate to specific population and subpopulations. The population in Israel is unique in its diversity. Objectives: Data collection of exercise capacity assessment in health and illness in the northern of Israel for future local database. Population: 500 Patients evaluated routinely in the exercise lab (pediatric cardiology institute) and healthy volunteers evaluated as controls. Study design: Prospective observational study. Participants will answer a health related questioner, undergo a physical examination, perform a cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill or a cycle ergometer.</brief_summary>
