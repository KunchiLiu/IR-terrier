	<brief_title>Natural History Study in Inherited Retinal Disease Subjects Caused by Mutations in RPE65 or LRAT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a retrospective, uncontrolled, multicenter, case history study to determine the natural history of visual function in patients with IRD phenotypically diagnosed as LCA or RP caused by autosomal recessive mutation in RPE65 or LRAT. Up to 60 subjects will be enrolled in this study at approximately 12 study centers in Canada, the US and Europe.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects aged 8 or older with IRD (LCA or RP) caused by inherited autosomal recessive mutation in either RPE65 or LRAT. Subjects who have at least 2 documented kinetic visual field assessments of the same isopter(s) in at least one eye performed at least 2 years apart on the same type of equipment when the subject was between the ages of 6 and 65 years. If applicable, subjects who provide informed consent for the study (the requirement for informed consent may be applicable to all sites or may be waived by the IRB and/or local regulations). The parent or guardian must sign an approved informed consent form for the study for subjects younger than the age of majority. Subjects, who in the Investigator's opinion, have any severe acute or chronic medical condition, psychiatric condition, physical examination finding or laboratory abnormality that may interfere with the interpretation of their visual function data. Subjects with concomitant bilateral ocular disorders that may affect visual acuity or visual fields (e.g., advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, advanced cataract, intraocular surgery).</criteria>
