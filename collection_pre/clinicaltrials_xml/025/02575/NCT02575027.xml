	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies the feasibility of palliative 4pi radiotherapy in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme that has come back after standard chemoradiation. A new radiotherapy delivery planning system, called 4pi radiotherapy, may help improve radiation delivery by improving dose coverage to the treatment target, while reducing the dose to surrounding normal tissues.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palliative 4pi Radiotherapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the accuracy of dose delivery and patient comfort with treatment time. II. To evaluate normal tissue dose volume statistics and compare to standard planning. OUTLINE: Patients undergo 4pi radiation simulation and planning followed by 5 to 10 daily fractions of 4pi palliative radiotherapy. If an acceptable plan cannot be achieved using 4pi planning, then the patient will be treated with standard radiation therapy planning for palliative re-irradiation. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) Patient must have previously undergone standard chemoradiation 59.4 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) or 60 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) with concurrent and adjuvant Temodar (temozolomide) Patient must be diagnosed with recurrent GBM either with biopsy or radiographically Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) &gt;= 70 Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent If a woman is of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test must be documented; women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; or abstinence) for duration of study treatment and for up to 4 weeks following the study treatment For the purpose of this study, all women are considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal at least 1 year since last menses), biologically sterile, or surgically sterile (i.e. hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation) Patients with active infection Patients with KPS &lt; 70 and/or unable to tolerate potentially longer treatment times Refusal to sign informed consent Pregnant women, or women of childbearing potential who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception for the entire study period and for up to 4 weeks after the study treatment Note: Concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy does not make a patient ineligible; participation in a concurrent treatment protocol does not make a patient ineligible</criteria>
