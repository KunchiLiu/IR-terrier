	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy (RT) alone is able to induce a clinically significant effect with a variable pathologic response (a pathological complete remission, pCR, defined as ≥ 95%, or ≤ 5% remaining visible tumour cells) in only about 10% of cases. A prior phase I study (PASART-1; NCT01985295) suggested that 25 x 2 Gy preoperative RT in combination with once daily 800mg oral pazopanib is feasible, while inducing tissue replacing tumor that can consist of fibrosis and necrosis in 40% of thus treated patients.</brief_summary>
