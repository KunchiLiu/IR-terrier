	<brief_summary>Purpose: To compare the outcome between sonography-guided steroid injection and direct steroid injection on carpal tunnel syndrome(CTS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sonography-guided Steroid Injection for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Material and methods: We have enrolled 26 ideopathic carpal tunnel syndrome patients (minimal to moderate according to Padua's classification).Thirteen patients were allocated in sonography approach group( sonography-guided local wrist injection, SAG) and the 13 patients were placed in direct approach group(direct local injection without using sonography, DAG). One , 3 and 6 months later after injection, we performed the outcome measures, including Boston symptom and functional scale, QuickDASH, nerve conduction study and sonography. If the patients receive the second injections, we will follow their treatment outcome by phone regularly at 1,3 and 6 months after first injection. If the patients were referred to surgery, the failures of local injection were considered and we will stop follow up them. After performing all assessment, we will compare the outcomes between the two groups.</detailed_description>
