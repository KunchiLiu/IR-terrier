	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: This is a multi-center trial. The phase 1 dose escalation trial will evaluate MLN0128 in a standard 3+3 successive cohort design to identify the highest planned dose level. Phase II trial subjects will be 1:1 randomized to receive either MLN0128 (investigational arm) or sorafenib (control arm). PHASE I DOSE ESCALATION INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT: Cohort 1 (dose level +1) will consist of 3-6 evaluable patients who will receive MLN0128 15mg on day 1 of the 28-day cycle. Cohort 2 (dose level +2) will consist of 3-6 evaluable patients who will receive MLN0128 20mg on day 1 of the 28-day cycle. Cohort 3 (dose level +3) will consist of 3-6 evaluable patients who will receive MLN0128 30mg on day 1 of the 28-day cycle. Subjects will be evaluated for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first 28 days of treatment (1 cycle). However, decisions to move to next dose escalation cohort will not be made until all subjects complete 2 cycles of therapy at a given dose. There will be no further dose escalation beyond dose level +3. PHASE II INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT: Randomization will take place following completion of the screening evaluations and eligibility assessments. Stratification factors will be employed during randomization to minimize between-arm assignment imbalance. - 1 Child-Pugh score 5-6 - 2 Child-Pugh score 7 Within the strata, subjects will be randomly assigned with equal probability to either the investigational arm (Arm A: MLN0128) or the control arm (Arm B: sorafenib). Arm A: MLN0128 will be administered orally at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) once weekly. Arm B: Sorafenib will be administered at 400mg PO BID daily, with dose adjustment per standard of care. A new treatment cycle (1 cycle = 28 days) will only be initiated when all of the following conditions are met: - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10*9/L - Platelets ≥ 50 x 10*9/L - Non-hematologic treatment related toxicities have improved to grade 1 or resolved per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE) Treatment may continue until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from study. Estimated Life Expectancy: ≥ 3 months Subjects must have adequate organ function, as specified below, within 7 days before study registration: Bone marrow reserve consistent with: - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10*9/L - Platelet count ≥ 50 x 10*9/L - Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Hepatic: - Total bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) - Transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤ 5 x ULN Renal: - Creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min based either on Cockcroft-Gault estimate or based on urine collection (12 or 24 hour) Metabolic: - Fasting serum glucose (≤ 130 mg/dL) and fasting triglycerides ≤ 300 mg/dL. - Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt;7.0%</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects 18 years or older at the time of informed consent. Voluntary written consent must be signed before performance of any study related procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that the subject may withdraw consent at any time without prejudice to future medical care. Females of childbearing potential must agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, or agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to prior to registration for protocol therapy. NOTE: Female subjects are considered of childbearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months. Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status postvasectomy), must agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 120 days after the last dose of study drug, or agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse. Subjects must have a diagnosis of measurable advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Advanced HCC is defined as disease not amenable to surgery, ablation, transplant, or embolic therapy. Phase II subjects must be willing to provide a tissue biopsy prior to registration if archived HCC tumor tissue is not available for correlative studies. For the phase I cohort, subjects with one prior systemic treatment are eligible. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1, or 2. Adequate organ function, as specified below, within 28 days before study registration: Bone marrow reserve consistent with: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L; platelet count ≥ 50 x 10^9/L; hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL; Hepatic: total bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminaseAST/SGOT and alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminaseALT/SGPT) ≤ 5 x ULN Renal: creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min based either on CockcroftGault estimate or based on urine collection (12 or 24 hour); Metabolic: Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≤7.0%, fasting serum glucose (≤ 130 mg/dL) and fasting triglycerides ≤ 300 mg/dL.
