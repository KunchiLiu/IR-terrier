	<brief_title>Development of a Community Engagement Activity for Advance Care Planning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While many patients and caregivers of individuals with chronic illness recognize the importance of advance care planning, many feel uncomfortable initiating end-of-life conversations with loved ones. Few tools exist that effectively engage caregivers and address their particular concerns and needs. The investigators have preliminary data showing that an easily implementable intervention (a conversation game) effectively engages healthy participants in realistic and satisfying ACP conversations. However, the investigators have not yet tested the acceptability or feasibility of using the game in a population of caregivers and/or patients with chronic illness. This pilot project will enable us to engage community-based patients and caregivers to determine if they find the game a satisfying, acceptable, relevant, and effective tool for advance care planning.</detailed_description>
