	<brief_summary>EGFR-TKI is the main is the first line therapy for local advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR gene mutation. The median progression free survival time is around 11 months with the first generation EGFR-TKI. Patients with acquired resistance with first generation EGFR-TKI usually with EGFR exon 20 mutation (T790M). Change the drug administration maybe prolong patients PFS and evently prolong OS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1st generation EGFR-TKI has reversible binding to EGFR, it also bind to T790M in a high dose which is account about 60% patients acquired resistance to the drug. Resistance patients may be benefit to a bolus drug use to block T790M gene.</detailed_description>
