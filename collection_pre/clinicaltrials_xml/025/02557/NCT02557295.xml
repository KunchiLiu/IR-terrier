	<brief_title>An Observational Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Remsima™ in Patients With RA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to assess the long-term safety of Remsima™ in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients by evaluation of events of special interest (ESI) up to 5 years and to exploratory compare patients receiving Remsima™ with patients receiving non-biologic treatments or other anti-TNF drugs. In order to assess the primary study outcomes, the following ESI will be evaluated: - Hepatitis B virus reactivation - Congestive heart failure - Opportunistic infection (excluding tuberculosis) - Serious infections including sepsis (excluding opportunistic infections and tuberculosis) - Tuberculosis (TB) - Serum sickness (delayed hypersensitivity reactions) - Haematologic reactions - Systemic lupus erythematosus/lupus like syndrome - Demyelinating disorders - Lymphoma (not HSTCL) - Hepatobiliary events - Hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma (HSTCL) - Serious infusion reactions during a re-induction regimen following disease flare - Sarcoidosis/sarcoid-like reactions - Leukaemia - Malignancy (excluding lymphoma) - Skin cancer - Pregnancy exposure† - Infusion reaction associated with shortened infusion duration - Others The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate efficacy. Further, additional safety of Remsima™ in RA patients, in comparison with patients receiving non-biologic treatments or other anti-TNF drugs. Health-economics parameters will also be assessed.</detailed_description>
