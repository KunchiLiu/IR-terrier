	<brief_summary>Epidermis that lacks moisture and/or sebum presents as dry skin, which is often characterized by a pattern of fine lines, scaling and itching. In dry skin, the barrier function may be compromised. Skin care practices to decrease the risk of development of dry skin and/or to improve dry skin condition have barely been investigated. Bathing with bath oils has been shown to increase skin hydration, thus helping to stabilize skin barrier function. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of bathing every other day on the skin barrier. Functional parameters, such as TEWL, stratum corneum hydration (SCH) and skin-pH (pH) were measured to characterize skin barrier function.</brief_summary>
