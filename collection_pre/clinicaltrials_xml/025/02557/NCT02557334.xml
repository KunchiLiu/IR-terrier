	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of freeze dried strawberry powder on LDL cholesterol, central and peripheral blood pressure, indices of arterial stiffness, and other lipid and lipoprotein concentrations. The investigators hypothesize that the bioactive compounds in freeze dried strawberry powder may elicit beneficial effects on LDL cholesterol, as well as blood pressure and arterial health.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed study design is a 3-period randomized crossover dose-response study to evaluate the effect of freeze dried strawberry powder supplementation on LDL-C and vascular health. Research participants will be overweight or obese (BMI 25-39 kg/m^2) but otherwise healthy adults with moderately elevated LDL-C (&gt;116 mg/dL or &gt;3.0mmol/L), blood pressure &lt;160/100 mmHg, total cholesterol below 240 mg/dL, and triglycerides below 350 mg/dL. Subjects will be randomly assigned to three supplementation periods: 1) low dose freeze dried strawberry powder (13 g/d); 2) high dose freeze dried strawberry powder (40 g/d); and 3) a placebo powder. Each powder will be provided for 4-6 weeks, separated by a 2-week washout period between treatment periods. Baseline and endpoint testing will include blood collection and vascular testing.</detailed_description>
