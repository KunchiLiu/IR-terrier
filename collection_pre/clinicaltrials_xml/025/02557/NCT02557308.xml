	<brief_title>An Observational Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Remsima™ in Patients With Ankylosing Spondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of Remsima™ in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients, in comparison with patients receiving other anti-TNF drugs, by evaluation of events of special interest (ESI) for up to 5 years from the first visit of each patient. In order to assess the primary study outcomes, the following ESI will be evaluated: Identified risks: - Hepatitis B virus reactivation - Congestive heart failure - Opportunistic infections (excluding tuberculosis) - Serious infections including sepsis (excluding opportunistic infection and tuberculosis) - Tuberculosis - Serum sickness (delayed hypersensitivity reactions ) - Haematologic reactions - Systemic lupus erythematosus/lupus-like syndrome - Demyelinating disorders - Lymphoma (not HSTCL) - Hepatobiliary events - Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma (HSTCL) - Serious infusion reaction during a re-induction following disease flare - Sarcoidosis/sarcoid-like reactions - Leukaemia Potential risks: - Malignancy (excluding lymphoma) - Skin cancer - Pregnancy exposure† The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate efficacy and additional safety of Remsima™ in AS patients, in comparison with patients receiving other TNF blockers.</detailed_description>
