	<brief_summary>This is an international multicenter, open-label, sequential phase study of intralesional (IL) PV-10 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition. Stage IV metastatic melanoma patients with at least one injectable cutaneous or subcutaneous lesion who are candidates for pembrolizumab will be eligible for study participation. In the Phase 1b portion of the study, all participants will receive the combination of IL PV-10 and pembrolizumab (i.e., PV-10 + standard of care). In the subsequent Phase 2 portion of the study participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either the combination of IL PV-10 and pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone (i.e., PV-10 + standard of care vs. standard of care).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PV-10 in Combination With Pembrolizumab for Treatment of Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to 24 eligible subjects will be enrolled in the Phase 1b portion of the study. Each subject in this cohort will receive the combination of IL PV-10 and pembrolizumab. A total of an estimated 120 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the two treatment arms (i.e., PV-10 + pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone) in the Phase 2 portion of the study. This number of subjects may be modified based on emerging evidence of preliminary efficacy and effect size from the Phase 1b portion of the study. Subjects assigned to receive PV-10 in Phase 1b and 2 will receive initial IL PV-10 to their injectable cutaneous and subcutaneous lesions commencing on study Day 1 for up to 13 weeks (i.e., investigational Treatment Phase of the study). PV-10 may be re-administered at 21-day (3-week) intervals during the Treatment Phase of the study to any remaining, uninjected cutaneous and subcutaneous lesions until all injectable cutaneous and subcutaneous lesions have been injected. Lesions that fail to exhibit complete ablation may be re-injected on this schedule. Pembrolizumab will be administered at 21-day (3-week) intervals per prescribing information (label) commencing on study Day 1 for up to 24 months or until disease progression, toxicity requiring discontinuation of study treatment or study termination.</detailed_description>

Thyroid function abnormality ≤ Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) Grade 2. 1. Untreated or clinically active melanoma brain metastases. Subjects with ≤ 3 brain metastases and each ≤ 1 cm size that were treated with either surgical resection and/or radiation therapy are eligible for study participation provided (a) there is no evidence of progressive central nervous system (CNS) disease on brain imaging at least 30 days after definitive treatment and (b) the subject is not taking prednisone at &gt;10 mg or equivalent daily. Subjects with &gt; 1 cm or &gt; 3 in number treated brain metastases are eligible for study participation provided (a) there is no evidence of progressive CNS disease on brain imaging at least 90 days after treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy and (b) if the subject is not taking prednisone at &gt;10 mg or equivalent daily. 2. Prior treatment with PV10 or any antiPD1 antibody Subjects previously treated with any antiPDL1 antibody are eligible for study participation). 3. Prior cancer therapy or anticancer vaccine within 4 weeks of initial study treatment. 4. Known sensitivity to any of the products or components to be administered during dosing. 5. Concurrent or Intercurrent Illness: History or evidence of symptomatic autoimmune pneumonitis, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or other systemic autoimmune disease. Evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression. Impaired wound healing or other extremity complications due to severe or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus in subjects whose Injectable Lesions are located in an extremity. Severe peripheral vascular disease (i.e., severe claudication [pain occurring after less than 200 meters of walking], rest pain, ischemic ulceration or gangrene) in subjects whose Injectable Lesions are located in an extremity. Significant concurrent or intercurrent illness, psychiatric disorders, or alcohol or chemical dependence that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, compromise the subject's safety or compliance or interfere with interpretation of study results. Uncontrolled thyroid disease or cystic fibrosis. Clinically significant acute or unstable cardiovascular, cerebrovascular (stroke), renal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, immunological, endocrine, or central nervous system disorders. Malignancy other than melanoma within 2 years of enrollment except for: adequately treated (i.e., with curative intent) basal or squamous cell carcinoma, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, in situ ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast, in situ prostate cancer, or limited stage bladder cancer. 6. Pregnancy: Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating. Female subjects who have positive serum pregnancy test taken within 14 days of initiation of study treatment. Female subjects of childbearing potential (defined as having a menstrual cycle within the past 12 months and not having had a surgical procedure to accomplish sterilization) who are not using highly effective contraception (e.g., oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, double barrier methods such as condoms and diaphragms, abstinence or equivalent measures). Male subjects who are unwilling to use acceptable method of effective contraception. 7. Subjects unable to comprehend and give informed consent are excluded.</criteria>
