	<brief_title>The Effect of Obesity in Dexmedetomidine Metabolic Clearance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators expect to find an inverse correlation between the amount of fat mass and liver blood flow or with the enzymatic metabolic capacity. Results will be based on a population pharmacokinetic modeling analysis performed in NONMEM program. The investigators will first account for the effect of different measured size scalars on volumes and clearances and then they will search for plausible covariates (liver blood flow, enzymatic capacity, degree of hepatic steatosis, etc) on dexmedetomidine metabolic clearance. A pharmacokinetic model capable of characterizing clearance changes in the obese using more plausible biological covariates will be tried to be defined.</detailed_description>
