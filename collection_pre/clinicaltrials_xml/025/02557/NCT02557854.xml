	<criteria>Age 140 years Histologically confirmed malignant extracranial solid tumor The subject's tumor must have relapsed after or failed to respond to frontline therapy and there must be no other known curative therapies available. Subject must have a life expectancy of &gt; 8 weeks Karnofsky performance status &gt; 50% for patients &gt;16 years of age, or Lansky performance status &gt; 50% for patients &lt; 16 years of age. The subject must have at least 1 measurable target lesion &gt;10mm in longest dimension that is in an anatomic location treatable by MRHIFU. Note that for this study, lesions in bone WILL be considered measurable provided they meet the other criteria by RECIST and are confirmed to be metabolically active on baseline studies by either MIBG uptake (for neuroblastomas) or PET avidity. Target lesions should be located so that they can be adequately heated by a hyperthermia treatment cell with a diameter of up to 58 mm, centered at a depth of 35 to 80 mm from the skin. There should be no staples, implants, extensive scarring, or other highly ultrasound absorbing or reflecting tissue in the expected beam path. For the first 5 patients enrolled on this study only, the lesion must be located in the extremities or pelvis to be considered treatable by MRHIFU. The subject must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior therapy with the exception of alopecia. The following time must have elapsed from the last dose of the following medications to study enrollment: myelosuppressive chemotherapy 14 days hematopoetic growth factors 7 days (14 days for Neulasta) biologic agent 7 days monoclonal antibody 3 halflives immunotherapy (ie tumor vaccines) 42 days palliative small port XRT 14 days substantial bone marrow XRT 6 weeks stem cell transplant or infusion without TBI 12 weeks total body irradiation (TBI) 24 weeks Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below: absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcL platelets ≥ 75,000/mcl (without transfusion for 7 days) hemoglobin &gt; 8g/dL (may receive transfusions) total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL ALT(SPGT) &lt; 225 U/L (45 U/L defined as ULN) creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR &gt; 70 mL/min/1.73m2 OR a serum creatinine (mg/dL) less than or equal to the following: Age (yrs)Male (mg/dL)Female (mg/dL) 11.990.60.6 25.990.80.8 69.9911 1012.991.21.2 1315.991.51.4 &gt;161.71.4 Adequate cardiac function defined as an ejection fraction &gt; 50% or shortening fraction &gt; 27% Cumulative lifetime anthracycline dose of &lt; 450mg/m2 Females and males of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. A male of childbearing potential is any male (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a vasectomy, or remaining celibate by choice) who has attained Tanner stage III or greater sexual development. A female of childbearing potential is any female (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria: Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or Has undergone menarche OR is &gt; 13 years of age Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days of treatment. Signed written informed consent must be obtained prior to any study procedures. Subjects may not be receiving any other investigational agents or anticancer therapies. Subjects with known active brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial. Patients with brain metastases that have been treated and stable for &gt; 30 days following treatment will be eligible. Subjects who have received prior Doxil and progressed on this therapy are not eligible, but subjects may have received prior doxorubicin. Subjects with a history of tumor progression within 30 days of anthracycline administration are not eligible. However, subjects who have previously received an anthracycline and subsequently relapse greater than 30 days after their most recent prior dose of anthracycline will be eligible. History of allergic reactions attributed to doxorubicin or Doxil Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants. Subjects with a contraindication to MRHIFU Subjects with conditions that carry high anesthetic risk in the opinion of the treating anesthesiologist are not eligible (i.e. subjects with significant airway compression by tumor or craniofacial abnormalities)</criteria>
