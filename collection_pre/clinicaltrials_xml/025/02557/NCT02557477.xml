	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to assess whether supplementation of Omega 3/6 fatty acids improves mainstream schoolchildren's reading ability. The secondary objective was to assess whether Omega 3/6 improves cognitive functions such as attention, memory, learning, language/communication, problem solving and social ability.This was a 3-month randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by one-way crossover (placebo to active treatment) for an additional 3 months. Mainstream schoolchildren aged 9-10 years were initially randomised to receive three Omega 3/6 capsules twice daily or identical placebo. All outcome measures were assessed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. The primary outcome measure was the LOGOS test, a comprehensive test battery for evaluating reading abilities. Secondary outcome measures were the parent-rated Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale-IV, 5-15 scale (domains of learning, memory, language/communication and problem solving); Social and Communication Disorders Checklist (to evaluate social ability)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This was a 3-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Period 1) followed by one-way crossover (placebo to active treatment) for an additional 3 months (Period 2). Participants were randomized to receive three Omega 3/6 capsules twice daily (corresponding to a daily dose of 558 mg EPA, 174 mg DHA, and 60 mg gamma-linolenic acid) or identical placebo capsules (palm oil). All daily doses were taken at home supervised by the parents. All outcome measures were assessed at baseline and at the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits. The participants were mainstream schoolchildren in the 3rd school year (aged 9-10 years). Exclusion criteria were continuous supplementation of Omega-3 fatty acids for periods longer than 1 month during the previous year, significant medical conditions (e.g. diabetes, epilepsy), intellectual disability, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis, psychoactive medication, or substance use.</detailed_description>
