	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of the study is to evaluate a method for offering mutation analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to all patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, regardless of age at diagnosis and family history. Information about the study as well as pre-test genetic counseling will primarily be given in a written way. In addition to that, if a study participant wishes to, she can also receive pre-test telephone genetic counseling.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Written Genetic Counseling and Mutation Analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study population: All patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer in southern Sweden are offered inclusion in the SCAN-B study at the time of diagnosis pre-surgery. If they consent to that, a part of the tumor is sent to a lab in Lund, Sweden, for research purposes (RNA sequencing etc.). Patients that are included in the SCAN-B study are eligible for inclusion in BRCAsearch, see inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study procedure (summary): 1. An envelope with written information is given to the patient at the visit to the surgeon the week after surgery. This envelope contains a written genetic counseling, information about the study, an informed consent form, psychosocial questionnaires and our contact information (telephone, e-mail). The patient can contact a genetic counselor for pre-test telephone genetic counseling if she wishes to. 2. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are analyzed by full sequencing. 3. Non-carriers are informed about the test result with a letter. Mutation carriers and VUS (variants of uncertain significance) are telephoned and given a time for an appointment at the Department of Clinical Genetics within a week. 4. Psychosocial self-reported questionnaires (HAD scale, EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BR23) are delivered at 3 times: At invitation to the study, one month after information about test result, and one year after information about test result.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. The patient is included in the SCANB study. 2. The patient is recently diagnosed with an invasive breast cancer or a ductal cancer in situ. 3. The patient has signed an informed consent form. 1. The patient is unable to understand the written information in Swedish. 2. The patient's psychological state, due to chronic och temporary reasons, is such that one could suspect that information about the study or genetic testing could be substantially detrimental to the psychological wellbeeing.</criteria>
