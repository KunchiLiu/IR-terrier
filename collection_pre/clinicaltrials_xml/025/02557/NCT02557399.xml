	<brief_summary>This is a multicentre, randomized, single-blind (investigator is blinded), active (the combination therapy of adapalene [ADA] and clindamycin [CLDM])-controlled and parallel-group study in Japanese subjects with facial acne vulgaris. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of CLDM 1 percent (%)-benzoyl peroxide 3% (Duac®: trademark owned by GlaxoSmithKline) once daily fixed dose combination gel versus combination therapy of ADA 0.1% gel and CLDM 1% gel in the topical treatment of facial acne vulgaris for 12 weeks. A total of 400 subjects will be screened for enrolment. Subjects will use Duac® fixed dose combination gel with quantity sufficient to cover entire face (including the forehead, nose, cheeks and chin) once daily in the evening (at bedtime) or combination therapy of ADA 0.1% gel with quantity sufficient to cover entire face (including the forehead, nose, cheeks and chin) once daily in the evening (at bedtime) and CLDM 1% gel twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening (at bedtime) for 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
