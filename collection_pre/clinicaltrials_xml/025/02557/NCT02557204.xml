	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to investigate the difference in the first attempt and overall success rate of different techniques for insertion of nasogastric tube. Secondary aim is to investigate the difference of the duration of insertion using the selected technique, complications during insertion such as kinking, knotting, mucosal bleeding</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Different Methods of Nasogastric Tube Insertion in Anesthetized and Intubated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two hundred adult patients, who received general anaesthesia for elective abdominal surgeries that required nasogastric tube insertion, will be randomized by means of a computer-generated randomization order into four groups: Conventional group (Group C), head in the lateral position group (Group L), endotracheal tube assisted group (group ET) and video laryngoscope group (group MG). Success rate of the selected technique (first attempt, second attempt and overall), duration of insertion for selected technique, complications such as kinking and mucosal bleeding will be noted.</detailed_description>
