	<brief_title>Combined Modality Therapy in Hepatoblastoma: South Egypt Cancer Institute Experience</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common malignant liver tumor in children, with an incidence of 0.7 to 1 per million children &lt;15 years of age. Till 1970s, surgery was the primary modality of treatment of HB. Unfortunately, up to 60% of the patients present in an unresectable stage. Later, the chemo- responsiveness of the tumor was demonstrated which led to the incorporation of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatinum and doxorubicin in the treatment of HB. International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) pioneered the concept of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the management of HB. Patients &amp; Methods: In the period from 2002 January till 2016 January, retrieval &amp; analysis of the medical records of pediatric patients with hepatoblastoma will be made at the pediatric oncology department, South Egypt Cancer Institute which represents the largest referral center in Upper Egypt. After pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis, these data will be categorized according to patients' demographics, presenting features, laboratory studies, including tumor markers &amp; histologic subtype, radiographic evaluation, disease staging, treatment course given, and subsequent treatment outcomes.</detailed_description>
