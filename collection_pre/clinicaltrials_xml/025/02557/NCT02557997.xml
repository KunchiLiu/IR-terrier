	<brief_summary>We aim at comparing markers of HIV reservoir, monocyte function and immune activation between antiretroviral therapy (ART)-na√Øve (chronic infection or primary infection), ART-controlled or ART-failing HIV infected adults initiating a dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimen. The investigators' purpose is to measure cell associated HIV-1 DNA, monocyte function [soluble CD14 (sCD14), soluble CD163 (sCD163)], and immune activation [neopterine, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)] biomarkers at different time points between baseline and week 48 post DTG-based regimen initiation in each group.</brief_summary>
