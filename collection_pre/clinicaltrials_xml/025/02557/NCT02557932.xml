	<brief_title>Comparison of 7-day PPI-based Standard Triple Therapy and 10-day Bismuth Quadruple Therapy for H. Pylori Eradication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current Helicobacter pylori management guidelines recommend proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-Clarithromycin containing triple therapy as 1st line treatment. However, in Korea, eradication rates of PPI-Clarithromycin containing triple therapy have been decreased to less than 80% due to increased clarithromycin resistance. In areas of high clarithromycin resistance (resistance rate more than 15%), guidelines recommend bismuth quadruple therapy as a 1st line treatment for H. pylori eradication. Clarithromycin resistance rates reported from 15.7% to 42.1% in Korea, thus, bismuth quadruple therapy may be better 1st line treatment than PPI-Clarithromycin containing triple therapy. However, only one limited study was performed to compare effects of the both treatment regimens in Korea. Thus, studies evaluating the effect of 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy as the first line treatment for H. pylori infection.</detailed_description>
