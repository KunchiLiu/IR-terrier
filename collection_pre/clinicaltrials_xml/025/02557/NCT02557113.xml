	<brief_summary>Leakage of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is the most common complication during vertebral body augmentation and can lead to serious patient morbidity. Any measure to reduce the rate of cement leakage is of value and makes the procedure safer.The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the creation of a cavity on cement leakage during vertebroplasty. Investigators tested the hypothesis that the creation of a merely small and irregular cavity in vertebral body prior to cement injection would reduce cement leakage.</brief_summary>
