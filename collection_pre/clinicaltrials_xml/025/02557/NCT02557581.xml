	<brief_summary>The role of cAMP signaling mediated by beta2-adrenergic stimulation with agonists has been well-studied in skeletal muscles of animals. Studies in humans are scant and the scope of the present study is thus to investigate the role of cAMP signaling by beta2-adrenergic stimulation for muscle adaptations in humans.</brief_summary>
