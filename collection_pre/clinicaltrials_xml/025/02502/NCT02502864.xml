	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to adjust the amount of docetaxel participants receive based on the level of docetaxel measured in their blood. This method of dose adjustment is called pharmacokinetic (PK)-adjusted docetaxel. The researchers believe that adjusting the dose of docetaxel using this method will lessen the side effects associated with docetaxel in cancer treatment.</brief_summary>
