	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate whether the type of fluid (0.9% saline or 6% Hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4) in the context of an individualized goal-directed fluid therapy is associated with a difference in morbidity and mortality within the first 14 days in patients at moderate-to-high risk of postoperative complications after abdominal surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluid Loading in Abdominal Surgery: Saline Versus Hydroxyethyl Starch (FLASH Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fluid administration is the mainstay treatment for suspected hypovolemia during surgery, but the effects of different crystalloid and colloid solutions on outcome remain poorly explored in surgical patients. Two recent international multicenter studies (6S and CHEST studies) have shown that, compared to crystalloid solutions, the use of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) could be responsible for higher morbidity, especially renal failure, and mortality in ICU patients, thus leading to a recent restriction of their range of indications. In contrast, in surgical patients, recent meta-analyses have concluded on the absence of difference in terms of mortality and postoperative renal failure between crystalloids and latest generation HES. Excessive fluid administration during surgery is associated with increased risk of postoperative morbidity, including renal dysfunction and mortality. It has been suggested that, compared with the volume-restoring effects of colloids, crystalloid use may require the administration of higher fluid volumes, which may contribute to poorer outcomes. In the surgical context, clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that individualized goal-direct fluid administration can reduce postoperative morbidity. Although most GDT studies have used colloid solutions for fluid loading, the effects of the type of fluids are currently unknown and crystalloids are proposed for first-line therapy. The proposed Flash multicenter study will be conducted to assess if the use of HES or crystalloid solutions during an individualized GDT contribute to outcome differences in patients at moderate-to-high risk of postoperative complications after abdominal surgery. As these fluids are widely used during surgery and because of current concerns about the risks related to the use of HES-based products in ICU patients, the trial will provide important data to clinicians involved in perioperative care.</detailed_description>
