	<detailed_description>General anesthesia lowers FRC thereby promoting airway closure and absorption atelectasis. Alveolar recruitment manoeuvers recruit collapsed alveoli, increase gas exchange, and improve arterial oxygenation. However, the effect of recruitment manoeuvre is short lasting and does not extend to the post operative period. Postoperative CPAP keeps the lung open and can improve oxygenation in the early postoperative period.</detailed_description>
