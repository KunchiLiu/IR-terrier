	<brief_title>Microwave Ablation for Pulmonary Metastases From Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From June 2010 to June 2015, 48 unresectable lesions in 32 patients with pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer were selected for CT-guided microwave ablation. Patients were scheduled for a 1 and 3 month CT follow-up to evaluate lesion diameter.We retrospectively evaluated CT-guided percutaneous microwave (MW) ablation safety and efficacy in pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer.</detailed_description>
