	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well cediranib maleate and olaparib work when given together or separately, and compares them to standard chemotherapy in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has returned after receiving chemotherapy with drugs that contain platinum (platinum-resistant) or continued to grow while being treated with platinum-based chemotherapy drugs (platinum-refractory). Cediranib maleate and olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether giving cediranib maleate and olaparib together may cause more damage to cancer cells when compared to either drug alone or standard chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the efficacy and identify (in)active arm(s) of the combination of cediranib (cediranib maleate) and olaparib, cediranib alone, olaparib alone, and physician's choice standard of care chemotherapy, as measured by progression-free survival (PFS) in the setting of recurrent platinum-resistant or-refractory ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. (Phase II) II. To assess the efficacy of the combination of cediranib and olaparib, and active monotherapy experimental arm(s) from Randomized Phase II, as measured by overall survival (OS) and PFS, as compared to physician's choice standard of care chemotherapy in women with recurrent platinum-resistant or-refractory ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. (Phase III) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the efficacy of the combination of cediranib and olaparib, cediranib alone, olaparib alone, and physician's choice standard of care chemotherapy, as measured by objective response rate (ORR: partial or complete response) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, in the setting of recurrent platinum-resistant or-refractory ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. (Phase II) II. To assess safety endpoints, as measured by frequency and severity of adverse events by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v).4.0.

(Phase III) IX. To assess the effect on secondary measures of quality of life, as assessed by the treatment side effects (TSE) and function/well-being (F/WB) subscales of the NFOSI-18, sensory neuropathy as measured by the FACT/GOG-Ntx-4, and health utility as measured by the EQ-5D, of single agent olaparib or cediranib and combination, compared to standard chemotherapy, in the setting of recurrent platinum-resistant or-refractory ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. (Phase III) OUTLINE: PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. ARM I (REFERENCE REGIMEN): Patients undergo physician's choice of standard of care chemotherapy, comprising either paclitaxel intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 28 days (Regimen I); pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on day 1 every 28 days (Regimen II); or topotecan hydrochloride IV on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days or days 1-5 every 21 days (Regimen III). Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II (CEDIRANIB MALEATE AND OLAPARIB): Patients receive cediranib maleate orally (PO) and olaparib PO as determined from an ongoing Phase I study. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM III (CEDIRANIB): Patients receive cediranib maleate PO daily continuously. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM IV (OLAPARIB): Patients receive olaparib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PHASE III: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I (REFERENCE REGIMEN): Patients undergo physician's choice standard of care chemotherapy as in Phase II Arm I. ARM II (CEDIRANIB AND OLAPARIB): Patients receive cediranib maleate PO and olaparib PO as in Phase II Arm II. ARM III (SINGLE AGENT): Patients receive either olaparib maleate PO or cediranib PO, as determined by the Phase II study. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>
