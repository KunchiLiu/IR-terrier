	<brief_title>Effect of Medical Interventions in Insulin Resistance on Prevalence of Abnormal Glucose Tolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The situation of type 2 DM prevention in China is serious. The commonly accepted natural course of type 2 DM is as follows: obesity, insulin resistance(hyperinsulemia), abnormal glucose tolerance, DM and complications of DM; correspondently, the function status of pancreas islet β cells are: normal, compensatory, decompensatory, impaired and failure. Post researches have proved that using medical interventions after the period of insulin resistance when the function status of β cells were compensatory, the course could not be reversed. There were few clinical researches about effects of medical interventions in the period of insulin resistance . This research would take medical interventions in subjects of insulin resistance without abnormal glucose tolerance, to see if there were different prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance in different groups.</detailed_description>
