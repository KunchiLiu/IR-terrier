	<detailed_description>Cambodian Americans have high risk for major depressive disorder and for type 2 diabetes. Depression is a known risk factor for diabetes. Some antidepressants can also increase risk of depression by causing weight gain. DREAM will test the effect of lifestyle and medication therapy management (MTM) on diabetes risk among depressed Cambodian Americans. Community health workers (CHWs) will deliver the lifestyle intervention and assist pharmacists with MTM. Lifestyle and biological risk factors for diabetes, such as depressive symptoms and insulin sensitivity, will be measured before and after the interventions.</detailed_description>
