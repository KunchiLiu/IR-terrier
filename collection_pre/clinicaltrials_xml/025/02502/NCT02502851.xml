	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the success of lesion preparation with either rotational atherectomy or cutting/scoring balloons as well as the long term effects of a hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent in an angiographically well-defined group of patients with complex calcified coronary lesions.</brief_summary>
