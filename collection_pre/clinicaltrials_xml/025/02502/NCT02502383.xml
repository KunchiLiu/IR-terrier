	<brief_summary>Using a previously created weight management program for adolescents, the intervention will be implemented through school-based health centers (SBHC) and will be delivered by SBHC providers trained in Motivational Interviewing. Students at intervention school sites will be compared to students at control school sites. All students will have baseline, 1 year, and 2 year follow-up to assess if students in the intervention school sites will have improved risk factor profile for metabolic syndrome, improved nutrition and increased physical activity when compared with students at control school sites.</brief_summary>
