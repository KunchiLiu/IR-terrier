	<brief_title>Benefits of CTO-PCI in Selected Cases With HFrEF (CTOHFrEF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observational studies have shown that chronic total coronary occlusion percutaneous intervention (CTO-PCI) improves angina, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and survival. None of these studies aimed to assess the benefits in populations with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The investigators studied the effect of CTO-PCI on left ventricular function and clinical parameters in patients with HFrEF. Using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), the investigators studied 29 patients with HFrEF and evidence of viability and/or ischemia in the territory supplied by an occluded vessel who were successfully treated with CTO-PCI. Non-CTO PCI was also performed in patients with multi-vessel disease, . Imaging parameters, clinical status, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were evaluated before and six months after CTO-PCI.</detailed_description>
