	<brief_summary>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth cause of death in the Western world. About 40% of pancreatic cancer patients were diagnosed as locally advanced unresectable status without distant metastasis. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was a reasonable treatment modality for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. However, several adverse events of chemoradiation could lead unfavorable treatment results, which included unique gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities, such as ulcer and hemorrhage in the stomach and duodenum that are included in the radiation field. According to the study in the investigators hospital, 45% of locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with CCRT suffered from GI ulcers, and among them, 65% of the patients experienced the significant hemorrhage events. Although these GI toxicities, the studies for radioprotective agents were limited. Albis® is a newly developed drug comprised of ranitidine, bismuth and sucralfate. The investigators will investigate the radioprotective effect of Albis® for locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with CCRT.</brief_summary>
