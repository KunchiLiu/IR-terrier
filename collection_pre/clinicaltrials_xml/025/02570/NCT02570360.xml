	<brief_summary>The research study compares the substance abuse treatment outcomes (e.g., craving, withdrawal symptoms, rates of use, abstinence) of standard intensive outpatient care, with or without an added 6-wk aerobic exercise component. In addition, certain biomarkers associated with both exercise and substance use (e.g., endocannabinoids and cortisol) will be assessed. In a rolling admissions format over the course of a year, approximately 36 treatment-seeking substance users who are currently receiving Intensive Outpatient Treatment through a local Alcohol or Other Drug Abuse agency will be randomized to either receive 6 weeks aerobic exercise training in addition to standard care or standard care with 6 weekly laboratory visits to complete questionnaires (18 per group).</brief_summary>
