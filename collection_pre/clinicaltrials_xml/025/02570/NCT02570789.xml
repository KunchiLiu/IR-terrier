	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether certain metabonomics and/or lipidomics features in correlation with pharmacokinetics before, during and after treatment with sunitinib or pazopanib in first line can predict toxicity and efficacy of sunitinib or pazopanib in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients.</brief_summary>
