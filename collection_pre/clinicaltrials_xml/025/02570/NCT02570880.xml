	<brief_title>Effect of Dough Fermentation Time of Bread on the Glycaemic Index</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The worldwide prevalence for non-communicable diseases (NCD) is increasing, nutrition is considered to be one of the main modifiable risk factors. An unhealthy diet leads to obesity, which is a further risk factor for NCDs. Excessive carbohydrates but also the nutritional quality of carbohydrates, can be elements defining "unhealthy diets". The nutritional quality of carbohydrates can be expressed as the glycaemic index. Fermentation time of bread dough could affect the ensuing bread quality to such an extent that it influences ist glycaemic index. If this hypothesis is confirmed, the process of breadmaking could be optimized in order to offer healthier bread varieties on the market.</detailed_description>
