	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate the temporal organization of autobiographical memory in patients with schizophrenia. Patients and control participants will be invited separately to participate in a 1hour walk in the city of Strasbourg and at the same time, to carry an automatic camera around their neck, which is called SenseCam®. Pictures obtained with SenseCam® will be later presented to the participants during the session of test. They will be asked to determine the chronological order of 12 pictures corresponding to 12 particular events of the tour. Then they will be asked to watch the complete sequence of photos from the tour and to determine the beginning and ending of the events that have occurred during the tour. According to the investigators hypotheses, patients should have difficulty to find out the correct chronological order of the photos and to determine the appropriate beginnings and endings of the events</brief_summary>
