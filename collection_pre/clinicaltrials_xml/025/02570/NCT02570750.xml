	<brief_title>The Effect Of Smoking Status Of The Patient On The Success Of Etanercept Therapy In Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study hypothesis was based on the following rationale: - Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with several extracutaneous manifestations and significant comorbidities (among others cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity and depression). - An increased prevalence of smoking among psoriasis patients, as compared with healthy subjects, has been observed in several studies - More recent studies suggest that cigarette smoking may trigger the development of psoriasis through oxidative, inflammatory and genetic mechanisms.Furthermore, smoking is associated with the clinical severity of psoriasis - Smoking also contributes to higher morbidity and mortality from smoking related disorders in these patients There is now some evidence that patients with psoriasis who smoke tend to be less responsive to treatment</detailed_description>
