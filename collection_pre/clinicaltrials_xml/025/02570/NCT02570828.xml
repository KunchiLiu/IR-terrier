	<brief_summary>This is a study to evaluate thermal imaging as a technology to monitor the normal clearing of amniotic fluid from healthy newborns and newborns suspected of having a condition called transient tachypnea of the newborn, or TTN. Thermal images are taken using an imaging device that attaches to an iPhone. This device, commercially known as FLIR ONE, creates a non-identifiable image based on the heat pattern of an object. In this case, the object is a child's chest and back. It does not emit any radiation like an x-ray does.</brief_summary>
