	<brief_summary>The study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of CSJ137 in chronic hemodialysis patients. It is hypothesized that treatment with CSJ137 may improve the level of hemoglobin in patients on chronic hemodialysis with iron-restricted anemia while reducing the need for dosing with erythropoietin and intravenous iron in these patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This posting discloses information about Part 1 of CCSJ137X2201. Another part, Part 2, of this trial is planned for conduct subsequent to the initiation of Part 1 and will have a different design than Part 1. The details of the design for this additional part are planned for disclosure in advance of conduct of Part 2.</detailed_description>

Receiving chronic erythropoietin (EPO) therapy; EPO dose not increased by 50% or more during 14 days prior to baseline. 4. Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 8.5 and &lt; 11.5 g/dL at baseline. 5. Ferritin &gt;500 ng/mL and ≤ 1000 ng/mL at screening. 6. TSAT ≤ 50% at a minimum of one time point during the 90 days prior to baseline, and TSAT ≤ 50% at baseline. 1. Known diagnosis of hemochromatosis, bone marrow malignancy, lymphatic malignancy or myelodysplastic syndrome. 2. History of dialysis AV fistula thrombosis within 2 months prior to screening, or 2 or more episodes of AV fistula thrombosis within 6 months prior to screening. 3. Liver disease/dysfunction (ChildPugh score ≥ 6), prior liver transplant, heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV); gastrointestinal bleeding. 4. A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen test result. Patients with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection may be included if all other liver function eligibility criteria are met. 5. ALT, AST or bilirubin ≥ 1.5x ULN within 4 weeks prior to baseline. 6. Uncontrolled renal osteodystrophy defined as intact PTH ≥ 750 pg/mL at screening. 7. Conditions predisposing to an increased risk of serious infection, such as an indwelling vascular catheter (central venous line or hemodialysis catheter) or active infection requiring antibiotic therapy at any time during the 2 weeks prior to screening. 8. Blood transfusion administered within 4 weeks prior to baseline. 9. Cancer patients who are actively undergoing chemotherapy at screening or who have received chemotherapy within 3 months prior to screening. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
