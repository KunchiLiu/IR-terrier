	<brief_summary>This study aims to perform a comprehensive neuro-cognitive evaluation of the 4-7 year old children from the Pediacam cohort (ANRS 12140 /12225, NCT02043418). It is expected thereby to provide complementary information to the trials CHER and PREDICT on the long term development of (1) HIV-infected children according to age at ARV initiation and (2) HIV exposed but not infected children, all compared with the control group of children uninfected, unexposed to HIV.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cognitive, motor and sensorial impairments associated to HIV infection have been and remain important concerns in children. The advent of ARV has reduced the frequency and the extent of HIV-related encephalopathys, but literature suggests that more limited impairments remain (CHER and PREDICT trials). These neuro-cognitive disorders might constitute an important public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa where a high percentage of children born to HIV+ women live. Nevertheless,the knowledge on their long-term consequences on children development in this context remains limited. Data on the burden of cognitive, motor and sensorial impairment in resource-limited settings as well as on the interaction with other factors that could also impair children development are scarse. The Pediacam cohort gives the opportunity to better understand the development of children born to HIV-infected mothers - infected by HIV or not - followed up from birth and living in sub-Saharan Africa.</detailed_description>
