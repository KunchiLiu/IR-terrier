	<detailed_description>The purpose of this prospective, multicentric, phase II study is to determine the feasibility of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in stage IV selected oligometastatic patients, by looking at acute and late toxicity. Investigators also want to verify what is the impact of local control in irradiated metastatic foci in the context of the systemic disease, how local control can affect disease free survival and overall survival, and moreover quality of life of patients treated.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age ≥18 years WHO performance status ≤ 2 Histologicallyproven of primary cancer disease M1 stage with primary cancer site radically treated with complete response/resection or stable. No other site of disease in progression (a maximum of 3 lymph node sites of disease to treat) Diameter ≤ 5 cm Abdomen/pelvic site Informed consent. Patients were required to have not brain metastases or bone metastases. Patients with a life expectancy of &gt;3 months. Any serious disease contraindicated radiation therapy Other coexisting malignancies, uncontrolled intercurrent illness, active infectious processes, and exudative, bloody, or cytologically malignant effusions excluded patients from the trial. Additionally, patients were excluded from the trial if they were receiving any systemic chemotherapy during radiotherapy, although hormonal therapy was allowed.</criteria>
