	<brief_title>A Phase III Trail of Adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Versus Adjuvant Radiotherapy in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient Population: Age: 18-70y; Thoracic esophageal squamous cell cancer undergoing radical esophagectomy; Clinical stage T1-4, N1-3, M0; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score: 0-1; The patients are randomized to 2 arms. Arm A: Adjuvant radiotherapy (50.4gray/28fraction) followed by chemotherapy (Paclitaxel and carboplatin) 4 cycles. Arm B :Adjuvant radiotherapy (50.4gray/28fraction) only</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically documented squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus; undergoing radical esophagectomy; the pathological stage is T(primary tumor)14 N(regional lymph nodes)13 M(distant metastasis)0 (ESOPHAGUS, Union for International Cancer Control(UICC) 2010) ; 2. Untreated (e.g. radiotherapy, chemotherapy, target therapy and immunotherapy); 3. The expectation of life is more than 6 months; 4. Age: 18~70 years old; 5. Normal hemodynamic indices before the recruitment (including white blood cell count&gt;4.0×109/L, neutrophil count&gt;1.5×109/L, platelet count &gt;100×109/L, hemoglobin≥90g/l, normal liver/kidney function); 6. ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) : 01; 7. Able to understand this study and have signed informed consent. 1. Have been treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other anti tumor treatment except surgery; 2. Known or suspected of allergy to paclitaxel or carboplatin; 3. Female in pregnancy or lactating; 4. With significant psychological, family, social and other factors which may affect the ability to understand and sign the informed consent; 5. Patients with peripheral neuropathy(CTC grade≥2); 6. With other malignant tumors before the recruitment. 7. The researchers consider that the patient is not appropriate to enroll the study; 8. The patient can't be tolerant to postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy for serious heart/lung/liver/kidney function, the haematopoietic system diseases, the immune system diseases, the nervous system diseases, cachexia and so on.</criteria>
