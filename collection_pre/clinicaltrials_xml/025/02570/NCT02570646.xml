	<brief_summary>Using a single-arm trial design, this study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of evaluating QuitAdvisorDDS, a clinical decision support software application designed to facilitate implementation of evidence-based tobacco treatment interventions into the dental setting. The study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of evaluating the impact of the QuitAdvisorDDS tool on patient outcomes related to tobacco use and cessation attempts as well as provider knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding tobacco treatment. Practitioners (dentists and hygienists) will complete surveys at baseline and follow-up, while patients will complete surveys at baseline and 1-month follow-up. An embedded substudy will also evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of collecting biospecimens (saliva) to serve as biochemical verification of smoking status.</brief_summary>
