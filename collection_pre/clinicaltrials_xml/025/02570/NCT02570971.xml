	<brief_summary>Ciguatera poisoning, caused by the ingestion of ciguatoxin-containing fish, is a global public health concern. In the US, the vast majority of ciguatera poisonings occur in Florida, followed by Hawaii and California. Equipoise exists in the medical literature regarding the effectiveness of mannitol therapy in treatment of ciguatera poisoning. While there are many case reports attesting to its utility, the only randomized control trial (RCT) comparing mannitol therapy with supportive care failed to show any significant benefit from mannitol treatment for a variety of clinical outcomes. Investigators therefore propose a second, larger RCT to test this question.</brief_summary>
