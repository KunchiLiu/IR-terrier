	<brief_summary>The Ablative Solutions, Inc. Peregrine System Infusion Catheter is a catheter-based device which is intended to be used to ablate the afferent and efferent sympathetic nerves serving the kidneys. The catheter is inserted via the femoral artery, steered into the renal artery, and then delivers, by infusion from its distal end, a neurolytic agent. This targets the nerve bundles, which are in the adventitia - a sheath surrounding the artery. The aim is to reduce blood pressure in cases of hypertension, including seriously elevated blood pressure which does not respond to drug treatment. This study will evaluate the safety and performance of the device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Peregrine Post-Market Study for the Treatment of Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is strong evidence in the published literature that the renal nerves are important contributors to hypertension, and that their ablation does not have adverse side-effects. The literature provides technical, clinical and scientific evidence supporting the use of perivascular renal denervation for a carefully defined patient group. An existing device (the Medtronic Symplicity catheter) was initially shown to be safe and effective for achieving perivascular renal denervation by delivery of radio-frequency energy. The results of early nonrandomized clinical studies (HTN-1, HTN-2) found that perivascular renal denervation by radio-frequency energy delivery was an effective therapy, associated with very low risks. In other contexts, denervation can also be safely and effectively achieved by neurolytic agents. The ASI Peregrine System™ Infusion Catheter and the denervation procedure in general is similar enough to the Medtronic Symplicity catheter to enable the use of published data to establish the validity of the design concept of the Peregrine System and estimate the likely levels of risk of side effects. It can be concluded from the literature that the ASI Peregrine System™ will achieve percutaneous renal denervation with a low risk of procedural complications (comparable to accepted percutaneous interventional therapies) and without long-term impairment of renal artery or kidney function or other serious adverse events. Previous premarket clinical trials have provided support for the safe and effective use of the Peregrine Catheter for the treatment of patients with hypertension. The Peregrine System Infusion Catheter is currently CE marked and the indication for use is "The Peregrine System™ Infusion Catheter is intended for the infusion of a neurolytic agent to achieve a reduction in systemic blood pressure in hypertensive patients." Based upon the literature and previous clinical data, chemical denervation is an appropriate treatment for the specified study population of adults who have hypertension despite taking at least 3 anti-hypertensive drugs of different classes including at least one diuretic. The objectives of this post-market study are to collect additional safety and performance data pertaining to renal denervation by using dehydrated alcohol as a chemical neurolytic agent delivered into the adventitial/peri-adventitial area of the renal arteries for the purpose of renal denervation, using the Peregrine System™ Infusion Catheter, in patients with hypertension. In order for the study to be valid, only one chemical neurolytic agent can be used. The Coordinating Investigator has chosen to use dehydrated alcohol (not less than 95% by volume) for therapeutic neurolysis, therefore all participating sites will usethis agent.</detailed_description>

Subject has a 24hour mean systolic Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurement (ABPM) ≥ 135 mm Hg with ≥ 70% valid readings (as determined by measurement device); 4. Subject with hypertension is receiving and adhering to a stable medication regimen of at least 3 antihypertensive medications of different classes (for at least 4 consecutive weeks), one of which must be a diuretic. 5. Subject agrees to have all study procedures performed, to comply with medication regimen and is able and willing to comply with all study followup visits. 6. Subject has provided written informed consent. 1. Subject has a contraindication known for conventional percutaneous interventional procedures. 2. Subject has known or suspected secondary hypertension; 3. Subject has type 1 diabetes mellitus; 4. Subject requires chronic oxygen support; 5. Subject has primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension; 6. Subject has a known bleeding diathesis. Subjects who are on anticoagulation therapy (vitamin K antagonist, factor Xa inhibitor or direct thrombin inhibitor) must be able to withhold medication before the procedure, on the advice of their Physician or the Investigator. For the decision and management of medication withdrawal, the Physician and Investigator should consider the ACCP Guidelines: Perioperative Management of Antithrombotic Therapy, 9th Edition; 7. Subject has thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100,000 platelets/µL); 8. Subject is pregnant or nursing or planning to become pregnant; 9. Subject has an eGFR ≤ 45 mL/min, based on the CKDEPI equation; 10. Subject has imagingassessed renal artery anatomy abnormalities or variations based on Investigator's evaluation of the screening images [i.e. MRA examination and/or renal angiography]) meeting one of the following criteria: If either of the renal arteries (up to 2 on each side) has a diameter of &lt;5 mm or &gt;7 mm or a length of &lt;11 mm each Accessory renal arteries with diameter &gt;2.0 mm and &lt;5.0 mm Renal artery stenosis &gt;60% of the normal diameter segment (diameter stenosis, compared to the angiographically normal proximal or distal segment) Aneurysm Excessive tortuosity Moderate or severe renal artery calcification Previous stenting or balloon angioplasty of the renal arteries Previous renal denervation; 11. Subject has a history of nephrectomy, a single kidney or kidney tumor, or urinary tract obstruction (with potential for hydronephrosis); 12. Subject is known to have a unilateral nonfunctioning kidney or unequal renal size (&gt;2 cm difference in renal length between kidneys); 13. Subject has a renal transplant; 14. Subject has a history of heterogeneities in the kidney such as cysts or tumors (however patients with simple renal cysts may be enrolled if the nephrologist/hypertensionist and Investigator determine the cyst(s) to be clinically insignificant); 15. Subject has a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, or stroke/TIA within the last six months; 16. Subject has hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease; 17. Subject has heart failure (NYHA III or IV) or has an ejection fraction ≤ 30%; 18. Subject has an implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), pacemaker or neurostimulator or any metallic implant which is not compatible with magnetic resonance imaging. NOTE: If a subject is not eligible for MRA, but is otherwise eligible for the study, the Investigator may choose to perform contrast angiography using fluoroscopy to make the final determination of anatomic eligibility; 19. Subject has a known allergy to contrast media which cannot be managed medically 20. Subject has a life expectancy of &lt;12 months; 21. Subject is currently enrolled in other potentially confounding research, i.e., another therapeutic or interventional research trial. Subjects enrolled in observational registries may still be eligible.</criteria>
