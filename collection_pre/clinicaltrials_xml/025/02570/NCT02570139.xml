	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Assess a New Barrier Film's Ability to Provide Skin Protection Against Incontinence &amp; Allow Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluated the product performance of a new skin protectant formulated to protect damaged and denuded skin even in the presence of exposure to the most potentially damaging body fluids, such as liquid stool and gastric fluid. The product is expected to intimately adhere to damaged and denuded skin and provide better protection from further damage than commonly used products such as moisture barrier pastes, thereby making it easier for nursing staff to cleanse the skin after incontinence episodes, thus saving time and also materials. The denuded sites on buttocks/thighs will be scored for skin loss and degree of redness. Over the course of time, with the skin protected, it should re-epithelizes. The skin improvement will be scored and the change in baseline over time monitored.</detailed_description>
