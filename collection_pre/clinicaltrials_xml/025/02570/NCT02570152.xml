	<brief_title>A Cohort Study to Determine the Incidence of Dengue Fever and to Build Capacity for Dengue Vaccine Trials in Dengue-endemic Regions of South Asia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to estimate the burden of dengue illness in selected sites South Asia and to prepare sites for the conduct of future vaccine efficacy trials. Operational goals include: - Build long-term collaboration with sites in dengue-endemic regions of South Asia where the incidence of clinical dengue illness can be studied. - Establish dengue surveillance cohorts that can be followed long-term. - Establish operational feasibility of future Phase III studies with regard to recruitment, case capture and sampling procedures. - Prepare sites for participation in Phase III clinical endpoint studies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject and/or subject's parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) (LAR[s]) who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol.

Subject is part of a household with at least one child (aged less than 18 years) and in which informed consent (and assent if applicable) to study participation was obtained from at least one adult and one child. Male or female aged between and including 6 months and 50 years at the time of enrolment. Subject who plans, at the time of enrolment, to remain at same residence/study area during the twoyear study period. Child in care. Participation (current or planned) in another epidemiological study or in a clinical trial that would conflict with the current study, based on investigator's judgement. Terminal illness based on investigator's judgement. Mental incapacity based on investigator's judgement.</criteria>
