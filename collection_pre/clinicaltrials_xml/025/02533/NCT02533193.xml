	<brief_title>Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Protocal Versus Traditional Care in Laparoscopic Hepatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ERAS programs has been proved to be a useful solutions in patients undergoing colorectal surgery in terms of significantly reduced postoperative complications and shorter length of hospital stay, compared to the patients of conventional treatment.
