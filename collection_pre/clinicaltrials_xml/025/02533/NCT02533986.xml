	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a 4-weeks intake of berry peel powder on fasting and postprandial glucose metabolism and inflammatory markers. The berry peel product will be compared with a placebo in a single-blind, cross-over design. Furthermore, inflammation-related peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) genes expression, appetite and cognitive performance will be included as a pilot study. Investigators hypothesize that long-term consumption of polyphenols and fibres of berry peel will exhibit both direct and indirect actions in healthy overweight subjects by improvement of glucose-associated markers as well as ameliorating inflammation. Moreover, above metabolic markers will correlated with improvements in inflammation-related PBMCs genes expression, subjective appetite and cognitive performance after long-term consumption of berry peel as a source of polyphenols.</brief_summary>
