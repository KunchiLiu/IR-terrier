	<brief_summary>The presence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) has a high frequency in patients victims of a coronary artery disease (CAD) (myocardial infarction, revascularization). Unlike patients seen in a sleep Laboratory with an impact on daytime functioning, CAD apneic patients do not complain in their daytime functioning. The objective of this study is to explore whether the objective cognitive assessment measures may be a good marker of the efficacy of CPAP treatment given to non-sleepy apneic CAD patients. Coronary patients with an AHI between 15 and 40 / h will be treated (or not) after randomization with CPAP treatment. The expected results are: CPAP apneic coronary patients should have a positive impact on cognitive performance, particularly on attention span and working memory measured by improvement in the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test score (PASAT score).</brief_summary>
