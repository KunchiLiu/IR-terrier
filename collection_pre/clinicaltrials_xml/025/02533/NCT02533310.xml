	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy as a treatment for specific phobia (spiders). A gamified virtual reality simulation of one-session therapy (VR-OST) will be compared to the gold-standard treatment in the form of traditional one-session phobia treatment (OST) using in-vivo stimuli. This study was powered to detect a non-inferiority margin of a 2-point difference between groups.</brief_summary>
