	<brief_title>Optimal Patient Turning for Reducing Hospital Acquired Pressure Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single site, open label, two arm randomized control trial aims to evaluate whether optimal patient turning, strictly every 2 hours with at least 15 minutes of tissue decompression, reduces the occurrence of hospital acquired pressure ulcers. Optimal turning procedures will be obtained with the use of a patient monitoring system (Leaf Healthcare, Inc.) and compared to standard preventative care practices.</detailed_description>
