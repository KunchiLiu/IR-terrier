	<brief_summary>Early skin to skin contact has beneficial effects and is part of the Healthy Birth Initiative. Positive effects on breast feeding, cardiorespiratory status, blood glucose control, and temperature has been demonstrated. It is the standard of care for vaginal deliveries but surgery is a barrier in its initation in the operating room. This study is evaluating initiating skin to skin contact as soon as feasible in the operating room. Informed consent will be obtained from scheduled/non emergent cesarean sections who are of EGA.37 weeks who are ASA I-II and receiving the standard spinal anesthetic. Skin to skin contact will be initiated after delivery as soon as apgars and newborn assessment has been completed. Goal is a minimum of 60 minutes of skin to skin contact between the mother and the newborn, with the only interruption being upon movement from the OR table to the stretcher when leaving the OR. Subjects seen post delivery day 1 for assessments of pain and maternal satisfaction utilizing a sliding 100mm VAS assessment tool.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Initiation of skin to skin contact between the mother and the baby will be done in the operating room during surgery rather than waiting until the recovery room as is our standard of care. After assurance that both mom and newborn are stable, the newborn will be placed across the mother's chest and covered with a blanket to help maintain body temperature. The skin to skin contact is maintained throughout the remaining surgical time and then continued into the recovery room. The subjects are seen post delivery day 1 for evaluation of their pain and satisfaction with care using a 0-100mm sliding VAS scale, with 0=not satisfied at all or no pain at all through 100 = total satisfaction and most severe pain ever.</detailed_description>
