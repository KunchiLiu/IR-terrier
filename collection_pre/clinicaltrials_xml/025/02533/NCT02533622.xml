	<brief_summary>Despite the known complications of immobility for ICU patients, compliance to mobility protocols is lacking in many institutions. Significant barriers have been described to compliance to up in chair and weight bearing orders in the ICU. Recent studies indicate that if progressive mobility is performed for acutely ill ICU patients they may have a reduced ICU length of stay, reduced overall hospital length of stay, incur lower hospital costs, and reduce the rate of some medical complications and increase functionality post ICU discharge. The current protocol seeks to understand whether or not the TotalCare® P500 Bed System and the Liko Lift can remove some of the barriers associated with progressive mobility compliance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Holy Name Progressive Mobility in the ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed as a process improvement program to increase compliance to a progressive mobility protocol in an ICU setting. The first part of the study (4-6 months period depending on time required for implementation) will document 1st day of weight bearing as well as the secondary outcome measures of this of progressive mobility protocol as are currently in place in the ICU for patients that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Ease of progressive mobility implementation will be assessed. Appropriate education will be performed as to the importance of progressive mobility. The second part of the study (4-6 months) will document the same outcomes, however, the progressive mobility protocol will now include a standardized process using the Total Care® P500 Bed System combined with the Liko Lift. During the second study period, patients will progress in a stepped protocol (see section 6.2) beginning with head of bed (HOB) at 30o to initiate orthostatic stress three times daily with increasing time intervals, then increasing HOB angle, time, and finally to standing and bearing weight. The Total Care® P500 Bed System and the Liko Lift will be placed on all participating units for the duration of the second phase of the study. Compliance to specific outcome measures again will be measured as well as the ease of Progressive Mobility implementation. The total study period will be 8-12 months (allowing time for bed delivery and education). Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for study will be enrolled. Protocol based "up in chair" and "standing" orders will be followed for compliance, and length of actual sitting in full chair or standing. If patients undergo "full chair" in the bed, this will be considered "up in chair." Time/days to first weight bearing, as defined as weight bearing in a standing position for at least 1 minute will be documented. ICU LOS, Ventilator Days will be assessed at ICU discharge for study patients. Nursing satisfaction and ease of PM protocol adherence surveys will be performed after each study period and will assess both standard of care and Total Care® bed/Liko lift systems.</detailed_description>
