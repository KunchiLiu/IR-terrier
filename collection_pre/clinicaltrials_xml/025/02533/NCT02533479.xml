	<brief_title>Erythrocytes and Skeletal-muscle Fatty Acids Are Positively Correlated After Caloric Restriction and Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was performed with 11 healthy sportsmen participating in a caloric restriction trial for 1 month. The participants follow a caloric restriction, 30-40% respect to the usual diet of each participant, three alternate days weekly along 4 weeks. After the caloric restriction period the participants realized an exercise stress test. For each participant one blood sample and muscular biopsy were obtained after acute exercise and caloric restriction intervention. All the participants were informed of the purpose and demands of the study before giving their written consent to participate. The study protocol was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki for research on human participants and was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the Consell Catal√† de l'Esport.</detailed_description>
