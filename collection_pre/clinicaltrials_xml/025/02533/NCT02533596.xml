	<brief_summary>Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is an established treatment modality for the acute removal of pathophysiological relevant mediators in various diseases. Adipokines have recently been found to play an important role in a variety of immunologic diseases. However, in many of these disease states cardiac and inflammatory involvement is common and biomarkers are routinely used for diagnosis or assessment of therapeutic success. The effect of TPE on biomarkers used in the clinical routine has not been investigated. The aim of this study is to determine adipokine and cardiac biomarker removal during TPE therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Elimination of Cardiac and Inflammatory Biomarkers and Adipokines by Therapeutic Plasma Exchange</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We performed a observational prospective single-centered study. Every patient received two consecutive therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) sessions during the study. Plasma exchange therapy was performed using either the Spectra Optia® or the Octo Nova® apheresis system. Anticoagulation was applied either by heparin or citrate. The prescribed dose of exchange volume of every TPE treatment was 1.1-times the individual calculated total plasma volume, using the Nadler-Allen equation. A substitute fluid with 5% albumin concentration was used in every treatment. Blood samples for measurement of different adipokines (resistin, leptin, soluble ICAM-1, soluble CD40 ligand, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNF-R) as well as cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers and routine chemistry were drawn before (pre-TPE) and at the end (post-TPE) of the first and second TPE session.</detailed_description>
