	<brief_summary>This study is to investigate the incidence of undiagnosed ulnar neuropathy in patients undergoing surgery. The investigators hope to determine if patients with ulnar neuropathy have changes in nerve conduction latency during surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Prevalence of Ulnar Neuropathy and Changes in Ulnar Nerve Latency During Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After obtaining an informed consent, the participating subjects will be asked a few questions relating to ulnar nerve dysfunction. Following this the investigators will do a focused physical exam looking for decrement of sensation in the distribution of the ulnar nerve and muscle strength of the hand muscles supplied by the ulnar nerve. After this the subjects will undergo an EMG exam to measure the conduction velocity of the ulnar nerve. Basically the nerve will be stimulated with a small current and the resultant muscle activity of the hand muscle will be picked up using an EKG like patch applied to the skin over the hand. If a subject is diagnosed to have ulnar neuropathy preoperatively the investigators would study the EMG based nerve conduction during surgery at 30-60 minute intervals for the duration of surgery. For purposes of comparison the investigators would measure the ulnar nerve conduction during surgery in age and sex matched controls.</detailed_description>
