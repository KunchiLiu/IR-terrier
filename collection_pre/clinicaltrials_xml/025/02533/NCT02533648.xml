	<brief_summary>Our recent data in mice have demonstrated a key role of xanthine oxidase in hyperglycemia-induced by Reactive oxygen species production, and a preventive role of allopurinol (inhibitor of xanthine oxidase) on the keeping of mitochondria number and structure, in skeletal muscle of diabetic mice. The investigators want to initiate a clinical trial in order to evaluate the efficacy of allopurinol on the improvement of mitochondrial alterations, oxidative capacities and insulin sensitivity, in skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
