	<brief_summary>Based on meta-analysis of prokinetics trials in laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) (Glicksman et al. 2014), well designed study was performed in 4 articles. But, those studies had several problems including inclusion criteria, randomization methods, and placebo medication. They had similar results that prokinetics and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) had synergistic effect for management of LPRD. Therefore, the aim of study is to evaluate the efficacy of prokinetics as an additional medication to proton pump inhibitor by well designed randomized double blind case-control study.</brief_summary>
