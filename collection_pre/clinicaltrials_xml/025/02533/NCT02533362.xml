	<brief_title>ANF-Rho in the Treatment of Chronic Neutropenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic neutropenia patients who are eligible for participation will be screened and enrolled to received open-label ANF-Rho for a period of 6 months. Study participation will be separated into 2 periods, Induction (8 weeks) and Maintenance (16 weeks). Blood samples to measure neutrophil levels and biochemistry labs will be drawn throughout the study to monitor efficacy response and patient safety. Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected during both periods and questionnaires will be completed by the patient and investigator for bone pain, quality of life (QOL) and injection site reaction.</detailed_description>
