	<brief_summary>This is a randomized clinical trial to quantify the effects of exoskeleton-assisted gait on the musculoskeletal system and health-related quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Exoskeleton-Assisted Gait Training on Bone Health and Quality of Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators will test if exoskeleton-assisted ambulation confers skeletal benefits in a dose-dependent fashion. Investigators also will test if reintroduction of ambulation will be associated with improvements in quality of life due to improvements in mood, pain, and functional connectivity of emotional networks in the brain.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>3 years or more after injury, Motor complete thoracic spinal cord injury (T4 T12), 158188 centimeters tall, Weigh less than 100 kilograms, Have a Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score of less than 3 in both lower extremities, and Have sufficient upper body strength to complete sit to sit transfers. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use contraceptive measures during participation in the study. They also will be required to have a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) before receiving an imaging studies.
