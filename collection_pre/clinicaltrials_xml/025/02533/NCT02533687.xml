	<brief_summary>With this study, it is aimed to compare the operative results and complication rates in transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) performed by resectoscopes with two different bipolar and a monopolar energy sources.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Different Energy Sources During TUR-P</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following data will be collected and evaluated prospectively for the three groups of patients who will undergo TUR-P due to benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) with one of the resectoscopes using different energy sources: 1. Preoperative data: age, height, weight, body-mass index, concomitant morbidities, use of any drug, history of operation, duration of lower urinary tract symptoms, history of any previous treatment taken for BPH, serum level of prostate specific antigen, prostate volume, maximum and average urine flow rate, postmicturation residual urine volume, hemoglobin level 2. Operative data: duration of operation, volume of resected tissue, observation of obturator reflex (if any), kind and size of the urethral catheter used 3. Postoperative data: time to removal of urethral catheter, hospitalization duration, change in hemoglobin, rate of blood transfusion, any other complications</detailed_description>
