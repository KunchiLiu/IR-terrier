	<brief_title>Combination of Nitrous Oxide 70% With Fentanyl Intranasal for Procedural Analgosedation in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nitrous oxide 70% (N20 70%) combined with 30% oxygen meets many criteria of an ideal pain medication for procedural analgosedation in children. At the emergency department of the Children's Hospital of Zurich, Switzerland, N20 70% is regularly used for short and painful orthopaedic procedures, mostly for reduction of dislocated forearm or finger fractures. The analgesic efficacy of N20 70% still remains controversial. Therefore, all children who are eligible for N20 70% receive additionally either fentanyl or placebo intranasal and then their behavior, level of sedation and adverse events are measured during the painful procedure. The hypothesis is that a combination of N20 70% and fentanyl intranasal is not significant better than N20 70% combined with basic analgetics.</detailed_description>
