	<brief_summary>This randomized phase IIb trial studies how well alternative dosing of exemestane before surgery works in treating in postmenopausal patients with stage 0-II estrogen positive breast cancer. Chemoprevention is the use of drugs to keep breast cancer from forming or coming back. The use of exemestane may treat early stage (stage 0-II) breast cancer. Comparing the exemestane standard dose regimen versus two alternative, less frequent dose regimens may decrease undesirable symptoms and be more effective in treating breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alternative Dosing of Exemestane Before Surgery in Treating Postmenopausal Patients With Stage 0-II Estrogen Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Non-inferiority of percent change in time of serum estradiol levels, adjusted for baseline levels, following four up to six weeks of exemestane 25 mg given three times per week or one time per week compared with exemestane 25 mg daily dosing. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess safety and toxicity. II. To support the preventive activity of exemestane we will investigate the change in Ki67 and progesterone receptor (PgR) levels in tumor cells and the adjacent intraepithelial neoplasia or benign histologic structures. III. To assess possible association of estradiol level with tissue and circulating biomarkers. IV. To investigate possible pharmacogenetic markers. V. To assess drug levels on tissue samples. VI. To investigate tissue and circulating proteomics profiling. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive exemestane orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7. ARM II: Patients receive exemestane PO QD on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients also receive placebo PO QD on days 2, 4, 6, and 7. ARM III: Patients receive exemestane PO QD on day 1 and placebo PO QD on days 2-7. In all arms, courses repeat every 7 days for 4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery between days 29-43. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30-40 days.</detailed_description>
