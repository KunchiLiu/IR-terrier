	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies docetaxel and carboplatin in treating patients with prostate cancer that does not respond to treatment with hormones (hormone resistant) and that has spread from the primary site (place where it started) to other places in the body (metastatic). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Metastatic, Hormone Resistant Prostate Cancer Containing Inactivated Genes in the BRCA 1/2 Pathway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess rate of 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline to docetaxel and carboplatin. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess PSA response duration to docetaxel and carboplatin. (Phase 2) II. To assess response of measurable disease. (Phase 2) III. To assess time to progression of bone lesions or measurable disease (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]). (Phase 2) IV. To assess response to docetaxel and carboplatin in tumors with mutation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair pathway genes (breast cancer [BRCA]1, BRCA2, ataxia telangiectasia mutated [ATM]). (Phase 2) V. To correlate the presence of DNA repair pathway mutations and copy number alterations in metastatic tissue versus in circulating tumor cells (CTC) and cell free DNA. (Phase 2) VI. To correlate changes in CTC number with PSA and radiographic response. (Phase 2) OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
