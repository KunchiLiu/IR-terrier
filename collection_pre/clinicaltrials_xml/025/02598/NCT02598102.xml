	<brief_summary>Double J (DJ) stents are placed following upper urinary tract surgeries. DJ stents are usually removed under local anesthesia using rigid cystoscope. Patients experience a lot of pain during this procedure and also continue to have discomfort during voiding for few days. The use of lignocaine jelly during this procedure is not very effective. Use of diclofenac suppository during flexible cystoscopy has been proven to be effective. This study was done to assess the effect of oral diclofenac in pain relief in patients undergoing DJ stent removal by rigid cystoscopy when compared to placebo and to assess its safety in these patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Preprocedural Diclofenac in Males Undergoing Double J Stent Removal Under Local Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutive consenting male patients undergoing DJ stent removal under local anesthesia during 2014-15 were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive 75 mg oral diclofenac or placebo 1 hour prior to procedure by double blind randomization. Intraurethral 2% lignocaine jelly (25 ml) was used in both groups. Pain during rigid cystoscopy, pain at first void and at 24 hours after cystoscopy was assessed using visual analogue scale [VAS] (0 to 100). Adverse reactions to diclofenac and episodes of acute urinary retention, if any, were assessed.</detailed_description>
