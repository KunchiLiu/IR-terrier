	<brief_summary>Protocol ALCT-0000497 is a multicenter safety, tolerability and fat absorption study that anticipates enrolling 35 male and female subjects (pediatric and adult) with cystic fibrosis. Subjects with confirmed exocrine pancreatic insufficiency will use a novel enteral feeding in-line digestive enzyme cartridge (RELiZORB) connected to enteral pump sets.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Protocol ALCT-0000497 consists of three distinct study periods as follows: 1. In Period A (7 days), subjects will receive Peptamen 1.5 enteral feedings at home. 2. In Period B (11 days), subjects will be randomized to either Group A (active investigational then placebo control) or Group B (placebo control then active investigational) and receive Impact Peptide 1.5 on Days 1 and 9. During the 8-day washout period between Days 1 and 9, subjects will receive Peptamen 1.5. 3. In Period C (9 days), subjects will use RELiZORB during nocturnal enteral feedings with Impact Peptide 1.5.</detailed_description>
