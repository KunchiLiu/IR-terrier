	<brief_summary>Myelofibrosis patients with high molecular risk mutations have an intrinsically aggressive disease with increased risk of leukemic transformation and reduced overall survival. As there are no therapies currently established in the subset of high molecular risk patients with early myelofibrosis, the study aims to evaluate ruxolitinib in this patient population.</brief_summary>
