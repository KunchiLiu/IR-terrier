	<brief_summary>This clinical study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination treatment of nintedanib and pirfenidone in participants with IPF. Eligible participant must have received pirfenidone for at least 16 weeks on a stable dose. Nintedanib will be added on Day 1 of the study as a combination treatment for IPF for 24 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants who are on pirfenidone for at least 16 weeks and on a stable dose (defined as 16022403 milligrams per day [mg/day]) for at least 28 days at the start of Screening; the dose must be expected to remain in that range throughout the study. Documented diagnosis of IPF, per the Investigator per using the criteria of the 2011 American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society / Japanese Respiratory Society / Latin American Thoracic Association guidelines. Participants with percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) more than or equal to (&gt;=) 50% and percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLco) &gt;=30% at Screening. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use two adequate methods of contraception, including at least one method with a failure rate of less than (&lt;) 1% per year, during the treatment period and for at least 3 months after the final Followup Visit. For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm. Participants with clinical evidence of active infection. Participant with any new or ongoing moderate or severe adverse reaction considered by the Investigator to be related to pirfenidone, or an pirfenidone treatment interruption in the 28 days before the start of Screening. Any condition that is likely to result in death in the 12 months after the start of Screening. Lung transplantation anticipated or any planned significant surgical intervention. Known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any excipient of either pirfenidone or nintedanib. Severe hepatic and/or renal impairment. History of gastrointestinal (GI) tract perforation, unstable or deteriorating cardiac or pulmonary disease (other than IPF), long QT syndrome, alcohol or substance abuse, use of any tobacco product etc. Bleeding risk. Use of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors (for example, fluvoxamine, enoxacin) and/or use of inhibitors of Pglycoprotein (for example, ketoconazole, erythromycin) or CYP3A4 (for example, ketoconazole, erythromycin) or their inducers (for example, rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St John's wort) in the 28 days before the start of Screening. Pregnancy or lactation.</criteria>
