	<brief_title>Comparing Mouth Rinses in Regard to Streptococcus Mutans Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized controlled clinical trial, unblinded. Once consent and assent have been obtained, the participant will be randomly assigned to one of the four mouth rinses being studied. A pre rinse stimulated salivary sample will be taken in which about 3cm of a sterile tongue depressor is introduced into the mouth and turned around 10 times to contaminate it with saliva. Each side of the spatula was then pressed against a petri dish containing Mitis-salivarius agar. The patient will then rinse 10 ml of the assigned rinse for a timed 30 seconds, expectorate, and then a post stimulated salivary sample will be taken similarly to the pre rinse sample. The samples will be transported to a lab for incubation and quantitative analysis of Streptococcus Mutans.</detailed_description>
