	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Resistance Training in Patients With Psoriatic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The IG patients performed resistance exercises for the following muscles group: upper limbs, lower limbs and trunk. It was used a machine "leg extension" for the training on the lower limbs. For upper limbs we used a pulley triceps machine and front pull in addition to free weights (dumbbells). In order to perform the exercise program the study followed all the recommendations established by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) (Ratamess et al., 2009). It was carried out two exercises for major muscle groups and one exercise for small muscles. The exercises were divided in 3 sets of 12 repetitions for each muscle group. The intensity of the exercises were 60% of one-maximum repetition (1RM). The exercise program involved pectoral exercises: crucifix and seat supine; biceps: alternated screw; triceps: triceps pulley; back: standing handsaw and pulled ahead; quadriceps: leg extensor and finally gluteo: standing hips extension. Control Group (CG) The control group was kept in a waiting list while continued with the standard pharmacological treatment during all the study. The patients were instructed to maintain their daily activities and to avoid any other non-pharmacological treatment. The exercise program was offered to the control group in the end of the study.</detailed_description>
