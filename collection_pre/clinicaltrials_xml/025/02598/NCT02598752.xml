	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if exercise fitness testing, is feasible and safe in persons over 50 years of age who have been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and who are scheduled to undergo a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). Assessments in this study include several physical tests to look at the capacity of your body before and after transplantation to see if these measures can help predict how patients do after transplant.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with MSK histologically confirmed AML or MDS Must be scheduled for allogenic HCT at MSKCC Must have chemotherapy responsive disease ≥50 years old ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 Primary attending physician approval Able to complete an acceptable baseline CPET, as determined by the absence of remarkable ECG findings or other inappropriate response to exercise Able to achieve an acceptable peak baseline CPET, as defined by any of the following criteria: Achieving a plateau in oxygen consumption, concurrent with an increase in power output; A respiratory exchange ratio ≥ 1.10; Attainment of maximal predicted heart rate (HRmax) (i.e., within 10 bpm of agepredicted HRmax [HRmax = 220Age[years]); °Volitional exhaustion, as measured by a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) ≥ 18 on the BORG scale Willing to comply with all protocol related procedures Any of the following absolute contraindications to cardiopulmonary exercise testing Acute myocardial Infarction (within 35 days of any planned study procedures) Unstable angina Uncontrolled arrhythmia causing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise Recurrent syncope Active endocarditis Acute myocarditis or pericarditis Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis Uncontrolled heart failure Acute pulmonary embolus or pulmonary infarction within 3 months of any planned study procedures Thrombosis of lower extremities Suspected dissecting aneurysm Uncontrolled asthma Pulmonary edema Respiratory failure Acute noncardiopulmonary disorders that may affect exercise performance or be aggravated by exercise (i.e., infection, renal failure, thyrotoxicosis) Presence of any other concurrent, actively treated malignancy; History of any other malignancy treated within the past 3 years (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer); Room air desaturation at rest ≤85% Mental impairment leading to inability to cooperate</criteria>
