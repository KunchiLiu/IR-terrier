	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the metrological characteristics of the data processing algorithms from inertial sensors (FOX © HiKoB) for the reconstruction of movement relative to the reference system (VICON) for measurement of dorsiflexion at the beginning of a step and in the middle of the oscillating phase.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are: 1. / - to assess the metrological characteristics of the data from inertial sensors (FOX © HiKoB) for the reconstruction of the movement in comparison with reference systems (GaitRite or Zebris systems, VICON) in terms of: A. Ability to determine the walking speed, stride length, the acceleration of plantar flexion at the beginning of the weight-bearing phase B. Ability to objectify performance reduction during a 6 minute test. C. Ability to identify different types of movement: simple walking, turn, obstacle clearance, staircase. 2. / - to analyze the EMG signal upon voluntary dorsiflexion of the foot of the paretic side from a sitting position before and after a fatigue test (objective D)</detailed_description>
