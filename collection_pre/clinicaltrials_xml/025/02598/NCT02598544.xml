	<brief_summary>Adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction is a commonly observed feature of metabolic dysfunction in obesity and diabetes. An important characteristic when examining AT function is the capacity to break down stored lipids (i.e. lipolysis) and its regulation. In the present study, the aim was to investigate whether atrial natriuretic peptide-mediated lipolysis is altered in different adipose tissue depots (subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue) of obese subjects with or without type 2 diabetes, compared to age-matched lean men. Eventually, the knowledge gained from this research will contribute to a better understanding of the present adipose tissue dysfunction and to the optimization of exercise programs for people with obesity and diabetes.</brief_summary>
