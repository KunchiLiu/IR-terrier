	<brief_summary>Evaluation of the endometrial cavity is an important step in the infertility work-up, particularly if assisted reproductive therapy is planned. The aim is to identify possible endometrial abnormalities that may impair implantation.Undiagnosed endometrial abnormalities are present in 11 to 45% of women scheduled for in vitro fertilization (IVF).Traditionally, two dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (2D TVUS) and hysterosalpingography (HSG) are the basic methods for assessment of the endometrial cavity. However, these imaging modalities have shown high false negative rates among infertile women, a finding that could confine their rule to initial screening rather than definite diagnosis. Office hysteroscopy (OH) is the gold standard for evaluation of the endometrial cavity. Although the endoscopic approach has been proven to increase pregnancy rate in women who experienced prior implantation failure, evidence on treatment of unsuspected hysteroscopically-diagnosed endometrial lesions, to improve IVF outcome, is still lacking. Nevertheless,clinicians tend to use OH routinely prior to IVF because the psychological and financial burden that infertile couples may experience as a consequence of failed IVF cycle is unjustifiable.Yet, costs and invasiveness of OH counteract its global implementation to all women prior to IVF.</brief_summary>
