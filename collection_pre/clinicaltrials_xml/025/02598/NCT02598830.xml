	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effect of vitamin D supplementation on outcomes of 12 weeks progressive strength training in 130 ageing subjects (&gt;45 years of age). Participants will be recruited into two similarly sized strata; one containing COPD patients and one containing healthy subjects. In each stratum, half the participants will receive vitamin D supplementation and half the subjects will receive placebo</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COPing With Life Through Exercise and Vitamin D</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical activity is a potent way of relieving some of the adverse morbidities associated with COPD, such as cachexia. It is thus problematic that 20-30% of patients fail to elicit positive adaptations to training. This oddity has been ascribed inherent muscular properties, with potential links to comorbidities such as vitamin D and testosterone deficiency or the nature of the training program. In the present project, we will take on a double-blinded RCT to disclose the functional and biological efficacy of vitamin D supplementation (with concomitant ingestion of 1000 mg Ca2+) on the outcome of 12 wks strength training in 130 aging individuals with or without COPD. 65 COPD patients and 65 healthy subjects will be allocated into two strata and separately randomized into two equally sized supplementation groups; i) vitamin D3 and ii) placebo. All subjects will perform lower-limb strength-training protocols in a contralateral manner: leg 1) high-resistance (5-12 RM) and leg 2) low-resistance (20-30 RM). Such a one-limb-at-a-time protocol ensures training that is unconfined by the cardiorespiratory limitations inherent to these patients, and allow comparison of the two training modalities in a manner unconfined by individual variation in exercise adaptability. A pilot study comparing one-footed and two-feeted training protocols will be performed. In addition, all subject will perform a selection of bilateral upper body exercises (5-12 RM), ensuring adequate hormonal responses and compliance to the study. The study is likely to revitalize guidelines for rehabilitation of COPD patients, and to provide vital information regarding the role of vitamin D in adaptations to strength training. For outcome measures specific to COPD patients, such as lung function and disease-related quality of life, final analyses will be performed on data from the COPD population only. For other outcome measures, such as muscle mass and strength, final analyses will be performed on data merged from COPD patients and healthy subjects. An important rationale behind implementing healthy control subjects into the project protocol was to increase the statistical power of outcome measures that are unrelated to COPD epidemiology and hence are of universal relevance to physiologcial adaptation to strength training. In a related set of analyses, we will perform between-groups comparisons, including multivariate analyses. We will also compare the efficacy of high- and low-resistance strength training, both of which will be performed by all participants, and are expected to result in similar muscular adaptations, including similar increases in muscle mass and strength. In general, we anticipate baseline vitamin D levels in blood (and hence changes in vitamin D, as obtained through supplementation), measured as 25(OH)D, to be a major determinant of the efficacy of the intervention. This means that individuals with low baseline levels of 25(OH)D are expected to display more pronounced changes in functional and biological outcome measures than those with high baseline values. Such a scenario could be related to the inability of the project protocol to increase blood levels of 25(OH)D beyond a certain level; i.e. individuals with a certain blood level of 25(OH)D will not respond to vitamin D3 supplementation by increasing 25(OH)D levels (essentially meaning that ingestion of vitamin D3 is leveled out by or exceeded by elimination of vitamin D derivatives). Alternatively, it may be related to the inability of tissues to respond to the resulting elevation in physiological vitamin D levels. To assess individual variation in vitamin D responses, data on functional and biological variables such as muscle mass and strength, will be divided into quartiles based on baseline 25(OH)D-levels, whereupon comparisons will be made between low-end and high-end quartiles. Individual variation will also be assessed using a mixed model approach.</detailed_description>
