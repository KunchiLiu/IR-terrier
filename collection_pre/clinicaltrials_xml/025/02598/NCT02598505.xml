	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are: 1. To confirm safety of Indacaterol in stable Heart Failure. 2. To determine whether beta 2 alveolar receptor stimulation by Indacaterol is able to ameliorate lung diffusion in heart Failure patients treated with beta blockers. 3. To compare the effects of Indacaterol in patients treated with a non-selective beta blocker (Carvedilol) and a beta 1-selective beta blocker (Bisoprolol).</brief_summary>
