	<brief_title>Tolerization Reduces Intolerance to Pegloticase and Prolongs the Urate Lowering Effect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an exploratory open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the effectiveness of a 16-week high zone tolerance regimen of pegloticase on response to therapy (serum uric acid &lt;6 mg/dL) with this drug in adult hyperuricemic patients with gout refractory to conventional therapy. Eligible subjects weighing &lt; 120 kg will receive pegloticase 8 mg intravenously (IV) on a weekly basis (Week 1 through Week 3 - "Tolerizing Period"), followed by 8 mg IV every 2 weeks through Week 17 for a total of 10 doses. Subjects weighing ≥ 120 kg will be sequentially assigned to 1 of 3 different loading doses (8, 12, and 16 mg) on Study Day 1, and then receive 8 mg on Week 2 and 3, followed by 8 mg every 2 weeks through Week 17 for a total of 10 doses. Subjects will be monitored for efficacy and safety endpoints through Week 17. Subjects will also have blood drawn for pegloticase levels prior to each dose on Weeks 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13,15, and 17. Following Study Week 17, subjects will have an option to continue dosing for an additional 8 weeks. A total of 53 subjects will be enrolled: 40 subjects weighing &lt; 120 kg and 13 subjects weighing ≥ 120 kg. The study duration, per enrolled patient, will be approximately 26 weeks including a 2-week screening period, a 16-week treatment period (end of treatment [EOT] visit Week 17), and an optional 8-week dosing extension.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Adult (age ≥18 years) men and women of nonchildbearing potential, with chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy, defined as patients who have failed to normalize SUA and whose signs and symptoms are inadequately controlled with xanthine oxidase inhibitors at the maximum medically appropriate dose, or for whom these drugs are contraindicated. 2. Hyperuricemic Screening visit SUA must be &gt;6 mg/dL 3. On gout flare prophylactic regimen for 7 days prior to the first dose. 4. Willing and able to give informed consent and adhere to visit/protocol schedules (informed consent must be given before the first study procedure is performed) 1. Glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (confirmed at Screening visit) 2. Noncompensated congestive heart failure, uncontrolled arrhythmia, treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (myocardial infarction or unstable angina) or hospitalization for congestive heart failure within 3 months of screening or uncontrolled blood pressure (&gt;160/100 mm Hg) at baseline (Screening and predose at Week 1 visit ) 3. Women of childbearing potential defined as: Pre or perimenopausal (&lt;24 months of natural [spontaneous] amenorrhea). &lt;6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy. 4. Prior treatment with pegloticase or another recombinant uricase 5. Prior treatment or concomitant therapy with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated drug 6. Known allergy to PEG products or history of anaphylactic reaction to a recombinant protein or porcine product 7. Concurrent treatment with urate lowering agents (ULAs), such as allopurinol and febuxostat. Patients treated with these medications must discontinue treatment 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug 8. Recipient of an investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration or plans to take an investigational agent during the study 9. Current liver disease as determined by alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) levels &gt;3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) 10. History of malignancy within 5 years other than basal cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix 11. Has any other medical or psychological condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might create undue risk to the patient or interfere with the patient's ability to comply with the protocol requirements, or to complete the study 12. Solid organ transplant recipients 13. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia with a plasma glucose value &gt;240 mg/dL at screening 14. Currently on dialysis</criteria>
