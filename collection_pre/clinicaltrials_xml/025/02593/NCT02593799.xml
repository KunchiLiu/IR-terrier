	<detailed_description>Esophageal variceal bleeding is one of the most lethal complications of liver cirrhosis. In the early stage of liver cirrhosis, the prediction of esophageal varices is very important for guiding the clinical decision making of primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. The investigators' recent systematic review evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of APRI, AAR, FIB-4, FI, King, Lok, Forns, and FibroIndex scores in predicting the presence of esophageal varices in liver cirrhosis. However, their diagnostic accuracy was low to moderate. Further study is warranted to establish a reliable score to predict the presence of high-risk esophageal varice in liver cirrhosis.</detailed_description>
