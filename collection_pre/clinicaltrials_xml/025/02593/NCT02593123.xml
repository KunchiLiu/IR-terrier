	<brief_summary>Determine the relapse-free, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI)-free survival in patients receiving the investigational regimen.This is a randomized phase II clinical trial, comparing two different dosing schedules of mycophyenolate mofetil for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prevention following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Risk for relapse, GVHD and non-relapse mortality will be assessed. Adaptive randomization between two study arms will be performed based on T cell counts at day 60.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantationin Relapsed Hematological Malignancy: Early GVHD Prophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigators will utilize a regimen combining low dose total body irradiation and rabbit ATG to facilitate stem cell transplantation (SCT) with HLA matched related and unrelated donors. Based on the hypothesis that early treatment interventions have significant late effects in allogeneic SCT, a simple intervention, varying the duration of intense immunosuppression following SCT, will be investigated in this study. This may allow more robust recovery of donor immune system cells in the first two months following transplantation and eventually result in lower risk of cancer relapse, while maintaining effective graft versus host disease (GVHD) control. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive GVHD prevention therapy using one of two different immunosuppressive regimens with tacrolimus &amp; mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Patients assigned to the investigational group will receive MMF for 15 days following SCT with growth factor support using granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) beginning on post-transplant day 4. Patients randomized to the standard treatment group will receive MMF for 30 days following SCT with cytokine support using granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) beginning on post-transplant day 4. If one of these treatment groups demonstrates an improvement in donor immune cell recovery, there may be a slow increase in the likelihood of patients being assigned to that more successful treatment group. Eventually the two groups will be compared with respect to the likelihood of either relapse or GVHD developing.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Any of the following high risk or recurrent hematological malignancies: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) NonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Multiple myeloma (MM) Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) *Note: Determination that the malignancy is high risk will be made by the investigator. Investigator determination that the patient is an appropriate candidate for reduced intensity allogeneic SCT with the standard Massey Cancer CenterVirginia Commonwealth Health System Bone Marrow Transplant MCCVCUHS BMT Program regimen employed in this trial Patients with or without previous myeloablative autologous transplant HLAmatched stem cell donor, either related (6/6 or 5/6 loci matched) or unrelated (8/8 or 7/8 loci matched) *Note: Unrelated donors must be matched at HLAA, B, C, and DRB1 loci. However, a single locus mismatch will be acceptable in the event a more closely matched donor is not available. Age â‰¥ 50 to &lt; 75 years; patients 18 to 49 years of age will be eligible only if the investigator has determined that the patient has comorbidity(ies) precluding conventional allogeneic transplantation with full intensity myeloablative conditioning Karnofsky Performance Status of 70100% Negative serology for HIV Women who are not postmenopausal or have not undergone hysterectomy must have a documented negative serum pregnancy test per standard MCCVCUHS BMT Program guidelines Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document *Note: The consent form must be signed and dated prior to initiation of SCT preparative treatments. Exclusion Criteria Previous therapeutic radiation therapy (RT) that exceeds critical structure tolerance doses as determined by a radiation oncologist Uncontrolled viral, fungal, or bacterial infection Active meningeal or central nervous system disease Previous therapy with rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG); previous treatment with equine ATG is allowed if more than 3 months ago *Note: Previous myeloablative autologous transplant is permitted but not required. Pregnancy or breastfeeding Medical, psychological, or social condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the patient's risk or limit the patient's adherence with study requirements</criteria>
