	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of BFKB8488A following subcutaneous (SC) administration in overweight and obese subjects (body mass index [BMI] 27-40 kg/m^2) with markers of insulin resistance. Single ascending fixed doses of BFKB8488A will be evaluated. Participants will be randomized into 7 sequential ascending fixed-dose cohorts of BFKB8488A SC or placebo and safety reviews will be performed before escalation to higher dose cohorts.</brief_summary>
