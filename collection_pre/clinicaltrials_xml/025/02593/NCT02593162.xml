	<brief_title>A Study of Faldaprevir, Ribavirin and TD-6450 in Participants With Genotype 4 Hepatitis C Virus Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A study to evaluate the safety and effect of treatment with experimental antiviral drugs in combination with ribavirin in treatment-naïve participants with genotype 4 hepatitis C infection. The study will test the safety and effects of this alternative treatment for up to 12 weeks. Secondary objectives of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics of the study drugs when co-administered, and to evaluate HCV RNA kinetics during treatment.</detailed_description>
