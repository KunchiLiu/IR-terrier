	<brief_summary>The TELEX trial will establish whether telmisartan alone improves walking performance in people with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The TELEX trial will also determine whether telmisartan plus supervised exercise improves walking performance more than either therapy alone. TELEX is a randomized controlled clinical trial (2 x 2 factorial design) of 240 participants with PAD randomized to one of four arms: Group A: telmisartan + supervised exercise therapy; Group B: telmisartan + a "no exercise" control group; Group C: placebo + supervised exercise therapy; and Group D: placebo + a "no exercise" control group.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All participants will have PAD. PAD will be defined as follows. First, an ABI &lt;= 0.90 at the baseline study visit is an inclusion criterion for PAD. Second, potential participants who have an ABI &gt; 0.90 but â‰¤ 1.00 and experience a 20% or higher drop in ABI after heelrise exercise will be eligible. Third, potential participants with an ABI &gt; 0.90 who have vascular lab evidence of PAD or angiographic evidence of PAD will be eligible. Finally, potential participants with a history of lower extremity revascularization who do not meet the criterion above and have an ABI &gt; 0.90 with a 20% or higher drop in ABI after heelrise exercise will be eligible. 1. Above or below knee amputation, critical limb ischemia, wheelchair confinement, inability to walk without a walker, or current foot ulcer. 2. Walking is limited by a condition other than PAD. 3. &gt; Class II NYHA heart failure or angina, increase in angina, angina at rest, or abnormal baseline treadmill stress test. Potential participants may become eligible following an abnormal baseline treadmill stress test if they have evidence of an absence of coronary ischemia based on testing with their own physician. 4. Currently taking an angiotensin receptor blocker or an ACE inhibitor or use of these medications in the past three months. 5. Currently taking aliskiren (Tekturna). 6. Blood pressure &lt; 110/55 at baseline or potassium &gt; 5.0 meq/L at baseline. 7. Blood pressure &lt; 100/50 after runin or potassium &gt;= 5.5 meq/L at the end of runin. 8. Severe hepatic impairment defined by two or more liver function enzyme values greater than 2.5 the upper limit of normal. 9. Acute decline in renal function on telmisartan, defined as a 30% or greater decline in eGFR following the twoweek runin as compared to baseline. 10. Allergy to ARBs. 11. Failure to successfully complete the 2week study runin, defined as failing to attend the health education and treadmill exercise runin sessions and/or failing to take the study medication daily for 10 or more days in the twoweek period (i.e. one pill per day for &gt; 10 days out of the 14 day runin period). 12. Surgery including lower extremity revascularization, coronary revascularization with stenting, or orthopedic surgery during the past 3 months or anticipated in the next 6 months or myocardial infarction or stroke in the past 3 months. 13. Major medical illness including renal disease requiring dialysis, lung disease requiring oxygen, Parkinson's disease, a lifethreatening illness with life expectancy less than six months, or cancer requiring treatment in the previous two years. [NOTE: potential participants may still qualify if they have had treatment for an early stage cancer in the past two years and the prognosis is excellent. Participants who only use oxygen at night may still qualify.] 14. MMSE score &lt; 23 or dementia. 15. Currently walking regularly for exercise at a level similar to the study intervention. 16. Participation in another clinical trial or cardiac rehabilitation or completion of a clinical trial or cardiac rehabilitation in the previous three months. [NOTE: after completing a stem cell or gene therapy intervention, participants will become eligible after the final study followup visit of the stem cell or gene therapy study so long as at least six months have passed since the final intervention administration. After completing an exercise intervention or a supplement or drug therapy (other than stem cell or gene therapy), participants will be eligible after the final study followup visit as long as at least three months have passed since the final intervention of the trial.] 17. NonEnglish speaking, a visual impairment that limits walking ability, or a hearing impairment that interferes with study participation. 18. Heart failure with an ejection fraction &lt;40% at baseline. 19. In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determine if the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant.</criteria>
