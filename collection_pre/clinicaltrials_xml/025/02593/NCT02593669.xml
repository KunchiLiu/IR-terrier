	<brief_summary>A cataract is a clouding of the crystalline lens inside the eye, which leads to a decrease in vision. It is the most prevalent, treatable cause of visual impairment and blindness in the world. Cataract surgery with an intraocular lens (IOL) implant is one of the most common and thought to be the most effective surgical procedure in any field of medicine. In this trial, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effect of cataract surgery on circadian rhythm and sleep as well as the effect of the blue light transmission characteristics of the implanted IOL on sleep.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Cataract Surgery on Sleep Quality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Prospective, randomized controlled study of 10000 participants(20000 eyes) with dense nucleus were enrolled. Patients were assigned to two groups: Group I: neutral IOL implanted in eye while in Group II, blue-blocking IOL was innovatively implanted in the eye. A cataract is a clouding of the crystalline lens inside the eye, which leads to a decrease in vision. It is the most prevalent, treatable cause of visual impairment and blindness in the world. Cataract surgery with an intraocular lens (IOL) implant is one of the most common and thought to be the most effective surgical procedure in any field of medicine. In this trial, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effect of cataract surgery on circadian rhythm and sleep as well as the effect of the blue light transmission characteristics of the implanted IOL on sleep. Patients enrolled into the study will be assessed in 3 months before the surgery and 3 months after the surgery.</detailed_description>
