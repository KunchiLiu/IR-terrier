	<brief_title>Peripheral Endothelial Function in Asthmatic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary criteria is the peripheral endothelial function that will be assessed by the measure of flow-mediated dilation (reactive hyperemia-peripheral artery tone index). The pulmonary function will be assessed by the measures of the FEV1, the forced vital capacity (FVC) and the expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF25-75%). The relationship between these parameters of the pulmonary function and the peripheral endothelial function will be analyzed. In addition, a relationship between peripheral endothelial function and the level of asthma control (Asthma Control Test (ACT)), the cardiovascular risk factors (SCORE INdex) and the treatment for asthma (controllers) will be also assessed.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patients must have a clearcut history of asthma at the time of enrolment into the trial (eventually confirmed in the past and documented by an increased hyperresponsiveness to methacholine; or a bronchodilator reversibility to a beta2adrenergic drug). Patients with unstable asthma Patients with a significant acute disease other than asthma. A significant disease is defined as a disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, may influence the results of the trial. Pregnant or nursing women.</criteria>
