	<brief_summary>Worksites offer attractive locations for reducing the national prevalence of overweight and obesity. Interventions that are both effective and sustainable for producing long-term changes in health and employee wellness are urgently needed. In an 18-month worksite randomized controlled trial in 12 worksites this study will test two lifestyle approaches designed to facilitate behavior modification for achieving long-term improvements in health and quality of life. Worksites randomized to the immediate intervention arm will receive the two on-site wellness programs and the randomized control sites will participate in outcomes assessments for the initial 6 month period after which participants will receive vouchers to participate in the program of their choice. The primary focus of the worksite wellness study is to identify ways to improve health related quality of life, with a particular focus on a decrease in cardiometabolic risk factors, including weight, improved weight-related wellness, and improved energy level in work and life. The combination of 2 interventions will be tested against the control condition in an intention to treat model and with a completers analysis.</brief_summary>
