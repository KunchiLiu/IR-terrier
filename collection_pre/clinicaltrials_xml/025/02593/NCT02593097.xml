	<brief_summary>Migraine is the third most prevalent disease in the world. Preventive treatment is indicated in about 40% of individuals with episodic migraine. Although 4 treatments are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for prevention of episodic migraine, none were designed to prevent migraine, efficacy is modest, and all have significant adverse-event profiles. As a result, less than 1/3 of migraine sufferers with who are candidates for prevention receive drug treatment and of those who are treated, more than 85% have discontinued the preventive drug within one year. Migraine pain is associated with the activation and sensitization of specific receptors involved in pain-promoting pathways. Metformin, which is a widely available, well-tolerated anti-diabetic medication, can downregulate pain-promoting pathways. Metformin has demonstrated positive results in animal models of migraine in the laboratory. Given the longstanding use and established safety record of metformin, the investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of metformin for preventive treatment of high-frequency episodic migraine in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will obtain approval from the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all patients will provide written, informed consent before study enrollment. This will be a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The investigators will enroll 40 subjects. Subjects will be recruited from the outpatient Mayo Headache Clinic, Mayo Women's Health Clinic, Mayo Community Internal Medicine, and the Mayo Clinic- Arizona State University Neurology Clinic. The Headache Clinic employs 6 headache specialists and 1 fellow which is sufficient staffing to support this study and recruitment of patients with high-frequency episodic migraine within 6 months. Inclusion criteria are as follows: 1) age 18-65 years, 2) a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura for &gt;1 year according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders-IIIb (2013), and 3) 5-14 migraine days per month on average during the preceding 3 months. Women of reproductive ability must use a reliable form of contraception beginning 3 months before study enrollment, throughout the study, and for at least 1 month after study completion. Exclusion criteria are as follows: 1) a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or polycystic ovarian syndrome, 2) overuse of acute migraine treatments, 3) failure to respond to 3 or more previous preventive drug treatments, 4) change in dose of migraine-preventive medication within 2 months of beginning the baseline diary phase, 5) significant somatic or psychiatric disease, 6) known alcohol or other substance abuse, and 7) pregnant or breastfeeding. Before study enrollment, patients will undergo a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test to confirm the absence of diabetes mellitus. Subjects will then keep a headache diary for 4 weeks to establish baseline characteristics, including number of migraine days per month, number of moderate to severe headache days per month, and number of days per month of acute medication use. The 4-week baseline period will be followed by 2 treatment periods of 12 weeks each, separated by a washout period of 4 weeks (total study duration, 32 weeks). For the 12-week treatment periods, subjects will receive either metformin 500mg twice daily or matching placebo twice daily. A statistician will create a randomized treatment allocation schedule by using a computerized random number generator. The randomized treatment allocation schedule will be stored using the REDCap randomization module. The Mayo Clinic Pharmacy will allocate patients to the metformin-placebo sequence or the placebo-metformin sequence in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects will have 7 study visits. Routine laboratory studies and a pregnancy test will be performed at enrollment and week 20. Abnormal kidney or liver function will exclude subjects. Pregnancy will exclude subjects. General and neurologic examinations will be performed during 3 of the 7 visits. At each visit, subjects will receive medication for the period until the next visit. A headache diary will be used for the trial. For every day that the subject has a headache of any type, she or he will record headache characteristics, associated features, and medications used. The primary end point is the number of migraine days per month during treatment with metformin vs placebo. The secondary end point is the percentage of patients with &gt;50% reduction in migraine days per month (response rate). Adverse events will be recorded. Mean 4-week migraine frequency for patients receiving metformin vs placebo treatment will be assessed by using the Hills-Armitage method. Response rate will be assessed by using the McNemar test. The statistician will create Web-based case report forms using REDCap. Study coordinators will record data using REDCap forms. If this crossover study demonstrates that metformin is an effective and well-tolerated medication for patients with high frequency episodic migraine, it will serve as pilot data for a large double-blind, randomized, controlled study. These studies will not only present a new, safe, well-tolerated therapeutic option for patients with high frequency episodic migraine, but also further elucidate the neurobiology of migraine. If AMPK is confirmed as a novel target for migraine treatment, drug discovery could identify more-powerful and safe activators of AMPK with improved efficacy and tolerability.</detailed_description>
