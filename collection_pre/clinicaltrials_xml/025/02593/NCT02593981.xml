	<brief_summary>As many as 57% of older adults complain of major disruption of sleep, 29% struggle to fall asleep and 19% complain of early-morning awakening. The implications of this sleep deprivation are sobering, particularly among older individuals. The primary goal of this study is to determine whether a palatable foodstuff which contains a fruit/honey drink and which is taken every evening before bedtime leads to improved sleep in community-living individuals with sleep problems.</brief_summary>
