	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of ACTIMMUNE Dose Escalation in Friedreich's Ataxia Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects who complete 26 weeks of blinded treatment in HZNP-ACT-301, (NCT02415127) will be eligible to enter this 6-month study. All subjects who choose to participate will receive ACTIMMUNE three times a week (TIW) for 26 weeks. In order to maintain the study blind in HZNP-ACT-301, all subjects in this open-label extension study will undergo ACTIMMUNE titration, regardless if they received ACTIMMUNE or placebo in HZNP-ACT-301.The Week 26 Visit from HZNP-ACT-301 will serve as the Baseline Visit (Day 1) for this study. The study drug dose is planned to be escalated on a weekly basis over the first 4 weeks of treatment (from 10 µg/m2 to 100 µg/m2), however, the dose may be reduced, interrupted, or held based on tolerability. During the treatment period, additional clinic visits are scheduled at Weeks 4, 13, and 26; in between clinic visits, subjects (and/or caregivers) will be monitored via emails/phone calls on a weekly basis until subjects reach their maximum tolerated dose and on a monthly basis thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent and child assent, if applicable. Completed 26 weeks of blinded treatment in Study HZNPACT301, (NCT02415127). If female, the subject is not pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant during the study, or within 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at Baseline/Day 1 (Week 26 of Study HZNPACT301), and agree to use a reliable method of contraception throughout the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects will be ineligible if, in the opinion of the Investigator, they are unlikely to comply with the study protocol or have a concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with the conduct of the study or potentially put the subject at unacceptable risk.</criteria>
