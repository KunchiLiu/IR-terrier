	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if receiving 4 cycles of an experimental chemotherapy combination before surgery can help to shrink or slow the growth of tumors before they are removed through surgery. The safety of this combination will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Women's Triple-Negative First-Line Study: A Phase II Trial of Panitumumab, Carboplatin and Paclitaxel (PaCT) in Patients With Localized Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) With Tumors Predicted Insensitive to Standard Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: About 1 week before Cycle 1, if you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive a single dose of panitumumab by vein over about 1 hour. You will then receive the study drug combination for 4 cycles. Each cycle is 21 days. On Day 1 of each Cycle, you will receive panitumumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel by vein. Panitumumab will be given over 30-60 minutes, paclitaxel over about 2 hours, and carboplatin over about 2 hours. On Days 8 and 15 of each cycle, you will receive panitumumab and paclitaxel by vein following the same timing as Day 1. If you have side effects, the study doctor may decide to lower the study drug dose(s) or to have you stop taking the drug(s). You may be able to restart the study drug(s) later at the same or a lower dose. The study doctor will discuss this with you. Study Visits: About 1 week before Cycle 1, the same day that you receive the single dose of Panitumumab, you will have blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons) for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. About 1 week after the first panitumumab dose, you will have blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons) for PK testing. On Day 1 of each cycle: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. On Days 8 and 15 of each cycle, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. On Day 21 (+/- 1 day) of Cycle 2, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK testing. Surgery: After you have received 4 cycles of chemotherapy, or at any time that the disease appears to get worse, you will have an MRI, mammogram, or ultrasound to check the status of the disease. Based on the scans, the doctor will decide the type of surgery that you will have to remove the tumors.You will be given a separate surgery consent form that describes the procedure and its risks. If you come off study, you may be offered chemotherapy, more surgery, or another option. At the time of your surgery, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK testing. Length of Treatment: You may receive up to 4 cycles of chemotherapy. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over at least 2 years after surgery. Follow-Up: Every 3-4 months, the study team will track your standard of care physical exam visits. This is an investigational study. Paclitaxel and carboplatin are FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of breast cancer. Panitumumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of colorectal cancer. It is currently being used for research purposes only in the breast cancer setting. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 37 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have an intact evaluable primary tumor or biopsy proven axillary node involvement with at least 1.0 cm smallest dimension based on imaging after neoadjuvant anthracyclinebased chemotherapy and prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy under this protocol. Baseline measurements and evaluations must be obtained within 4 weeks of registration to the study. All areas of disease should be recorded in order to assess response and uniformity of response to therapy. 2. Triplenegative breast cancer defined as ER&lt;10%; PR&lt;10% by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HER2 01+ by IHC or 2+, FISH &lt; 2, gene copy number &lt; 4. 3. Age &gt;/= 18 years. 4. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. 5. Patients must have received at least one dose of an anthracycline based neoadjuvant regimen. Patients are eligible if therapy was discontinued due to disease progression or therapy intolerance. 6. Baseline MUGA or echocardiogram showing LVEF &gt;/= 50% within 6 weeks prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 7. 7) Adequate organ function defined by the following parameters • Serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 mg/dl. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;/= 50 mL/min calculated by the CockcroftGault method as follows: male creatinine clearance = (140 age in years) x (weight in kg) / (serum Cr x 72); Female CrCl = (140 age in years) x (weight in kg) x 0.85 / (serum Cr x 72). • ANC&gt;/= 1500/mm^3, platelets &gt;/= 100,000/mm^3 • Hemoglobin &gt;/=9.0 g/dL • SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT)&lt; 3.0 x upper limit of normal • Alkaline phosphatase (Alp) &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN • Total bilirubin &lt;/=1.5 x ULN 8. Signed informed consent. 1. Patient is unwilling or unable to sign and date the IRB approved informed consent. 2. Patients with less than 1.0 cm measurable residual disease after neoadjuvant anthracycline based chemotherapy. 3. Women that are pregnant or lactating. 4. Patients with a history of prior malignancy within 5 years of study entry with the exception of curatively treated nonmelanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast. 5. Patients with a history of stage IV or metastatic disease. 6. Any serious medical illness, other than that treated by this study, which would limit survival to less than 1 month or psychiatric illness which would limit informed consent. 7. Known positive test(s) for human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis C virus, acute or chronic active hepatitis B infection. 8. Patients with a peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1. 9.

Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective methods of contraception during the study and 8 weeks after. Highly effective contraception methods include combination of any two of the following: • Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); • Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository; • Total abstinence or; • Male/female sterilization. 16. Continued from #15: Women are considered postmenopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to treatment. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of childbearing potential. 17.
