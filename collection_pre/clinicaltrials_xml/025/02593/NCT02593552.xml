	<brief_title>Video Intervention to Enhance the Safety Of Cognitively Impaired Older Drivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goals of this pilot study were to demonstrate that 1) g-force technology can effectively detect unsafe driving events by older adults, and 2) cognitively impaired older adults can improve their driving safety with an in-car video feedback intervention. Unsafe driving events were triggered by g-forces leading to capture of a video record that was then transmitted wirelessly to a remote office where the events were analyzed and scored. During the baseline phase (3 months), there was no feedback. During the intervention phase (4-6 months), participants received a weekly progress report in the mail along with DVD of recorded unsafe driving events with recommendations. The research team then contacted the participant and informant weekly to provide additional coaching, and verify that participants reviewed the information and videos. During the post-intervention monitoring phase (7-9 months), there was no further feedback. The primary quantitative outcomes were total number of unsafe driving events/1,000 miles and total safety driving score/1,000 miles. Secondary qualitative outcomes included the types and severity of unsafe driving events that were recorded.</detailed_description>
