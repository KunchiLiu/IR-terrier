	<brief_summary>This study aims at evaluating the feasibility of CT myocardial perfusion imaging in daily clinical practice and compare it to SPECT perfusion imaging in order to assess sensitivity and specifity of CT myocardial perfusion imaging compared to SPECT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic CT Myocardial Perfusion Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If after the clinically indicated CCTA a myocardial perfusion examination is indicated, first a single ultra low dose CT scan will be performed to look for late enhancement of potentially scarred myocardium. Together with the contrast agent co-injection of the clinically indicated tracer 99mTc-Tetrofosmin will be performed for later scintigraphic perfusion evaluation. After stress perfusion imaging CT rest perfusion imaging will be performed in a similar fashion. After acquisition of CT rest perfusion images scintigraphic stress and rest image acquisition will be performed as in daily clinical routine with an additional administration of 99mTc-Tetrofosmin resting dose if necessary. CT stress and rest perfusion will be compared to the clinically indicated and well established SPECT examination.</detailed_description>
