	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine the treatment effect of accommodative/vergence therapy on myopic children by assessment of accommodative function before and after therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Accommodative/Vergence Therapy to Modify Accommodative Function in Children With Myopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Specific aims of the proposed clinical trial: 1.1 To prove accommodative/vergence therapy (AT) can normalize the accommodative function of myopic children.。 1.2 If the accommodation function of myopic children can be improved with AT therapy, the outcome will supply a basic for a randomized, multi-center clinic trail to determine the effectiveness of AT to slow the progression of myopia. 2. Hypothesis: Accommodative/vergence therapy can normalize the accommodative functions of 8-12 years old Chinese myopic children.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects enrolled in the trial must: 1. be within the age range of 8 to 12 years old inclusive; 2. 0.75d to 4.50dspherical equivalent by cycloplegic autorefraction in both eyes 3. astigmatism≤1.5d in both eyes； 4. anisometropia≤1.0d； 5. accommodation lag at near(33cm）in right eye by noncycloplegic auto refraction ≧1d; 6. have vision correctable to at least 0.8 or better in each eye. Subjects enrolled in the trial must NOT have: 1. current or prior use of progressive addition lens, bifocals, or contact lenses in either eye( prior or current use of single vision lens allowed)； 2. history of any of the following functional defects: strabismus, amblyopia, nystagmus； 3. history of diabetes or seizures； 4. history of any ocular systemic, or neurodevelopmental condition that might influence refractive development； 5. use of ocular or systemic medications known to affect accommodation, such as atropine, pirenzepine, and antiepileptic medications in recent 3 months； 6. history of any ocular surgery that might influence refractive development； 7. developmental disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD), or learning disability diagnosis in children that in the investigator's discretion would interfere with officebased treatment； 8. relocation anticipated for 3 years； 9. birth weight lower than 1250 grams（2lbs,12oz）； 10. siblings in the study.</criteria>
