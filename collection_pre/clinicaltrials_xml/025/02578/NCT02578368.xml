	<brief_summary>Previously untreated patients with limited metastatic stage (see protocol for details on criteria) will receive 4 cycles of FLOT (5-Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin and Docetaxel). Patients without disease progression will be randomized 1:1 to receive additional chemotherapy cycles (4-8 cycles of FLOT) or surgical resection followed by subsequent chemotherapy (4-8 cycles of FLOT). Main objective of the study is overall survival. Most important secondary objective is the quality of life under treatment and during follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Alone vs. Chemotherapy + Surgical Resection in Patients With Limited-metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach or Esophagogastric Junction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with potentially limited metastatic gastric cancer or adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) potentially fulfilling the selection criteria and who gave informed consent will undergo a careful screening and a central review process. 271 patients are to be allocated to the trial, of which at least 176 patients will be randomized. The primary objective is to extend overall survival, while preserving quality of life. The study has an 80% power to detect a statistically significant improvement (hazard ratio, HR 0.65) in overall survival in favor of the bimodal strategy. Quality of life (QoL) under treatment and during follow-up represents the most important secondary endpoint. All patients enrolled will receive four cycles (= 8 weeks) of FLOT. For HER-2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) positive disease, trastuzumab should be added. After the 4th cycle of FLOT, patients will undergo a repeated imaging (esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy, CT/MRI or PET scan of the involved organs). Patients with disease progression will be taken out of the trial. Patients with stable disease, partial or complete remission will be stratified by tumor location (gastric vs. GEJ adenocarcinoma), response to preoperative FLOT (complete or partial remission vs. stable disease) and based on whether they have distant lymph node metastases only or additional organ involvement and will be randomized 1:1 to Arm A (with surgery) or B (no surgery). Arm A: Surgery will be scheduled 4-6 weeks after d1 of the last cycle of preoperative chemotherapy (d1 + 4-6 weeks). The protocol gives detailed recommendations for resection of the primary tumor as well as the metastases. Post-operatively, further 4-8 cycles of FLOT can be administered. Arm B: Patients will be treated with additional 4-8 cycles of FLOT. Surgical interventions are allowed for palliation. In both of the arms, tumor assessments (CT/MRI or PET of the relevant organs) are performed prior to randomization and then every 3 months thereafter until progression/relapse, death or end of follow-up. Quality of life (QoL) will be assessed at baseline, prior to randomization, and every 3 months after randomization during treatment and in the follow-up phase, together with tumor assessments. Survival status and status on relapse/first progress of disease will be assessed every 3 months for up to 5 years after randomization.</detailed_description>

Written informed consent of the patient. (*) Definition of the limited metastatic status is: 1. Retroperitoneal lymph node metastases (RPLM) (e.g., paraaortal, intraaortocaval, parapancreatic or mesenterial lymph nodes) only (Note: in duodenum invading gastric cancer, retropancreatic nodes are not regarded M1) or/and 2. at maximum one organ involved with or without RPLM according to the following schema: I. Localized potentially operable peritoneal carcinomatosis: stage P1 according to classification of the "Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer" (Clinically visible carcinomatosis of the peritoneum or of the pleura and &gt;P1 peritoneal carcinomatosis are not allowed!) or II. Liver: maximum of 5 metastatic lesions that are potentially resectable or III. Lung: unilateral involvement, potentially resectable or IV. Uni or bilateral Krukenberg tumors (ovarian met.) in the absence of macroscopic peritoneal carcinomatosis or V. Uni or bilateral adrenal gland metastases or VI. Extraabdominal lymph node metastases such as supraclavicular or cervical lymph node involvement or VII. Localized bone involvement (defined as being within one radiation field) or VIII. Other metastatic disease location that is considered limited by the investigator and is confirmed by the review committee 1. Medical inoperability 2.
