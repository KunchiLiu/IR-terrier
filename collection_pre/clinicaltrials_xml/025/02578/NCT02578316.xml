	<brief_title>A Study to Determine the Metabolism and Elimination of 14C-E7080 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas, Who Are Unsuitable For, or Have Failed, Existing Therapies.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study comprised of two phases, the Study Phase and Extension Phase. Participants received 14C-lenvatinib on Day 1 of the Study Phase. Thereafter participants were given daily oral doses of 24 mg of lenvatinib over a 28 day cycle. During the Study Phase, participants received an initial single dose of 14C-lenvatinib oral patient dosing solution containing 24 mg of lenvatinib as anhydrous free base and radioactivity of 100 mCi (3.7 MBq) on Day 1, followed by collection of blood, urine and feces samples for pharmacokinetic analysis between Day 1 and Day 8, with a discharge visit on Day 8. Participants then entered the Extension Phase of the study to continue to receive once daily oral administration of non-radiolabeled lenvatinib at a dose of 24 mg. Each 28-day dosing period will be considered one treatment cycle.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA 1. Participants with histologically and/or cytologically confirmed solid tumor or lymphoma who were resistant/ refractory to approved therapies or for whom no appropriate therapies were available. Participants with measurable tumors according to RECIST were desirable but not essential for inclusion. 2. All previous treatment (including surgery and radiotherapy) must have been completed at least four weeks prior to study entry and any acute toxicity must have resolved 3. Aged greater than or equal to 18 years 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2 5. Could take oral study medication 6. Gave written informed consent to participate in the study 7. Willing and complied with the study protocol for the duration of the study. EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1. Participants with brain or subdural metastases, unless they had completed local therapy and have discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment in this study. Any signs and/or symptoms of brain metastases those were stable for at least 4 weeks. 2. Participants with meningeal carcinomatosis 3. Any of the following values for laboratory parameters: 1. hemoglobin less than 9 g/dL (5.6 mmol/L); 2. neutrophils less than 1.5 x 10^9/L; 3. platelets less than 100 x 10^9/L; 4. Prothrombin time (PT) [or International Normalized Ratio (INR)] and Patial thromboplastin time (PTT) &gt; 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) 5. serum bilirubin greater than 1.5 x ULN 6. other liver parameters greater than 3 x ULN 7. creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min per the Cockcroft and Gault formula 4. Uncontrolled infections 5. Significant cardiovascular impairment (history of congestive heart failure greater than New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II, unstable ischemic heart disease including a myocardial infarction within six months of study start, or serious cardiac arrhythmia) 6. Participants with marked baseline prolongation of QT/QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval (QTc interval greater than or equal to 500 msec) using the Fridericia method 7. Any treatment with an investigational drug within the last 30 days 8. Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding; women of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test at screening or no pregnancy test. Women of childbearing potential unless (1) surgically sterile or (2) using adequate measures of contraception in the opinion of the Investigator (including two forms of contraception, one of which must be a barrier method). Perimenopausal women who were amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing potential. Fertile males with female partners of childbearing potential who were not willing to use contraception, or whose female partners were not using adequate contraceptive protection, were excluded. 9. Proteinuria greater than 1+ on bedside testing 10. History of gastrointestinal malabsorption 11. Surgery within four weeks of start of study treatment 12. Bleeding or thrombotic disorders or use of an anticoagulant, such as warfarin, with a therapeutic INR. Aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) were permissible but when used with caution. 13. Poorly controlled hypertension (defined as a change in hypertensive therapy within three months of study start) or participants diagnosed with hypertension (defined as a repeat blood pressure measurement of 160/90 mmHg or higher) at screening 14. Previous lenvatinib therapy 15. History of alcoholism, drug addiction, psychiatric or psychological condition, or social situation which, in the opinion of the investigator, would impair study compliance 16. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition to lenvatinib 17. Other significant disease or disorder that, in the Investigator's opinion, would exclude the participant from the study 18. Legal incapacity</criteria>
