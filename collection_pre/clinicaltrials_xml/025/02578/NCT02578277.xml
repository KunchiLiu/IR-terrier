	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Written Informed Consent 2. Healthy male and female (not of childbearing potential) subjects as determined by medical history, surgical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory determinations 3. Body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 kg/m2 to 32.0 kg/m2, inclusive, at screening and Day 1. BMI = weight (kg)/[height(m)] 4. Women must have documented proof that they are not of childbearing potential (eg, surgically sterile, postmenopausal with a documented folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 mIU/mL) and should not be breast feeding 5. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with BMS955176 in addition to a posttreatment completion period 1. Any significant acute or chronic medical illness 2. Use of tobacco, excessive alcohol 3. Medical history indicative of an increased risk of a cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac disease and history of asthma, bronchospasm, sleep apnea, rhabdomyolysis, a bleeding disorder, a major depressive disorder within the past 6 months, peptic ulcer or significant GI bleed, Raynaud's disease, or any gastrointestinal surgery that could impact upon the absorption of study drug 4. Evidence of organ dysfunction or any clinically significant deviation from normal in physical examination, vital signs, ECG, or clinical laboratory determinations beyond what is consistent with the target population 5. History of allergy to BMS955176, digoxin (or any member of the digitalis glycosides class of drugs), caffeine, metoprolol, montelukast, flurbiprofen, omeprazole, midazolam, or pravastatin, or to any related compounds</criteria>
