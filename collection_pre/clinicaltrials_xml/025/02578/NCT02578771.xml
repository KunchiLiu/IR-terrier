	<brief_summary>ZuraPrep is being evaluated for efficacy as a preoperative skin preparation solution to demonstrate its immediate and persistent antimicrobial properties. At least 72 subjects will be randomized utilizing bilateral applications on abdomen and groin. ZuraPrep active product and reference positive control will be compared; ZuraPrep non-active and negative control will be compared. Each subject will receive two of the planned treatments, one on the left side of body and one of the right. Study duration for subjects - 3 to 4 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Clinical Evaluation to Characterize in Vivo Effects of Topically Applied ZuraPrep &amp; ZuraPrep Vehicle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The single investigational test article, ZuraPrep solution is being evaluated for efficacy as a preoperative skin preparation solution to demonstrate its immediate and persistent antimicrobial properties. At least 72 subjects will be randomized utilizing bilateral applications on abdomen and groin. The primary objective of this study is to characterize the in vivo effects of the ZuraPrep test article compared to the positive reference control ChloraPrep, as well as to evaluate the ZuraPrep test vehicle to the negative control, Saline, using the newly proposed sampling intervals. This is a randomized, paired-comparisons design where each subject will receive two of the planned treatments, one on the left side of body and one on the right. Treatments will be evaluated at 30 seconds, 10 minutes and 6 hour sampling intervals compared to baseline. Status will be calculated separately for the abdomen and groin for each side of the body. Study duration for subjects - 3 to 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
