	<brief_summary>Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of the AVERT PLUS to monitor contrast volume used during angiographic procedures. This will be a first in man prospective observational study of the accuracy of this system to quantify contrast volume used during clinically indicated angiography in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Novel Method of Contrast Volume Quantification - AVERT PLUS 2.0</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Design: The AVERT PLUS is an FDA 510K cleared device which consists of 1) a contrast delivery modulator designed to reduce unnecessary contract dye delivery to the patient during angiography (coronary or peripheral) and 2) a concomitant contrast monitoring system to precisely measure contrast volume delivered to the patient. This will be a first in man prospective observational study of the accuracy of this system to quantify contrast volume used during clinically indicated angiography in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.</detailed_description>
