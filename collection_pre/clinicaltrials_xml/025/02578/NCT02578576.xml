	<brief_summary>Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory transmural bowel disorder characterized by high rate of postoperative anastomotic complications and recurrences. Surgery itself can influence immunologic function and trigger inflammatory response, which may result in the flare of Crohn's disease soon after surgery (within one month), especially near the anastomosis. Early flare-up of Crohn's disease can negatively impact the outcomes of operation. However, due to the the complexity of perioperative period and dangerous of invasive examine, it is difficult to distinguish disease flare from postoperative complications. In this study, the investigators aim to development a diagnostic method of flare-up within one month after surgery, which can help us to detect and then treat disease flare in time.</brief_summary>
