	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether targeted temperature management at 36.0˚C(TTM-36) in patients who remain unconscious after resuscitation from in-hospital cardiac arrest(IHCA) will reduce death and disability compared with fever control. For this purpose, the current pilot study will be undertaken to establish the feasibility, safety, and surrogate outcomes of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in 60 patients who remain unconscious after resuscitation from IHCA. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either TTM-36(n=40) or conventional treatment group(n=20). Randomization will be performed with stratification according to initial rhythm (shockable vs. non-shockable).</brief_summary>
