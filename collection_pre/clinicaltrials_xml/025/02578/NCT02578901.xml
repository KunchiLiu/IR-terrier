	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of antifibrinolytic therapy with tranexamic acid (TXA) in preventing bleeding in patients who are thrombocytopenic due to primary bone marrow disorders or chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>American Trial Using Tranexamic Acid in Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to conduct a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the usefulness of antifibrinolytic therapy with tranexamic acid in preventing bleeding in patients who are thrombocytopenic due to primary bone marrow disorders or chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The results of this study will change practice by providing evidence as to whether or not TXA is effective and safe treatment when used as an adjunct to platelet transfusion therapy in the thrombocytopenic patient.</detailed_description>
