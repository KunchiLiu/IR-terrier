	<brief_summary>Scientific evidence of conservative management of individuals with plantar fasciosis is sometimes conflicting. There is evidence that regular exercise programs are effective for this pain condition. The inclusion of other therapeutic modalities is still controversial. Some authors have suggested that the use of US-guided percutaneous electrolysis (EPE®) maybe useful for the management of chronic tendinopathies; however, no study has investigated the potential placebo effect of this intervention. The objective of this randomized clinical trial is to determine the effectiveness of US-guided percutaneous electrolysis (EPE®) versus sham US-guided percutaneous electrolysis for the management of patients with plantar fasciosis for pain, function, and disability.</brief_summary>
