	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics and pivotal bioequivalence of Darunavir (DRV) 800 milligram (mg), Emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) 10 mg when administered as a fixed-dose combination (FDC) (D/C/F/TAF) relative to the separate agents (DRV 800 mg tablet formulation and FTC/TAF 200/10 mg FDC) in the presence of 150 mg Cobicistat (COBI), under fed conditions, in healthy participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Bioequivalence Study of Darunavir, Emtricitabine, and Tenofovir Alafenamide, in the Presence of Cobicistat in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study in 96 healthy adult participants. The study consists of 2 treatment sessions. Participants will receive in one session a single dose of darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) 800/150/200/10 milligram (mg) tablets as fixed-dose combination (FDC) and in another session Darunavir (DRV) as 1x 800 mg tablet, Emtricitabine/ tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF) as 1x 200/10 mg FDC tablet, and Cobicistat (COBI) 150 mg as 1x 150 mg tablet all under fed conditions. Treatment sessions will be separated by a washout period of at least 7 days. The duration of the study for an individual participant will be at least 12 days, Screening and Follow-up not included. Participants safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant must be nonsmoker for at least 3 months prior to selection Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at Screening. If the results are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if they are not listed under the exclusion criteria and if the Investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed/signed by the Investigator Participant must have a body mass index (BMI), between 18.5 and 30 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2) (inclusive) Participant must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at Screening. If the results of the biochemistry panel, blood coagulation, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the abnormalities or deviations from normal are not listed in the exclusion criteria, and the Investigator judges they are not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed/signed by the Investigator All female participants, except when postmenopausal, must have a negative serum (beta‐human chorionic gonadotropin [beta‐hCG]) pregnancy test at Screening and must not breastfeed from Screening onwards Participant has a positive human immunodeficiency virus type (HIV1) or human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV2) test at Screening Participant has hepatitis A, B, or C infection (confirmed by a positive hepatitis A antibody immunoglobulin M (IgM), hepatitis B surface antigen, and/or hepatitis C virus antibody, respectively) at Screening Participant has currently significant and active gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurologic, psychiatric, metabolic, endocrinologic, genitourinary, renal, hepatic, respiratory, inflammatory, neoplastic, or infectious disease. Currently active dermatological disease that would interfere with a correct assessment of possible skin reactions to the study drugs Participant has currently significant and active diarrhea, nausea, or constipation that in the Investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or bioavailability Participant has any history of renal insufficiency</criteria>
