	<brief_title>A Pilot Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of ITDD vs. CMM in the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a non-randomized, open-label, single-center study that will compare efficacy of pain treatment with ITDD to efficacy of pain treatment with CMM in patients suffering from pancreatic cancer pain. There will be two treatment groups: Study group (ITDD): These subjects will have a Prometra System implanted and managed with the appropriate drug regimen to treat their pain. Systemic analgesics will not be prescribed for this group. Control group (CMM): These subjects will be treated with CMM to treat their pain. A maximum of 30 subjects (maximum of 15 in each treatment group) may be enrolled in this study at one study center.</detailed_description>
