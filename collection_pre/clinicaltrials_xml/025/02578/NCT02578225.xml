	<brief_summary>This study, which will be conducted at 23 sites representing the determined NUTS-1 regions in Turkey, in which all patients who were admitted to clinic or were hospitalized with Heart Failure (Acute or Chronic) diagnosis will be enrolled into the study, for a month and on a day of the week which will be determined by the site itself, is a national, multi-center, observational, epidemiological and cross-sectional study. This study is a local study which is planned to be conducted only in Turkey. Included patients of the study will be clinically evaluated by the physicians who are maintaining them and will receive the standard medical treatment which is determined by their physicians in normal life conditions. No experimental intervention or treatment will be received by patients in relation to the enrollment to this study. Therefore, this study does not contain a protocol or a pre-determined visit flowchart. However, patients with Heart Failure diagnosis should grant their consent to the retrospective utilization of their data and questions which will be asked to them about their disease history. Provided that the study's design is non-pharmacological observational, investigators will treat and follow the patients in accordance with their own medical decisions and their best clinical experiences.
