	<detailed_description>Background: Pre-eclampsia, more than being proteinuric gestational hypertension alone, is a state of exaggerated systemic inflammation and remains a leading direct cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide.1 Standardization of antenatal and postnatal assessment and surveillance of pre-eclampsia with protocols that recognize the systemic inflammatory model of preeclampsia have been associated with reduced maternal morbidity.2 To quantitatively asses electroencephalography (EEG) mental involvement in Pre-eclampsia is still time consuming and not always readily available. PIERS was developed and internally validate as a pre-eclampsia outcome prediction modelâ€” (Preeclampsia Integrated Estimate of RiSk) model.3 The purpose of our study was to evaluate the discriminative power of the Bispectral Index (BIS), biomarkers sFIT (soluble FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase): PIGF (Placental Growth Factor) ratio,4 and adrenomedullin mortality risk stratifier,5 to classify the degree and progression of pre-eclampsia. Methods: In 24 patients with Eclampsia or pre-eclampsia investigators will use an artefact-free 20-min mean BIS value, as well as biomarkers sFIT (soluble FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase): PIGF (Placental Growth Factor) ratio and adrenomedullin mortality risk stratifier to classify the degree of pre-eclampsia correlated the PIERS Pre-eclampsia risk assessment PIERS percentage (http://piers.cfri.ca/PIERSCalculatorH.aspx) will be calculated from patients' clinical and laboratory findings documented in their charts, compared with 24 pregnant patients without Eclampsia or pre-eclampsia.</detailed_description>
