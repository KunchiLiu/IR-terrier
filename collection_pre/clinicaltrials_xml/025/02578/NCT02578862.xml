	<brief_summary>Utilization of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) has been proposed as a method to improve visualization during endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), largely due to its physiologic decrease in cardiac output without the peripheral smooth muscle relaxation and resultant vasodilation associated with inhaled anesthetics. This may be especially important in cases of advanced inflammatory sinus disease, when visualization may be most compromised. The goal of this study is to improve clinical practice paradigms by evaluating the use of TIVA versus inhaled anesthetic for maintenance of anesthesia in ESS for advanced paranasal sinus disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims: 1. Determine the effect of total intravenous versus inhaled anesthesia on intraoperative visual field in endoscopic sinus surgery for advanced paranasal sinus disease 2. Evaluate clinical outcomes associated with choice of total intravenous versus inhaled anesthesia in endoscopic sinus surgery General Design: Double blind, randomized controlled trial of total intravenous versus inhaled anesthetic for maintenance of anesthesia during endoscopic sinus surgery. Subject Recruitment and Screening: Patients will be screened for study inclusion by the principal investigator (EDM) during their preoperative visit in the Department of Otolaryngology. Those meeting inclusion criteria will be introduced to the study at this time. A full description of the research purpose, personnel, procedures, risks and benefits will be presented, and a copy of the study consent documentation will be provided for home review. Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups: On the day of surgery, eligible participants will be admitted to the Day of Surgery Department, where a member of the Anesthesia team will review study information and confirm informed consent. A randomly assigned, sealed envelope will then be opened to assign participants to either the TIVA, or inhaled anesthetic cohort. At no time will the patient or surgeon be made aware of the patient's cohort. Blinding of Study Drug: At no time will the patient or surgeon be made aware of the patient's cohort. During the procedure the surgeon is blinded to the type of anesthesia by placement of a high drape at the head of the operative table. Study reviewers will be blinded to treatment arm without cohort assignment at time of review for determination of visual field score. Study Procedures: Participants make no clinic/hospital visits for purposes of study completion as all patient interaction limited to visits and surveys completed as part of routine clinical care. Clinic visits will include a baseline preoperative visit, and visits at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 10 weeks after surgery.</detailed_description>
