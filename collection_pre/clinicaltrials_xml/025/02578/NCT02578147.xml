	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to have girls play new computer games designed for middle school children and not yet available to the public. The investigator wants to know what girls think about these games. The investigator also wants to learn about the health behavior of 7th grade girls of Hispanic/Brazilian/Latino origin, and the investigators want to test the Mighty Girls program in Miami. Half of the girls in JUEGA will be given the Mighty Girls program and the investigators want to know if this program reduces behavior that puts girls at risk for having sex, drinking, and using drugs. The program tries to reduce this risk by helping girls learn skills to make wise choices, even when their friends have other ideas or want them to make more risky choices This goal is important because US statistics indicate that Hispanic teens are at risk for teen pregnancy and Miami has one of the highest HIV and AIDS rates in the United States. The investigator wants to find out whether the Mighty Girls program is as effective in Miami-Dade County Public Schools as it was when tested in one of Orlando's Orange County Public Schools.</brief_summary>
