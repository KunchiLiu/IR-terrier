	<brief_title>Intrathecal Dexamethasone and Labor Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective double-blind trial included 80 primigravidas during vaginal delivery with a cervical dilatation ≥ 4 cm and 50% effacement randomly assigned to one of two equal groups; Group L received intrathecal levobupivacaine 0.25% in 2 mL and Group LD received intrathecal levobupivacaine 0.25% combined with dexamethasone 4 mg in 2 mL. At first request of analgesia, a combination of 0.25% levobupivacaine with 100 μg fentanyl in 10 ml via the epidural catheter. Further analgesia was provided with 7 ml 0.25% levobupivacaine hourly. The primary outcome measure was the duration of spinal analgesia. Secondary outcome measures include time from spinal analgesia to delivery, total amount of epidurally administered levobupivicaine, adverse effects of neuraxial block and neonatal outcome.</detailed_description>
