	<brief_title>The Objective is to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Masitinib in Combination With Riluzole in the Treatment of Patients Suffering From Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Masitinib is novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets microglia and mast cells through inhibiting a limited number of kinases. Masitinib blocks microglia proliferation and activation, and mast cell-mediated degranulation, the release of cytotoxic substances that might further damage the motor nerves.</detailed_description>
