	<brief_summary>After successful coronary angiography and OCT examination, patients with TCFAs in non-culprit, mild-to-moderate stenotic lesions will be enrolled. Then, they will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either atorvastatin (20 mg/day) alone or atorvastatin (20 mg/day）plus ezetimibe（10 mg/day）by envelope method. Angiographic and OCT follow-up will be scheduled for the target vessel after 12 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ezetimibe and Atorvastatin Therapy on TCFA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized , controlled, open-label, single-center study to evaluate the effect of ezetimibe added to atorvastatin on coronary thin-cap fibroatheroma(TCFA). After successful coronary angiography and OCT examination, patients with TCFAs in non-culprit, mild-to-moderate stenotic lesions will be enrolled. Then, they will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either atorvastatin (20 mg/day) alone or atorvastatin (20 mg/day）plus ezetimibe（10 mg/day）by envelope method. Angiographic and OCT follow-up will be scheduled for the target vessel after 12 months.The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in minimum fibrous cap thickness measured by OCT from baseline to follow-up.The secondary endpoints include absolute and percent changes in the lipid, glycemic, and inflammatory profile. Then, changes of these indicators above will be compared respectively in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.</detailed_description>
