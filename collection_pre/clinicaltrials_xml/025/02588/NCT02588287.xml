	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effect of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) treatment on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and renal safety of tenofovir. Subjects receiving tenofovir-based antiretroviral therapy with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors (HIV PI/r) and initiating SOF/LDV treatment for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) will be invited to participate. The study consists of three visits: a screening visit and two abbreviated 4-hour pharmacokinetic visits (one before initiating SOF/LDV and a second approximately 4 weeks after initiating SOF/LDV).</brief_summary>
