	<brief_summary>In last few years, most researches about hepatic complication after chemotherapy focused on hepatitis B virus (HBV). With adequate prophylaxis and monitor, HBV-related hepatitis flares can be prevented. In contrast, cancer patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are traditionally considered as relative safe to receive chemotherapy. However, two large retrospective studies recently showed that severe hepatitis could develop in 14-27% lymphoma patients with chronic HCV infection, including 3-4% hepatic failure. The risk factors to predict severe hepatitis are pre-treatment elevated ALT level and liver cirrhosis. Due to the lack of prospective studies, the dynamic changes of serum HCV RNA levels and the association of hepatitis are still unclear. Some epidemiologic studies demonstrated an association between HCV infection and B-cell lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma and several reports showed higher prevalence of HCV infection among DLBCL patients than the controls. HCV infected DLBCL patients are reported to have distinct clinical characteristics, such as older, more with elevated LDH levels, and more with extra-nodal involvement. Regarding the impact of HCV infection on prognosis, the results are conflicting. Taiwan is an endemic area of HCV but there are limited reports addressing the clinical characteristics and prognosis in this unique population. Therefore, the investigators initiate a prospective, multi-center observational study to clarify the dynamic association between serum HCV RNA levels and hepatitis in HCV-infected lymphoma patients treated with chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
