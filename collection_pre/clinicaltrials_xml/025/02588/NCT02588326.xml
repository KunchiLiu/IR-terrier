	<brief_summary>Currently FDA does not accept pharmacokinetic studies to show bioequivalence of locally-acting nasal suspension formulations. However, bioequivalence is defined as the absence of significant differences in pharmacokinetics of therapeutically equivalent drug products compared to the matching originally invented drug formulation. These there-called "generic drugs" are then interchangeable. Drug companies have to show that their generic version has the same active ingredient, the same label, is intended to be used for the same conditions or diseases and works at the same rate in the body. The aim of the study is to determine if pharmacokinetics is sensitive to differences in the particle size distribution of three different nasal suspension formulations of mometasone furoate during charcoal block. The result from this study will aid the FDA in finding methods to ensure that generic products are the same as the trade name drugs.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As a subject in this research study the following procedures and scheduling will take place. During the screening visit the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed to ensure the subject is appropriate for the study. A physical examination will be performed after the vital sign measurements are obtained. Also, nasal spray application training will be performed and tolerability to charcoal block will be determined. Screening tests will be performed within 30 days of study visit 1 and no later than 2 days before study visit 1. There will be 3 study visits additional to the screening, a minimum period of 7 days should lapse between the subsequent study visits but no more than 3 weeks. The total study duration for each subject will be about 5-10 weeks. Blood sample collection Blood samples will be taken 15 minutes prior to dosing and 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 hours post dosing. At each time point 8 ml of blood sample will be collected, a total of 389 ml blood will be drawn from each subject, including the screening visit.</detailed_description>

Any history or current drug or alcohol abuse, which would interfere with the subject's completion of the study and with adherence to the protocol The subject or their close family member is an employee of the study site or is involved with the conduct of the study. Subject reports a regular xanthine consumption of &gt; 5 cups of coffee or black tea per day (or equivalent xanthine consumption of 500 mg xanthine per day using other products). Subject is vegetarian or reports other strict dietary habits which would preclude the subject's acceptance of standardized meals. The subject is a student of the Principal Investigator.
