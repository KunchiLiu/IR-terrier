	<brief_title>Phase III Study of Sulfatinib in Treating Advanced Extrapancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>273 patients will be randomly assigned (in 2:1 ratio) to the Sulfatinib or Placebo treatment group based on interactive web response system（IWRS).The patients will receive continuous oral treatment, every 28-day treatment cycle until progression of disease occurs, intolerable toxicity or other protocol specified end-o-treatment criteria is met. The tumor should be assessed every 8 weeks (+/-3 days) within the first year and every 12 weeks (+/-3 days) after the patient has been treated for one year. A Blinded Independent Image Review Committee (BIIRC) will subsequently provide a central review of the oncologic imaging materials from the patients. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be assembled to monitor safety and efficacy data, and evaluate interim analysis. If the interim analysis demonstrates overwhelming efficacy of the treatment arm with respect to PFS (primary endpoint) versus control arm, IDMC could recommend terminating and to unblinding the study and sulfatinib will be offered to the control arm patients who are still on treatment until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Adequately understand the study and voluntarily sign the Informed Consent Form; 2. Be at least 18 years old; 3. Based on central pathology review results，patients have a confirmed histologically pathology diagnosis of low or intermediate grade (G1 or G2) advanced (unresectable or distant metastatic) extrapancreatic NETs with origins including, but not limited to, the lung, thymus, the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, duodenum, liver, jejunum, ileum, colon, cecum, appendix, rectum) and unknown origin etc. For Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (GINETs), G1 is defined as &lt; 2 mitoses /10 highpower field (HPF) and/or &lt;3% Ki67 index; G2 is defined as 220/10 HPF and/or 320% Ki67 index; for NETs originating from the lung and thymus gland, G1 is defined as &lt;2 mitoses/10 HPF and no necrosis; G2 is defined as 210/10 HPF and/or foci of necrosis. NETs from origin other than GINET, lung and thymus, or from unknown origins should be graded according to the GINET grading criteria. If the mitotic ratio and Ki67 index correspond to different grade, the higher grade should be used to assign classification. 4. Have previously received no more than two types of systemic antitumor therapy, including longacting somatostatin analogs (SSAs), interferon,peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, themammaliantargetofrapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors or chemotherapy; patients who are unable or unwilling to receive such treatments are also eligible; 5. Patients must have radiological documentation of progression of disease within 12 months prior to randomization. 6. Have measurable lesions 7. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≥1.5×109/L, platelet count of ≥100×109/L, and hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL; 8. Serum total bilirubin &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); 9. Patients who do not have liver metastasis, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels ≤ 2.5 times the ULN; and who do have liver metastatic, with ALT, AST and ALP ≤ 5 times ULN. 10. Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 times ULN and creatinine clearance ≥60 ml/min; 11. International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤1.5 ULN and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ≤1.5 ULN. 12. Have a performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale; 13. Have expected survival of more than 12 weeks; 14. Male or females patients with reproductive potential must agree to use an effective contraceptive method, for example, doublebarrier device, condom, oral or injected birth control medication or intrauterine device, during the study and within 90 days after study treatment discontinuation. All female patients are considered to be fertile, unless the patient had natural menopause or artificial menopause or sterilization. 1. High grade (G3) neuroendocrine cancer, adenocarcinoid, pancreatic islet cell carcinoma, goblet cell carcinoid, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and small cell carcinoma; 2. Neuroendocrine tumors with pancreatic origins 3. Functional NETs which need to be treated with long acting SSAs to control disease related syndromes, such as insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonoma, somatostatinoma, accompanied by carcinoid syndrome, ZollingerEllison syndrome or other active symptoms; 4. Have received antivascular endothelial growth factor（VEGF）/VEGFR targeted drugs and progressed upon these drugs; 5. Urinalysis shows urine protein ≥ 2+ or 24hour protein quantity test shows urinary protein ≥1 g; 6. Serum potassium, calcium (albuminbound ionic or corrected) or magnesium exceed the normal range with clinical significance; 7. Under antihypertension treatment, still uncontrolled hypertension, defined as: systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg; 8. Gastrointestinal disease or condition that investigators suspect may affect drug absorption, including, but not limited to, active gastric and duodenal ulcers, ulcerative colitis and other digestive disease, gastrointestinal tumor with active bleeding, or other gastrointestinal conditions that may cause bleeding or perforation by investigator's discretion; 9.
