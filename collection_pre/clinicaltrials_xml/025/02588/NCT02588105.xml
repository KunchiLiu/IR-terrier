	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether AZD0156 is safe, what is the best dose to give, and how it is processed by the body when given alone or in combination with other agents. The study will also collect some initial information about how effective it is.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of AZD0156 at Increasing Doses Alone or in Combination With Other Anti-cancer Treatment in Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will consist of a number of study modules, each evaluating the safety and tolerability of AZD0156 with a specific combination agent. The combination option may require an initial monotherapy dose escalation to gain an understanding of pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability before initiating dose escalation in combination. An oral formulation of AZD0156 will be used. Module 1 explores AZD0156 in combination with olaparib Additional modules may be added to explore AZD0156 as a monotherapy or in combination with other agents and may be in different tumour types. An expansion cohort in module 1 may enroll additional patients including, but not limited to, patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma, to explore further the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biological activity at selected dose(s) or alternate dosing schedules, and to get a preliminary assessment of efficacy . During the dose expansion phase of any study module, a preliminary investigation of the effect of food on exposure may be made.</detailed_description>
