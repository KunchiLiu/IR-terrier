	<brief_title>The Predictive Value of TMPRSS2-ERG Fusion in High Risk Prostate Cancer Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate the predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in prostate patients who have been treated with hormonal and radiation treatment after biochemical failure Original biopsy slides of 65 patients will be collected and reviewed. A tissue used to test and map DNA fragments will be constructed from patients who underwent radiation therapy. RNA and DNA will be extracted from each slide. This study, if positive, will establish the predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in prostate cancer patients. It can lead to believe that high-risk prostate cancer patients will benefit from a more aggressive treatment. An endpoint of this study is to evaluate the relation between the Gleason score and the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. Another is to evaluate the relation between the T-stage and TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion.</detailed_description>
