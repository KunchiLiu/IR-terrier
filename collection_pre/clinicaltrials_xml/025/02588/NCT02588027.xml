	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized controlled trial to determine if postoperative ibuprofen after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair impacts postoperative opiate medication use, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores, shoulder range of motion (ROM), and repair integrity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Ibuprofen on Postoperative Opiate Medication Use and Shoulder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized into two cohorts: 1. Ibuprofen 400mg by mouth three times daily. Patients will also receive the standard opiate medication (hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10mg/325mg) for the UCSF orthopaedic clinic for postoperative pain control. 2. Placebo tablet by mouth three times daily. Patients will also received the standard opiate medication (hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10mg/325mg) for the UCSF orthopaedic clinic for postoperative pain control. Patients will be screened for the study at the preoperative clinic vist and randomized on the day of surgery if they meet our inclusion criteria. Postoperatively, they will be seen at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Pill counting will be done at the 1 week postoperative visit. VAS pain scores will be assessed at every visit. Functional shoulder outcomes including shoulder range of motion and the American Shoulder and Elbow Society (ASES) survey will be completed at these visits as well. The SF-12 health and Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) survey will be completed at the preoperative visit and final follow-up visit only. We will assess rotator cuff repair integrity with ultrasound study at 1 year after surgery</detailed_description>
