	<brief_title>A Study of Tremelimumab Combined With the Anti-PD-L1 MEDI4736 Antibody in Malignant Mesothelioma (NIBIT-MESO-1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis of malignant mesothelioma (MM) patients remains dismal and effective treatment represents a high un-met medical need. Investigators have recently reported promising clinical activity of the anti-CTLA-4 mAb tremelimumab in pre-treated MM patients: disease control rate (DCR) was 31%, and survival rate at 1- and 2-years were 48.3% and 36.7%, respectively. These initial findings were corroborated by a second study in which, based on retrospective pharmacokinetic analyses, an intensified schedule of tremelimumab was utilized. Fifty-two % of patients achieved a DCR (median duration 10.9 months). These intriguing clinical results and the emerging efficacy of immunomodulatory mAb targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in different tumor types, prompted us to design the NIBIT-MESO-1 study aimed to investigate the efficacy of tremelimumab combined with the anti-PD-L1 MEDI4736 in MM patients.</detailed_description>
