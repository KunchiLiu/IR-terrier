	<brief_summary>In the study, NextGen SE are on-hand a cohort comprising each 50 pediatric and 50 adult patients, and in which there are an unclear movement disorder or an unclear cognitive disorder, examines the following questions : Primary: - Number of diagnoses made by NGS Secondary: 1. restriction of the quality of life by unclear disease 2. Cost of not purposeful preliminary diagnostics ( beyond the minimal diagnostic data set ) 3. Impact of the diagnosis to therapy and follow-up examinations 4. Time to diagnosis</brief_summary>

Unclear cognitive decline o After minimal exclusion diagnosis MRT (intracranial pressure, focal brain lesions explanatory) laboratory (Thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH), TPOAK, antibody profile limbic encephalitis) Liquor (inflammation, meningitis) Electroencephalography (EEG) (Status) Exclusion chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) For patients &lt;18 years Patients with (penetrating) suspected cerebral neurogenetic diseases Unclear movement disorder (spasticity, ataxia, dyskinesia) Unclear cognitive disorder with probability of monogenic origin Fragile X Syndrome (FraX) at mentally retarded boy, Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) with ataxia should be genetically excluded For patients &gt; 18 years 1. Lack of consent 2. symptom onset &gt; 40 years of age 3. Sudden, abrupt beginning 4. As early as previous history of genetic diagnosis using nextgeneration sequencing (NGS), also in the form of a panel For patients &lt;18 years 1. injury brain disorders On the basis of imaging On the basis of medical history (premature baby, hypoxicischemic encephalopathy) 2. Inflammatory brain disorders On the basis of imaging On the basis of laboratory parameters (Oligoclonal fractions, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count increased) 3. Light, isolated mental developmental disorder or behavioral disorder (rare monogenetic) (less than 2 standard deviartion of normal or &lt; 6 year olds less than 1 year in development history back) 4.
