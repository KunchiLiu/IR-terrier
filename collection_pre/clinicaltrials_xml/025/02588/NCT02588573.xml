	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to compare the overall subjective comfort profile over 8 hours of lens wear in two groups of habitual soft contact lens wearers (frequent replacement and daily disposable hydrogel lenses) when refitted into Clariti 1-Day.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Overall Performance of a 1-day Silicone Hydrogel Lens When Habitual Soft Lens Wearers Are Refit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective, single day, randomized, double-masked, non-dispensing, contralateral study.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>A person is eligible for inclusion in the study if he/she: 1. Is at least 17 years of age and has full legal capacity to volunteer; 2. Has read and signed an information consent letter; 3. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule; 4. Is correctable to a visual acuity of 20/40 or better (in each eye) with their habitual correction or the assigned study lenses; 5. Habitually wears either 1Day Acuvue® Moist® or any frequent replacement contact lenses (as defined in 4.1.1); 6. Habitually wear contact lenses with a power between 1.00 and 6.00D (inclusive) in both eyes; 7. Demonstrates an acceptable fit with the study lenses; 8. Is usually able to wear contact lenses for at least 8 hours per day. A person will be excluded from the study if he/she: 1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study; 2. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection; 3. Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study outcome variable; 4. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study outcome variable; 5. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic substances (pharmaceuticals), such as fluorescein dye, or products to be used in the study; 6. Is aphakic; 7. Has undergone refractive error surgery. 8. Has participated in the previous BEETHOVEN study (ORE# 20893) For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or inflammation which requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered active ocular disease. Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or inflammation and are therefore not active.</criteria>
