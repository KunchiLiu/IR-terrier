	<brief_summary>To investigate, whether a prophylactic wrapping of the gastroduodenal artery stump with the ligamentum teres or falciform hepatic (embryological structures, covered with peritoneum that do not have relevant meaning for adults) can reduce the incidence of arrosion bleeding during surgery. Thus a surgical technique is evaluated prospectively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pancreatoduodenectomy With or Without Ligamentum Teres Wrap Around Gastroduodenal Artery Stump for Prevention of Pancreatic Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatoduodenectomy is a standard surgical procedure for resection of tumors of the pancreatic head and neck, and for selected patients with chronic pancreatitis. A postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is a severe and frequent complication that may lead to a potentially letal arrosion hemorrhage from the stump of the gastroduodenal artery (GDA). Aim of the study is to evaluate the prophylactic wrapping of the GDA stump using the falciform hepatic ligament during the index operation. The null hypothesis is that prophylactic wrapping does not decrease the incidence of arrosion hemorrhage from the GDA stump. The study is designed as a randomized, single-blinded, controlled, multicenter trial.</detailed_description>
