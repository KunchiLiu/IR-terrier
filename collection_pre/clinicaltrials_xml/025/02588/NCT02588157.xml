	<brief_title>Effect of Cricoid Pressure on Macintosh, McGrath X-Blade and Glidescope Videolaryngoscopes in Rapid Sequence Induction Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators fecidedir to enroll the ASA I-II 120 patients and divided them into three groups ( Macintosh / McGarth X-Blade / Glidescope). The investigators recorded the patients' airway data and demographic variables. All patients were premeditated with midazolam. Standard monitoring including electrocardiogram, non invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, heart rate were recorded before induction , after induction, after the device insertion and every 1 minutes after intubation. Cormac-Lehan grades with these video laryngoscope were recorded also. We recorded the optimization maneuvers ( like handling force, reinserting, cricoid pressure). Bloodstaining on the devices after removal were recorded as mucosal damage. Teeth, tongue, lip damage were also recorded. Sore throat, bronchospasm, wheezing were recored at recovery unit.</detailed_description>
