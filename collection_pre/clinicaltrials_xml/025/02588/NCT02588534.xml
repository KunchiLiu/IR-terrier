	<brief_summary>A single-center, open-label, randomized study with a screening period of up to 21 days. Following that, eligible men and women will receive 50 mg of etanercept subcutaneously in the thigh to compare injection by auto-injection device to manual injection (each injection separated by 28 days)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-label Study Using 50 Mg Liquid Etanercept Subcutaneous Injection in the Thigh to Compare an Auto-injector Device and a Manual Injection in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single-center, open-label, 2-period, 2-sequence, 2-treatment, randomized, crossover study. After a screening period of up to 21 days before dosing, 36 eligible men and women will be assigned to receive a 50-mg subcutaneous (SC) dose of etanercept administered by each of 2 methods of injection (Treatment A: administration by auto-injector device; and Treatment B: administration by manual injection) on separate occasions in an order determined by a randomization list (randomized 1:1 to sequence). Treatment administrations will be separated by a minimum of 28 days (maximum of 36 days). Subjects will be required to remain resident during the 72-hours after dosing in each period.</detailed_description>
