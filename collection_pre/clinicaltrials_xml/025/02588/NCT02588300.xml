	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, interventional cohort study of drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE). The goal is to evaluate the upper airway in a cohort of patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) diagnosed in a prior polysomnography. This study correlates the sedation level measured by entropy during DISE using propofol via a TCI pump with the local obstruction patterns of the upper airway according to the VOTE classification. As OSAHS is a widespread disease and the DISE procedure has become a common tool for diagnosis and evaluation of further treatment, a growing number of research articles deal with this topic. These articles are available through pubmed.</brief_summary>
