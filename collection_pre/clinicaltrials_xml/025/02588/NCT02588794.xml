	<brief_title>Cytokine Adsorption in Sepsis and Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient with proved severe sepsis/septic shock, treated in accordance to actual sepsis guidelines, who develope akute kidney injury (RIFLE I) or kidney failure (RIFLE F), were randomized in two groups. One group is treated with CVVHD/ local citrat anticoagulation (standart clinical practice). The other group ist treated with an additional cytokine adsorber ( 300ml CytoSorb device, 3804606CE01) CytoSorb therapy is performed for 24h, then the adsorber is changed into a new device. Cytosorb therapy is stopped, when Interleukin 6 leves drop below 1000 pg/ml in patient serum.</detailed_description>
