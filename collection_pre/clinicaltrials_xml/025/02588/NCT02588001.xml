	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in patients with non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. The total duration of the study will be 5 years. All patients will receive enzalutamide 160 mg (four 40 mg capsules) orally once daily. The treatment will be started at Visit 0 within one week after enrollment. Visit 1 is at 2 weeks after the treatment started; clinical assessments are conducted on adverse events and the Japanese version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) scales. Patients who are considered to be adequate by the investigator can continue the treatment with 12-week cycle visit (counted from initial dose) until patients meet withdrawal criteria. Patients will be followed up at 2 and 3 years after enrollment and at 3 years after the last participant enrollment. The end of the study is defined as follow-up assessment date at 3 years after the last participant enrollment. Patients will primarily be assessed by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PFS).</brief_summary>
