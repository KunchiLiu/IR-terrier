	<brief_summary>This study is intended for men and women at least 18 years of age who have advanced lung cancer which has grown or returned after being treated. In particular, it is a study for subjects who have a blood test positive for HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*205 and/or HLA-A*0206 protein and a tumor test positive for NY-ESO-1 expression (protein or gene). The study will take the subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the blood, and send them to a laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study will be the subject's own T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of attacking and destroying cancer cells. The manufacturing of T cells takes about 1 month to complete. The T cells will be given back to the subject through an intravenous infusion. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of genetically changed T cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in subjects with lung cancer. Subjects will be seen frequently by the Study Physician right after receiving their T cells back. Subjects will then be entered into a long-term follow up in order to monitor the subject. Subjects will be seen every 6 months by their Study Physician for the first 5 years after the T cell infusion. If the T cells are found in the blood at five years, then the subjects will continue to be seen once a year until the T cells are no longer found in the blood for a maximum of 15 years. If the T cells are no longer found in the blood at 5 years, then the subject will be contacted by the Study Physician for the next 10 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T for Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-arm study of genetically engineered NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells in HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*0205 and/or HLA-A*0206 positive subjects with advanced (Stage IIIb or IV) NSCLC. Subjects with measurable disease will be screened for general health, performance status and disease stage. Following screening, subjects meeting all eligibility will undergo a large-volume leukapheresis to obtain cells for the manufacture of autologous NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹ TCR bearing T cells. When the NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells are available, subjects will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on Day -7, Day -6 and Day -5 followed by the cell infusion on Day 1. Subjects will visit the clinic for safety and efficacy assessments daily from T cell infusion (Day 1) through Day 5, Days 8, 10, 12, and then weekly until week 6 and then at 8, 10, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks, and every 3 months until 2 years and then every 6 months until progression of their disease (or withdrawal of consent for the interventional portion of the study) Subjects who have a confirmed response (or have stable disease for &gt;4 months) but subsequent disease progression following the initial infusion and whose tumor continues to express the appropriate antigen target may be eligible for a second infusion. All subjects, completing or withdrawing from the interventional portion of the study, will enter a 15-year long-term follow-up phase for observation of delayed adverse events. All subjects will continue to be followed for overall survival during the long-term follow-up phase.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject has voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed consent 2. Subject is ≥18 years of age 3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (stage IIIB or IV) or recurrent disease. Subjects with known EGFR mutations or ALK or ROS1 gene rearrangements must have also failed prior EGFR or ALK or ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, respectively (PD or unacceptable toxicity). Subjects may have received PD1 or PDL1 inhibitors. There is no limit on lines of prior anticancer therapy. 4. Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. 5. Subject must be HLAA*02:01, HLAA*02:05 and/or HLAA*02:06 positive. 6. Subject's tumor (either an archival specimen or a fresh biopsy if archival tissue is unavailable) has been pathologically reviewed by a designated central laboratory confirming NYESO1 and/or LAGE1a expression. 7. ECOG Performance Status 01 and anticipated life expectancy &gt; 3 months. 8. All subjects must have left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%. 9. Subject is fit for leukapheresis and has adequate venous access for the cell collection. 10. Female subjects of childbearing potential (FPCP) must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test. NOTE: FPCP is defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized. FPCP must agree to use maximally effective birth control or to abstain from heterosexual activity throughout the study, starting at the first dose of chemotherapy through 12 months after the infusion of cells and/or for 4 months after there is no evidence of persistence/gene modified cells in the blood, whichever is longer. Effective contraceptive methods include intrauterine device, oral and/or injectable hormonal contraception, or 2 adequate barrier methods (e.g. diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, or female condom with spermicide). Spermicides alone are not an adequate method of contraception. Or Male subjects must be surgically sterile or agrees to use a double barrier contraception method or abstain from heterosexual activity with a female of childbearing potential upon enrolment starting at the first dose of chemotherapy through and for 4 months thereafter or longer (if indicated in the country specific monograph/label for cyclophosphamide. 11. Subject must have adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory values in the table below: Absolute Neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 x10⁹/L (without GCSF support) Platelets ≥ 75 x10⁹/L Hemoglobin &gt;80 g/dL (without transfusion support within 7 days from start of leukapheresis) Prothrombin Time or INR ≤1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) ≤1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless receiving therapeutic anticoagulation.

Furthermore and prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy, a subject meeting the following criteria is not eligible for participation in the study: 1. Subject who has had cytotoxic chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy; immune therapy (including monoclonal antibody therapy, checkpoint inhibitors or biological therapy within 4 weeks prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy; corticosteroids or any other immunosuppressive therapy within 2 weeks prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy; tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (e.g. erlotinib, gefitinib) within 1 week prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy. 2.

(Note: there is no washout period for palliative radiation to nontarget organs other than the lung or mediastinum. If radiation was to an intended target lesion within 3 months of baseline imaging studies, and the lesion is progressing within this time frame it may be considered as a target lesion after review and discussion with the Sponsor.)</criteria>
