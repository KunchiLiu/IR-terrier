	<brief_title>Investigation of Long-term Effects of CarelessTM on Microcirculation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim of the study is to investigate long-term effects of CarelessTM, a Mangifera indica fruit powder on microcirculation and endothelial function after supplementation of 4 weeks. Effects will be investigated with 100mg and 300mg CarelessTM and compared to placebo. To describe targeted parameter, cutaneous microcirculation will be measured at 1 mm depth as well as flow mediated endothelial function at the beginning and end of supplementation, each. Furthermore, the parameters will be determined postprandially 1 hour after glucose loading. Additionally the influence on the glucose metabolism, as well as on body weight and body fat will be documented.</detailed_description>
