	<brief_summary>The estimation of the cardiovascular risk in the general population must take into account small renal disturbances, as the microalbuminuria. Conversely certain parameters of the cardiovascular risk influence the evolution of renal diseases, for example the arterial high blood pressure. The measure of the activity of the autonomous nervous system, and especially the quantification of its variability, is a means to estimate the cardiovascular risk. The investigators formulate the hypothesis that the variability of the autonomous nervous system is an additional clinical element for the evaluation of the evolutionary risk of renal diseases. The aim of this study is to compare the variability of the autonomous nervous system during the various evolutionary stages of the renal disease. The renal disease studied will be IgA nephropathy (IgNA). IgNA is a histologically defined glomerulonephritis (rela biopsy) by the presence of deposits immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the renal mesangium (at list 1+) by immunofluorescence.</brief_summary>
