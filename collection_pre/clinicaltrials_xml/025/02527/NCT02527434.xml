	<brief_title>Study of Tremelimumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, multi-center study to determine the efficacy and safety of tremelimumab in the treatment of different cohorts of patients with selected advanced solid tumors. If eligible and at the discretion of the Investigator, after confirmed disease progression on tremelimumab monotherapy or during follow-up, patients will have the option of being sequenced to MEDI4736 (MedImmune 4736) monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy, for up to 12 months or until disease progression, whichever comes sooner.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. histologically or cytologically documented solid tumor malignancies, including but not limited to 1 of the following: UBC, Metastatic PDAC, TNBC; Are intolerant, are ineligible for, or have refused treatment with standard firstline therapy; 2. At least 1 lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes, which must have short axis ≥15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) (preferred) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and that is suitable for accurate repeated measurements.
