	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized, longitudinal study of the clinical outcomes of osteoarthritis patients treated by two different alignment philosophies for total knee replacement. In this study ShapeMatch® cutting guides will be compared to the conventional approach.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Mechanical Axis vs Kinematic Alignment in Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>The patient is a male or nonpregnant female between the ages of 4080 years. The patient requires a primary total knee replacement and is indicated for computerassisted surgery. Patient is deemed appropriate for a cruciate retaining knee replacement. The patient has a primary diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA). The patient has intact collateral ligaments. The patient is able to undergo MRI scanning of the affected limb. The patient has signed the study specific, ethicsapproved, Informed Consent document. The patient is willing and able to comply with the specified preoperative and postoperative clinical and radiographic evaluations. The patient has a history of total, unicompartmental reconstruction or fusion of the affected joint. Patient has had a previous osteotomy around the knee. The patient is morbidly obese (BMI ≥ 40). The patient has a deformity which will require the use of stems, wedges or augments in conjunction with the Triathlon Total Knee System. The patient has a varus/valgus malalignment ≥ 15° (relative to mechanical axis). The patient has a fixed flexion deformity ≥ 15°. The patient has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficiency, which would limit the ability to assess the performance of the device. The patient has a systemic or metabolic disorder leading to progressive bone deterioration. The patient is immunologically suppressed or receiving steroids in excess of normal physiological requirements. Patient has a cognitive impairment, an intellectual disability or a mental illness. The patient is pregnant. The patient has metal hardware present in the region of the hip, knee or ankle (as this is known to create geometrical distortion in the region of the implant). The patient has any known contraindications for undergoing assessment by MRI (e.g. ferrous implants, metallic clips, magnetically activated implanted devices such as cardiac pacemakers, etc).</criteria>
