	<brief_summary>The efficacy of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy for branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is shown, but its effect on retinal sensitivity is not fully investigated. The purpose of this study is to compare the changes in retinal sensitivity after ranibizumab therapy or combination therapy of ranibizumab and laser photocoagulation in eyes with BRVO.</brief_summary>
