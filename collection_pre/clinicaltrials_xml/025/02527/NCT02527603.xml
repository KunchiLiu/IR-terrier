	<brief_title>Spaso Versus Self-assisted Maneuver for Anterior Shoulder Dislocation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction: There are many described maneuvers in literature describing how to reduce an anterior shoulder dislocation. Most of these maneuvers are performed by a trained physician, however, seldom are these taught to patients in case of recurrence or accidental dislocations that may occur far from a trained professional to treat. The Boss-Holzach-Matter maneuver is a simple, easy to understand and easy to perform self assisted method that has not been compared to any other method. Hypothesis: The Boss-Holzach-Matter method is a less painful maneuver compared to the Spaso method assuming an equal success rate. Objective: To determine whether the Boss-Holzach-Matter method is a less painful method for anterior shoulder dislocations compares to the Spaso method assuming equal success rate. Methodology: Fifty six patients presenting acute anterior shoulder dislocation will be randomized, at the time of the admission , to either Spaso reduction method performed by a physician or the self-assisted Boss-Holzach-Matter method.</detailed_description>
