	<detailed_description>A Phase I, dose escalation study to evaluation the safety and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of F-627 in female breast cancer patients receiving 4 cycles of EC chemotherapy (Epirubicin plus Cyclophosphamide). 18 patients (6 patients each cohort) were assigned to three sequential doses cohort of F-627 at the dose of 80, 240 and 320 µg/kg. The patients received chemotherapy (100 mg/m2 epirubicin and 600 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide) administrated by i.v. injection on Day 1 and F-627 by s.c. injection on Day 3 of each cycle for 4 cycles. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed in 6 patients during first cycle, the next cohort was escalated. Blood samples were collected for completed blood counts with differential, serum F-627 concentration and safety evaluation at different point following F-672 injection. The decision to proceed to the next higher dose was be made jointly by the sponsor's medical expert and the investigator based upon the review of safety data in the first cycle treatment.</detailed_description>
