	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the relative predictive ability of the derived monitoring instrument to determine post discharge instability and 30-day outcomes in patients discharged with HF. The primary hypothesis is that variables in the monitoring instrument, individually and combined, identify risk for 30-day outcomes. Clinical indicators of dyspnea, fatigue, orthopnea, dyspnea with exertion, daily weight, edema, heart rate, blood pressure, mental condition, medication adherence, and overall well-being will be reported by participants on a daily basis and considered indicators for 30-day outcomes of stability, re-hospitalization, or mortality.</brief_summary>
