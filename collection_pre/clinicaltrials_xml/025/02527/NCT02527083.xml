	<brief_summary>Research suggests that the type of anesthesia used for surgery may affect intraoperative stress hormone levels. There is also data to support that an increased level of stress hormones leads to increased pain after surgery. The primary aim of this study is to determine the effect of anesthesia type on long term pain after hernia surgery. In this study, patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair will be randomized to an anesthetic group, either Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) maintained with propofol or Balanced Inhaled Anesthesia (BIA) maintained with sevoflurane. This will allow us to look at any differences in short and long-term pain after hernia repair depending on type of anesthesia received.</brief_summary>
