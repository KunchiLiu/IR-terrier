	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate how the effect of infused sodium nitrite differs in hypertensives compared to healthy age and sex matched controls. The effects on renal handling of nitrite, nitrate, sodium and water, plasma concentrations of vasoactive hormones, peripheral (brachial) and central blood pressure will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Sodium Nitrite on Renal Function and Blood Pressure in Hypertensive Versus Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nitric oxide (NO) is an important vasodilating molecule with a very complex biochemistry and metabolism. NO is classically synthesized from L-arginin by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) located in the endothelial cell lining. Several chronic cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease and diabetes are accompanied by endothelial dysfunction and hence diminished synthesis of NO. NO is a very reactive molecule and direct investigation of its function are limited and it has mainly been investigated by inhibition of eNOS. Recent research has shown that sodium nitrite is readily converted to NO by enzymes in vivo. The effects of sodium nitrite on renal variables, vasoactive hormones and central blood pressure are previously unexamined. It is now possible to achieve serial estimations of the central aortic systolic pressure (CASP) by a wrist born device. Hypothesis: 1. Sodium nitrite infusion increases the urinary sodium excretion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 2. Sodium nitrite infusion increases plasma levels of nitrite, nitrate, NO and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 3. Sodium nitrite infusion lowers the peripheral and central blood pressure 4. Renal clearance of nitrite is constant and not dose dependent 5. Sodium nitrite infusion affects vasoactive hormones 6. The hemodynamic and renal effects is more pronounced in hypertensives as compared to healthy controls. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of sodium nitrite infusion on 1. Renal handling of nitrite, nitrate, sodium and water 2. Plasma concentrations of vasoactive hormones 3. Peripheral (brachial) blood pressure and CASP Design: 15 hypertensive subjects and 15 healthy, age and sex matched controls is recruited. Each subject will attend to two examination days. Four days prior to each examination day subjects are given a standardized diet with a low level of nitrate and nitrite. On the evening before the examination day the subjects take a single dose of lithium carbonate 300 mg in order to measure lithium clearance. On the examination days subjects are receiving a two hour infusion of either placebo (isotonic sodium chloride) or sodium nitrite. During the two examination days each subject receives both treatments in random order. Perspectives: Increasing knowledge about the nitrite-NO system can contribute to changing the clinical practise of diagnostics and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.</detailed_description>
