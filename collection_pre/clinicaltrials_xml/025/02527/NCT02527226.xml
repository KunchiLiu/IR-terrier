	<brief_summary>This is a protocol to govern the prospective trial of facial nerve monitoring in patients undergoing parotidectomy with an eye towards interpreting if the facial nerve monitor provides useful information to operating surgeons and if the information provided by the facial nerve monitor can predict degrees of postoperative facial nerve paresis. Additionally, the study will determine if performing daily facial rehabilitation exercises provides a benefit in reducing time to recovery of temporary post-parotidectomy paresis.</brief_summary>
