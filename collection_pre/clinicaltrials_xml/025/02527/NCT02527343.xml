	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of FPL plus diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertriglyceridemia. Diagnosis of FLP is based on deficiency of subcutaneous body fat in a partial fashion assessed by physical examination and low skinfold thickness in anterior thigh by caliper measurement: men (≤ 10 mm) and women (≤ 22 mm), and at least 1 of the following: Genetic diagnosis of familial PL (e.g., mutations in LMNA, PPARγ, AKT2, CIDEC, PLIN1 genes) OR Family history of FPL or family history of abnormal and similar fat distribution plus 1 Minor Criteria OR 2 Minor Criteria (In the absence of FPLassociated genetic variant or family history) and BMI&lt; 35 kg/m2 Minor Criteria 1. Requirement for high doses of insulin, e.g., requiring ≥ 200 U/day, ≥ 2 U/kg/day, or currently taking U500 insulin 2. Presence of acanthosis nigricans on physical examination 3. Evidence/history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or PCOSlike symptoms (hirsutism, oligomenorrhea, and/or polycystic ovaries) 4. History of pancreatitis associated with hypertriglyceridemia 5. Evidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Hepatomegaly and/or elevated transaminases in the absence of a known cause of liver disease or radiographic evidence of hepatic steatosis (e.g., on ultrasound or CT) Diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus as defined by the American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2015) made at least 12 weeks prior to the Screening visit, and 2 of the following: on standardofcare antidiabetic therapy, and HbA1c ≥ 7% to ≤ 10% at Screening. Hypertriglyceridemia is defined as Fasting TG levels ≥ 500 mg/dL (≥ 5.7 mmol/L) at Screening and Qualification visit. If the fasting TG value at Screening and/or Qualification visit is &lt; 500 mg/dL (&lt; 5.7 mmol/L) but ≥ 350 mg/dL (≥ 4.0 mmol/L) up to 2 additional tests may be performed in order to qualify A diagnosis of generalized lipodystrophy A diagnosis of acquired partial lipodystrophy Acute pancreatitis within 4 weeks of Screening History within 6 months of Screening of acute or unstable cardiac ischemia (myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, new onset angina), stroke, transient ischemic attack, or unstable congestive heart failure requiring a change in medication Major surgery within 3 months of Screening Treatment with Metreleptin within the last 3 months prior to Screening Previous treatment with ISISAPOCIIIRx</criteria>
