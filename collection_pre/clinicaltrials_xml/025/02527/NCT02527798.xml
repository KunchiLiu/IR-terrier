	<brief_title>Safety of Furosemide in Premature Infants at Risk of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants will receive a placebo or furosemide for 28 days. Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis.Premature infants will be randomized to receive placebo or furosemide in a dose escalating approach. Follow up information will be collected up to 7 days after the last dose and at 36 weeks post menstrual age. The final study assessment will occur at the time of discharge, early termination or transfer.</detailed_description>
