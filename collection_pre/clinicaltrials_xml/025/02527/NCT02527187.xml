	<criteria>Positive clinical history or not of inhalation allergy (rhinitis I rhinoconjunctivitis I asthma) from Betula verrucosa Allergic subjects, must submit a pricktest positive (average of the papule &gt; 3 mm diameter) with a summary of the same allergen I presence against the allergen specific Immunoglobulin E. The average diameter of the papule obtained by histamine dihydrochloride to 10 mgml must be &gt;3mm Age: from 5 to 70 years. They must be capable of giving informed consent Subjects outside of the age range. Subjects who have previously received immunotherapy in the last 5 years for the treatment of asthma or the allergic rhinoconjunctivitis induced by allergens that may interfere with the allergen from Betula extract verrucosa Subjects with important symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis I bronchial asthma in which the suspension of the antihistamine treatment for systemic is contraindicated. Subjects that have previously submitted a serious secondary reaction during skin prick test diagnostic tests. Subjects treated with ssblockers. Unstable subjects of clinical point of view (asthma acute, febrile, etc). Subjects with lesions of active hives, severe active dermographism, severe atopic dermatitis, sunburn, eczema, lesions of psoriasis in the area of realization of the prick test (risk of false positives). Subjects with viral infection activates the herpes simplex or herpes varicellazoster in the area of realization of the prick test. Subjects that have some pathology in which the administration of adrenaline (hyperthyroidism, hypertension, heart disease, etc.) is contraindicated.
