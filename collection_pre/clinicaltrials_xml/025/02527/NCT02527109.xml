	<brief_title>The Effect of Intra-anal Nifedipine, Used As Add-on to Conservative Therapy, on Pain in Patients With Anal Fissure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blinded study. All patients in the study will be treated with the conservative standard of care for anal fissure. Study medication will be used as an add-on to conservative therapy, and will consist of 3 groups: 1. Treatment Group 1- 12 mg of Nifedipine to be self-administered twice daily. 2. Treatment Group 2- 12 mg of Nifedipine to be self-administered once daily in the morning hours and placebo to be self-administered in the evening. 3. Placebo Group - Placebo to be self-administered twice daily. Approximately 330 subjects will participate in this study. A screening visit will be used to determine subject suitability for inclusion in the trial. Within one week of the screening visit, subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will receive either Nifedipine 12 mg X2 a day (BID) (24 mg/day total) or Nifedipine 12 mg X1/day to be administered in the morning hours and a matching placebo X1/day to be administered in the evening hours (12 mg/day total) or a matching placebo X2 a day (BID) (0 mg/day total) for a period of 8 weeks. During this period, 4 study visits (at 0, 2, 5, and 8 weeks) will take place. Study medication and placebo will be administered BID (in the morning and in the evening). In addition to receiving study medication, subjects will be maintained on a conservative standard treatment for Anal Fissure: sitz baths, high fiber diet, stool softeners and plenty of fluids. Upon completion of the treatment cycle, patients will be contacted by phone (at weeks 10, 13 and 16) and will be questioned about recurrent symptoms e.g. pain or bleeding. Patients that: 1. Were enrolled to one of the investigational groups ,and completed the 8 weeks treatment period or discontinued treatment because the investigator deemed them as healed AND 2. Experience symptoms of recurrence AND ARE 3. Willing to participate in an open label extension will receive Nifedipine 12 mg X2 a day (BID) for a period of 8 weeks. During this period, 4 study visits (at 0, 2, 5, and 8 weeks from the start of retreatment) will take place.</detailed_description>
