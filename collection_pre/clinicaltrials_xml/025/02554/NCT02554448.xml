	<brief_title>Detection of CTCs in Stage III Rectal Cancer Patients Undergoing Neoadjuvant Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have the potential to provide a surrogate for'real-time biopsy' of tumor biological activity. Enumeration of CTCs in rectal cancer patients could play an important role in diagnosis, predicting the risk for tumor recurrence and effectiveness of neoadjuvant therapy. The investigators choose several timepoints to detect the dynamic change of CTCs,1 day before the 1st ,3rd and 5th(if the patient needs before surgery) neoadjuvant therapy course,1 day before and 7days ,3 month,6 month after surgery. Approximately 7.5-mL ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid(EDTA)-blood was drawn by vein puncture from patients with rectal cancer . Briefly, the number of CTCs will be count by the cellsearch system , recorded and analysed by the investigator.</detailed_description>
