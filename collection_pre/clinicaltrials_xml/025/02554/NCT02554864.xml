	<brief_summary>The adductor canal block (ACB) is the standard of care for analgesia after Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) repair. ACB is performed by injecting local anesthetic (freezing) in the subsartorial canal in the thigh which is about 7-10cm long. Preliminary evidence suggests that different injection sites within the canal may produce different degrees of analgesia and quadriceps motor block. This trial seeks to determine the effects of various ACB injection sites on postoperative analgesia and motor power following ACL repair.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Location of Injection of Local Anesthetics in the Adductor Canal Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adductor canal block (ACB) is replacing femoral nerve block (FNB) as the peripheral nerve block of choice for knee surgery. The ACB aims to inject local anesthetics (LA) within the neurovascular sheath in the subsartorial adductor canal around the femoral nerve. The point where the sartorius muscle crosses over the femoral artery is generally the accepted site for performing ACB. Clinically, injecting LA in the adductor canal blocks the sensory innervation of the knee and thus offers pain relief that is similar to FNB while conserving motor power around the knee. While these benefits are desirable, the exact location for performing ACB that ensures these benefits, remains debatable. The subsartorial adductor canal itself is 7-10cm long and the anatomical location of the sensory and motor nerves that innervate the knee and its surrounding muscles in this canal may vary. This randomized controlled trial is designed to identify and refine the ACB technique by clinically determining the effects of various ACB injection locations on postoperative analgesia and quadriceps motor power following ACL repair.</detailed_description>
