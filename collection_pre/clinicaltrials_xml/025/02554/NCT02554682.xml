	<brief_title>The P4 Intervention Study to Improve Adolescent Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary care provides a means by which to connect evidence-based interventions with patients; however, many interventions have been evaluated using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in non-healthcare settings. The primary objective is to conduct a pilot study to determine the effect of evidence-based interventions delivered in primary care clinic settings on parent-teen communication about alcohol use, sexual health, and safe driving. Eligible participants are healthy adolescent patients from the CHOP primary care network with a well-child visit scheduled between the ages of 14 to 17 years with one parent willing to participate. Adolescents that hold an intermediate driver's license, that are pregnant, or that have pervasive development disorder or a developmental delay are excluded from this study. Parents will be given written psychoeducational intervention materials on communicating with their adolescents about alcohol use, sexual health, or safe driving (e.g.,booklets, tip sheet brochures, activity workbooks, web links), receive coaching about using the intervention materials, and provider endorsement of the materials during the well-child visit, as well as follow-up phone health coaching 2 weeks after the appointment. The primary endpoints are evaluating the difference between the intervention and control groups on parent-teen communication on the targeted health topics.</detailed_description>
