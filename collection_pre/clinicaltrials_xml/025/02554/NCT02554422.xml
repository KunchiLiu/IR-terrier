	<brief_title>Objective Measurement of Ossicular Chain Mobility Using a Palpating Instrument Intraoperatively</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to develop and test a palpating instrument, which enables the experienced and occasional otologic surgeon to record force in three dimensions during his standard palpation of each ossicle at surgery and al-lows correlation of his subjective impression with objective measurement results. The first task was to incorporate force sensing capability into a standard 45Â° angulated 2.5 mm hook, which is commonly used to palpate, disconnect and luxate ossicles during middle ear surgery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Adult subjects Normally scheduled for middleear or internalear surgery as a result of an ear disease and for whom a routine assessment of the mobility of the ossicle chain is in order. The targeted subject population consists of patients undergoing stapedotomy for otosclerosis and subjects with a normal ossicular chain who are subject to the placement of a cochlear implant to treat hearing loss. Exclusion criteria: Children Subjects in whom the ossicle chain is missing or incomplete Missing informed consent form Incapacitated subjects or subjects with impaired judgment capability.</criteria>
