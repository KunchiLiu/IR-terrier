	<brief_summary>The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different doses of QMF149 (QMF149 150/160 µg and QMF149 150/320 µg via Concept1) over two respective MF doses (MF 400 µg and MF 800 µg via Twisthaler® (total daily dose)) in poorly controlled asthmatic patients as determined by pulmonary function testing, and effects on asthma control</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with a diagnosis of asthma, for a period of at least 1 year prior to Visit 1 (Screening) Patients who have used medium or high dose ICS or low dose of LABA/ICS combinations for asthma for at least 1 year and at stable doses for at least 1 month prior to Visit 1 Patients must have ACQ7 score ≥ 1.5 at Visit 101 and at Visit 102 (prior to doubleblind treatment) and qualify for treatment with medium or high dose LABA/ICS Prebronchodilator ≥ 50% FEV1 of &lt; 80 % of the predicted normal value for the patient after withholding bronchodilators at both Visit 101 and 102, according to ATS/ERS criteria. Withholding period of bronchodilators prior to spirometry: SABA for ≥ 6 hours and FDC or free combinations of ICS/LABA for ≥ 48 hours, SAMA for ≥ 8 hours, LAMA for ≥ 7 days, xanthines &gt;=07 days A onetime repeat/retesting of percent predicted FEV1 (prebronchodilator FEV1) is allowed. Spacer devices are not permitted during reversibility testing. Patients who demonstrate an increase in FEV1 of 12% and 200 mL within 30 minutes after administration of 400 µg salbutamol/360 µg albuterol (or equivalent dose) at Visit 101 All patients must perform a reversibility test at Visit 101 If reversibility is not demonstrated at Visit 101: Reversibility should be repeated once Patients may be permitted to enter the study with historical evidence of reversibility that was performed according to ATS/ERS guidelines within 1 year prior to Visit Alternatively, patients may be permitted to enter the study with a historical positive bronchoprovocation test that was performed within 2 years prior to Visit 1. Patients who have smoked or inhaled tobacco products within the 6 month period prior to Visit 1, or who have a smoking history of greater than 10 pack years. This includes or use of nicotine inhalers such as ecigarettes at the time of Visit 1 Patients who have had an asthma attack/exacerbation requiring systemic steroids or hospitalization or emergency room visit within 6 weeks of Visit 1 (Screening) Patients who have ever required intubation for a severe asthma attack/exacerbation. Patients who have a clinical condition which is likely to be worsened by ICS administration (e.g. glaucoma, cataract and fragility fractures) who are according to investigator's medical judgment at risk participating in the study). Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening as determined by the investigator within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screening) or between Visit 1 and Visit 102. Patients may be rescreened 4 weeks after recovery from their respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening. Patients with a history of chronic lung diseases other than asthma, including (but not limited to) COPD, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, clinically significant bronchiectasis and active tuberculosis. Patients with severe narcolepsy and/or insomnia. Patients who have a clinically significant ECG abnormality at Visit 101 (Start of Run In/Baseline epoch) and at any time between Visit 101 and Visit 102 (including unscheduled ECG) Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to lactose, any of the study drugs or to similar drugs within the class including untoward reactions to sympathomimetic amines or inhaled medication or any component thereof Patients who have not achieved an acceptable spirometry results at Visit 101 in accordance with American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) criteria for acceptability and repeatability (rescreening allowed only once). Repeat spirometry may be allowed once in an adhoc visit if the spirometry did not qualify due to ATS/ERS criteria. If the patient fails the repeat assessment, the patient may be rescreened once Patients on Maintenance Immunotherapy (desensitization) for allergies or less than 3 months prior to Visit 101 or patients on Maintenance Immunotherapy for more than 3 months prior to Visit 101 but expected to change throughout the course of the study. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing of study treatment and for 30 days after stopping of study treatment.</criteria>
