	<brief_title>Fasting-mimicking Diet and Immunosenescence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of the fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) in an elderly population (50-75 years of age) receiving their annual influenza vaccination. The study will include two arms: Control (normal diet) and FMD (2 cycles of 5-day fasting-mimicking diet within two months). Participants both arms will receive the standard influenza vaccine.The primary endpoint is anti-influenza antibody titers measured 4 weeks after flu vaccination. Secondary endpoints include: (1) body composition changes, measured as BMI, waist to hip ratio; (2) physiological changes, measured as blood chemistry and motor performance; (3) health outcomes, measured by SF-36 Health survey, dry eye surveys and flu incidents within 12 months of vaccination.</detailed_description>
