	<brief_summary>The purpose of the proposed research is to examine the effects of two treatment approaches on speech production involving speakers with chronic apraxia of speech (AOS) and aphasia. The planned investigation is designed to examine the acquisition, maintenance and generalization effects of each treatment. One approach, electropalatography (EPG) uses visual biofeedback in conjunction with articulatory-kinematic treatment and the other approach, sound production treatment (SPT) is one of the most systematically studied articulatory-kinematic treatments for AOS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>EPG has been used to treat apraxia of speech (AOS) as well as other speech production disorders (i.e., articulation disorders &amp; cleft palate). SPT is one of the most systematically studied treatment approaches for AOS. Both treatment approaches are considered clinical treatment approaches/standards of care for AOS. The pseudopalate used in conjunction with EPG treatment is an acceptable device for treating speech production disorders including AOS. The pseudopalate is custom-fit for each patient and is similar to a dental retainer and is considered minimally invasive. The purpose of this research is to systematically examine the effects of treatment on speech production using EPG treatment vs. an SPT approach. The planned investigation is intended to explicate the acquisition, maintenance, and generalization effects of each treatment approach. The specific experimental questions to be addressed are as follows: 1. Will treatment using an EPG approach or an SPT approach result in greater accuracy of articulation of trained speech sounds produced in words? 2. Will treatment using an EPG approach or an SPT approach result in greater accuracy of articulation of untrained exemplars of trained speech sounds produced in words (i.e., response generalization)? 3. Will treatment using an EPG approach or an SPT approach result in greater long term maintenance effects for trained speech sounds? 4. Do different treatment approaches result in distinct ratings of functional communication skills via the Aphasia Communication Outcome Measure (ACOM; Doyle et al., 2012) and an outcome measure of speech intelligibility using the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (AIDS; Yorkston &amp; Beukelman, 1981)?</detailed_description>
