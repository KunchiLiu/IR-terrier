	<brief_summary>The main goal to treat early NLUTS is to relieve lower urinary tract syndrome and prevent from late complications. The present study is to evaluate the efficacy of electrical pudendal nerve stimulation (EPNS) and transanal/transvaginal electrical stimulation (TES) in NLUTD.The study design consists of a non-randomized, parallel controlled trial. A total of 60 eligible patients will be involved and divided into EPNS or TES group according to their location of medical treatment. The primary endpoint is lower urinary tract syndromes (ICIQ-FLUTS/MLUTS). The second endpoint is assessment of daily life Qol (ICIQ-LUTSqol), and residual urine volume.</brief_summary>
