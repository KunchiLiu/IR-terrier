	<brief_title>Quality of Analgesia After Interscalene Block After Arthroscopic Shoulder Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The interscalene brachial plexus block (ISBPB) is a common analgesic technique for procedures of the shoulder and upper arm. Moreover, the incidence of rebound pain is well documented and is often of considerable discomfort to patients, who may quickly go from little or no pain to moderate-severe pain. Continuous nerve block techniques with home ambulatory catheters are currently utilized to manage postoperative pain.This study is designed to compare the level and duration of pain control of ExparelÂ® injected after bupivacaine via stop-cock connected syringes and bupivacaine alone for ISBPB.</detailed_description>
