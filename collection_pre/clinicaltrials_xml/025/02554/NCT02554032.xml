	<brief_title>The Aortic Surgery Cerebral Protection Evaluation (ACE) Randomized CardioLink-3 Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery on the thoracic aorta often requires a brief period of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). The most feared complication of aortic surgery is neurological injury, which can range from mild cognitive impairment to more severe injuries such as stroke. Due to the significant morbidity and mortality associated with post-operative stroke and neurological dysfunction, cerebral protection techniques have evolved extensively. A recommended approach to cerebral protection during DHCA is to deliver blood to the brain in an antegrade fashion via the arterial system, so called antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP). Axillary artery cannulation, a form of ACP, has become the preferred method of neuroprotection for aortic operations requiring DHCA. However, axillary artery cannulation requires more surgical time and presents potential complications such as brachial plexus injury, seromas, and limb ischemia. The present study aims to determine whether a less common alternative strategy, innominate artery cannulation, offers similar neuroprotection compared to axillary artery cannulation and reduces operative times. A total of 110 patients undergoing elective aortic surgery from two centres will be randomly assigned to one of the two strategies. The primary outcome will be the number of patients with new ischemic lesions found on post-operative diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and total operative time.</detailed_description>
