	<brief_summary>This is an exploratory study designed to investigate the effects of aerobic dual belt treadmill walking versus traditional treadmill exercise on gait performance and functional capacity in older adults at risk for mobility disability. Identifying the relationship between aerobic treadmill exercise (dual belt or traditional) and the recovery of walking abilities will serve to optimize current rehabilitation approaches.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will be forty-eight older adults with pre-clinical mobility disability who will be randomized into one of three intervention groups: dual-belt treadmill exercise, traditional treadmill exercise, or non-contact control. Prior to and following 16 weeks of therapy, we will observe the participants' performing several functional movements (walking, standing from sitting, sitting from standing, walking up and down stairs) and measure their muscular activity. These performance-based measures will be obtained to determine whether their movement function improves as a result of therapeutic intervention. The participants' absolute performance on any of these tasks does not matter as much as that they make the very best effort on each of the tests. They are welcome to take a break at any point in the testing or training.</detailed_description>
