	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new instrument that takes digital images of tear film (a thin film that coats the eye that is made up of oil and water). The investigators are interested in measuring how the thickness of the tear film varies through time. The goal is to develop a technique that may enable non-invasive evaluation of Dry Eye Disease for future clinical diagnosis.</brief_summary>
