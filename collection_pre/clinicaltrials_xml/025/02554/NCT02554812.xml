	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1b/2 dose-optimization study to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of avelumab (MSB0010718C) in combination with other cancer immunotherapies in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The primary purpose is to assess the safety and early signs of efficacy of various avelumab combinations with other cancer immunotherapies, optimizing dosing regimens as appropriate, in a limited series of indications.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced/metastatic solid tumor. Combination A: Phase 1b, patients with NSCLC that have progressed on standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available, and Phase 2, patients with NSCLC, melanoma, SCCHN, TNBC in any line of therapy, SCLC, 1st line NSCLC. Combination B: Phase 1b, patients with advanced solid tumors that have progressed on standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available, and Phase 2, patients with NSCLC, melanoma, or SCCHN in any line of therapy, or locally advanced/metastatic CRC progressed after 1 line of standard therapy. NSCLC patients in Phase 2 with tumor ALK or EGFR mutations must have received or been refractory/intolerant to standard therapy. Combination C: Ovarian cancer, SCCHN, NSCLC, or gastric cancer, that has progressed after at least 1 line of standard therapy or is ineligible for/intolerant to SOC. Combination D: NSCLC, melanoma, or SCCHN that has progressed after at least 1 line of standard therapy or is ineligible for/intolerant to SOC. ECOG performance status 0 or 1 Estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months Adequate bone marrow, renal, and liver function Resolved acute effects of prior therapy Negative serum pregnancy test at screening Male and female patients able to have children must agree to use 2 highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study and for at least 60 days after last dose Signed and dated informed consent Monoclonal antibody based anticancer therapy within 28 days prior to study entry or smallmolecule based anticancer therapy (targeted therapy or chemotherapy) within 14 days prior to study entry.
