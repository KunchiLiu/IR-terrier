	<criteria>Females aged 21 to 35 years with regular ovulatory menstrual cycles of 21 to 45 days, with a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 who desire pregnancy. Subjects must be high responders, defined as subjects who have a serum antiMüllerian hormone (AMH) ≥5 ng/mL at screening. Documented history of infertility (e.g., unable to conceive for at least 12 months or for at least 6 months if receiving donor sperm) with a Day 2 or Day 3 serum FSH level between 1 and 12 IU/L (inclusive), the results of which should be obtained within 6 months prior to randomization. Known stage IIIIV endometriosis (American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 2012). History of recurrent miscarriage not followed by a live birth (recurrent is defined as two (2) or more consecutive miscarriages). Previous in vitro fertilization (IVF) or assisted reproductive technology (ART) failure due to a poor response to gonadotropins. Poor response is defined as development of ≤2 mature follicles or history of 2 previous failed cycle cancellations prior to oocytes retrieval due to poor response.</criteria>
