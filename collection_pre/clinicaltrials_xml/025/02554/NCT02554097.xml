	<brief_summary>Patients with gallstone and confirmed common bile duct stones are registered in this study. The three managements for common bile duct stones are endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST), laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) and laparoscopic transcystic common bile duct exploration (LTCBDE). Patients will be assessed at baseline, preoperative investigations, operative method, operative time, conversion to open procedure, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and the presence of retained and recurrent stones. All patients were followed up for 3 years by telephone interview ang outpatient visits. Abdominal US and liver function tests were carried out whenever any abdominal symptom appeared during the follow-up period. If there were unusual findings, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography(MRCP) was carried out.</brief_summary>
