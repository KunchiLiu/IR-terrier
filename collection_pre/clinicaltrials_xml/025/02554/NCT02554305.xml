	<brief_summary>This study compares between the clinical, hematological, inflammatory and neurological outcome of patients undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) surgery in which different oxygenation systems will be used.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Fusion Versus The Affinity Oxygenation Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to assess the efficacy and safety of fusion Oxygenation System in patients undergoing isolated CABG, a prospective one-to-one randomized trial comparing the fusion oxygenation to the currently used affinity oxygenation system will be conducted. Forty patients intending to undergo CABG will be divided into 2 groups according to the oxygenation system which will be used during surgery. Distribution into groups will be done randomly. Ten patients undergoing elective peripheral vascular surgical procedures under general anesthesia and 10 patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention will serve as control groups for the neurological outcomes. Clinical status, inflammatory and hematological response as well as Neurological outcome will be assessed.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult patients (1875 years old) undergoing firsttime, isolated CABG at the Hebrew University, Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel and the University Hospital of Angers, Angers, France. Patients undergoing elective peripheral vascular surgical procedures under general anesthesia Patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention will serve as control groups Emergency operations Left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30% CABG with concomitant procedure Previous stroke or documented neurological disorder High grade (&gt;70%) unilateral or bilateral carotid stenosis Contraindication to MRI testing.</criteria>
