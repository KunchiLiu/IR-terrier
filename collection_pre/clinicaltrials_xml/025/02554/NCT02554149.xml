	<brief_title>Radiological Measurement of Femoral Stem Version Using Lateral Decubitus Method: A Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Version of the femoral stem is an important factor influencing the risk of dislocation after total hip replacement (THR) as well as the position of the acetabular component. However, there is no radiological method of measuring stem anteversion described in the literature. Investigators propose a radiological method to measure stem version and have assessed its reliability and validity. In 40 patients who underwent THR, a hip radiograph and CT scan were taken to measure stem anteversion.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Investigators recruited 40 consecutive patients who underwent THR between October 2015 and December 2015 patients who could not extend the hip because of a residual flexion contracture. who had a flexion contracture of the knee or who could not flex the hip to 90Â° even after THR were excluded because participants could not adopt the posture required for the particular radiographs and CT scans.</criteria>
