	<brief_summary>Septic shock is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome with acute circulatory failure secondary to a documented infection. It is the most feared complication in ICU patients, with a 50% mortality rate. The study of stem cells and their experimental use in sepsis treatment is particularly relevant in the international scientific research, where Italy plays an important role. In the vast and complex field of stem cell research, the primary aim of the current proposal is to evaluate the time course level of circulating endothelial progenitor stem cells CD34 + / CD133 + (EPCs), and some factors EPCs-related, such as hypoxia- inducible factor (HIF- 1) and stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in septic patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. The secondary objectives of the project are: determine cut-off values of EPCs , HIF -1 and SDF-1 related to sepsis score from literature and their time course variation in patients receiving conventional treatment according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines,with or without extracorporeal hemoperfusion therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims of the prospective observational study in the postoperative period of two groups (G) of patients who underwent emergency major abdominal surgery [Ga: postoperative patients in emergency surgical ward (ES) and Gb: postoperative septic patients in intensive care unit (ICU)] are: - evaluate the time course level of circulating endothelial progenitor stem cells CD34 + / CD133 + (EPCs) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) and stromal derived factor - 1 (SDF-1), involved as well in the induction of EPC mobilization, at the following times: ES admission (T0), at 24h postoperative (T1), 72 h (T2) and 7 (T3) and 10 (T4) postoperative days. - determine cut-off values of EPCs CD34 + / CD133 +, HIF-1 and SDF-1 for predicting severe sepsis using flow cytometry and ELISA immunoassay test. - observe the outcome and time course variation of EPCs, HIF-1 and SDF-1 between the group of patients treated with extracorporeal hemoperfusion therapy (Gb1) and the group treated with conventional therapy alone according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines (Gb2), by cluster analysis. The research study can provide useful parameters for early diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in sepsis which is the leading cause of death from infection, with an incidence of approximately 10% in ICU postoperative patients according to recent epidemiologic studies.</detailed_description>
