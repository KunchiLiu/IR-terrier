	<brief_summary>St. Michael's Hospital (SMH) provides service to individuals with some of the most severe brain injuries and intensive care needs in Canada. These patients often require prolonged intensive care admissions, lengthy hospital stays, involvement of many health professionals, and long-term support for ongoing care requirements. Many hospitals face resource limitations, specifically involving the health disciplines and their ability to provide frequent intervention. It has been proposed that multisensory stimulation (i.e. exposing the patient to various sights, sounds, smells, etc.) in the early stages of brain injury recovery may result in improved responsiveness/cognitive function. Previous research has indicated a potential benefit for early multisensory stimulation intervention for patients with severe brain injury. However there is still not enough conclusive evidence to confirm whether the intervention is truly effective. The investigators are proposing a pilot randomized controlled study (placebo-controlled, double-blinded) to determine the feasibility and examine the effectiveness of early multisensory stimulation with patients following severe brain injury who remain in a coma, vegetative state, or minimally conscious state. Eligible patients will be randomized to a control group (standard care + family/caregiver education) or an intervention group (standard care + family/caregiver education + early sensory intervention). Data regarding number of patients enrolled, amount of intervention completed, percentage of outcome data collected, patient's level of responsiveness and cognitive function will be collected before and after the intervention period, using several outcome measures. The investigators hope to determine the feasibility of conducting this type of study within this clinical setting and the effectiveness of multisensory stimulation with this patient population.</brief_summary>
