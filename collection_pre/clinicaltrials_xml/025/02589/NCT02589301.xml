	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (relative bioavailability) and pharmacodynamics, after single subcutaneous application, in healthy volunteers of both sexes, between pegfilgrastim formulation, produced by Eurofarma Laboratorios S/A and Neulastim® (reference formulation), marketed by Produtos Roche Químicos e Farmacêuticos S/A. In addition to that, a pharmacodynamics comparison will be performed, through change in absolute neutrophil count in leukogram performed in the same time of pharmacokinetics analysis collection and through CD34+ cell count in peripheral blood at timepoints 0:00, 96:00 and 384:00 hours.</brief_summary>
