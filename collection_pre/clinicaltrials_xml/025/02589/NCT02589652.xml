	<brief_title>Switch or Sequential Combination Therapy of Peginterferon in Hepatitis B Patients With Longterm Entecavir Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection remains a global health treat. The ideal end point of therapy is HBsAg loss or HBsAg seroconversion, indicating a complete remission of CHB. In patients with HBeAg-positive CHB, sustained HBeAg seroconversion is also a desirable end point. Current therapies include pegylated interferon (PegIFN) finite and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) longterm therapy. However, only 30-40% of patients may achieve HBeAg seroconversion on PegIFN monotherapy, whereas 15-20% of patients on entecavir (ETV). Recently, accumulating evidence had shown that optimization of switching or combining PegIFN in patients on long-term ETV therapy may increase rate of HBeAg seroconversion and even lead to the complete eradication of HBV. However, these two regimens has not been tested adequately in patients with low HBsAg/HBeAg titers on long-term ETV therapy. This is a multicenter, prospective cohort study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential combination or switch therapy of pegylated interferon alfa-2a in chronic hepatitis B patients with low HBsAg and HBeAg titers after long-term entecavir therapy, and compared to those who continued on ETV therapy.</detailed_description>
