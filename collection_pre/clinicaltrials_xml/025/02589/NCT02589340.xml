	<brief_title>Buspirone, in Combination With Amantadine, for the Treatment of Levodopa-induced Dyskinesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plan: We will perform a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-period cross-over study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a novel treatment combination for LID in PD. Methods: Eligible subjects who consent to participate in this study will be randomized to one of two sequences of treatment interventions during the baseline visit. Each treatment sequence includes placebo and buspirone interventions. After randomization, each participant will titrate up on study drug for two weeks ending in 30 mg/day. At the end of each two week study drug period, the participant will then have a study visit at the VA Portland Health Care System that includes safety monitoring, adverse event monitoring, drug compliance, and several measurements of LID.</detailed_description>
