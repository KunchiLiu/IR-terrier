	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 (VX-970) when given together with whole brain radiation therapy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread from the original (primary) tumor to the brain. ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 together with radiation therapy may be a better treatment for non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VX-970 and Whole Brain Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases From Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To conduct a phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of twice weekly intravenous (i.v.) VX-970 administered concurrent with conventionally fractionated whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), with VX-970 starting 18-30 hours after the first dose of radiation (but prior to the second fraction of radiation). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the incidence of &gt;= grade 3 delayed neurological toxicity at 2, 4 and 6-months post-completion of whole-brain radiotherapy (for patients without intracranial progression). II. To estimate the radiological response rates (RR) including bi-directional and volumetric measurements of lesion size. III. To estimate the intracranial 2-, 4-, and 6-month progression-free survival (PFS). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Changes in dynamic susceptibility contrast enhancement (DSC-magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) perfusion and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). (Group I) II. To measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VX-970 levels, tumor VX-970 levels, and pATR T1989, pCHK1 S345 and RAD51 multiplex foci. (Group II) III. Changes in DSC-MRI perfusion and mean ADC measurements in DWI. (Group II) OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. GROUP I: Patients undergo whole-brain radiation therapy once daily (QD), 5 days a week for 15 fractions. Patients also receive ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes twice a week, 18-30 hours after first radiation therapy. Treatment continues for 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. GROUP II: Patients receive ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 IV over 60-90 minutes 2-4 hours prior to surgery. After surgery, patients undergo whole-brain radiation therapy and receive ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 as in Group I. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for 6 months, then every 6 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) within 5years of study registration who are being evaluated for palliative whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) (with or without neurosurgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS]) for radiologically or histologically diagnosed brain metastases are eligible for this phase I study Life expectance of greater than two months (Graded Prognostic Assessment Score for NSCLC of 1.5 or higher) to allow completion of study treatment and assessment of doselimiting toxicity Patients should have tumor tissue available for molecular marker testing Group 1: patients should have archived tumor tissue available; the archived tumor tissue is not shipped nor are any correlative tests are performed for Group 1 patients in the present study; however, if the present study produces significant results, future protocols to perform correlative studies will be written and samples will be requested at that time Group 2: patients should have archived tumor tissue available or have a fresh sample obtained at baseline and fresh tumor tissue available from the planned craniotomy Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%) Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL If no known liver metastases: total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); if known liver metastases, then: total bilirubin &lt; 2.5 x ULN If no known liver metastases: aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) &lt; 2 x ULN; if known liver metastases, then: AST/SGOT &lt; 5 x ULN Creatinine within normal institutional limits for age OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above ULN Negative serum pregnancy test result Note: Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of VX970 administration Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients with 13 brain metastases, each &lt; 3 cm by contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with stable systemic disease and ECOG score of 02, who would otherwise be eligible for SRS alone should not be enrolled into this study unless SRS is not feasible due to any medical or logistic limitations as determined by the treating physician; however, patients who develop recurrence postSRS or surgery alone and are recommended WBRT will be eligible for the protocol Presence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, &gt; 1 cm midline shift, uncial herniation, significant hemorrhage/hydrocephalous or history of seizure Patients who have had systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy or other targeted agents or any other investigational agents within 4 halflives (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to starting study treatment or patients who have not recovered from serious adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier Patients must not have received prior WBRT (previous SRS done at least 4 weeks ago is acceptable) Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with VX970 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to VX970 Concomitant administration with strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) should be avoided; because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequentlyupdated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of; ongoing phenytoin should be either discontinued if clinically safe or transitioned to nonenzymeinducing antiepileptics like Keppra (levetiracetam) with a 8day washout period (halflife 1822 hours, time to steadystate 48 days) prior to first dose of VX970 (7days prior to WBRT) Patients needing more than 8 mg dexamethasone per day at the time of start of WBRT will not be eligible to participate in the study; however, patients will be allowed entry into the study if it is medically safe to reduce the daily dose of dexamethasone to 8 mg or less from the day of the start of WBRT; the dexamethasone dose for such patients may be increased beyond 8 mg per day during the course of treatment if medically necessary; this increased need for dose should be communicated to the study's principal investigator, Dr Mohindra at the University of Maryland Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would increase the risk of toxicity or limit compliance with study requirements; this includes but is not limited to, uncontrolled serious infection requiring i.v. antibiotics at the time of registration, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic/uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible Patients with known diagnoses that are associated with germline DDR defects such as Li Fraumeni syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia are excluded from the study</criteria>
