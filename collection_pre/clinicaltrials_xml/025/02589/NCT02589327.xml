	<brief_title>Effects of Exercise on Cardiac Fat in Women With Obesity: a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excessive cardiac fat accumulation have been recognized to be associate to increased cardiac and metabolic risk. More effective treatments are needed to induce changes in cardiac fat content, body composition, and cardiac fat metabolic activity that result in a reduction in cardiovascular risk in overweight and obese population. Despite this need, little is known about which mode, frequency, and duration of exercise will allow for greater reductions in cardiac fat, improvements in body composition, restoration of a healthy cardiac fat metabolic activity, and improvement on cardiovascular risk markers. The aim of this study the effects of exercise in cardiac fat content, cardiac function, physical fitness, and metabolic activity in obesity.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>BMI 3039.99 White/Caucasian Known health problems such as cardiovascular, pulmonary or metabolic disease will be excluded. Pregnant females. Any adults found taking medications that affect endocrine or cardiovascular function will also be excluded from the study. Participants that exercise more than three times per week or strength train more than twice per week. Individuals that have poor venous access or have expressed a fear of needles or having blood taken will also be excluded. Cigarette smoking (current or those who quit within the previous 6 months Hypertension Diabetics MRI exclusion criteria must be observed: must complete a safety checklist that is designed to identify metal in your body that could pose a hazard during scanning. Some forms of metal are acceptable (e.g., dental fillings after 1970). Tattoos are generally not exclusionary, unless they have been inked with metallic dyes. All metal must be removed from your body. All female subjects, prior to scanning, are required to complete a pregnancy test. Must NOT be claustrophobic or have a history of claustrophobia</criteria>
