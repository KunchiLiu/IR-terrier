	<brief_summary>This study evaluates two group-based Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle interventions delivered in the workplace to individuals at risk for pre-diabetes: 1) an in-person group-based lifestyle intervention; and 2) an internet-based intervention delivered using an online platform with lifestyle coaching support. Eligible participants will be randomized equally to each intervention program (120 participants in each).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Getting in Balance: A Workplace Diabetes Prevention Intervention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study seeks to compare weight loss, changes in physical activity and dietary fat intake, and participant engagement in two Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) interventions derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) curriculum: an in-person and an internet-based intervention program. We hypothesize that the internet-based intervention will be more effective in achieving weight loss than the in-person intervention, given its convenience for participants to complete sessions and therefore greater potential engagement in the program.</detailed_description>
