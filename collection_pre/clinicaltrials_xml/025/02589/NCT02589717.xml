	<criteria>Able to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgment Histologically or cytologically documented locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra) Disease progression during or following treatment with at least one platinumcontaining regimen (e.g., gemcitabine and cisplatin [GC], methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin [MVAC], carboplatin and gemcitabine [CarboGem], etc.) for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma or disease recurrence Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2 Life expectancy &gt;/= 12 weeks Adequate hematologic and endorgan function, defined by laboratory results obtained within 14 days prior to the first study treatment For women who are not postmenopausal (&gt;/= 12 months of nontherapyinduced amenorrhea) or surgically sterile (absence of ovaries and/or uterus): agreement to remain abstinent or use single or combined nonhormonal contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of &lt;1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug Treatment with any other investigational agent or participation in another clinical trial with therapeutic intent within 28 days prior to enrollment Treatment with chemotherapy 14 days prior to enrollment; however, participants may be rescreened after the 14day washout period Treatment with radiotherapy 7 days prior to enrollment; however, participants may be rescreened after the 14day washout period Known primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or symptomatic CNS metastases Pregnant or lactating, or intending to become pregnant during the study Significant cardiovascular disease, such as New York Heart Association cardiac disease (Class II or greater), myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to randomization, unstable arrhythmias, or unstable angina Severe infections within 4 weeks prior to enrollment, including, but not limited to, hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia Received therapeutic oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics within 14 days prior to enrollment; however, participants may be rescreened after the 14day washout period Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to enrollment or anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study other than for diagnosis History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins Known hypersensitivity or allergy to biopharmaceuticals produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells or any component of the atezolizumab formulation Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of disease or a condition that contraindicates the use of the investigational drug or renders the participant at high risk for treatment complications Participants with active hepatitis B Active tuberculosis Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to enrollment or anticipation that such a live, attenuated vaccine will be required during the study Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferons or IL2) within 4 weeks or five halflives of the drug, whichever is shorter, prior to enrollment Treatment with systemic corticosteroids or other systemic immunosuppressive medications (including, but not limited to, prednisone, dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and antitumor necrosis factor [antiTNF] agents) within 2 weeks prior to enrollment or anticipated requirement for systemic immunosuppressive medications during the trial</criteria>
