	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to study the safety of autologous mesenchymal stromal cell transfer using a biomatrix (the Gore Fistula Plug) in a Phase I study using a single dose of 20 million cells. 15 adult patients, ages 18 years and older with cryptoglandular fistulas will be enrolled. Subjects will undergo standard adjuvant therapy including drainage of infection and placement of a draining seton. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore Fistula Plug; fistula plug as per current clinical practice. The subjects will be subsequently followed for fistula response and closure for 24 months. This is an autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same patient.</brief_summary>

Competent and able to provide written informed consent Exclusion Criteria 1. Inability to give informed consent. 2. Clinically significant medical conditions within the six months before administration of MSCs: e.g. myocardial infarction, active angina, congestive heart failure or other conditions that would, in the opinion of the investigators, compromise the safety of the patient. 3. Specific exclusions; Evidence of hepatitis B, C, or HIV 4. History of cancer including melanoma (with the exception of localized skin cancers) 5. Investigational drug within thirty (30) days of baseline 6. A resident outside the United States 7. Pregnant or breast feeding. 8. History of clinically significant autoimmunity (e.g. Crohn's disease) or any previous example of fatdirected autoimmunity 9. Previous allergic reaction to a perianal fistula plug. 10.
