	<brief_summary>Although salivary contents play a major role in the early stage of food digestion process, their role in taste perception of glucose polymers is essentially unknown. It is hypothesized that the differences in salivary contents, more specifically salivary amylase concentration and activity, influence taste perception of glucose polymers and ultimately eating behavior, which is related to risks in various diseases. The current project is designed to investigate 2 aims. Aim 1 will investigate the variation in salivary contents across individuals and its role in taste perception of glucose polymers. Aim 2 will focus on the role of salivary contents in food liking and disliking.</brief_summary>
