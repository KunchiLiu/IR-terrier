	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to explore premeal protein-enriched bar effect in postprandial glucose levels and concentration of plasma incretin hormones [glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and/or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)] in healthy subjects and those with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Premeal Consumption of Protein-enriched Bar on Blood Glucose Level and Secretion of Hormones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifteen healthy subjects and fifteen subjects with type 2 diabetes treated by diet and/or metformin, SU, DPP4 inhibitors will be recruited. Every subject will studied on 2 separate days in random order with 1-2 week intervals. These participants will consume protein enriched bar followed by a standardized high-glycemic-index breakfast in a hospital setting or breakfast followed protein enriched bar in a cross-over fashion. Blood sampling will be done at the moment of start of breakfast (0 min) and then 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 min. Plasma glucose levels, total/active GLP-1, GIP, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon will be measured. Incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of glucose level and hormone from 0 min to 180 min will be calculated.</detailed_description>
