	<brief_title>Gait and Functional Outcomes Study Following Total Knee Arthroplasty With Medial-pivot or Posterior-stabilized Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MicroPort Orthopedics (MPO) is conducting this study to build upon the results of a previous study which showed the Medial Pivot (MP) system required lower quadriceps activation than subjects implanted with a Posterior stabilized (PS) system preforming the same activities of daily living. The propose of the current study is to determine the impact of Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) design on muscle activation following TKA surgery.</detailed_description>
