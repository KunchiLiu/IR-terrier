	<brief_title>The neoClose Abdominal Closure vs Carter-Thomason Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both the neoClose abdominal closure to the standard Carter-Thomason closurewill be used to close 12 mm camera and stapler port sites upon completion of a robotic assisted laparoscopic gastric bypass. The procedure requires a 12 mm port be placed in the midline approximately 3 cm cephalad to the umbilicus and a second in the right mid abdomen. Port sites will be closed as defined as the inability to palpate a fascial defect and the incision being air tight upon carbon dioxide insufflation.</detailed_description>
