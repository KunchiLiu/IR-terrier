	<brief_summary>The trial is designed to investigate differences in outcome of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma and junctional adenocarcinoma treated with perioperative (neoadjuvant + adjuvant) chemotherapy (FLOT) plus surgical resection versus neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CROSS) plus surgical resection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perioperative Chemotherapy Compared To Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation in Patients With Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to the given evidence a survival benefit of perioperative chemotherapy (periCTX) over Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (neoCRT) for patients with Esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC) has not been proven in any randomized controlled trials (RCT). Data supporting the value of periCTX have all been obtained in studies including mixed patient cohorts with EAC and gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC). Due to relevant differences of histologic subtype distribution, response to periCTX and survival rates between EAC and GAC there is a clear need to obtain evidence concerning the value of periCTX for EAC. As nowadays periCTX is extensively and successfully applied in clinical practice in patients with EAC there is an obvious need to obtain evidence from a multicentre RCT. Moreover a confirmation of the superior survival rates of the recent RCT on neoCRT should be obtained in a RCT conducted exclusively on EAC. Therefore, this prospective RCT with the primary objective of longterm patient survival comparing periCTX and neoCRT was designed.</detailed_description>
