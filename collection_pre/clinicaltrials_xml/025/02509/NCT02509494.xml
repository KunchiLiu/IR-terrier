	<brief_title>Staged Phase 3 Study to Assess the Safety and Immunogenicity of Ebola Candidate Vaccines Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo During Implementation of Stages 1 and 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is staged Phase 3 study to gather information on the safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous prime-boost regimen. In this regimen, Ad26.ZEBOV will be administered as a prime vaccination and later boosted with the candidate vaccine MVA-BN-Filo. The study will take place in Sierra Leone and will consist of a screening phase, an active phase (vaccination) and a follow-up phase. The active phase of the study will be conducted initially in two stages. In the first stage approximately 40 adults aged 18 years or older will be vaccinated to gain information about the safety and immunogenicity of the prime-boost regimen. In stage 2 a larger group of approximately 688 individuals will be vaccinated to further evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the prime-boost regimen across different age groups. In this stage, children aged 1 year or older, adolescents and adults will be included. Solicited local and systemic adverse events will be collected until 7 days after the prime and boost vaccination. Unsolicited adverse events will be collected from signing of the informed consent form (ICF) onwards until 56 days after the boost vaccination in Stage 1 and until 28 days after the prime vaccination in Stage 2, and then again until 28 days after the boost vaccination. Serious adverse events will be collected from signing of the ICF onwards until 12 and 36 months after the prime vaccination in Stage 2 and Stage 1, respectively. These data will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) to assess whether initiation of vaccination in the next stage or age group can be provided. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, which will be monitored throughout the study. Participants in Stage 2 will be followed up for safety and immunogenicity until 12 months after the prime vaccination. Participants in Stage 1 will be followed up for safety and immunogenicity until 36 months after the prime vaccination.</detailed_description>
