	<brief_title>Validation of the Implantation of a New Electrode for the Treatment of Dystonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a validated therapy for treating dystonia and other movement disorders. The main therapeutical target used for treating dystonic syndromes is the internal globus pallidum (GPi). Given the morphology and the topography of this nucleus and, based on the experience of an efficient therapy by using only one or two contacts out of the available four contacts of the standard DBS lead, we designed two new electrodes, one one contact-electrode and one two contact-electrodes, with the aim to limit side effects related to internal globus pallidum DBS and to provide a more homogeneous electric field around the electrode within the GPi and maintaining the same therapeutical outcome. The main objective of the trial is to study the technical feasibility of the implantation of a new one contact-electrode (Monopolar DBS Lead Model 09064-40cm) for treating isolated generalized/segmental dystonia or tardive dystonia. The second main objective of the study is to assess the safety of the implantation of the new device. The secondary objective is to explore the therapeutical effect of DBS using the new monocontact electrode and to study the electrical field generated around the monocontact electrode within the GPi. The study is prospective and patients are recruited from a Tertiary Movement Disorders Clinic. Seven subjects will be recruited for the study.</detailed_description>
