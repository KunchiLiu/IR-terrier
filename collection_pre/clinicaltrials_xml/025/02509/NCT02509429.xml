	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of an Artificial Pancreas system which includes a Control-To-Range algorithm, versus standard Insulin Pump Therapy with Threshold Low glucose Suspend feature. 24 Children aged from 7 to 12 will be recruted in 4 clinical centres. After a 2 week run-in period, they will attend two investigational sessions of 65 hours in home-like settings. During each session, the CTR algorithm or the TLGS feature will be activated, depending on the randomization. The main endpoint is the time spent below 70mg/dL between 22:00 and 07:00.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of an Artificial Pancreas Versus Threshold Low Glucose Suspend in Type 1 Diabetic Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is an open randomized control trial preceded by a run-in period and follows a cross-over design.After inclusion, the therapy will be moved to sensor augmented pump therapy with a dedicated training to continuous glucose monitoring using study system (study CGM). During 2 to 3 weeks, the patient will use his/her usual insulin pump and the study CGM (run-in period). At the end of this period, the patient and the relative will be admitted in a parents'house or hotel/resort nearby the hospital for 65 hours to undergo the first interventional session. Admission will be at 17:00 Day 1. The investigator will connect wirelessly the study pump and CGM to the study platform DiAs and remote monitoring will be activated. Until 08:00 Day 2, insulin delivery will be managed in open-loop mode, i.e. insulin doses will be decided according to capillary glucose measurements. From 08:00 Day 2, one algorithm will be activated according to the randomization order, i.e. either the threshold low glucose suspend (TLGS) algorithm (threshold will be set at 70 mg/dl) or the closed-loop algorithm. Insulin delivery will then be managed in open-loop mode with activated TLGS or by the closed-loop algorithm until 08:00 Day 4. In both cases, meals will be of free content and taken around 09:00, 13:00, 17:00 and 20:00. Meal insulin doses will be managed according to pre-meal glucose level and CHO meal content in open-loop mode with TLGS, or according to DiAs bolus calculator suggestion in closed-loop mode. Patient and relative will be encouraged to move in parents'house or hotel/resort and surroundings between meals. The algorithm will be inactivated at 08:00 Day 4. The study pump will be removed and replaced by patient's usual pump. The patient and the relative will be released at 10:00 after breakfast. Study CGM will still be used at home for 2 to 4 weeks until the second interventional session. This session will be similar to the first one but the alternative algorithm will be activated. Patient will come back to pre-study insulin therapy from 08:00 Day 4 and be released at 10:00 when second session is completed.</detailed_description>
