	<brief_title>Hyperfibrinogenemia After Major Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, investigators daily investigate fibrinogen plasma levels and fibrinogen antigen in severe trauma patients (Injury severity score &gt; 15) within the first ten days. Investigators then modelize hyperfibrinogenemia profiles according to severity of injuries and physiopathologic mechanisms. Finally, investigators determine predisposing risk factors to develop hyperfibrinogenemia and assess the impact of fibrinogen replacement therapy in initial phase of management of major trauma.</detailed_description>
