	<brief_title>Improvement of STI Detection in Adolescent Emergency Department Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators have developed a novel means of collecting sexual health information from adolescents in the emergency department (ED) through the use of an audio-computer assisted self-interview (ACASI). This information can then be used to provide clinical decision support to clinicians for targeted sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening in the ED for adolescents. This randomized trial randomizes patients to whether or not the clinician receives the decision support and tests whether provision of decision support results in increased STI screening for patients who report high risk sexual activity. Secondary outcomes include evaluation of whether the clinical decision support results in increased STI detection, and identifying factors associated with adapting the clinical decision support.</detailed_description>
