	<brief_summary>The sinuplasty balloon offers a more physiological first of the sinuses which minimizes risks associated to traditional surgery. Its atraumatic characteristic also helps to reduce the risk of bleeding (so any use of Pack), limit scarring ransom, reduce the post-operative pain, ensure faster return to daily life activities (reduction of the average length of hospitalization). Patient's quality of life would be improved (SNOT-22 questionnaire) and reduction of post-operative pain score seams decrease on EVA. The economic impact of the sinuplasty balloon appears very favourable and fits into the strategy of development of the ambulatory practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Chronic Frontal Sinusitis by a Simple Technique Using Dilation Balloons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to estimate the cost-utility ratio of the sinuplasty balloon after frontal sinus surgery, compared to surgery by rigid instrumentation, in a randomized single-blind controlled study. The secondary objectives is to compare: - the two types of surgery - the quality of life - the feeling of pain in patients but also the occurrence of surgical times or complications between the two proposed techniques.</detailed_description>
