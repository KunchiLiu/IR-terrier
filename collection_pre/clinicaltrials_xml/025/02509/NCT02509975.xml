	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, pilot, open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized safety and effectiveness study of OCL 503 in men with BPH.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of OCL 503 in Prostate Artery Embolization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior to entering the study, all patients will undergo pre-study assessments including compliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria, laboratory assessments, IPSS, uroflowmetry, IIEF, and MRI pelvic imaging. Following conventional catheter angiography with cone-beam CT to confirm catheter placement and prostatic vasculature, each patient will undergo transarterial embolization with OCL 503. OCL 503 will be administered intra-arterially via microcatheter until there is stasis of blood flow. Patient assessments include blood work, IPSS, uroflowmetry, IIEF, MRI and patient interviews conducted at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post embolization.</detailed_description>
