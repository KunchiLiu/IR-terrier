	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to examine the safety and feasibility of delivering allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (allo-MSCs) by transendocardial injection to cancer survivors with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction secondary to anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy (AIC). The secondary purpose of this study is to obtain preliminary evidence for therapeutic efficacy of allo-MSCs delivered by transendocardial injection to cancer survivors with LV dysfunction secondary to AIC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stem Cell Injection in Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, trial will evaluate the safety and feasibility of allo-MSCs administered by transendocardial injection in thirty-six subjects with anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy (AIC). The first six subjects will receive allo-MSC therapy (open label) and will be assessed for safety and feasibility of the study procedures. Following 1 month data review of each of the six subjects by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Gene and Cell Therapy Data Safety Monitoring Board; this will be followed by a randomized, double-blind clinical trial enrolling thirty subjects. These thirty subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive allo-MSCs or placebo. All subjects will undergo cardiac catheterization and study product administration using the NOGA Myostar catheter injection system. Subjects will be followed at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months post study product injection. All endpoints will be assessed at the 6 and 12 month visits which will occur 180 ±30 days and 365 ±30 days, respectively, after the day of study product injection (Day 0). For the purpose of the safety evaluations and endpoint analysis, the Investigators will utilize an "intention-to-treat" study population. In addition, because this phase I study is the first cell therapy study in this population, at 12 months all available standard-of-care medical records for cancer surveillance will be reviewed for cancer recurrence.</detailed_description>
