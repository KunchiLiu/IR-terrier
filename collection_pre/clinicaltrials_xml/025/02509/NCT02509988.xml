	<brief_title>Nutritional Intervention Preconception and During Pregnancy to Maintain Healthy Glucose Metabolism and Offspring Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is known that maternal insulin resistance and high blood glucose levels in early pregnancy alter the functioning of the placenta in ways that persistently affect the supply of nutrients and fat in the unborn baby. There is an increasing focus on the need to optimise preconception nutrition but as yet, limited preconception interventions that are recognized as promoting health for the mother and her child. The Investigators will recruit 1800 women, aged 18-38 years, who are planning a pregnancy in the United Kingdom, Singapore and New Zealand. The participants will be randomly allocated to receive the standard nutritional drink or the study nutritional drink. Women who conceive between one and twelve months after starting the nutritional drink will be followed through pregnancy and studied with their babies for the first year after delivery. Various testing will be carried out at relevant time points. Mothers will undergo blood, urine, hair and cheek swab sampling, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans along with body measurements and health and lifestyle questionnaires. Infants will undergo hair, cheek swab, urine and stool sampling along with body measurements, measurements of body composition and a DXA scan. The data collected will allow identification of the contributions of nutritional and lifestyle factors, social and economic status, ethnicity, genetics and metabolomics and gut microbes to maintaining healthy glucose metabolism in pregnancy and promoting healthy growth, body composition and wellbeing in the children.</detailed_description>

After having gained written informed consent, fathers will have blood, urine, hair sampling, cheek swabs and body measurements taken and will complete a health and a lifestyle questionnaire at one of the visits during pregnancy. The mother will consent for their babies to have body measurements, buccal, hair, stool samples and allergy testing from birth to 12 months.</criteria>
