	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) impacts negatively on the quality of life of patients. Several studies have shown that acute exacerbations (AEs) decrease health-related quality of life, pulmonary function and survival of COPD patients. The objective of the present study is to examine the effects of a physical therapy program on perceived health status in COPD patients hospitalized due to an acute exacerbation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Physiotherapy on Perceived Health Status in Hospitalized COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is a progressive disease, characterized by lung function impairment with airway obstruction. Patients with COPD suffer exacerbations; the frequency of these exacerbations increases with the severity of the disease. It has been previously shown that the level of health related quality of life of COPD subjects deteriorates considerably with increasing severity of disease and that the deterioration is linearly related to a decrease in FEV1 % predicted normal values. Since COPD is a chronic condition, a major goal of care is to improve health related quality of life. However, there is little information on the effect of a physiotherapy program during exacerbation on perceived health status.</detailed_description>
