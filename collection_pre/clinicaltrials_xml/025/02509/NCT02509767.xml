	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial will study subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA sc) self-administration at two Planned Parenthood affiliates serving diverse patient populations. Prior studies demonstrate that DMPA self-injection is safe, effective, feasible, and acceptable for women and adolescents. A total of 400 female patients (ages 15-44) requesting DMPA will be randomized to self-administration of DMPA sc or clinic administration (usual care). Subjects will be followed for one year. The primary study outcome is DMPA continuation at one year by self-report in both study arms. Secondary outcomes include patient-reported satisfaction with treatment; satisfaction with home use; and costs associated with contraceptive care. The investigators hypothesize higher continuation rates among self-injection users compared to patients who receive standard care. Secondary exploratory hypotheses include higher patient satisfaction and lower costs associated with contraceptive care among self-injection users.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open-label, randomized parallel group clinical trial will study subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA sc) self-administration at two Planned Parenthood affiliates serving diverse patient populations. Prior studies demonstrate that DMPA self-injection is safe, effective, feasible, and acceptable for women and adolescents. A total of 400 female patients (ages 15-44) requesting DMPA will be randomized to self-administration of DMPA sc or clinic administration (usual care) in a 1:1 allocation. Subjects will be followed for one year. All subjects will receive reminders when their next injection is due. Follow-up surveys will be conducted at 6 and 12 months. Adherence will be monitored by subject self-report and study outcomes will be ascertained by self-report and medical record review. The primary study outcome is DMPA continuation at one year by self-report in both study arms. Secondary outcomes include patient-reported satisfaction with treatment; satisfaction with home use; and costs associated with contraceptive care. The investigators hypothesize higher continuation rates among self-injection users compared to patients who receive standard care (delta = .13; 80% power; one-sided α=0.05; allowing for 15% loss-to-follow-up). Secondary exploratory hypotheses include higher patient satisfaction and lower costs associated with contraceptive care among self-injection users.</detailed_description>
