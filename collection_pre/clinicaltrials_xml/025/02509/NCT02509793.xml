	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to see if tetrabenazine, which is commonly used to treat Huntington's Disease (HD), reduces the problems of impulsivity that are common in patients with HD. Investigators will also see how the medicine affects aspects of thinking and mood.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Assessing Impulsivity in Patients With Huntington's Disease on Xenazine (Tetrabenazine)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label assessment of behavioral symptoms including depression, impulsivity, and suicidal ideations in patients prior to, and after, taking a stable dose of TBZ. Once a subject has provided written informed consent, he/she will be scheduled for a study visit. All subjects will be evaluated with tests of depression (Geriatric Depression Scale), impulsivity (Minnesota Impulsivity Scale, QUIP, BIS-11, and computerized impulsivity scales), and suicidal ideation (Columbia Suicide Scale) as a safety measure before they actually start taking TBZ. Patients will be asked to return to the clinic for an identical evaluation plus adverse events, after they have been on a stable dose of TBZ for 4 weeks, which would be 7 Â± 1 week after initiating TBZ. Patients will be titrated over 2- 4 weeks to best dose as determined by the investigator, up to a maximum of 75 mg/day. In our clinical practice, &gt;90% of HD patients take 75mg or less per day. This also allows for a more consistent and shorter titration period to improve patient retention. As patients are titrating, there will be several telephone contacts conducted. The initial dose will be 12.5 mg BID. Best dose will be largely determined by adverse events. Determination of best dose will include one scheduled phone call and others as needed. Other medications will remain stable between visits.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For HD patients onlyDefinite HD (positive gene testing or typical symptoms in the context of family history of HD). A moderate degree of impulsivity as measured by the Barrat Impulsivity Scale (BIS). (&gt;65) Must be symptomatic in the opinion of the investigator. We will employ the standard clinical criteria for symptomatic HD, any motor signs c/w HD, usually chorea). Patient is cognitively alert and able to answer/understand. Patient requires the assistance of another person to walk, or is nonambulatory. Patient is severely impaired cognitively. Patients taking neuroleptic (dopamine blocking) medications within the past 14 days. patient is actively suicidal, has untreated or inadequately treated depression, has impaired hepatic function, is taking MAO inhibitors or is taking reserpine or has been off of reserpine for less than 20 days</criteria>
