	<brief_title>Connected to Care: Use of Mobile Short Message Services to Improve HPV Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Connected to Care is a two-site RCT (Randomised Clinical Trial), in which the effect of an mHealth intervention is compared to standard of care in a group of women who are undergoing VIA (Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid) and are tested for HR (High-Risk) HPV (Human Papilomavirus). Post testing, HPV-positive women receive a home visit by a community health worker where they are informed about the result of their HPV-test and invited to a check-up appointment 12 months later. In the 12-month period that follows, the intervention group receives mHealth (Mobile Health) messages about cervical cancer and how it can be prevented by regular screening; quizzes based on the mHealth messages; and sms-reminders for the check-up appointment. The primary hypothesis is that the intervention increases the attendance rate with 15%. The effect of the intervention is 12-month check-up attendance rates for HR HPV-positive women (both intervention and control group).</detailed_description>
