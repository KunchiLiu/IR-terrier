	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the feasibility of using the commercially available Parkinson's KinetiGraph Data Logger (PKG) to quantitatively assess motor fluctuations in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. A reliable and objective assessment of motor fluctuations would support the general neurologists in the referral of PD patients to the Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgical centers and facilitate the DBS eligibility evaluation of PD patients usually done by the DBS specialists at the DBS surgical centers.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients are diagnosed with PD. Patients are presented to the clinical sites to evaluate DBS candidacy or optimize their PD treatment eventually with DBS therapy. Patients are at least 18 years old. Patients are able to provide written data release consent as required by EC institutions or local law and regulations. Patients have restricted movement, e.g. bed bound. Patients operate heavy machinery for prolonged periods. Patients have serious medical conditions that compromise safety or interfere with mobility in addition to PD (e.g. arthritis and rheumatisms). Patients have been already screened by Stimulus or EarlyStimulus questionnaires Patients present no response to Levodopa medication or have atypical Parkinsonism. Patients have major medical or psychiatric illness other than stable, treated depression or anxiety that may jeopardize the patient's ability to give informed consent, follow study requirements, or that may confound the patient's diagnosis or assessments. Patients have major neurological diagnoses other than PD. Patients are not capable of following the required clinical instructions</criteria>
