	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of GS-4997 in adults with impaired hepatic function relative to matched, healthy controls. Each participant in the control group will be matched to a participant with impaired hepatic function by age (± 10 years), gender, and body mass index (± 20%).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All individuals: Body mass index (BMI) from 18 to 40 kg/m^2, inclusive Creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 60 mL/min (using the CockcroftGault method) based on serum creatinine and body weight Individuals with impaired hepatic function: Aside from hepatic insufficiency, must be sufficiently healthy for study participation based upon screening evaluations. Must have diagnosis of chronic (&gt; 6 months), stable hepatic impairment with no clinically significant change in hepatic status within the 3 months (90 days) prior to study drug administration (Day 1). Individuals with severe hepatic impairment must have a score on the ChildPughTurcotte scale of 1015 at screening. Individuals with moderate hepatic impairment must have a score on the ChildPughTurcotte scale of 79 at screening. Individuals with mild hepatic impairment must have a score on the ChildPughTurcotte scale of 56 at screening. Healthy individuals (matched control): Must be in good health based upon screening evaluations. All individuals: Pregnant or lactating females Have received any investigational compound or device within 30 days prior to study dosing Current alcohol or substance abuse A positive test result for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV1/2) antibody Have poor venous access that limits phlebotomy Have been treated with systemic steroids, antiHIV agents, immunosuppressant therapies, or chemotherapeutic agents within 3 months prior to screening or expected to receive these agents during the study (eg, corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, and other immune or cytokinebased therapies) that would be contraindicated for other exclusion criteria. Significant serious skin disease, such as but not limited to rash, food allergy, eczema, psoriasis, or urticaria Significant drug sensitivity or drug allergy (such as anaphylaxis or hepatoxicity) Unstable cardiac disease, including history of myocardial infarction within 1 year of screening, recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia despite appropriate medical therapy, decompensated congestive heart failure, or dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40%), or a family history of Long QT Syndrome, or unexplained death in an otherwise healthy individual between the ages of 1 and 30 years. Syncope, palpitations, or unexplained dizziness Implanted defibrillator or pacemaker. Severe peptic ulcer disease, severe gastroesophageal reflux disease, or other severe gastric acid hypersecretory conditions. Medical or surgical treatment that permanently alters gastric absorption (eg, gastric or intestinal surgery). A history of cholecystectomy is not exclusionary. History of prior allogeneic bone marrow progenitor cell or solid organ transplantation. Currently registered on an organ transplantation list. History of bleeding from esophageal varices within 90 days prior to Admission (Day 1). Use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, saquinavir, suboxone, telithromycin, atazanavir) and strong CYP3A4 inducers (eg, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenytoin and St. John's wort), within 28 days prior to study drug administration (Day 1). Consumption of grapefruit juice, grapefruits, and Seville orange juice within 2 weeks prior to study drug administration (Day 1). Recent significant changes in the use of nicotine or nicotine containing products Individuals with impaired hepatic function: Aside from hepatic insufficiency, serious or active medical or psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with treatment, assessment, or compliance with the protocol. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, defined as a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), unless the patient has been treated with a nucleos(t)ide analog (eg, tenofovir or entecavir) for at least 6 months and the HBV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay has been persistently undetectable for at least 6 months. Positive test for drugs of abuse, including alcohol at screening or on Day 1/checkin, with the exception of opioids and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, marijuana) under prescription and investigator verification for pain management. Individuals who screen positive for benzodiazepines may be allowed if prescribed under the care of a physician and after review by investigator and Sponsor. Requires paracentesis &gt; 1 time per month. Individuals with hepatic impairment with comorbid diseases not associated with hepatic impairment requiring medication(s) must be taking the medication(s) without a change in dose for &gt; 3 months prior to screening. Changes in concomitant medications or dosage used to treat symptoms of hepatic impairment or associated comorbid conditions that could lead to clinically significant changes in medical conditions during the course of the study that would affect the ability to interpret potential drugdrug interactions within 28 days prior to dosing. Healthy individuals (matched control): A positive test result for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis B core antibody (antiHBc) Positive test for drugs of abuse, including alcohol at screening or on Day 1/checkin. Have any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness (including depression) which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with treatment, assessment, or compliance with the protocol. History of liver disease. Have taken any prescription medications or overthecounter medications including herbal products within 28 days of commencing study drug dosing with the exception of vitamins, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and hormonal contraceptive medications.</criteria>
