	<brief_summary>Objectives: This study aims to assess the effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of intensive acupuncture treatments combined with standard antiemetic medication as compared with P6 acupoint stimulation combined with standard antiemetic medication or with standard antiemetic medication alone, to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Background: PONV is one of the prevalent discomforts in the early phase of recovery after surgery. Evidence suggests that the stimulation of the P6 acupuncture point can reduce the occurrence of PONV. What remains unclear is whether a higher dose of acupuncture produces more benefits compared with P6 stimulation alone or whether acupuncture combined with standard antiemetic medication yields better outcomes. This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of different acupuncture regimen for the prevention of PONV: high-dose acupuncture treatments combined with standard antiemetic medication, P6 acupuncture-point stimulation combined with standard antiemetic medication, or medication alone.</brief_summary>
