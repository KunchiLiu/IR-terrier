	<brief_summary>Bronchiectasis is characterized pathologically by the abnormal and permanent dilation of bronchi caused mainly by the perpetuation of inflammation and impaired clearance of secretions. Physical therapy is essential in the treatment of these patients, using its various techniques and devices. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impedance of the respiratory system, by impulse oscillometry, after breathing exercises with chest compression or flutter in patients with bronchiectasis, considering that there are no results in the literature on the effect of these techniques in the small airways of these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Effects of a Flutter Device and Chest Wall Compression on Respiratory System Impedance in Bronchiectasis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis patients and healthy subjects will be evaluated before and after a 30 minutes session of control, breathing exercises with flutter valve, that is a device that produces oscillation and positive pressure during the expiratory phase, or chest compression, that is a manual manoeuvre in the right and left sides of the lower chest, all of them in a sitting position. The main outcome will be obtained by impulse oscillometry, that is a method to access large and small airways, to evaluate the resistance (R), reactance (X), reactance area (AX) and resonant frequency (Fres) of respiratory system for the whole breath and for inspiratory and expiratory phase. Additionally, will be analysed the dyspnea using the Medical Research Council scale; acceptability and tolerability scale; pulse oxymetry; difficulty of expectoration score; and volume, adhesivity and purulence of sputum.</detailed_description>
