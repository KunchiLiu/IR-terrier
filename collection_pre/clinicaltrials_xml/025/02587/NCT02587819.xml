	<brief_title>Investigation of the Safety and Tolerability of BSCT (Anti-nf-P2X7) 10% Ointment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the trial was to determine the safety and tolerability of BSCT (anti-nf-P2X7) 10% Ointment topically applied twice daily for 28 consecutive days in male and female patients with BCC; and to determine the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (total sheep Immunoglobulin G [IgG]) when BSCT (anti-nf-P2X7) 10% Ointment is applied twice daily to BCC lesions. This was an open-label, single-arm, multicenter Phase 1 study that enrolled 21 BCC patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female adults â‰¥ 18 years of age; One primary histologically confirmed BCC lesion, not located on the hand or foot, suitable for surgical excision, with a minimum area of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm (histological diagnosis made no more than 4 weeks prior to the Screening visit. Willing to refrain from using nonapproved lotions or creams on the BCC treatment site and surrounding area during the treatment period and from washing the treated area for at least 8 hours following each application of study medication; Ability to follow study instructions and likely to complete all study requirements; Written informed consent obtained, including consent for biopsy tissue to be examined and stored by the central dermatopathologist; Written consent to allow photographs of the BCC lesion to be used as part of the study data; For females of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test at Screening and use of an acceptable form of birth control. Pregnant, lactating, or planning pregnancy during the study; Presence of known or suspected systemic cancer; Histological evidence of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or any tumor other than BCC in the biopsy specimen; Histological evidence of severe squamous metaplasia, infiltrative, desmoplastic, or micronodular growth patterns in the biopsy specimen; Evidence of dermatological disease or confounding skin condition within the 25cm2 treatment area, eg, SCC, actinic keratosis, rosacea, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, eczema, or xeroderma pigmentosa; Concurrent disease or treatment that suppresses the immune system; Chronic medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would interfere with the performance of the study or would place the patient at undue risk; Known sensitivity to any of the ingredients in the study medication; Treatment with systemic chemotherapeutic agents (eg, methotrexate, paclitaxel) within the 6 months prior to the Baseline visit; Use of systemic retinoids within the 6 months prior to the Baseline visit; Treatment with systemic immunomodulators or immunosuppressants within the 6 months prior to the Baseline visit; Use of topical immunomodulators within 2 cm of the target treatment area within the 4 weeks prior to the Baseline visit; Treatment with topical agents for the treatment of BCC or actinic keratosis within 2 cm of the target treatment area within the 4 weeks prior to the Baseline visit: Treatment with liquid nitrogen, surgical excision or curettage within 2 cm of the target treatment area during the 4 weeks prior to the Baseline visit; Clinically significant abnormalities as noted in the screening ECG, physical examination, or laboratory test results; Evidence of current chronic alcohol or drug abuse which, in the investigator's opinion, might interfere with the subject's adherence to protocol requirements; Current enrollment in an investigational drug or device study or participation in such a study within 4 weeks of the Baseline visit; In the investigator's opinion, evidence of unwillingness, or inability to follow the restrictions of the protocol and complete the study.</criteria>
