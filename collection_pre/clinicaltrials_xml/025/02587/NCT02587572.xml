	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Trial Using Allogeneic Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells: The SIRONA Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Longeveron Mesenchymal Stem Cells (LMSCs) in subjects with metabolic syndrome and to assess the effects of LMSCs on endothelial function using several different doses. Following a successful run-in phase, a total of forty (40) subjects will be randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive one of three different doses of LMSCs or placebo. After randomization, baseline imaging, testing and study product infusion, subjects will be followed up at 24 hours, month 1, month 3, month 6, month 9 and month 12 post study product infusion. All endpoints will be assessed at the 3, 6 and 12 month visits which will occur 90±30 days, 180±30 days, and 365±30 days respectively from the day of the study product infusion (Day 1). For the purposes of the endpoint analysis and safety evaluations, an "intent-to-treat" study population will be utilized.</detailed_description>
