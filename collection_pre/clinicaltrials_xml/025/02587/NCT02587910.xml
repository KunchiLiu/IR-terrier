	<detailed_description>Volunteers were recruited in Lebanese American University campuses. Those who fit the inclusion criteria were allowed to choose between two arms: invasive or non-invasive procedures. Volunteers who chose to enroll in the non-invasive arm were given the study product directly after completing the GERD Q questionnaire. A follow-up by phone was done on day 0, 3 , 6 and 11. GERD Q questionnaire was repeated on days 11 and 28 along with a satisfaction rating. Adverse events were reported on a log sheet. Concerning the invasive arm, volunteers were given an appointment at Lebanese American University Medical Center Rizk Hospital to place the 24h pH-metry, after study product was administered. After 7-10 days, the 24h pH monitoring was done again.</detailed_description>
