	<brief_summary>A high-fat, high-carbohydrate meal (HFHC) induces an increase in inflammation in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in healthy subjects. A few studies have shown that orange juice, when consumed together with the high-fat meal, is able to revert the increase in inflammatory markers. The present study will assess the effect of a single HFHC meal taken with water, orange juice or an isocaloric glucose drink on protein expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy individuals. Twelve healthy, normal weight individuals consumed a HFHC meal with water, water with glucose or orange juice in a cross-over design with at least one week interval between the meals. Blood samples were collected before, 1, 3 and 5h after the meals.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: A high-fat, high-carbohydrate meal (HFHC) induces an increase in inflammation in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in healthy subjects. A few studies have shown that orange juice, when consumed together with the high-fat meal, is able to revert the increase in inflammatory markers. OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of a single HFHC meal taken with water, orange juice (500ml) or an isocaloric glucose drink on protein expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy individuals. DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: Twelve healthy, normal weight individuals consumed a HFHC meal with water, water with glucose or orange juice in a cross-over design with at least one week interval between the meals. Blood samples were collected before, 1, 3 and 5h after the meals. Blood glucose, insulin and lipid profile were measured. Also, proteome analysis using TMT labeling was performed on peripheral-blood mononuclear cells collected before and at times 3 and 5h after the meal.</detailed_description>
