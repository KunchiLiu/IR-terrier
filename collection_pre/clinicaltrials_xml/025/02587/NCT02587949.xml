	<brief_summary>In patients admitted to hospital with acute cerebrovascular stroke, we want to study the relationship between hair cortisol levels and biomarkers of inflammation and the clinical and radiological severity of the stroke and the degree of neurological disability being tested in three months and one year after.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Correlation Between Hair Cortisol Level of Acute Stroke or Its Long Term Disability.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will include patients hospitalized due to an acute cerebrovascular stroke. A number of 30 patients aged 40-70 will be included. Within 48 hours of the event, blood inflammatory biomarkers, and scalp hair sample for cortisol will be taken. All recruited patients will undergo full neurological examination and the severity of the stroke will be rated using NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale). 3 months and one year later neurological examination and rating of neurological disability will be determined using Rankin Scale.</detailed_description>
