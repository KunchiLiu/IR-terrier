	<brief_title>Comparison of Diabetes Retinopathy Among Type 2 Diabetic Patients Treated With Different Regimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an important cause of blindness, and its development of an irreversible process. DR is not only the overall progress and the level of blood sugar, and blood glucose fluctuations more closely, is the key to a smooth hypoglycemic delay DR progression.Diabetes control and complication trail(DCCT) study shows that even though glycemic control was no significant difference in blood glucose fluctuations ,DR also have a significant difference. In this study, three different glucose-lowering program for: (A) a single oral anti-diabetic drugs, (B) basal insulin and oral anti-diabetic drugs, (C) premixed insulin and oral anti-diabetic drugs for comparison. Focus on the stability and the impact of these three programs hypoglycemic long-term prognosis of the DR, and thus affect the molecular mechanisms of DR-based exploration of glucose fluctuations, to optimize blood glucose solutions, lower blood sugar steady, slow progression of DR ultimate clinical purposes. The multi-center study is to cooperate, enrolled 600 cases of type 2 diabetes, observe the effects of different solutions on blood sugar glucose fluctuations and retinopathy, a total of 5 years of follow-up. This will be the first at home and abroad to compare the incidence of hypoglycemic effect programs on DR large multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical studies, clinical practice will optimize the treatment of type 2 diabetes theoretical and evidence-based medicine.</detailed_description>
