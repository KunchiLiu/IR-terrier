	<brief_title>Bioavailability and Absorption Kinetics of Phenolic Compounds and Specific Vitamins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phytonutrients are regarded to play an important role in many health-related issues like: - Improvement of redox balance - Anti-inflammatory effects - Prevention of chronic diseases like CVD, stroke, diabetes II, Alzheimer´s, AMD, and certain forms of cancer - Beneficial effects on human´s microbiome Therefore it is of scientific interest whether this product provides absorbable phytonutrients/phenolics and vitamins to support mechanistic explanations for the beneficial outcomes observed in the past after intake of Juice Plus+®. GOAL To identify absorption kinetics and bioavailability of phenolic compounds and specific vitamins from encapsulated Juice Plus+® powder MERITS - This study would reveal knowledge whether and to which extent specific vitamins and phenolic compounds are absorbed, including absorption kinetics/metabolism. - Data of this study may provide support for mechanistic arguments on the beneficial clinical outcomes observed and published in the past. ENDPOINTS - Absorption kinetics of phenolic compounds in plasma - Bioavailability of vitamins C, E, and carotenoids into plasma Absorption kinetics of phytonutrients: - Open-, one-arm study, absorption kinetics over 10 hours - 5 blood sample collections: baseline (= 0); 1hr, 2hrs, 5hrs and 10 hours after intake of 3 capsules - Wash-out of all food supplements and dietetic foodstuff: 2 weeks - Wash-out of phytonutrients: 48 hours before baseline sampling, accomplished via a phytonutrient-poor diet. Bioavailability of vitamins C, E, A and carotenoids: - Open-, one-arm study over 8 weeks - 2 blood sample collections: at baseline (2 weeks after the phenolics experiment) and after 8-weeks - Wash-out of all food supplements and dietetic foodstuff: 4 weeks, 2 weeks before the phenolics experiment + another 2 weeks Subjects: 20 healthy subjects from Graz region, meeting all inclusion criterions (see underneath).</detailed_description>
