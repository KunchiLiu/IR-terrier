	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of the PIM kinase inhibitor INCB053914 in subjects with advanced malignancies. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 (dose escalation) will evaluate safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of INCB053914 and the recommended phase 2 dose(s) (a tolerated pharmacologically active dose that will be taken forward into Part 2 of the study). Part 2 (dose expansion) will further evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the recommended Phase 2 dose(s).</brief_summary>
