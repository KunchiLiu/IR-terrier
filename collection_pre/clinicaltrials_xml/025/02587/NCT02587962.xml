	<brief_summary>An ascending dose study in patients with solid tumors to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of birinapant when given in combination with pembrolizumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-escalation Study of Birinapant and Pembrolizumab in Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in two phases. The Phase 1 portion of the study will employ a sequential group dose-escalation design to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of birinapant administered in combination with 200 mg pembrolizumab, both administered as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion. The following proposed doses of birinapant are to be evaluated: 5.6, 11, 17, and 22 mg/m2 The Phase 2 portion of the study will assess the safety and tolerability of the RP2D of birinapant when given in combination with pembrolizumab.</detailed_description>
