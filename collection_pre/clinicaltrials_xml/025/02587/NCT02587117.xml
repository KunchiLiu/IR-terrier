	<brief_summary>Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a common sub-acute, chronic inflammatory mucocutaneous disease.This study was evaluated the comparative efficacy of lycopene and prednisolone for the treatment of oral lichen planus. Half of participants (total number of participants was twenty eight) were received lycopene and the other half were received prednisolone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial to Study the Effects of Two Drugs, Lycopene and Prednisolone in Patients With Oral Lichen Planus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prednisolone and lycopene were produced remission of lesions in oral lichen planus patients, but they do so by different mechanisms. The main cause of oral lichen planus is still unknown. Some authors advocate the disease appears to be a result of T-cell-mediated autoimmune responses in oral epithelial tissues. But, recent study suggests that increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation together with an imbalance in the antioxidant defense system may play a part in the generation of disease. Lycopene exerts its antioxidant activity by physical and chemical quenching of free radicals and decreases free radicals-initiated oxidative reactions, particularly lipid peroxidation and DNA oxidative damage, thereby preventing tissue damage. Prednisone have both anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects.It suppresses the inflammatory response by limiting the recruitment of inflammatory cells and inhibiting synthesis of pro-inflammatory products such as prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs) and platelet activating factors (PAF) by indirectly inhibiting phospholipase A2 and negative regulating cyclooxygenase (COX-2).</detailed_description>
