	<brief_title>577nm Micropulse Laser vs Half-dose Photodynamic Therapy on Acute Central Serous Chorioretinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central serous chorioretinopathy(CSC) is characterized by serous detachment of neurosensory retina which can cause lose in visual acuity.Some studies have shown that Half-dose photodynamic therapy(PDT) is effective on CSC,although accompanied with side-effects,such as choroidal ischemia, retinal pigmental epithelium(RPE) atrophy,and RPE rip,and with exorbitant price.Recent retrospective studies suggest micropulse laser (MPL) therapy may also be effective without obvious complications in this disease. But to date, there is no study on effectiveness of CSC between PDT and MPL. The study is the first prospective randomized controlled trial about 577nm micropulse laser versus half-dose photodynamic therapy on acute central serous chorioretinopathy.The null hypothesis of the study is that there is difference between MPL and half-dose photodynamic therapy on acute central serous chorioretinopathy at first month after treatment.The primary outcome measures is the proportion of eyes with complete absorption of subretinal fluid at 1 month after treatment.</detailed_description>
