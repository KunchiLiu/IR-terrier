	<detailed_description>Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will be seen for up to12 weeks unless 100% epithelialization of the index wound and two subsequent healing confirmation visits have been achieved prior to week 12. Each subject will receive a weekly application of the EpiFix plus standard of care until 100% epithelialization is achieved. The subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety during the course of the trial.</detailed_description>
