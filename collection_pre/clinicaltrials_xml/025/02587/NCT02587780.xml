	<brief_summary>This observational study is designed to examine the glycaemic responses (of sedentary, active and very active healthy individuals) to a 50gram dose of glucose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Sugar Responses by Physical Activity Level and Intensity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3 groups of participants fulfilling the criteria for: sedentary (&lt; 30mins phys activity p/day) active (&gt;30 mins phys act p/day) and very active (&gt; 60 mins phys act p.day) will be invited to attend a laboratory session on two separate occasions separated by one week and asked to: fast overnight before having a baseline and then six further capillary (finger-prick) blood samples taken over a period of two hours following consumption of 50 grams of glucose. The blood samples will produce a standard glucose 'curve' and this will be used to calculate incremental area under the curve to identify similarities or differences between the three groups responses. Hypothetically it may be that the different levels and intensities of physical activity will affect the results with active individuals producing flatter better-controlled blood sugar responses than the inactive subjects. The Null-hypothesis would be no difference in response. it is possible, for instance, that such a low-dose of glucose in an otherwise healthy group of individuals has no discernible affect on such a curve. Physical activity will be assessed by questionnaire and interview. Anthropometric measures (height, weight and body composition) will be taken using a stadiometer and bio-electrical impedance unit (Bodystat 1500, Body Stat: Isle of man UK) at the time of the laboratory measures. No participants will have data taken of any kind before they have read a participant information sheet and signed informed consent.</detailed_description>
