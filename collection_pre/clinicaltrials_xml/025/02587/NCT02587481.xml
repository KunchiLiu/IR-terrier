	<brief_summary>In this open, monocentric, observational study acute coronary syndrom (ACS) patients will be characterized by pneumological examination concerning a concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Often COPD coexists with ACS; therefore ACS patients benefit either from prevention or potential therapy of chronic hypoxia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study patients with either non ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) will be included. After amnesis patients will undergo blood withdrawal, blood-gas analysis and examinations concerning pulmonary function (Bodyplethysmography). In addition to routine blood withdrawal for differential blood count, 9 ml blood sample is takenfor molecular analysis of relevant prognostic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-blood based biomarkers, an for establishing a library of biomaterial in form of a biobank.</detailed_description>
