	<brief_title>Comparison of Uterine Repair Methods for Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two well-known uterine repair techniques are described; the uterus can be repaired in situ within the peritoneal cavity (intraabdominal) or exteriorized temporarily from the abdomen for the closure of the hysterotomy incision (extraabdominal). 3 meta-analysis on the topic were unable to demonstrate the superiority of one technique regarding maternal morbidities. However, there is a paucity of studies with a standardized anesthetic protocol evaluating these outcomes. This study will evaluate the impact of the uterine repair technique on different maternal morbidities; focusing on intra-operative nausea and vomiting under a standardized anesthetic protocol.</detailed_description>
