	<brief_summary>The investigators plan to compare the impact of two approaches for smoking cessation on smoking abstinence, use of evidenced-based therapy, and quality of life among a diverse population of patients at the Manhattan campus of the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System, which serves a critical safety-net role for urban veterans. During hospitalization, all smokers will receive usual care. Patients will be randomized to one of two arms: financial incentives plus usual care vs. usual care alone, which includes referral to the state Quitline. All patients enrolled in the study will be offered nicotine replacement therapy. The investigators will conduct follow-up assessments at 2 weeks, 2 months, 6 months and 12 months after discharge. The primary study outcome is smoking abstinence at 6-month follow-up, verified by salivary/urinary cotinine.</brief_summary>
