	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of BCD-066 Compared to Aranesp® for Anemia Treatment in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study CKD patients on dialysis previously treated by short-acting epoetins will switch to one of darbepoetin alfa products - BCD-066 (experimental arm) or Aranesp (active comparator) to maintain previously achieved target level of hemoglobin (100-120 g/l). Patients will be treated for 52 weeks. IV iron supplementation will be provided to maintain serum ferritin level above 500 µg/l according to KDIGO Anemia Guidelines (2012).</detailed_description>
