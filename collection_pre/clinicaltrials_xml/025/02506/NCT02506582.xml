	<brief_title>The Effects of Jerusalem Artichoke and Fermented Soybean Powder Mixture Supplementation on Glucose Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this clinical study was to evaluate the effect of jerusalem artichoke and fermented soybean powder mixture supplementation on blood glucose. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 60 subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The subjects were randomly assigned to either a group ingesting 40 g jerusalem artichoke and fermented soybean powder mixture supplementation daily or a placebo group for 12-week. We assessed fasting and postprandial levels of glucose.</detailed_description>

IFG was defined as fasting glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dL and IGT was defined as 2h OGTTs glucose levels 140199 mg/dL. Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes was defined as fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL or 2h OGTTs level ≥ 200 mg/dL. 1. glucose lowering medications or insulin injections; 2. abnormal liver or renal function; 3. chronic stomach and intestines disease; 4. chronic alcoholism; 5. pregnancy or intending to become pregnant during time of study. 6. complications; 7. an occupation that could be dangerous if hypoglycemia should occur.</criteria>
