	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to conduct an oxygen saturation (SpO2) accuracy validation comparing prototype pulse oximeter oxygen saturation measurements directly to arterial blood saturation during non-motion conditions over the range of 60-100% SaO2 as measured by Reference CO-Oximetry. Additionally, the prototype pulse oximeter pulse rate measurements will be compared to 3-lead ECG heart rate measurements made via a multi-parameter monitor.</brief_summary>
