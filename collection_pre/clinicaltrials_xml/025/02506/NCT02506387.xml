	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the registry is to investigate and follow all patients treated with the MitraClip System in Belgium. This information is intended to contribute to decision making with regards to MitraClip therapy selection in patients with mitral regurgitation: (a) by establishing the clinical value of the MitraClip therapy in the continuum of care; and (b) by providing practical information that will allow physicians to make therapeutic decisions, assist hospitals to make purchasing decisions, and assist insurers/government in making coverage decisions. In addition national data will be shared with European registries in order to increase the knowledge about the efficacy of this new technique.</brief_summary>
