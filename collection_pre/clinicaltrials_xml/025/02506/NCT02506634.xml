	<brief_summary>Consecutive patients aged 18-65 years who go to the gastroenterology clinic presented with upper gastrointestinal discomfort would be included. All patients underwent upper endoscopy or an ambulatory 24-h pH(Potential Of Hydrogen) monitoring.Pathologic esophageal acid reflux was defined as the percentage total time for which a pH value &lt; 4 was &gt;4.2 % in the distal esophagus. Then, patients were treated with esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily for 28 days. The symptom scores were measured by the frequency score multiplied by the severity scores of the predominant symptom before and at the end of the treatment, and the " PPI test " was defined as positive if the overall scores of the predominant dyspeptic symptom in the fourth week decreased by &gt;50 % compared with those of the baseline. GERD is defined by either 24-hour impedance-pH monitoring or positive PPI(proton pump inhibitor) test or positive result from endoscopy. The percentage of each symptom of GERD in the symptom questionnaire in Chinese outpatients in Gastroenterology department will be calculated. The symptom of the highest percentage will be the primary symptom.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Primary Symptoms of GERD(Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) in Chinese Outpatients in Gastroenterology Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective：To define the primary symptom of GERD in Chinese outpatients in Gastroenterology department Secondary Objective：1. To investigate the symptom distribution of patients who present with symptoms originated from upper gastrointestinal tract and have pathologic esophageal reflux established by 24-hour impedance-pH monitoring, upper endoscopy, or proton pump inhibitor test. 2. To evaluate the life quality of patients with atypical GERD symptoms (symptoms except heartburning and regurgitation) 3. To investigate the diagnostic value of proton pump inhibitor trial to diagnose GERD with atypical reflux symptoms 4. To investigate the predictive value of Gerd Q to diagnose GERD with atypical reflux symptoms with heartburn or regurgitation</detailed_description>
