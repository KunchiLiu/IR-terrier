	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the changes of quality of life of patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis treated with standard medications plus Dialyzable Leukocyte Extracts (DLE). All patients will receive DLE in combination with current guide lines-suggested standard medication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality of Life in Allergic Rhinoconjunctivitis Patients Treated With Dialyzable Leukocyte Extracts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DLE are heterogenous mixtures of peptides under 10 kilo Daltons (kDa) obtained after disruption of peripheral blood leukocytes from healthy human donors. DLE have been reported to improve clinical response in allergies, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. The therapeutic effect of DLE is related to an immune modulatory effect that changes innate signaling pathways, such as Toll Like Receptors, and Nuclear Factor -kappa B; production of cytokines might also be modified with the use of DLE, including Tumor Necrosis Factor a, Interleukin (IL)-6, and induction of Interferon-g secretion, driving immune response to a T-helper Th1 immune-regulatory response, and thus helping to reduce allergy symptoms.</detailed_description>
