	<criteria>The subject has: 1. been diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus (insulin or noninsulin dependent) and peripheral neuropathy (loss of protective sensation) in affected foot 2. a HbA1c of less than 10% assessed within last 12 weeks 3. a fullthickness diabetic neuropathic foot ulcer that is free from tunnels/sinus tracks, necrotic tissue, exposed bone and/or tendon, and osteomyelitis post debridement (Wagner 1 or 2; Appendix I) 4. one (target) diabetic neuropathic foot ulcer of less than 12 months duration that has an area that measures ≥ 1.5 and ≤ 10 cm2 post debridement (max length x max width) at screening that is on any surface and part of the foot (fore, mid or hindfoot) with an etiology related to loss of protective sensation in that foot. 5. a target ulcer that closed &lt;30% during the 2 week runin period (2 weeks management with SOC following signature of informed consent prior to potential randomization) 6. sufficient arterial supply to affected foot tested within the past 60 days The subject has: 1. ulcers of nondiabetic etiology on the study foot 2. a target ulcer clinically infected or has underlying osteomyelitis at time of study treatment initiation 3. clinical evidence of gangrene on any part of the affected foot 4. a target ulcer with exposed bone or tendon 5. any malignancy or a neoplasm at the target ulcer site 6. active Charcot Foot or Charcot Foot that is unable to be offloaded (stable, nonactive Charcot deformity that is able to be offloaded is acceptable) 7. more than 3 ulcers on the study foot, including the target ulcer, and all other ulcers must be at least 3 cm removed from the target ulcer 8. any significant comorbid disease that may interfere with wound healing 9. received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunosuppressant or corticosteroid (greater than 10 mg prednisoneequivalent per day) within the past 30 days. 10. had the diabetic foot ulcer treated with an experimental drug/biologic/device, or a livecell therapy (experimental or marketed), or active moist wound healing therapy within 30 days of randomization day</criteria>
