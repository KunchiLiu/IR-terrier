	<brief_title>Meropenem Penetration Across BBB in Patients With CNS Infection and Optimization of Meropenem Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Meropenem is important for management of post-neurosurgical meningitis, but the data about its penetration across blood-brain barrier (BBB) are inadequate. This prospective, open-label study investigated the pharmacokinetic profile of meropenem in patients with post-neurosurgical central nervous system (CNS) infection, especially its BBB penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A total of 82 patients with post-neurosurgical CNS infection were included to receive meropenem intravenously according to regimen of 2g q8h, 1g q8h or 1g q6h. After infusion of 4 doses, blood and CSF samples were collected simultaneously at predefined timepoints. High-performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet method was used to determine the concentration of meropenem.</detailed_description>
