	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine if treatment with an anti-inflammatory drug (delayed-release prednisone) improves the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of veterans with Gulf War Illness (GWI). The primary outcome measure is a change from baseline of HRQOL with respect to physical functioning and symptoms. Secondary outcomes measures include changes from baseline levels of GWI-associated biomarkers of inflammation in peripheral blood, GWI-associated symptoms (chronic pain, fatigue, and cognitive impairment), and HRQOL with respect to mental functioning.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gulf War Illness Inflammation Reduction Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During Desert Shield and Desert Storm (Aug 2, 1990 to July 31,1991) 696,841 United States Military personnel were deployed to the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations. Today approximately one-third of those veterans are suffering from GWI, an unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness. Evidence of chronic inflammation in veterans with GWI has emerged from previous observational studies. The goal of this trial is to determine if reducing the GWI-associated chronic inflammation is an effective treatment for GWI. This is a randomized, two group, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. The treatment group will receive a low dose (2x5mg) once a day of delayed-release prednisone (Rayos) for 8 weeks. The placebo group will receive matching placebo (2x5mg) once a day for 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure for this clinical trial is a change from baseline of HRQOL with respect to physical functioning and symptoms. The secondary outcome measures include changes from baseline of peripheral blood levels of GWI-associated biomarkers of inflammation, changes from baseline of GWI-associated symptoms (chronic pain, fatigue, and cognitive impairment), and a change from baseline of HRQOL with respect to mental functioning.</detailed_description>
