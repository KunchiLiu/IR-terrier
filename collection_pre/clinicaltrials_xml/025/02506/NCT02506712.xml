	<brief_summary>The main objective is to quantify energy expenditure when using the SmartDrive system during manual wheelchair propulsion in external conditions (slope, straight line). For this two comparisons are performed: Comparison of energy expenditure with and without the use of a system SmartDrive 6 minute propulsion test. Comparison the risk of musculoskeletal disorders of the wrist during a 6 minute propulsion test.</brief_summary>
