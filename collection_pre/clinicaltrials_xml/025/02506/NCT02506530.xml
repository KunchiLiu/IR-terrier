	<brief_title>Treatment Pathway of Patients Suffering From a Breast Cancer Related Lymphoedema, During an Intensive Decongestive Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of the study is to assess the proportion of successfully treated patients (success rate). That is to say patients having a reduction of excess arm volume â‰¥ 30% after 5 days of three types of treatment for secondary lymphoedema : Group 1: standard intensive decongestive therapy for 5 days (bandages + manual lymphatic drainage). Group 2: standard intensive decongestive therapy (bandages + manual lymphatic drainage) + Cellu M6 for 5 days Group 3: Bandages + Cellu M6 for 5 days Symptomatic treatment of lymphoedema reference is intensive decongestive therapy including manual lymphatic drainage, compression of multicomponent bandaging, therapeutic exercise and skin care (HAS 2012 ISL International Society of Lymphology, 2013).</detailed_description>
