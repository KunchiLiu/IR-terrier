	<detailed_description>Gemcitabine plus nub-paclitaxel (GEMABR) regimen was recently presented at an international oncology meeting and represents a new standard regimen in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. GEMABR is one of the high response rate treatment regimen, the investigators considered as a promising treatment as neoadjuvant chemotherapy . On the other hand , incidences of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia , febrile neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy were significantly higher in the g group compared with gemcitabine group. Therefore, it was decided to consider the balance of safety and efficacy as a preoperative chemotherapy, the investigators use the NAC-GEMABR regimen includes only two cycles (three times weekly and one week rest) of GEMABR regimen. The investigators also evaluate the optimal treatment schedule of NAC-GEMABR therapy as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, optimal duration between surgery and chemotherapy, R0 resection rate, and resection rate for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.</detailed_description>
