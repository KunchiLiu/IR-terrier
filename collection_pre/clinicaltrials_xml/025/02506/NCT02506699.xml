	<brief_summary>For ten years, rTMS, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex, has found its place in the treatment of drug-resistant neuropathic pain. Patients relieved by some sessions may thereafter receive a chronic invasive stimulation via electrodes implanted through a neurosurgical procedure. This is common practice at the University Hospital of Caen and in different CHU with the proper equipment rTMS. It seems permissible to provide in our center only a non-invasive technique for patients challenged with brain surgery, since according to the various meta-analyzes the analgesic efficacy of rTMS seems to be correlated to the repetition of sessions. Assessment centers and the treatment of pain allow a multidimensional assessment, bio-psycho-social of patients in order to optimize their management and experience efficiently analgesics first- and second-line. We propose a study evaluating the analgesic efficacy of rTMS, in relevant stimulation parameters reproduced according to a literature review, during 3 months after 5 active sessions separated by one week apart, in 15 patients with neuropathic pain chronic refractory to treatment of first and second line, followed by multidisciplinary center specializing in chronic pain Lower Normandy. The quality of life will also be assessed by validated scales, and the results will be compared to the literature data.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient 18 to 70 years with: 1. Pain lasting for more than six months; 2. Monitoring in CETD in Normandy; 3. Having had a biopsychosocial assessment and have been the subject of a multidisciplinary discussions recorded in the medical record; 4.
