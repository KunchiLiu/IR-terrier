	<brief_summary>This is a randomized double-blind crossover study of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of BCD-066 (darbepoetin alfa manufactured by CJSC BIOCAD, Russia) and Aranesp® (Amgen Europe B.V., Netherlands) in healthy volunteers. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the equivalence of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety parameters after single subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Each drug will be administered to each volunteer at a dose of 1 µg per kilogram as a single subcutaneous or intravenous injection with an interval of at least 25 days.</brief_summary>
