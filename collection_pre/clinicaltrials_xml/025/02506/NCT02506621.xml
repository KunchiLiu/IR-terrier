	<brief_title>ELR Monitoring Against Permanent Pacemaker in Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the ZIO xt , MoMe, TECHNOMED pocket ECG and Nuubo to the R-test, our current standard clinical practice, in detection of AF burden, in patients with history of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation and have a dual chamber pacemaker or ICD in situ, with sensitivity and specificity of AF detection calculated from the implanted pacemaker monitored beat to beat holters.</detailed_description>
