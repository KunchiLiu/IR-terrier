	<brief_summary>This is a phase IV, twelve week, open label, randomized, parallel group study to assess safety and tolerability of combined treatment with nintedanib and pirfenidone. A secondary objective is to assess the exposure based on PK trough concentration values to nintedanib either given alone or in combination with pirfenidone and to assess the exposure of pirfenidone when combined with nintedanib.</brief_summary>
