	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether regular measurement of skin foot temperature with a novel device (DFUPS) will prevent ulcer recurrence in diabetic patients at high risk of foot ulceration. It is planned to regularly measure the temperature of the feet of people with diabetes who have already had a foot ulcer which has subsequently healed. These measurements should allow the identification of hotspots on the foot and may be helpful when advising about ulcer risk and providing preventative treatment. It is hoped to find out whether the regular use of thermal images taken with the DFUPS device together with standard foot treatment may reduce the number of people with diabetes developing ulcers or even prevent foot ulcers.</brief_summary>
