	<brief_title>Azathioprine Based on Endoscopy After Clinical Remission in Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sample size was calculated based on the previous study showing the difference of mucosal healing rate between azathioprine (58%) and 5-aminosalicylate (21%). With a two-tailed test of α = 0.05 and 1 - ß = 0.8, 52 patients were required. The placebo drug which is identical to azathioprine will be provided by Celltrion drug company. Differences in the categorical variables between the groups are examined with χ2 or the Fisher exact test. For comparisons of continuous variables, a Student t test is used.</detailed_description>
