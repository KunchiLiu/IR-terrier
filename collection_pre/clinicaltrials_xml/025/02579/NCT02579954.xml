	<brief_summary>Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension is characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance inducing shortness of breath and exercise intolerance. We aim to correlate cardiac function (evaluated at rest by right heart catheterism and RMN) to exercise capacity (evaluated by endurance time at 75% of maximal workout), in prevalent patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, and their evolution at three and twelve months.</brief_summary>
