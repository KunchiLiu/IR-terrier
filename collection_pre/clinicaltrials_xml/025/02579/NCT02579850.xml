	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to evaluate the superiority of the fixed triple therapy with BDP/FF/GB at a daily dose of 400/24/50 mcg respectively with that of Ultibro® Breezhaler® (DPI), fixed combination of indacaterol 85 mcg and of glycopyrronium 43 mcg in COPD patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>2-arm Parallel Group Study of Fixed Combination of CHF 5993 vs Ultibro® in COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outpatients attending the hospital clinics/study centres will be recruited. Patients with severe and very severe COPD airflow obstruction according to GOLD 2014 criteria. A total of approximately 2192 patients will need to be screened in order to obtain 1534 (767 per arm) randomized and evaluable patients. Approximately 200 sites will be involved worldwide. Each patient will perform a total of 8 clinic visits (V0 to V7) during the study. The Primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of CHF 5993 pMDI over Ultibro® in terms of moderate and severe COPD exacerbation rate over 52 weeks of treatment. The Secondary objectives are: 1. To evaluate the effect of CHF 5993 pMDI on other lung function parameters, patient's health status and clinical outcome measures; 2. To assess the safety and the tolerability of the study treatments. A 2-week open-label run-in period under Ultibro® followed by a 52-week randomised treatment period. The trial design will be optimised to measure exacerbation rates by using the Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT), developed means of collecting patient-reported outcome (PRO) data, which helps to capture the frequency of exacerbations.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion : 1. Male and female ≥ 40 years 2. Severe or very severe COPD diagnosed for at least 12 months 3. Current smokers or exsmokers who quit smoking at least 6 months prior to screening visit, with a smoking history of at least 10 pack years 4. Postbronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 50% of the predicted normal value and a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.7 5. Documented history of at least one exacerbation in the 12 months 6. Patient under double therapy for at least 2 months prior to screening. Double therapy will be defined by treatment with any of the following: Orally inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and (longacting beta2agonist) LABA ICS and longacting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) Orally LABA and LAMA Monotherapy with LAMA for at least 2 months prior to screening 7. Symptomatic patient at screening with a CAT score ≥ 10. 8. Cooperative attitude and ability to use correctly the inhalers, the spacer AeroChamber Plus (only to patients who are using a spacer), the electronic devices with COPD questionnaire. Exclusion : 1. Pregnant or lactating women and all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant UNLESS are willing to use one or more of the reliable methods of contraception 2. Patient with a current clinical diagnosis of asthma with a physicianjudged need for inhaled or oral corticosteroid therapy 3. Patient requiring use of the following medications: Course of systemic steroids &gt; 3 days for COPD exacerbation in the 4 weeks prior to screening Course of antibiotics for COPD exacerbation &gt; 7 days in the 4 weeks prior to screening Phosphodiesterase4 inhibitor in the 4 weeks prior to screening Use of antibiotics for a lower respiratory tract infection in the 4 weeks prior to screening 4. COPD exacerbation requiring prescription of systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics or hospitalization during the runin period 5. Patient treated with noncardioselective βblockers in the month preceding the screening or during the runin period. 6. Patient treated with longacting antihistamines unless taken at stable regimen at least 2 months prior to screening and to be maintained constant during the study or if taken as needed 7. Patient requiring long term (at least 12 hours daily) oxygen therapy for chronic hypoxemia 8. Known respiratory disorders other than COPD which may impact the efficacy of the study drug 9. Patient who have clinically significant cardiovascular condition 10. Patient with atrial fibrillation (AF): Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Persistent, Long standing or Permanent 11. Abnormal and clinically significant 12lead ECG that results in active medical problem which may impact the safety of the patient 12. Patient whose ECG shows QTcF &gt;450 ms for males or QTcF &gt;470 ms for females at screening visit are not eligible (not applicable for patient with pacemaker) 13. Medical diagnosis of narrowangle glaucoma, clinically relevant prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction would prevent use of anticholinergic agents 14. History of hypersensitivity to M3 Antagonists, β2agonist, corticosteroids or any of the excipients contained in any of the formulations used in the trial which may raise contraindications or impact the efficacy of the study drug 15. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities indicating a significant or unstable concomitant disease which may impact the efficacy or the safety of the study drug 16. Patients with hypokalaemia (serum potassium &lt;3.5 mEq/L or 3.5 mmol/L) or uncontrolled hyperkalaemia 17. Unstable concurrent disease which may impact the results of the study 18. Patients with any history of malignancy likely to result in significant disability or likely to require significant medical or surgical intervention within the next six months (after V1) or with malignancy for which they are currently undergoing radiation therapy or chemotherapy 19. History of alcohol abuse or substance/drug abuse within 12 months prior to screening visit 20. Participation in another clinical trial if investigational drug was received less than 8 weeks prior to screening visit</criteria>
