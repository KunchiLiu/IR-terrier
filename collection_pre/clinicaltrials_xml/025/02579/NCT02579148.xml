	<brief_title>Collagen Scaffolds Loaded With HUCMSCs for the Improvement of Erectile Function in Men With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intracavernous transplantation of stem cells has been shown to improve erectile function in some preclinical studies. However, inadequate cell homing to damaged sites limited its functions. The investigators explore the effect of HUCMSC on improving erectile function of diabetic men, and whether collagen scaffolds contribute to long-term cell retention in the corpus cavernous and improves erectile function of diabetic men.</detailed_description>
