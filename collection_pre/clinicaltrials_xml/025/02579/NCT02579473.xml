	<brief_summary>SER-214 is a poly (2-ethyl-2oxazoline)(POZ) polymer conjugate of rotigotine, a potent dopamine agonist that has high affinity for the subclass of dopamine receptors in the brain that mediate dopamine signaling. SER-214 will be administered subcutaneously once a week via a standard 1 mL insulin syringe to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of released rotigotine and POZ-conjugate. Subjects in this study are eligible if they have early, stable or untreated Parkinson's disease and are still experiencing motor fluctuations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Weekly Subcutaneous Injections of SER-214 in Subjects With Parkinson's Disease (PD), to Determine the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic (PK) Profile of SER-214</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical evidence suggests that dopamine agonists should be considered as an initial or early symptomatic therapy for PD. Current information indicates that the early use of long-acting dopaminergic agonists may protect against the development of motor complications by stimulating dopamine receptors in a non-pulsatile manner and by delaying the introduction of levodopa. In pre-clinical primate studies, L-dopa (short-acting, pulsatile) and dopaminergic agonists (long-acting; non pulsatile) provide comparable clinical benefit but with agonists inducing significantly less dyskinesia. Chronic L-dopa treated animals develop gene changes that are associated with abnormal neuronal firing patterns and dyskinesias which are not seen with long-acting dopamine agonists. Based on pre-clinical and clinical study results, treatment of Parkinson's patients with long-acting levodopa or dopamine agonists should provide symptomatic benefit, and significantly delay the onset of motor complications. This can be accomplished with duodopa or continuous sc apomorphine but these treatments are associated with significant side effects. To date, no practical method of providing continuous drug delivery using a dopaminergic agent for therapy of patients with early PD to prevent the development of motor complications has been advanced through clinical trials. SER-214 is being developed as a weekly sc injection that provides prompt onset of dopaminergic stimulation. Continuous levels of released rotigotine within the therapeutic window for relief of motor fluctuations have been observed in MPTP-treated cynomolgus macaques. PK determinations in normal monkeys for up to 13 weeks of treatment show that weekly injections of SER-214 provide continuous drug delivery of released plasma rotigotine within a predictable therapeutic range.</detailed_description>
