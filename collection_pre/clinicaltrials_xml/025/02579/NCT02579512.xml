	<brief_summary>The NIA algorithm is similar to the traditional 12-lead ECG equipment. By analyzing patient data, NIA algorithm provides more detailed results compared to traditional 12-lead ECG. Patients with suspected coronary artery disease are conventionally diagnosed and treated by cardiac catheterization. However, cardiac catheterization is invasive procedure. Unless clinical diagnosis is evident before cardiac catheterization, a treadmill exercise test, a nuclear medicine myocardial perfusion test, or a multi-direction coronary CT angiogram is usually performed to increase the accuracy of diagnosis. But these examinations are not accessible to all patients, and are time-consuming and costly.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non Invasive Extra-corporeal ECG Signal Analysis Algorithm( NID Algorithm) for Myocardial Ischemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this project, the investigators hope to compare the data collected under this new technology of NIA algorithm with results from final diagnoses of cardiac catheterization. As the NIA algorithm is a fast and less costly, if it provides more sensitivity and specificity than does exercise ECG, nuclear myocardial perfusion test, and high-resolution coronary CT angiogram, it will expedite diagnosis for patients with coronary artery disease.</detailed_description>
