	<brief_summary>Axitinib is a drug which is approved by the FDA for patients with advanced kidney cancer who have already received some treatment. It works by reducing blood flow to a tumor. Axitinib is normally give at 5mg twice per day and sometimes this dose is increased if patients tolerate it. The purpose of this study is to figure out a different way to decide which dose of axitinib each patient should receive based on the side effects they experience.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Axitinib Given on an Individualized Schedule for Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective To determine whether axitinib given on an individualized dose/schedule for metastatic renal cell carcinoma following immunotherapy with PD-1 and PD-L1 Inhibitors leads to improved PFS. Secondary objectives: 1. To characterize the objective response rates in patients given axitinib on an individualized dose/schedule. 2. To evaluate the tolerability and safety of an alternative method of axitinib titration. 3. To characterize the anti-tumor effect, as measured by change in tumor burden per RECIST 1.1, of axitinib titration performed after initial RECIST PD on axitinib.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed, locally recurrent or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma Has received one prior systemic therapy regimen for mRCC directed against PD1 and/or PDL1 which must have been the most recent regimen Prior highdose interleukin2 therapy is permitted in addition to antiPD(L)1 therapy, but is not required Prior bevacizumab or VEGF TKI is permitted either in combination with antiPD(L)1 therapy OR as monotherapy when given PRIOR to antiPD(L)1 therapy Prior treatment with combined ipilimumab and nivolumab is permitted Prior axitinib in any setting is not permitted Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy is permitted if disease recurrence was greater than 6 months from the last dose of therapy. A minimum of two weeks since last dose of most recent renal cell cancer therapy assuming resolution of clinically significant treatmentrelated toxicities to grade 1, baseline, or controlled with supportive medications Evidence of measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 %. Adequate organ function as defined by: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,000/μL Platelets ≥100,000/μL Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL Serum calcium ≤12.0 mg/dL Serum creatinine ≤2.0 x ULN Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN SGOT≤2.5 x ULN and SGPT ≤2.5x ULN Signed informed consent and willingness/ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures Non clear cell RCC Major surgery within 4 weeks of starting the study treatment. Radiation therapy within 2 weeks of starting the study treatment. Prior palliative radiotherapy to metastatic lesion(s) is permitted, provided there is at least one measurable lesion that has not been irradiated. NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 grade 3 hemorrhage within 4 weeks of starting the study treatment. Any of the following within the 6 months prior to study drug administration: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack. Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 grade ≥2. Controlled atrial fibrillation is permitted. Uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;160/100 mm Hg despite optimal medical therapy) Concurrent treatment on another clinical trial. Supportive care trials or nontreatment trials, e.g. QOL, and imaging trials, are allowed. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Female subjects must be surgically sterile or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. All female subjects with reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum) prior to enrollment. Male subjects must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study. Uncontrolled CNS metastases. Patients are considered to have controlled CNS metastases (and thus eligible) if they have completed local therapy (XRT and/or surgery) and are off steroids with clinical and radiographic stability 3 months from the end of CNSdirected therapy.</criteria>
