	<brief_title>The Safety and Biological Activity of ATYR1940 in Patients With Limb Girdle or Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ATYR1940-C-004 is a Phase1b/2 open-label intrapatient study dose escalation study aiming to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, biological activity of intravenous ATYR1940, administered once weekly for 8 weeks, then twice a weekly for 4 weeks in adult patients with LGMD2B and FSHD. Approximately 8 LGMD2B and 8 FHSD patients will be enrolled.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Provided informed consent Investigator's opinion, patient is willing and able to complete all study procedures and comply with the study visit schedule. Patients with LGMD2B: Established, genetically confirmed diagnosis of LGMD2B. Either the presence of a STIRpositive muscle on lower extremity skeletal muscle MRI, or, if no STIRpositive muscles, meets muscle biomarker criteria. Patients with FSHD: Established, genetically confirmed diagnosis of FSHD. The presence of a STIRpositive muscle on lower extremity skeletal muscle MRI. Currently receiving treatment with an immunomodulatory agent, including targeted biological therapies within the 3 months before baseline; corticosteroids within 3 months before baseline; or highdose nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents within 2 weeks before baseline. Currently receiving curcumin or albuterol; use of a product that putatively enhances muscle growth on a chronic basis within 4 weeks before baseline; statin treatment initiation or significant adjustment to statin regimen within 3 months before baseline (stable, chronic statin use is permissible). Use of an investigational product or device within 30 days before baseline. Evidence of an alternative diagnosis other than LGMD2B or FSHD or a coexisting myopathy or dystrophy, based on prior muscle biopsy or other available investigations. History of severe restrictive or obstructive lung disease or evidence for interstitial lung disease on screening chest radiograph. History of antisynthetase syndrome, prior Jo1 Abpositivity, or a positive or equivocally positive Jo1 Ab test result during screening. Chronic infection, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus or a history of tuberculosis. Vaccination within 8 weeks before baseline or vaccination is planned during study participation. Symptomatic cardiomyopathy or severe cardiac arrhythmia that may in the Investigator's opinion, limit the patient's ability to complete the study protocol. Muscle biopsy within 30 days before baseline.</criteria>
