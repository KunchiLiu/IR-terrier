	<brief_summary>This Phase I study is primarily designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD2811 at increasing doses in patients with advanced solid tumours and for whom no standard of care exists. The study will be conducted in two parts, a dose-escalation phase (Part A) and a dose expansion phase (Part B). During Part A, the dose-escalation phase, patient enrolment will proceed according to a 3+3 design where the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) will be identified. The study will also characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AZD2811 and will explore the potential biological activity by assessing anti-tumour activity in patients. Once the MTD is established, Part B (the dose expansion phase) will commence and will enroll patients in 3 groups. Part B will further explore PK parameters, safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumour activity of the AZD2811 RP2D as monotherapy (Group 1) in patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC, and when combined with irinotecan (Group 2 and Group 3). In Part B-Group 2, PK, the safety and tolerability of the AZD2811 will be assessed in a lead-in cohort when given in combination with irinotecan. When a safe and tolerated dose for the AZD2811 and irinotecan combination has been defined, an additional 30 patients will be enrolled to assess efficacy (Part B-Group 3).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study of Safety, Tolerability, and PK of AZD2811 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a FTIP study primarily designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD2811 at increasing doses in patients with advanced solid tumours and for whom no standard of care exists. The study will be conducted in two parts, a dose-escalation phase (Part A) in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumours, and a dose-expansion phase (Part B) in patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC. During Part A, the dose-escalation phase, patient enrolment will proceed according to a 3+3 design where the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be identified.

Patients must have received ≤3 prior chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting which may have included irinotecan. Part B dose expansion 1. Patients must have received at least 1 prior therapy but no more than 2 prior regimens for relapsed and/or refractory SCLC. No previous treatment with irinotecan if entering Part B, Group 2 or 3. 2. Measurable or evaluable disease according to RECIST v1.1. 3. Aged at least 18 years. 4.

Predicted life expectancy ≥12 weeks. 7. Females should be using adequate contraceptive measures from the time of screening until 6 months after study discontinuation, should not be breast feeding and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing. 1. Patients who have been treated with most recent radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy or investigational drugs within ≤21 days or 5 halflives (whichever is shorter) from enrolment (screening), and/or who have any unresolved NCI Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 &gt; Grade 1 treatmentrelated side effect, with the exceptions of alopecia, should not be enrolled. 2. Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) ≤21 days from beginning of the study drug or minor surgical procedures ≤7 days. No waiting is required following implantable port and catheter placement. 3. Previous treatment with alisertib. 4. Any of the following cardiac criteria: Congestive heart failure (CHF) per New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification &gt; Class II Cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy Unstable angina or newonset angina QTcF interval &gt;470 ms on screening ECG. 5.
