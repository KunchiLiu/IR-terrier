	<brief_summary>Background: The recommended monitoring and target levels in septic shock (SSC Guidelines 2012) including mean arterial pressure (MAP) target are not based on robust clinical data. Objective: To test, if in patients with septic shock, tissue perfusion guided (TPG) treatment strategy leads to a faster resolution of hypoperfusion than the macrocirculatory target guided standard care. Design: A prospective phase II two-parallel-group open-label randomized controlled trial Interventions: 1. Intervention group- Targeted tissue perfusion guided (TTP) - care. 2. Control group - Macrocirculatory - guided (MCG) care. Randomization: 1:1 stratified according to the site and presence or absence of known hypertension. Trial size: 200 randomised patients in 4 ICUs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted Tissue Perfusion Versus Macrocirculatory-guided Standard Care in Patients With Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study hypothesis: Targeting at clinical tissue perfusion (in the TTP arm) will decrease the use and untoward effects of vasopressors, and result in more days alive in 30-days without vasopressor or inotropic support and without lactatemia, in comparison with standard clinical care with preference of macrocirculatory targets (MCG arm). Intervention group - Targeted tissue perfusion (TTP) care: Primary targets /registration period 1. capillary refill time (CRT) / &lt;3 sec/ every hour 2. skin mottling / absent / every hour 3. arterial lactate / &lt;2.0 mmol/l/ per 2hr 4. peripheral temperature/ warm /every hour 5. urine output/ ≥0.5 mL/kg per hour/ every hour 6. mean arterial pressure (MAP) 50-65 mmHg (minimum as a safety limit)/ continuous - if previous hypertension 65- 70 mmHg - if oliguria 2-hour trial 75-80 mmHg (If diuresis better, continue 2hr and re-evaluate) Secondary target 7. Continuous mixed venous saturation (SvO2) &gt;65%, if available Control group - Macrocirculatory targets guided (MCG) standard care Primary targets 1. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) 65-75 mmHg /continuous ** if previous hypertension 75-80 mmHg *** if oliguria &lt; 0.3 ml/kg, 2-hour trial 85-90 mmHg (If diuresis better, continue 2hr and re-evaluate) 2. Central venous pressure (CVP)/hourly, Adequate fluid therapy is indicated to restore clinical hypovolemia up to the recommended CVP-level of 8-12 mmHg, if needed 3. Urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h/ hourly Secondary target 4. Continuous SvO2 &gt;65%, if available</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Septic shock defined as 1.
