	<brief_title>Effects of N-acetylcysteine on Cardiorespiratory Control in COPD Patients With Mild-to-moderate Airflow Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Cardiovascular complications constitute the main causes of poor physical capacity and healthcare resources utilization in COPD. There is emerging evidence that these impairments have a major impact on the health of patients with mild-to-moderate disease, the largest sub-population of COPD. This important problem, however, is currently neglected as no specific pharmacological treatment is offered to these patients. Recent studies indicate that vascular abnormalities are mediated, at least in part, by circulating inflammatory substances and direct damage of the arteries by oxygen radicals (oxidative stress). The current investigation will test the hypothesis that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, improves systemic vascular function and physical capacity in COPD patients with mild-to-moderate airflow obstruction.</detailed_description>
