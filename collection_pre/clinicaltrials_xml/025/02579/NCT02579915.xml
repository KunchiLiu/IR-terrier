	<brief_title>Developing a Low-Intensity Primary Care Intervention for Anxiety Disorders (AIM-PC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goals of our 3-year, 2-phase project are to develop AIM for primary care linkage and assess its feasibility and acceptability. This protocol description only pertains to Phase 2 (Randomized Controlled Trial). 42 primary care patients with primary Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and/or Panic Disorder (with or without Agoraphobia) will be randomly assigned to the AIM treatment or to a symptom tracking control group. Full assessments will occur pre- and post-treatment and 3-months follow-up. A mid-treatment assessment will include measures of cognitive biases and the primary outcome. Weekly measures of anxiety and depression will be collected, as will feedback from patients and PCPs about the research and delivery procedures.</detailed_description>
