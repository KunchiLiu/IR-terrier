	<brief_summary>In various transanal and anal procedures it is desirable to clean the operating field from stool contamination. Thus mechanical bowel preparation is not well tolerated by patients. Enema does not provide sufficient effect. By the use of Coloshield a rectal washout might be performed and enable a clean operating field. In this randomized controlled trial the macroscopic contamination of the rectum with and without Coloshield is compared using the Boston Bowel Preparation Score (0-3).</brief_summary>
