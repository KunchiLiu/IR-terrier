	<brief_title>Vaginal Antibody Safety Trial: Safety Study of Monoclonal Antibodies to Reduce the Vaginal Transmission of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, Phase 1, randomized, single blind, placebo-controlled, two-segment study to assess the safety of the MB66 vaginal film. After appropriate screening, approximately 43 healthy women will be enrolled. The study will be divided into two sequential Segments. The first, Segment A, is a single-arm, single-dose, open label design. The 8 Segment A participants will receive a single dose of one full MB66 film. After dosing, subjects will be asked to maintain sexual abstinence and will be evaluated in person on Day 1 (24-hours post MB66 administration), by telephone on Day 3 or 4 and in person on the Day 6-10 Exit Visit, after which subjects will be allowed to resume sexual activity with study-provided condoms until three weeks after last exposure to film (to avoid male exposure to residual drug product). A placebo arm is not included in Segment A, because the very low risk of toxicity of the placebo film makes it unlikely that any toxicity observed in Segment A would be wrongly attributed to the active agents (mAbs) in the MB66 film. This conclusion is based on the known tolerance of the very similar vehicle used in a commercial polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based vaginal film (VCF®), and the absence of toxicity of the MB66 placebo film in the very sensitive rabbit model after substantially higher dosing intensity and duration. Completion of Segment A and a safety review of Segment A adverse events will trigger the initiation of Segment B, a repeat dose, randomized, two arm, single-blind, placebo-controlled design. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 into two groups (15 evaluable subjects per group) and be treated once daily with either 1 MB66 film or 1 vehicle control placebo film for seven consecutive days. For five days before, and for 7 days after the dosing period, subjects will be asked to maintain a period of sexual abstinence. Subjects will be evaluated in person on Day 0 (at 1 and 4 hours post MB66 in-clinic dosing), again on Day 1 (24 hr post dosing), by telephone on Day 3-4, and evaluated again in person on Day 7-8, after which, subjects will be allowed to resumed sexual activity with condoms required until three weeks after last film insertion. Subjects will be evaluated a last time on the Day 12-16 Exit Visit. In addition to safety measures, pharmacokinetic evaluations will be done on Day 0, Day 1, and Day 7 in both Segments, and additionally on Day 14 for Segment B. Specifically, this study will evaluate the rate of MB66 film dissolution, the vaginal concentrations of the MB66 antibodies, and the degree of systemic absorption of the MB66 antibodies. A number of of exploratory objectives will also be evaluated, including assessment of the antiviral effect of the MB66 antibodies ex vivo in cervicovaginal lavage fluid from participants after dosing with MB66 film, the effects of MB66 and placebo films on the cervicovaginal microbial environment using pH, Nugent score, and bacterial ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and comparison of the effect of MB66 and placebo films on cervicovaginal immune mediators by Luminex and ELISA assays. Segment B participants will also be asked to assess the acceptability of the MB66 vaginal film after 7 days of use.</detailed_description>

Able and willing to provide adequate locator information at screening 4. HIVuninfected based on testing performed by study staff at 5. In general good health as determined by the site clinician 6. Agree to abstain from any vaginal insertions, including products, douches, devices such as sex toys, or penile or oral intercourse from 5 days prior to Visit 2 (Enrollment Visit) until the final Study Visit (one week after last dose of study film). Only tampons during menses and clinically indicated speculum exams are allowed. 7. Agree to use condoms provided by the study staff from one week after last use of study film until three weeks after last use of study film 8. Willingness to undergo all studyrelated assessments and follow all studyrelated procedures 9. Be currently using an effective method of contraception at enrollment (used continuously and with good compliance for the past 60 days as determined by participant selfreport) with plans to continue use throughout the study period. Acceptable methods include any hormonal method (except vaginal ring); intrauterine device (IUD) inserted at least 90 days prior to enrollment; female sterilization; abstinent from sexual activity with male partner for the past 60 days; sexual activity with vasectomized partner; engages in sex exclusively with women. 10. For participants 21 and older, a Pap result in the 36 calendar months prior to the Enrollment Visit consistent with Grade 0 according to the Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies Addendum 1 to the DAIDS Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events satisfactory evaluation with no treatment required of nonGrade 0 Pap result per American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines or per local standard of care, within the last 36 calendar months prior to enrollment. Note: For participants aged 1821, a Grade0 or adequately evaluated abnormal Pap smear is not required as the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology recommends initiating screening at age 21. 11. At screening and enrollment, agrees not to participate in other research studies involving drugs, medical devices, or vaginal products while enrolled in this trial 1. Menopausal at screening (as defined as amenorrhea or irregular periods for one year or more without an alternative etiology) 2. Hysterectomy 3.
