	<brief_summary>In view of the fact that little is known about the pre- and post-interventional coagulation management of phenprocoumon patients with reviparin at general practices in Germany, an observational study is being initiated to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of reviparin in the area of outpatient, general practice-based care in the context of bridging therapy. Patients for whom bridging therapy with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was specified and for whom the LMWH reviparin was chosen for this purpose shall be investigated.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients &gt; 18 years old Requiring prophylaxis/bridging treatment with reviparin, e.g. for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in general and orthopaedic surgery, due to the decision of the treating physician Hypersensitivity to reviparin or one of the excipients of ClivarinÂ® or other lowmolecularweight heparin preparations and/or heparin, e.g. confirmed or suspected immunemediated heparininduced thrombocytopenia (type 2) Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min) Bleeding: like other anticoagulants, reviparin should not be used in conditions associated with an increased risk of bleeding, e.g. acute bleeding, haemorrhagic diathesis, coagulation factor deficiencies, severe thrombocytopenia, untreated arterial hypertension, bacterial endocarditis and subacute endocarditis, acuteonset gastrointestinal ulcers or haemorrhages, brain haemorrhage, spinal or ear or eye surgery, intraocular bleeding or corresponding injuries within the past 6 months Severe hepatic or pancreatic impairment Children Patients with a body weight &lt; 45kg Life expectancy of less than 3 months Pregnant women (due to the generally very long duration of treatment with LMWH in female patients who are already on anticoagulation therapy)</criteria>
