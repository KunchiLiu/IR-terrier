	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) to that of lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone without pembrolizumab in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (Auto-SCT).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis of active multiple myeloma and measurable disease. Ineligible to receive treatment with autoSCT due to age (≥65 years old) or any significant coexisting medical condition (cardiac, renal, pulmonary or hepatic dysfunction), likely to have a negative impact on tolerability of autoSCT. Participants &lt;65 years of age who refuse autoSCT are not eligible for this study. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1. Female participants of childbearing potential must have 2 negative urine pregnancy tests (with a sensitivity of at least 25 Milliinternational units/Milliliter) within 10 to 14 days and within 24 hours prior to receiving study medication. Female participants of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception 28 days prior to study start, continuing throughout the study, and for up to 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide (or 120 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab). Male participants of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception from the first dose of study medication, continuing throughout the study, and for up to 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide (or 120 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab). Has undergone prior allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation within the last 5 years. Has peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment within the last 5 years (except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy). Has history of noninfectious pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis Has received prior therapy with an antiprogrammed cell death 1 receptor (antiPD1), antiprogrammed deathligand 1 (antiPDL1), antiPDL2, antiCD137, or anticytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 (CTLA4) antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or checkpoint pathways). Has a known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), or a known, active Hepatitis B (HBV), or a known, active Hepatitis C (HCV) infection. Is unable or unwilling to undergo thromboembolic prophylaxis including, as clinically indicated, aspirin, Coumadin (warfarin) or lowmolecular weight heparin. Has lactose intolerance. Has an invasive fungal infection.</criteria>
