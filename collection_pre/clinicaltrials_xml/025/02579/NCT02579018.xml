	<brief_summary>There are two major goals of this investigation. First, to develop pilot data to justify a larger randomized clinical trial of an intervention designed to train interoceptive signals (IS) and interoceptive responsivity (IR) in persons with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Second, the investigators will determine whether persons with AN have similar or different IS and IR for heart rate while exercising as compared to age and gender matched controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heart Rate Sensing and Response in Persons With Anorexia Nervosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this pilot investigation is to assess AN interoceptive sensitivity and responsivity as it pertains to heart rate during exercise. Thirty adults, 18 years and older will be recruited for a cross-sectional comparison of IS and IR in the context of exercise.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study participants will include adults with anorexia spectrum disorders and healthy age and gender matched controls. There will be two control groups, one that includes regularly exercising age and gender matched persons and one where controls do not engage in regular exercise. For those with AN, the following INCLUSION criteria must be met: Age ≥ 18 years old BMI 25 kg/m2 or less Diagnosis of anorexia spectrum disorder Medications: Stable use of all medications ≥ three months For age and gender matched controls, the following INCLUSION criteria must be met: Age ≥ 18 years old BMI 25 kg/m2 or less No diagnosis of anorexia spectrum disorder Medications: Stable use of all medications ≥ three months Age (+/ 2 years) and gender matched to study participant History of diabetes, heart disease or taking medications for those conditions History of hypertension (high blood pressure) not controlled with medication Orthopedic limitations, musculoskeletal disease and/or injury Inability to consent Lack of transportation to the Duke Center for Living campus</criteria>
