	<brief_title>Flexibility of Cognition And Persistent Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative pain is a normal, physiologic, protective response to tissue injury that routinely resolves after healing of the surgical site. However, in some patients, pain persists long after surgery. PPSP is a diagnosis of exclusion that has most consistently been defined as pain that (1) developed after a surgical procedure, (2) is not residual from a preexisting condition, (3) has lasted for at least two months, and (4) is not attributable to other causes. One suggested risk factor for PPSP is poorer performance on tests of cognitive flexibility. Two common tests of cognitive flexibility are the Trail Making Tests (TMT) A and B and the Color Word Matching Stroop Test (CWMST). Three hundred patients undergoing either total knee arthroplasty or thoracotomy/mastectomy will be enrolled. During preoperative evaluation, participants will complete the TMT and CWMST. Subjects will be followed prospectively and will complete surveys at one month, six months, and one year postoperatively to assess PPSP prevalence and intensity.</detailed_description>
