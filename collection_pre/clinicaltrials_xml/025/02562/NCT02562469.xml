	<detailed_description>In an open clinical trial, ACTIVATE, a computer-based neurocognitive intervention will be evaluated to determine its effectiveness in improving symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related impairments. ACTIVATE is a computerized neurocognitive training program (ACTIVATE; see: www.c8sciences.com) that simultaneously targets eight core neurocognitive factors (i.e., sustained attention, working memory (WM), response inhibition, speed of information processing, cognitive flexibility and control, multiple simultaneous attention, category formation, and pattern recognition and inductive thinking). Youth between the ages of 7-11 will be recruited and assessed for ADHD and assigned to the ACTIVATE intervention. Assessment of outcomes will occur before, weekly during treatment, immediately post-treatment, 3- and 6-month follow up periods.</detailed_description>
