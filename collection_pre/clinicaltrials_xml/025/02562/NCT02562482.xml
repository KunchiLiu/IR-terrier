	<brief_title>Trial for Safety and Immunogenicity of a Chikungunya Vaccine, VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP, in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a 2-injection vaccine regimen with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and virus like particle vaccine (CHIKV VLP) in healthy adults. The hypothesis is that the vaccine regimen is safe and induces a neutralizing antibody response to CHIKV. The primary objectives are to evaluate safety and tolerability of a 2-injection investigational vaccine regimen of VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP at 20 mcg compared to placebo (PBS) in healthy adults in CHIKV endemic areas. The secondary objective is to evaluate neutralizing antibody response in vaccine recipients. The exploratory objectives relate to assessing incidence of CHIKV infection in vaccine and placebo recipients, as well as antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses during the study. The expected duration of time on the study per subject is approximately 72 weeks with vaccinations scheduled at Day 0 and Day 28.</detailed_description>
