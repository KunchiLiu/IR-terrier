	<brief_summary>This study is constituted of 2 parts: Part A: A total of 36 patients will be enrolled in part A. Each eligible subject will participate in two 14-day treatment periods with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) of BioChaperone insulin lispro and insulin lispro (Humalog®, Eli Lilly and Company). Each treatment period consists of 10 treatment days under free living conditions (e.g. home / workplace) and under standardised conditions at the clinic. Various assessments for pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, pump compatibility, short-term efficacy and safety are performed on selected days, including: - Mixed Meal Test (MMT), Day 1, Day 3, Day 12 and Day 14, that will assess the post-prandial glucose response for 6 hours after individualized standard meal (fixed nutrient ratio) ingestion and bolus administration via CSII. - Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM), (Day 1 - 14) that will be used in blinded mode (i.e. neither subjects nor the investigators are aware of the sensor glucose values). - Pump compatibility (Day 1 - 14): Subjects will continue CSII treatment with the Investigational Medicinal Products (IMP) during the outpatient periods. Part B: A total of 44 patients will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized to a 4-period cross-over study aiming at comparing the performance of BC Lispro and Humalog after a prandial bolus administration with two different CSII systems (Roche Accu-Chek® Spirit and Medtronic Paradigm® Veo™) or with a syringe. Pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, pump compatibility and safety will be analyzed. Each period will include a mixed meal tolerance test with a CSII device and a mixed meal tolerance test with the same dose of insulin administered with a syringe.</brief_summary>
