	<brief_title>Changes in Myocardial Biomechanics and Early Short-term Doxycycline Therapy in Patients With Primary Anterior STEMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is known that MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) take part in myocardial remodeling, which lead to the adverse remodeling of left ventricular. Doxycycline inhibiting MMPs and it help to prevent collagen degradation and following LV (left ventricular) dilatation. Some experimental studies on rat models have suggested an anti-remodeling effect of doxycycline in myocardial infarction by means of decrease in activity of MMPs-2 and recovery of contractile function of myocardium. The clinical trial was performed at 2013 (D.Antoniucci), but it was a single study and confirmed theoretical and experimental background. The study is randomized, opened, controlled. 45 patients with the first anterior STEMI will be enrolled. On admission all patients will receive reperfusion therapy during the first 24 h. Patients will be randomized by the open envelope method and after that some of the participants will be on doxycycline (100 mg b.i.d. for 7 days) in addition to routine medical therapy for STEMI, but other will be on routine medical therapy of STEMI. After that they will have echocardiography at 3-d, 7-th, 14-th days and 6 month after STEMI. The investigators will evaluate left ventricular function of these patients by routine and speckle-tracking echocardiography, incidence of cardiovascular end points (death, recurrent myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke) and their combinations, also the investigators will take blood samples to assess metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other biomarkers.</detailed_description>
