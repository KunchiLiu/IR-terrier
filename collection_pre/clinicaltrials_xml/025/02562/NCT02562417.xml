	<brief_summary>Sugammadex is used as a reversal drug for rocuronium- or vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block during general anaesthesia. IV dexamethasone is injected as a prophylactic measure against postoperative nausea and vomiting. Recent animal data have shown that dexamethasone may impair the reversal effect of sugammadex. The objective of this randomised controlled trial is to confirm in the clinical practice these preliminary results.</brief_summary>
