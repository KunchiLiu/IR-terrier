	<brief_title>Is Drainage Necessary After Total Hip Replacement?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After approval from the local ethical committee, patients undergoing Total Hip Replacement (THR) were included in this study. Patients with previous hip surgeries and coagulation disorders were not included. All patients were submitted to a non-cemented Total Hip Replacement (THR) through a Hardinge's approach. Before wound closure, a nurse opened an envelope containing the patient randomization: group 1 - with closed suction drainage (CSD) and group 2 - without closed suction drainage (CSD). In the group 1, a sub-fascial suction drain was used, and kept for 24 hours. Data collected included: mid-tigh circumference after 24 hours, blood transfusion, inflammatory blood markers C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and leucogram, Harris Hip Score (HHS) after 3 months, and complications. Patients were followed for 3 months post operatively.</detailed_description>
