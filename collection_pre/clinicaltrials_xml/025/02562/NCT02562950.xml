	<brief_summary>This will be a drug-drug interaction study to evaluate the effect of multiple oral doses of GLPG1837 on the single dose pharmacokinetic profile of midazolam administered in fed healthy male subjects. Each subject will receive a single oral dose of midazolam (2 mg) on 2 occasions: on Day 1, before dosing with GLPG1837 and on Day 12 co-administered with GLPG1837, after multiple oral doses of GLPG1837 (daily for 10 days, from Day 2 until Day 11). Also, the safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses of GLPG1837 co-administered with midazolam in healthy male subjects will be evaluated. A first dose group of 12 subjects will receive a total daily dose of 500 mg (250 mg b.i.d.) GLPG1837 and a second dose group of 12 subjects will receive a total daily dose of 1000 mg (500 mg b.i.d.) GLPG1837.</brief_summary>
