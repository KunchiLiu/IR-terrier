	<brief_summary>This study is an observational study designed to determine the extent of gastrointestinal (GI) post-procedure complications after Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation (RFCA) for atrial fibrillation (AF). This exploratory study will evaluate patient symptoms prior to the RFCA procedure, at 1 month post RFCA procedure, and at 3 months post RFCA procedure, through the administration of a questionnaire. The purpose of this study is to determine if vagus nerve injury resulting from RFCA for AF increases the risk of post-procedure GI complications that may present as temporary or permanent symptoms.</brief_summary>
