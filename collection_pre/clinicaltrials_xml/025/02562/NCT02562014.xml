	<brief_summary>The excess production of colonic short-chain-fatty-acids (SCFA) has been implicated in the promotion of obesity, but colonic fermentation of dietary-fiber to SCFA may also play a role in preventing diabetes. The investigators aimed to compare the effects of two fermentable fibers (inulin and resistant-starch) on postprandial SCFA, glucose, insulin, free-fatty acids (FFA) and gut hormone responses and to compare the responses in healthy overweight and obese (OWO) vs lean (LN) participants. Methods: Using a randomized, single blind, crossover design, 13 OWO and 12 LN overnight fasted participants were studied on 3 separate occasions. On each day they consumed a 300 mL drink containing 75g glucose (Control) or 75g glucose plus 24g inulin (IN), or 28.2g resistant-starch (RS). A standard lunch was served 4 h after the test drink.</brief_summary>
