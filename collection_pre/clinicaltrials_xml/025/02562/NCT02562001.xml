	<brief_summary>The spinal cord injury is identified as the major cause of permanent disability worldwide, with the loss of ability to walk being the largest and most devastating of them for these patients. In this way, our goal is to analyze the effects of treatment with electrical transcranial direct-current stimulation of high definition (HD-tDCS) associated with gait training with partial body weight support aided by robotic device (Lokomat, Hocoma) in the march of patients with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). This randomized double-blind study will be built on the existing work already conducted at the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Institute of Medical School of the University of Sao Paulo, General Hospital. Outpatients (GA) and inpatients (GI) with spinal cord injury (AIS C and D) will receive active or placebo HD-tDCS followed by gait training with Lokomat (GA: 3 sessions / week X 6 weeks = 18 sessions; GI: 5 sessions / week x 6 weeks = 30 sessions). The functional assessments (through clinical and functional scales, assess gait, muscle strength, spasticity, balance and pain) and neurophysiological (cortical excitability measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation) will be held before and immediately after the training period and after a 3 months follow up. The expected result is that patients that received the active HD-tDCS presents an improvement over the ground gait after the Lokomat training period significantly greater than the placebo group, with positive correlations between neurophysiologic, kinematics and functional measurements.</brief_summary>
