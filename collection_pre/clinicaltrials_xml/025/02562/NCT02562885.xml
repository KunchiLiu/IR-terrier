	<brief_summary>Background: Close relationship exists between sleep slow wave (SSW) and the generation of spike wave in NREM-sleep. SSW are cortically generated oscillations alternating between excitatory depolarization ("Up-phase" of the SSW) and inhibitory hyperpolarization ("Down-phase" of the SSW). It has been shown experimentally that with increasing synchrony of slow neuronal oscillations SSW turn into spike waves. Acoustic pulses applied in correspondence to the SSW "Up-phase" enhance the amplitude of the subsequent SSW. Conversely, tones delivered at the SSW "Downphase" have a disruptive effect on the following SSW. Participants: Patients with epilepsy and spike waves in NREM-sleep. Objective: Modification of spike wave frequency, amplitude and spreading during NREM sleep by acoustic pulses applied at the "Up-" or "Down-phase" of SSW.</brief_summary>
