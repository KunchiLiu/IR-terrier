	<brief_summary>The primary goal is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of T-DM1 and non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients previously treated with taxanes and trastuzumab-based therapy. In addition, pharmacokinetic data on the combination of T-DM1 and lyposomal doxorubicin will be obtained.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T-DM1 and Non-pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin in HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects: Age ≥ 18 years with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that have relapsed or progressed on or after taxanes and trastuzumab-based therapy. Subjects must have histologic or cytologic confirmation of the HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Evidence of measurable or evaluable metastatic disease is required. Primary objective: - To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of T-DM1 and non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients previously treated with taxanes and trastuzumab-based therapy. Secondary objectives: - To determine the efficacy of the combination of T-DM1 and non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, defined by the overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), number of progressions and number and reasons for deaths. - To assess the safety profile of the combination of T-DM1 and non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, defined by all toxicities reported during the study. - To evaluate the cardiac safety of the combination of T-DM1 and non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin measured by LVEF as assessed by echocardiography, cardiac troponin I and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. - To evaluate the potential role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the predisposition for developing cardiotoxicity. - To analyze the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of T-DM1 and its metabolites and non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Type of study: This is a prospective dose-finding, multicenter and open-label phase I clinical trial. Treatment: Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) will be administered at a fixed dose of 3.6 mg/kg IV on Day 1 every 3 weeks and three cohorts of patients with three different dose levels of conventional non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (45 mg/m2, 50 mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2) IV on Day 1 in cycles of 21 days each are planned.</detailed_description>
