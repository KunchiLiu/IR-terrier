	<detailed_description>Japanese endoscopic gastric atrophy (EGA) classification, operative link on Gastritis Assessment (OLGA), operative link on intestinal metaplasia assessment (OLGIM) and gastritis pattern are used in evaluating the severity of gastritis and intestinal metaplasia in different countries, which are risk factors of gastric cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate characteristics of background mucosa in early gastric cancer (EGC), and to seek for the optimal assessment for EGC screening. A prospective study was conducted encompassing EGC patients (cases) and non-EGC patients (controls). All patients were performed endoscopic examination and systematically biopsied. Outcome measures were assessed and compared, including EGA classification as well as the OLGA/OLGIM assessment. Helicobacter pylori(H. pylori) status was detected in the meantime. A stepwise logistic regression model was performed to analyze correlations between EGA, OLGA, OLGIM and EGC.</detailed_description>
