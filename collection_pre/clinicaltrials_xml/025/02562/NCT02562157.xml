	<brief_summary>Achieving gastro-jejunal or duodenal anastomosis (GJA ) by exclusive endoscopically is a real goal for many years in the development and research of the transluminal endoscopic surgery (N.O.T.E.S). Endoscopic treatment, including palliative antro duodenal stenosis by metallic stent, although minimally invasive, causes problems in long-term secondary obstruction and migration. Surgical treatment of these strictures is associated with significant morbidity and mortality . The complication rate and severity of post-operative surgery after gastric bypass Roux-en-Y anastomosis or gastroduodenal fistulas remain close to 5% with a mortality of 1%. After 3 years of experimental research on porcine model, our team has developed a procedure of gastro duodenal anastomosis using transgastric endoscopic minimally invasive surgical technique (or NOTES) - LBA UMRT24 CERC laboratory , Aix-Marseille University , Faculty of Medicine North, with the aim to offer a credible alternative to conventional surgery. Thus the investigators propose to conduct a pilot prospective intervenionnal study. The investigators hypothetized that this technique would reduce morbidity and mortality clinical but also economic consequences of surgery while making it possible to obtain excellent results permeability and long-term functionality. This method uses a new concept of tissue apposition with a fully covered metallic stent to create the anastomosis under endoscopy exclusively. Ten patients with antro duodenal obstructions requiring surgical or endoscopic bypass will be included as part of an interventional biomedical research that will be conducted in one expert center. The duration of the inclusions will be 18 months. Then, the stent will be removed three months after insertion, at the end of the healing process, and each patient will be followed for one year. The primary endpoint will be the assessment of the feasibility of the procedure for gastro duodenal anastomosis using tissue apposition stenting and NOTES in human being. The secondary endpoints will be the clinical efficacy, the long term (1 year) patency of the anastomosis, the procedure duration, adverse events, morbidity and mortality, the quality of life and the length of stay. In case of failure of the NOTES procedure, the patient will be treated either by surgery or by conventional endoscopy according to the usual techniques without loss of chance. The risk / benefit ratio appears positive and a safety report will be issued after the first 4 inclusions. There will be no supplementary examination in patient follow-up in this study for which a CT iconography and biology are enough. The material used in the context of this work is consistent with the legislation on medical devices and has received CE Mark (tissue apposition fully covered stent Axios Â®).</brief_summary>
