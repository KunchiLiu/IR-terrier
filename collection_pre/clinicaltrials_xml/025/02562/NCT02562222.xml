	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to establish an optimized protocol of tDCS that normalize the lack of habituation and efficiency of inhibitory cortical circuits in migraine patients and determine tDCS polarity and the best cortical areas to stimulate which could normalize the lack of habituation and efficiency of inhibitory cortical circuits. For this, migraineurs volunteers will undergo to some tDCS protocols or sham tDCS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimized tDCS for the Treatment of Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A crossover trial to establish an optimized tDCS protocol will be accomplished. Anodal and cathodal tDCS will be applied over the primary motor cortex (C3 - active and contralateral supra-orbital region - reference) and visual cortex (Oz - active and Cz - reference). Dual tDCS (anodal and cathodal - optimized protocol) will be applied on C3 - active and Oz - active. Electrical cortical activity will be assessed on 14 migraineurs through: (i) MEP; (ii) MT; (iii) SICI; (iv) ICF; (v) PT and (vi) visual evoked-potential (VEP-habituation). An interval of 48hs between sessions will be taken. The order of the sessions will be randomized and counterbalanced among volunteers by site www.randomization.com.</detailed_description>
