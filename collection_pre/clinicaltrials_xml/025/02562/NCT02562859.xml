	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the amount of GLPG1837 and metabolite present in the blood (relative bioavailability) after a single oral administration of 500 mg GLPG1837 given as an oral suspension under fasted conditions as well as a tablet formulation under fasted and fed conditions, in male healthy subjects. Also, the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of 500 mg GLPG1837 given as an oral suspension under fasted conditions as well as a tablet formulation under fasted and fed conditions, will be assessed. Twelve subjects will receive GLPG1837 on 3 occasions as single dose administrations: as an oral suspension fasted, as an oral tablet, fed and fasted. Treatment administrations will be separated by a wash-out period of at least 6 days.</brief_summary>
