	<brief_summary>This is a randomized Phase 3 study to determine whether treatment with vaccinia virus based immunotherapy (Pexa-Vec) followed by sorafenib increases survival compared to treatment with sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received prior systemic therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hepatocellular Carcinoma Study Comparing Vaccinia Virus Based Immunotherapy Plus Sorafenib vs Sorafenib Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study comparing Pexa Vec followed by sorafenib versus sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC without prior systemic therapy. A total of 600 patients will be randomly assigned to 2 treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio (300 in each arm) to reach at least 570 evaluable patients.</detailed_description>
