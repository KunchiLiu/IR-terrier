	<brief_title>Creation of an ECG Database in 3T MRI With Healthy Heart and Several Kind of Cardiac Disease.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ECG monitoring is an essential tool during MRI, especially for cardiac MRI (CMR). Indeed, the system needs to synchronize the acquisitions on the cardiac cycles. To identifiy the cycle, the system is based on the ECG. Furthermore, patients having a CMR can be at risk of presenting cardiac rhythm troubles, and must be monitored with a trustable system. The problem is that in MRI, a lot of artefacts occure, leading to dramatic disturbances of the signal. A lot of tools are used to try to remove the artefacts. The aim of this study is to create a database that can be used to test the different tools to remove the artefacts. We intend to include all types of ECG patterns that can exist, to allow to test the tools in all situations.</detailed_description>
