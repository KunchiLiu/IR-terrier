Typically, PCOS can identify during the early adolescence. Insulin resistance is a common finding in the obese women with PCOS.

Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a dermatosis characterized by velvety, papillomatous, brownish-black, hyperkeratotic plaques, typically of the intertriginous surfaces and neck. Although AN is associated with malignancy, the recognition of its more common connection to obesity and insulin resistance allows for diagnosis of related disorders including type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Significant improvements in ovulation and pregnancy rates as a result of clomiphene treatment after metformin in women with clomiphene-resistant PCOS were reported in a popular randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial . The first pharmacological approach to induction of ovulation in women with PCOS is clomiphene citrate</brief_summary>
