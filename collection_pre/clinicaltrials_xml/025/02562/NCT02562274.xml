	<detailed_description>At present, the novel cheap and effective intervention against menopause related symptoms such as memory impairment and osteoporosis is still required due to the increased breast cancer risk induced by hormone replacement therapy. Based on the role of oxidative stress on cognitive deficit in menopause and the synergistic effect of herbs in traditional folklore, the cognitive enhancing effects and anti-osteoporosis effects of the functional food containing the combined extract of herbs possessing antioxidant effect has gained attention. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effect of the herbal porridge containing the combined extract of mulberry and Vietnamese coriander (MP) on cognitive function and bone formation markers of menopausal women. Forty-five participants were randomly assigned to receive a placebo or MP (50, 1500 mg) treatments once daily for 8 weeks. The cognitive function and working memory were assessed via the auditory oddball paradigm of event-related potentials and computerized battery tests respectively prior to the intervention, 1 month, 2 month, and at delay 1 month. Bone formation markers including serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin were determine prior to the intervention and at the end of study.</detailed_description>
