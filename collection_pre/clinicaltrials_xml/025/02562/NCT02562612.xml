	<brief_title>Study of SM-88 in Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this clinical trial is to assess the response rate and PFS in previously treated breast cancer patients. Additional objectives include the pharmacokinetics of multiple ascending doses of SM-88, a cocktail combination of 4 drugs being developed for the indication of metastatic breast cancer. Secondary objectives of this study include an assessment of safety and tolerability of ascending doses of orally administered SM-88. Additional response data will also be collected.</detailed_description>

Must be able to swallow and retain oral medication. 7. Subjects must be willing to discontinue the use of any vitamins or herbal supplements seven days prior to the IMP dosing and not resume the use of these supplements until after PK sample is collected at 168h/Day 8. 1. Prior medical history of any illness or injury that, in the opinion of the principal investigator (PI), that may confound the results of the clinical trial or pose an additional risk to the subject by his participation in the clinical trial. 2.

Subjects should not have a history of lactose intolerance. 5. Concurrent use or known history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of SM 88. 6. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results at screening and/or baseline visit as determined by PI. 7. Participation in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to screening. 8. Surgery within 90 days prior to dosing determined by the PI to be clinically relevant. 9. Subjects must be considered medically healthy with no clinically significant medical history. 10. Subjects cannot be taking any concomitant medications. Subjects must be willing to discontinue the use of any vitamins or herbal supplements seven days prior to the dose date of the clinical trial and remain off these supplements until the last PK sample is obtained (168h/Day 8). 11. Positive urine drug screening. 12. Positive results at screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C antibodies (HCV).</criteria>
