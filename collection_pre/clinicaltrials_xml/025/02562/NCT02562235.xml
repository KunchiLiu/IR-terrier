	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of riociguat at age-, sex- and body-weight-adjusted doses of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.5 mg, 2.0 mg and 2.5 mg TID in children from ≥6 to less than 18 years with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) group 1. The study consists of two phases: titration phase up to 8 weeks and a maintenance phase up to 16 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Children aged ≥6 to &lt;18 years Diagnosed with PAH : Idiopathic (IPAH) Hereditable (HPAH) PAH associated with (APAH) Connective tissue disease Congenital heart disease with shunt closure more than 6 months ago (no open shunts, confirmed by RHC no less than 4 months after surgery) Diagnosis of PAH confirmed by right heart catheterization (RHC) at any time prior to enrolment (for patients with closed shunts RHC no less than 4 months after surgery) Pulmonary arterial hypertension confirmed by a RHC at any time prior to start of study, with mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPmean) ≥25 mmHg at rest, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) or left ventricular enddiastolic pressure (LVEDP) ≤15 mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) &gt;240 dyn•sec•cm5 (i.e., ≥3.0 wood units•m2) Patients must be on standard of care PAH medications, allowing Endothelin Receptor Antagonists (ERA) and/or Prostacyclin Analogues (PCA), for at least 12 weeks prior to baseline visit. Two groups of patients will be included: Prevalent: Patients currently on monotherapy who need additional treatment (discretion of the investigator) Incident: Treatment naïve patients initiated on PAH medication (allowing ERA and /or PCA) and then riociguat added once patinets are stable on standard of care WHO functional class IIII Adolescent females of childbearing potential can only be included in the study if a pregnancy test is negative. Adolescent females of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception when sexually active. 'Adequate contraception' is defined as any combination of at least 2 effective methods of birth control, of which at least one is a physical barrier (e.g. condoms with hormonal contraception or implants or combined oral contraceptives, certain intrauterine devices). Adequate contraception is required from the signing of the informed consent form up until 6 weeks after the last study drug administration. Young men must agree to use adequate contraception when sexually active. Written inform consent provided and if applicable child assent provided Concomitant use of the following medications: phosphodiesterase (PDE) 5 inhibitors (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) and nonspecific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors (theophylline, dipyridamole), nitrates or NO donors (such as amyl nitrite) in any form Pretreatment with NO donors (e.g. nitrates) within the last 2weeks before visit 1 Active state of hemoptysis or pulmonary hemorrhage, including those events managed by bronchial artery embolization or any history of bronchial artery embolization or massive hemoptysis within 3 months prior to screening Systolic blood pressure (SBP) more than 5 mmHg lower than the age, sex and heightadapted level of the 50th SBP percentile (NHBPEP, 2004) History of leftsided heart disease, including valvular disease or heart failure Pulmonary hypertension related to conditions other than specified in the inclusion criteria Pulmonary venoocclusive disease Screening aspartate transaminase (AST) and/ or alanine transaminase (ALT) more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) Severe restrictive lung disease Severe congenital abnormalities of the lung, thorax, and diaphragm Clinically relevant hepatic dysfunction (especially Child Pugh C) Renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m2 e.g. calculated based on Schwartz formula, for detailed calculation instructions PH associated with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (PHIIP)</criteria>
