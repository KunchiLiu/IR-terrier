	<brief_summary>Evaluation of the add-on effect on endothelial dysfunction of treatment of periodontitis in patients with chronic periodontitis and severe obstructive sleep apnea treated by CPAP. Patients with and without chronic periodontitis will be treated by CPAP for 20 weeks. At V2 (10 weeks), endothelial dysfunction will be assessed by the Reactive Hyperemia- Peripheral Artery Tone index. The endothelial dysfunction of the patients will be also assessed at V3 (20 weeks) after periodontitis treatment for the group of patients with chronic periodontitis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At V2, patients with periodontitis will have full-mouth intensive removal of denatl plaque biofilms with the use of scaling and root planing. The add-on effect of the periodontitis treatment on endothelial dysfunction will be assessed ten weeks later (V3) in comparison with V2 by taking into account with the effect of 10 weeks of CPAP in the control group with severe OSA but not periodontitis.</detailed_description>
