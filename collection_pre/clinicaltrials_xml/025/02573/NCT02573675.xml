	<detailed_description>This study is designed as an observational and retrospective cohort study, thus there will be no intervention or specified prescription. For the comparison of outcomes according to dialysis modality, we will adopt an intention-to-treat analysis, and consider the dialysis modality at day 90 to be the initial dialysis modality. However, the investigators will also regard the dialysis modality at day 30 as the initial dialysis modality in order to evaluate and compare earlier mortality.</detailed_description>
