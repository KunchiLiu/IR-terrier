	<brief_summary>Multicentre, prospective, double blinded, randomized study designed as an intrapatient comparison to evaluate the effects of the Biotronik Closed-loop Stimulation algorithm on prevalence and timing of haemodynamic variations and clinical prodromes induced by head-up tilt test in patients underwent pacemaker implantation for refractory cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Tilt Test-Induced REsponse in Closed-loop Stimulation (TIRECS) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 30 patients with refractory cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope receiving a Biotronik pacemaker with Closed-loop Stimulation (CLS) algorithm will be enrolled in the study. Two head-up tilt test (HUTT), one during DDD 60/min pacing with CLS algorith turned off (CLS-OFF) and the other during DDD-CLS pacing (CLS-ON), will be performed one week apart; patients will be randomly and blindly assigned to group A (n=15, first HUTT in CLS-ON mode) or B (n=15, first HUTT in CLS-OFF mode). During HUTT heart rate, blood pressure, and the incidence of clinical prodromes and syncope wil be recorded.</detailed_description>
