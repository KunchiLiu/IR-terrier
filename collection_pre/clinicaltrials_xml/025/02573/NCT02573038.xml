	<brief_summary>Angioid streaks are rare lesions associated to retinal pigment epithelium degenerations. They can be caused by general diseases as pseudoxanthoma elasticum, Paget's disease or drepanocytosis. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) represents the most frequent complication for those patients. It leads to a rapid and important loss of visual acuity. CNV in angioid streaks represent the fourth leading cause of CNV in young patients. CNV in angioid streaks is treated at the moment with off-label anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) therapy and could also benefit from aflibercept (EYLEA), a new anti-VEGF currently indicated in AMD. Case reports suggest that such patients would not need as many injections as in AMD. ASTRID is an open-label, single arm, prospective, multicenter, phase II study. The main objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness in clinical terms after 52 weeks of treatment with aflibercept on the visual acuity of patients affected by CNV in angioid streaks. A specific dosage regimen is designed to achieve maximum efficiency. The patients are followed on a monthly basis until 52 weeks. Six injections are mandatory, the other ones are injected only in case of active CNV.</brief_summary>
