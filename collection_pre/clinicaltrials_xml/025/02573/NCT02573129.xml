	<brief_title>The Lean Meats Mediterranean Diet Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subjects will complete an 18-wk randomized crossover study. Following a 2-wk baseline testing period to assess cardiometabolic and emotional well-being and habitual diet, subjects will consume a Mediterranean-style, weight-maintenance diet that is either restricted or rich in lean, minimally processed red meat for 5 weeks. Following a 4-wk washout period and second 2-wk baseline testing, subjects will consume the Mediterranean Diet with the alternate predominant animal protein sources for 5 weeks. Cardiometabolic and emotional well-being will be assessed during baseline and post periods.</detailed_description>
