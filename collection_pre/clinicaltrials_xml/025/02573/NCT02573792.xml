	<brief_summary>Optic neuritis (ON) can remain isolated or reveal a widespread and chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS), a multiple sclerosis (MS) or, more rarely, a Devic's neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or a systemic disease. The optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a retinal imaging technique to measure the thickness of the retina and its different layers with an accuracy of 4-6 µM. Costello et al have shown that approximately 75% of 54 MS patients have developed within 3 to 6 months after a ON a loss of 10 to 40 µM in the thickness of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). The etiologic diagnosis of ON has been transformed in recent years. MS can now be diagnosed by McDonald's MRI criteria and NMO by the AQP4 antibodies (anti-aquaporin- 4) antibodies and the anti-MOG (myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) antibodies. The diagnosis and prognosis value of the OCT in patients with ON is not well known</brief_summary>
