	<brief_summary>To demonstrate that the use of Standard @IFE and Planning@IFE features of the IFE software, compared to the current method, when planning and inserting the needle under MRI monitoring in the context of liver biopsies enable: - a facilitation of the planning stages of the procedure (route path, marking of the entry point and alignment of the MRI cutaways on the planned path), resulting in a reduction in the duration of the planning stages, - a facilitation of the real-time modification of MRI cutaways during the procedure, resulting in a reduction of the duration of the procedure</brief_summary>
