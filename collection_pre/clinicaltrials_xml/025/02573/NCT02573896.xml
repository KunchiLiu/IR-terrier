	<detailed_description>This NANT trial will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of autologous expanded natural killer (NK) cells when combined with standard dosing of ch14.18 and will assess the feasibility of adding lenalidomide at the recommended Phase II dose of the expanded NK cells with ch14.18, for treatment of children with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma. Ch14.18 is a chimeric antibody against GD2, which is expressed on a majority of neuroblastoma cells. It has been shown to increase EFS and OS in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma when given after autologous stem cell transplant in combination with subcutaneous GM-CSF and intravenous IL-2, followed by isotretinoin. Lenalidomide has been studied in children with solid tumors and can safely be given to patients based on 2 prior trials in children. It was also shown to have immunomodulatory effects and is synergistic with ch14.18. Lenalidomide is also an oral agent that can be given in the outpatient setting. Natural killer cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that have the ability to recognize and kill malignant cells, including neuroblastoma. Ch14.18 and lenalidomide both exert part of their anti-cancer effect through the activation of natural killer cells. Patients are being given in combination in NANT 2011-04 where the safety and immunomodulatory effect has been established in that study at the dose level proposed in this study. Natural killer cells are dysfunctional and low in number in many cancer patients, and number and function are further suppressed by chemotherapy and radiation. Investigators hypothesize that autologous NK cells can be expanded and activated ex vivo and readministered to restore number and function, and in combination with lenalidomide and ch14.18 will provide an anti-tumor effect in patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. Investigators will determine the feasibility of centralized expansion, cryopreservation, and distribution of autologous NK cells. Investigators will then determine the maximum tolerated dose by assessing the toxicities of autologous expanded NK cells given with ch14.18; by assessing the toxicities, cytokinetics and immunomodulatory effects, Investigators will select the recommended Phase II dose of the two-agent combination after dose escalation of the NK cells and then adding lenalidomide to the combination to establish the three-agent combination. Cytokinetics (persistence of infused NK cells) and immune function studies will be required for all patients entered on this study. In addition to routine assessment of response, quantification of rare tumor cell detection in blood and bone marrow using TLDA will also provide another measure of possible anti-tumor efficacy to support the rationale for the final schedule chosen.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma either by histologic verification of neuroblastoma and/or demonstration of tumor cells in the bone marrow with increased urinary catecholamines. Patients must have a history of highrisk neuroblastoma according to COG risk classification at the time of study registration. Patients who were initially considered low or intermediaterisk, but then reclassified as highrisk are also eligible. Patients must have at least ONE of the following: 1. Recurrent/progressive disease at any time prior to study enrollment 2. Refractory disease 3. Persistent disease Patients must have at least ONE of the following (lesions may have received prior radiation therapy as long as they meet the other criteria listed below): 1. For recurrent/progressive or refractory disease, at least one MIBG avid bone site. 2. For persistent disease, If a patient has only 1 or 2 MIBG avid lesions AND a Curie Score of 12, then biopsy confirmation of neuroblastoma and/or ganglioneuroblastoma in at least one site present at the time of enrollment (bone marrow, bone, or soft tissue) is required to be obtained at any time point prior to enrollment. 3. FDGPET avid tumors: A biopsy confirmation of neuroblastoma and/or ganglioneuroblastoma is required at any time prior to enrollment OR anatomical imaging is required at the time of enrollment consistent with a bone metastasis for at least one FDGavid bone site. Any amount of neuroblastoma tumor cells in the bone marrow done at the time of study enrollment based on routine morphology with or without immunocytochemistry in at least one sample from bilateral aspirates and biopsies. At least one soft tissue lesion that meets criteria for a TARGET lesion as defined by: 1. SIZE: Lesion can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with a longest diameter ≥ 10 mm, or for lymph nodes ≥ 15 mm on short axis. 2. In addition to measurable size, a lesion needs to meet the following criteria: 1. MIBG avid. For patients with persistent disease only: If a patient has only 1 or 2 MIBG avid lesions ANDa Curie Score of 1 2, then biopsy confirmation of neuroblastoma and/or ganglioneuroblastoma in at least one site present at time of enrollment is required to be obtained. 2. MIBG non avid tumors: These patients require a biopsy done at any time prior to enrollment confirming neuroblastoma and/or ganglioneuroblastoma in at least one soft tissue site (even if FDGPET avid) present at the time of enrollment. At least one nontarget soft tissue lesion that is not measurable, but had a biopsy positive for neuroblastoma and/or ganglioneuroblastom or is MIBG avid at any time prior to enrollment. Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks and a Lansky (≤16 years) or Karnofsky (&gt;16 years) score of at least 50. Prior Therapy 1.
