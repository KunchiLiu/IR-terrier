	<brief_summary>Continous infusion of nor adrenaline + albumin Continous infusion of terlipressin + albumin Response will assessed at every 48 hour (i) Complete response: Decrease in serum creatinine to 133 lmol/L (1.5 mg/dL). (ii) Partial response: 50% serum creatinine decrease from baseline to a final value &gt;133 lmol/L (&gt;1.5 mg/dL). (iii) No response: Serum creatinine decrease of &lt; 50% from baseline Treatment will be extended until reversal of HRS (decrease in creatinine below 1.5 mg/dL) or for a maximum of 7 days after rescue treatment will be followed. If intolerant to terlipressin, excluded from study and rescue treatment will be given in form of noradrenaline or octreotide and midodrine.</brief_summary>
