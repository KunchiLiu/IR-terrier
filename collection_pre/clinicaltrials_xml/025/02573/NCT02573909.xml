	<brief_summary>There are conflicting results in earlier studies concerning the safety and efficacy of epidural oxycodone. In a study by BÃ¤cklund and colleagues, epidural oxycodone was as effective as intravenous oxycodone, so they did not recommend epidural use of oxycodone. In another study, Yanagidate and Dohi reported that oxycodone was as effective in pain treatment with double dose compared to epidural morphine. In our previous study, epidural oxycodone provided safe and effective pain relief when compared to intravenous oxycodone. In the present study, the aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of epidural or intravenous oxycodone in patients undergoing elective gynecological surgery with planned epidural pain treatment.</brief_summary>
