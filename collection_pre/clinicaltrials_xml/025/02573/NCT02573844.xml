	<detailed_description>This is a phase IV, double- blind, randomized, placebo controlled, moncentric study. Males and women over 18 y.o. with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosed applying Rome III criteria will be enrolled consecutively. The study consist of 4 periods: - A screening's period of 2 weeks starting from visit 1, useful to screen potentially eligible patients performing diagnostic investigations necessary to confirm disgnosis. - A run- in's period, starting from visit 2 and lasting 2 weeks will represent a baseline without specific treatments in order to characterize the severity of symptomatology and evaluate patients' compliance relative to daily diaries - A 2 weeks- treatment's period ( active/ placebo) starting from visit 3. The 1st day of the period of treatment, eligible patients will be randomized following a 1:1 ratio to receive Proklama ( 1 sachet/ day) or placebo. Treatments will be administred daily during the whole 2 weeks- treatment's period. - A wash out's period lasting 2 weeks starting from visit 4, to be performed the day after the end of the 2 weeks- treatment's period. - A 2 weeks- treatment's period ( placebo/ active) starting from visit 5, to be performed the last day of wash out's period. During this visit patients will receive the second treatment, following a crossover design.</detailed_description>
