	<brief_title>Evaluation of Dupilumab's Effects on Airway Inflammation in Patients With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The total study duration for each patient is between approximately 29 and maximum of 30 weeks, consisting of a screening period of 5 weeks and optional up to 7 additional days, a treatment period of 12 weeks, and a post-treatment period of 12 weeks. Patients who complete the treatment period may be eligible to participate in an open-label extension study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Male and female adults with a physician diagnosis of persistent asthma for ≥12 months. Existing treatment with medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids in combination with a longacting beta agonist for at least 3 months with a stable dose ≥1 month prior to Visit 1 (Screening Visit). Treatment with a third asthma controller for at least 3 months with a stable dose ≥1 month prior to Visit 1 is allowed. Prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume (FEV1) 55 to 85% of predicted normal. Exclusion criteria: Patients &lt;18 years or &gt;65 years. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) &lt;26 ppb at Visit 1 (Screening Visit). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other lung diseases (eg, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [ChurgStrauss Syndrome]) which may impair lung function. A patient who experiences an asthma exacerbation that results in emergency treatment, hospitalization due to asthma, or treatment with systemic steroids at any time from 1 month prior to Visit 1. A patient who has experienced an upper or lower respiratory tract infection within the 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Evidence of lung disease(s) other than asthma. Previous smoker (smoking history &gt;10 packyears) or current smoker (within 6 months prior to Visit 1). Comorbid disease that might interfere with the evaluation of investigational medicinal product or conduct of study procedures (eg, bronchoscopy). Antiimmunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy (omalizumab) or any other biologic therapy within 6 months of Visit 1. Exposure to another investigative study medication within a time period prior to Visit 1 that is less than 5 halflives of the study medication. Treatment with systemic (oral or injectable) corticosteroids within 28 days of Visit 1. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
