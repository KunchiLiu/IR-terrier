	<brief_summary>This is a phase I, randomised, placebo-controlled 2-part study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AZD8871 delivered by inhalation, in asthmatic and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Two-part Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacodynamic and -Kinetic Study of Inhaled AZD8871 in Asthmatic and COPD Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an integrated Phase I protocol divided into 2 parts. Part 1: single ascending dose study (6 AZD8871 dose levels) in 16 male subjects with mild asthma. AZD8871 will be administered (by the Genuair® inhaler) under supervision at the study centre, according to the randomisation scheme Part 2: a 5 treatment period single dose study (of AZD8871 [two doses], indacaterol, tiotropium and placebo) in 40 male and non-childbearing female subjects with moderate to severe COPD. Each treatment period will be separated by a washout period of at least 7 days. The primary comparison for bronchodilation will be between AZD8871 doses and placebo.</detailed_description>
