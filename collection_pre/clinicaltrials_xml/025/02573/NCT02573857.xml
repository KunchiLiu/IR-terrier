	<brief_summary>Part A -Cohort 1 DSM265 will be administered as a single dose (400 mg). For cohort 1 only, an additional single dose (400 mg) of DSM265 may be given if gametocytemia develops. Treatment with DSM265 will be given after an overnight fasting period of ≥ 8 hours. If dosing is to occur in the evening, subjects will be required to fast for ≥4 hours prior to receiving treatment. Subjects will be required to fast for a further four hours anytime after dosing with DSM265. Part B - Cohort 2 OZ439 will be administered as a single 200 mg dose. If recrudescence is observed, a single 400 mg dose of OZ439 will be given. Treatment with OZ439 will be administered after an overnight fasting period of ≥ 6 hours. If dosing is to occur in the evening, subjects will be required to fast for ≥4 hours prior to receiving treatment. Participants will drink 200 mL of milk prior to drug administration, and then swallow the appropriate volume of OZ439 suspension. Subjects will be required to fast for a further six hours anytime after dosing with OZ439. - Cohort 3 DSM265 will be administered as a single dose (400 mg) as described for cohort 1. No additional dose will be administered.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Characterise the Antimalarial and Transmission Blocking Activity of a Single Dose of DSM265 or OZ439 in Healthy Subjects With Induced Blood Stage Plasmodium Falciparum or Plasmodium Vivax Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-centre, open label study using induced blood stage malaria (IBSM) infection to assess the effectiveness of the investigational drugs DSM265 or OZ439 in reducing parasitemia. Transmission blocking activity of DSM265 (in P. falciparum infection; cohort 1 only) and infectivity to vector mosquitoes prior to drug treatment (in P. vivax infection; cohort 2 and 3) will also be assessed. This study will be conducted in up to three cohorts (n = 8 per cohort), and will be divided into 2 parts. In Part A (cohort 1) the efficacy of a single administration of 400 mg DSM265 for the clearance of asexual blood stages of P. falciparum will be determined. Activity of a second single dose of 400 mg DSM265 against gametocytes will be assessed in this cohort only if sexual stages are identified by PCR following the initial drug treatment. In Part B, subjects will be infected with P. vivax by IBSM, then treated with a single 200 mg dose OZ439 (cohort 2) or 400 mg dose of DSM265 (cohort 3). For cohort 2, if recrudescence occurs following initial drug treatment with 200 mg OZ439, then affected participants who reach the treatment threshold will receive a single 400 mg dose of OZ439. The PK/PD relationship following drug treatment will be determined in order to further characterize the antimalarial activity of the investigational drug in the IBSM system using P. falciparum (for cohort 1; 400 mg DSM265) or P. vivax (for cohort 2, 200 mg OZ439; cohort 3, 400 mg DSM265). The treatment effects on gametocytemia (if sexual blood stages are detected by PCR) and transmission blocking activity of DSM265 will be investigated as a secondary objective for cohort 1 (P. falciparum infection). Prior to drug treatment, the infectivity of P. vivax IBSM infection to vector mosquitoes will also be investigated as a secondary objective for Part B, cohorts 2 and 3. The exposures achieved with the doses proposed for DSM265 used in Part A and DSM265 or OZ439 in Part B are associated with a safety profile which is well described from previous studies and significantly below the maximum tolerated exposures reported for either drug.</detailed_description>

More specifically for serum creatinine, hepatic transaminase enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase), and total bilirubin (unless the Participant has documented Gilbert syndrome) should not exceed the upper laboratory norm and haemoglobin must be equal or higher than the lower limit of the normal range As there is the risk of adverse effects of the investigational drugs (DSM265 and OZ439), and standard curative treatment (Riamet and primaquine cohort 1 only) in pregnancy, it is important that any participants involved in this study do not get pregnant or get their female partners pregnant (refer to Section 6.7). For cohort 1 and 3 (treatment with DSM265): Female participants of childbearing potential (WOCBP) may be enrolled in the DSM265 cohorts but must have adequate contraception in place for the duration of the study and up to 60 days (9 weeks) after the last dose of DSM265, with adequate contraception defined as: Stable hormonal contraception (with an approved oral, transdermal or depot regimen) for at least 3 months prior to screening i.e. oral contraceptives, either combined or progestogen alone, hormonal implantable contraception, vaginal ring, contraceptive patches Intrauterine (IUD) device or system in place for at least 3 months prior to screening Male partner sterilization prior to the female participant's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that participant Abstinent female participants must agree to start a double method if they start a sexual relationship during the study and for up to 60 days (9 weeks) following the last dose of DSM265. Male participants to be dosed with DSM265 in cohort 1 or 3 must agree to use a double method of contraception including condom plus diaphragm or condom plus stable oral/transdermal/injectable hormonal contraceptive by female partner from at least 14 days prior to the time of the dose of the study drug through 120 days (17 weeks) after the last dose of DSM265.

For cohort 2 (treatment with OZ439): Female subjects must be considered as women of not childbearing potential (WONCBP) to be eligible. WONCBP is defined as: Spontaneous amenorrhoea for at least 1 year or spontaneous amenorrhea for at least 6 months confirmed by an FSH result above the laboratory defined range for postmenopausal or permanently sterilised (eg tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy) Female subjects with same sex partners (abstinence from penilevaginal intercourse), are eligible when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle. Male participants to be dosed with OZ439 in cohort 2 must agree to use a double method of contraception including condom plus diaphragm or condom plus stable oral/transdermal/injectable hormonal contraceptive by female partner from at least 14 days prior to the time of the dose of the study drug through 96 days (14 weeks) after the last dose of OZ439.
