	<brief_summary>Batefenterol inhalation powder is currently under development as a fixed-dose combination with fluticasone furoate (FF) for the treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The present study will administer batefenterol/FF (300/100 micrograms [mcg]) for the first time to subjects with COPD, to investigate the safety and tolerability of the combination compared with placebo, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles of the individual components when administered in combination. This is a Phase IIa, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study. Subjects will be randomized (2:1) to one of the following double-blind treatment groups: Batefenterol/FF 300/100 mcg inhalation powder once daily, or matching placebo inhalation powder once daily. Subjects will self-administer the study treatments once daily (QD) in the morning for 42 days via a multi-dose dry powder inhaler (DPI) which contains two blister strips. Additionally, an inhaled short acting beta2-receptor agonist, albuterol will be provided from screening to the end of the treatment period for all subjects to use as needed to relieve COPD symptoms. At the end of the treatment period, subjects can resume conventional therapy. The study will randomize approximately 60 subjects. The total duration of subject participation (from screening to follow-up) will be approximately 8 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Type of subject: Outpatient. Informed Consent: Capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes compliance with prespecified requirements and restrictions. Age and gender: Male and female subjects, 40 years of age or older at the time of signing the informed consent, are eligible to participate in the study. Female subject: is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: 1. Nonreproductive potential defined as: Premenopausal females with one of the following: documented tubal ligation; documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion; hysterectomy; documented bilateral oophorectomy Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. 2. Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed below 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until at least five terminal halflives OR until any continuing pharmacologic effect has ended, whichever is longer after the last dose of study medication and completion of the followup visit. This list does not apply to females of reproductive potential with same sex partners, when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle or for subjects who are and will continue to be abstinent from penilevaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis: Contraceptive subdermal implant that meets the standard operating procedure (SOP) effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the SOP effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone Injectable progestogen Contraceptive vaginal ring Percutaneous contraceptive patches Male partner sterilization with documentation of azoospermia prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society. COPD Disease severity: A postalbuterol forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of =&lt;0.70 and a postalbuterol FEV1 &gt;=30 and =&lt;80% of predicted normal values calculated using the European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative reference equations at Visit 1. Smoking history: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette smoking of &gt;= 10 packyears at Visit 1. Former smokers are defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked (for example, 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years both equal 10 packyears). Note: Pipe and cigar use cannot be used to calculate packyear history. Asthma: A current diagnosis of asthma (Subjects with a prior history of asthma are eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD). Other Respiratory Disorders: Known alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency, active lung infections (such as tuberculosis), and lung cancer are absolute exclusionary conditions. Other excluded conditions include and not limited to clinically significant bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension unrelated to COPD, sarcoidosis, or interstitial lung disease. Or a subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, has any other significant respiratory conditions in addition to COPD Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or hematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled and/or a previous history of cancer in remission for &lt;5 years prior to Visit 1 (localized carcinoma of the skin that has been resected for cure is not exclusionary). Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. Poorly controlled COPD: defined as the occurrence of 'acute worsening of COPD that is managed with corticosteroid and/or antibiotics or that requires treatment prescribed by a physician in the 6 weeks prior to Screening (Visit 1)', or 'subjects who are hospitalized due to acute worsening of COPD within 12 weeks of Visit 1'. History of COPD exacerbation: subject who have had more than one exacerbation (moderate or severe) within the 12 months prior to Visit 1. Pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection: Subjects with lower respiratory tract infection that required the use of antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1; or subjects hospitalized due to pneumonia within 12 weeks of Visit 1. Use of longterm oxygen therapy (LTOT): Oxygen therapy prescribed for greater than 12 hours a day. Asneeded oxygen use (that is, =&lt;12 hours per day) is not exclusionary. Nebulized Therapy: Regular use (prescribed for use every day, not for asneeded use) of shortacting bronchodilators (for example, albuterol) via nebulized therapy. Lung Resection: Lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior to Visit 1. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding at Visit 1. Liver Disease: Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).
