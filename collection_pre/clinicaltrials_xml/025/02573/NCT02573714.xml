	<brief_title>Sub-dissociative Intranasal Ketamine for Pediatric Sickle Cell Pain Crises</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, drug trial using sub-dissociative intranasal ketamine as an adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy for the management of pediatric sickle cell disease vasoocclusive pain crises in resource-poor settings. Pediatric patients will be enrolled at a teaching and referral hospital in West Africa. Patients will be randomly assigned to the treatment arm - standard therapy plus sub-dissociative intranasal ketamine (1 mg/kg) given at time zero) or the control arm - standard therapy plus intranasal normal saline (volume-matched to treatment arm), and patients will evaluated at standard intervals to assess for pain scores and vital signs (0 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and 120 minutes). Pain will be assessed using the Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R). Patients will also be observed for any potential side effects or adverse events. All patients will be contacted 2-3 weeks post intranasal medication administration for over-the-phone follow-up using a portion of the PedsQL-SCD questionnaire, to assess for basic quality of life related to pain management and treatment.</detailed_description>
