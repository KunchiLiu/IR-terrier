	<brief_summary>This study seeks to determine whether the addition of ABT-414 to concomitant radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) prolongs progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in participants with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification. In addition, this is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter sub-study to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of ABT-414 in subjects with newly diagnosed EGFR-amplified GBM who have mild or moderate hepatic impairment.</brief_summary>
