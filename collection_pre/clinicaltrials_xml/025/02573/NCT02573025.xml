Exceptions are paracetamol, the contraceptive pill, hormone replacement therapy and commonly used vitamin supplements, which are permitted Regular smoking with consumption of more than 10 cigarettes per day or an equivalent amount of tobacco Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 3 months prior to the first dosing</criteria>
