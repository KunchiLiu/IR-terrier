	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Pharmacokinetic parameters of JNJ-63623872 in combination with oseltamivir in elderly participants (aged 65 to &lt;= 85 years) compared to adults (aged 18 to &lt;= 64 years) with influenza A infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Antiviral Activity of JNJ-63623872 in Combination With Oseltamivir in Adult, and Elderly Hospitalized Participants With Influenza A Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving), placebo-controlled, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study to evaluate the effect of JNJ-63623872 in combination with oseltamivir in participants with influenza A infection. The study consists of 3 Phases: Screening visit (1 Day), participants who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive study drug in double-blind treatment Phase (7 Days) and follow up Phase (21 Days). The duration of participation in the study for each participant is approximately 28 Days. Primarily Pharmacokinetic parameters of JNJ-63623872 will be measured. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
