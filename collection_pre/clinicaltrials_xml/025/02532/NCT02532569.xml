	<brief_summary>A multi-center, open, phase 4 clinical trial to assess the long-term immunogenicity and safety of fourth administration of Boryung Cell-Culture Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine inj. and to conduct an exploratory investigation on vaccine interchangeability in Korean children aged 6 years who received primary 3 doses with ENCEVAC® or Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine-GCC® inj.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Immunogenicity and Safety of Fourth Administration of Boryung Cell-Culture Japanese Encephalitis Vaccineinj</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a follow-up study of KD287-BR-CT-301 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01150942), a phase 3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of a cell-culture Japanese encephalitis vaccine (ENCEVAC®) compared with that of a mouse brain-derived Japanese encephalitis vaccine (Japanese Encephalitis vaccine-GCC® inj). Subjects participated in KD287-BR-CT-301 study were to receive 3 doses of Japanese encephalitis vaccine (JEV) assigned by randomization from the age of 12 months and those subjects who completed the 3 doses of JEV are the target population in this study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the long-term immunogenicity and safety of the booster (fourth) dose of JEV, which will be given as Boryung Cell-Culture Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine inj, proven to be same with ENCEVAC® but manufactured by a different manufacturer.</detailed_description>

Children who have had fever (≥ 40 °C) or systemic allergy within 48 hours after vaccination. Children who have shown anaphylactic reaction to the investigational products administered in the KD287BRCT301study or who are likely to be allergic to the ingredients of the investigational product. Children who have been diagnosed with immunodeficiency such as acquired immune deficiency or who have family history of immunodeficiency. Children who have received other vaccines within 28 days before booster dosing of JEV (vaccines to be administered according to the national vaccination program. Children who have received immunosuppressive therapy within 28 days before booster dosing of JEV. There is a possibility that immune globulin preparations has not been excreted enough on the day of booster dosing of JEV if children have received such a product. Children who are currently participating or planning to participate in other clinical studies during the study period.
