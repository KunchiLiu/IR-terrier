	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if opdivo (nivolumab) can help to control Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The safety of nivolumab will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in Remission at High Risk for Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle is 28 days. If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will receive nivolumab by vein over about 1 hour on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle. After Cycle 6, participant may receive nivolumab 1 time each month. After participant has been on study for about 1 year, they may receive the study drug 1 time every 3 months. If during this time, the disease appears to get worse, participant may go back to receiving the study drug on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle. The study doctor will discuss this with participant. On Day 1 of Cycle 1, participant will stay in the clinic for up to 2 hours after the end of their infusion so the study staff can check on their health. After that, participant will stay in the clinic for about 1 hour after the end of their infusion. Study Visits: One (1) time each week during Cycle 1, one time during Cycles 2 and 3, and then every 8-12 weeks after that until Cycle 6, participant will have a physical exam. If participant continues therapy after Cycle 6, they will have a physical exam every 2-3 months. One (1) time each week during Cycle 1, every 2 weeks during Cycles 2 and 3, and then 1 time during each cycle after that, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. These tests may be done more often if participant's doctor thinks it is needed. On Day 28 of Cycles 1, 3, and 5 and then one time every 3 months after that, participant will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease and for cytogenetic testing. Length of Study: Participant may continue receiving the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in their best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions. Patient's participation on this study will be over after they have completed the End-of-Treatment Visit. End-of-Treatment Visit: Within 30 days after participant's last dose of study drug: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - If it has not been done within the last 6 weeks and the doctor thinks it is possible, participant will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the status of the disease and for cytogenetic testing. If participant cannot come to the clinic for the End-of-Treatment visit, they will be called by the study staff and asked about their health. This call should last about 5-10 minutes. This is an investigational study. Nivolumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of melanoma. It is considered investigational to use nivolumab to treat AML. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with AML in remission (defined as CR, CR with incomplete platelet recovery CRp, CR with incomplete hematologic recovery CRi, or partial remission defined as a bone marrow with &lt;10% blasts after therapy with or without hematologic recovery). 2. High risk for relapse defined as: 1st CR with high risk features for relapse (including history of prior malignancy treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or history of myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorder, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, MDS/MPN or other hematologic malignancy thought to have evolved to AML [i.e., secondary AML, sAML]; high risk cytogenetics at diagnosis; FLT3 mutated at diagnosis; or presence or minimal residual disease assessed by PCR, cytogenetics, and/or flow cytometry at time of enrollment) 2nd CR regardless of disease characteristics at the time of diagnosis. 3. Have received induction chemotherapy and at least one cycle of consolidation chemotherapy. Patients should have achieved a CR within 12 months of enrollment onto protocol. 4. No further chemotherapy or SCT planned at the time of enrollment. 5. Age 18 years or older. 6. Adequate organ function: creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN; serum bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN; AST and ALT &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN. 7. ECOG performance status &lt;/= 2 8. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (bhCG) pregnancy test result within 24 hours prior to the first dose of treatment and must agree to use an effective contraception method during the study and for 23 weeks after the last dose of the study drug. Females of non childbearing potential are those who are postmenopausal greater than 1 year or who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy. 9. Males who have partners of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective contraceptive method during the study and for 31 weeks following the last dose of study drug 10. Patients or their legally authorized representative must provide written informed consent. 1. History of another primary invasive malignancy that has not been definitively treated or in remission for at least 2 years. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancers or with carcinomas in situ are eligible regardless of the time from diagnosis (including concomitant diagnoses). 2. Any major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, experimental therapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of the study drugs. 3. Patients with any other known concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes; cardiovascular disease including congestive heart failure NYHA Class III or IV, myocardial infarction within 6 months, and poorly controlled hypertension; chronic renal failure; or active uncontrolled infection) which, in the opinion of the investigator could compromise participation in the study. 4. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol. 5. Patients who are on steroids (&gt; 10 mg/day or equivalent) or immune suppression medications. 6. Patients with autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis]). 7. Patients with a history of Inflammatory Bowel Disease such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 8. Patients known to be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen expression or with active hepatitis C infection (positive by polymerase chain reaction or on antiviral therapy for hepatitis C within the last 6 months), or with known HIV infection. 9. Current therapy with other systemic antineoplastic or antineoplastic investigational agents. 10. Females who are pregnant or lactating 11. Patients with history of previous immunomodulatory therapy.(not including lenalidomide or thalidomide).</criteria>
