	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective multicenter evaluation of the performance of the InterGraft System for anastomosis of a hemodialysis graft. The InterGraft System includes an arterial InterGraft (AIG) connector and a venous InterGraft (VIG) connector used with a standard arterial-venous (AV) graft. The study is intended to demonstrate that the 6 month cumulative patency of grafts connected with the InterGraft Connectors is similar to that of grafts connected using standard sutured anastomoses. In addition, the study will also include a separate cohort of up to 25 subjects in whom the VIG is used for the venous anastomosis, together with a standard sutured arterial anastomosis, in situations where the target artery is not suitable for use of the AIG.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of a Vascular Anastomotic Connector System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pivotal multicenter, prospective, non-randomized adaptive design study. The planned study enrollment is a minimum of 104 evaluable subjects who require AV graft placement for hemodialysis and who meet the entry criteria. However, the study will allow for a maximum enrollment of 252 subjects, including up to 185 evaluable subjects, up to 30 roll-in cases, up to 25 subjects in a separate cohort study (described below), and a provision for 12 subjects lost to follow-up. Roll-in cases will not be included in the primary analysis, but will be analyzed separately. This maximum number of subjects allows for an upward adjustment in sample size, if warranted, based on a pre-specified midpoint evaluation of the primary endpoint. Additional subjects may be enrolled up to a maximum of 185 evaluable subjects after review of interim analysis results. In addition to the main study, a separate study cohort may enroll up to 25 subjects in whom the VIG is used for the venous anastomosis, together with a standard sutured arterial anastomosis. Such subjects may be identified based on pre-surgery imaging or at the time of the surgery (e.g., cases in which the subject meets the initial inclusion criteria, but the target artery is determined to be unsuitable for anastomosis with the AIG at the time of surgery). Data from this cohort will not be included in the primary analysis, but will be analyzed separately. The study will include up to 15 participating clinical centers. Study site investigators will be physicians skilled in AV access graft placement and interventional techniques. Study data will be collected up to the point at which each subject has completed the 6 month endpoint.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject is ≥ 18 years of age. 2. Subject requires the creation of a vascular access graft for hemodialysis, secondary to a diagnosis of End Stage Renal Disease. 3. Subject is able to have the vascular access graft placed in an upper extremity. 4. Baseline imaging shows suitable vascular anatomy/vessel sizes for the InterGraft Connectors; OR Baseline imaging shows suitable vascular anatomy/ vessel size for the Venous InterGraft Connector and unsuitable or indeterminant anatomy/vessel size for the Arterial InterGraft Connector, and a suitable artery for a sutured anastomosis. NOTE: Such subjects may be included in a separate study cohort of up to 25 total subjects, if all other selection criteria are met. 5. Subject has a reasonable expectation of remaining on hemodialysis for at least 6 months. 6. Subject or his/her legal guardian understands the study and is willing and able to comply with the dialysis schedule and followup requirements. 7. Subject or his/her legal guardian provides written informed consent. 8. Physician's examination at time of surgery shows no significant vessel lesions, calcification(s), anatomic structures or abnormalities that may limit ability to safely deploy the InterGraft Connectors [Main study]; OR Physician's examination at time of surgery shows no significant vessel lesions, calcification(s), anatomic structures or abnormalities that may limit ability to safely deploy the Venous InterGraft Connector, and physician's examination shows that the target artery is not suitable for use of the Arterial InterGraft Connector, and the target artery is suitable for a sutured anastomosis. NOTE: Such subjects may be included in a separate study cohort of up to 25 total subjects if all other selection criteria are met. 1. Subject has a documented and unsuccessfully treated ipsilateral central venous stenosis as determined by imaging. 2. Subject currently has a known or suspected systemic infection. 3. Subject has a known hypercoagulable or bleeding disorder or requires treatment with warfarin or heparin. 4. Subject has had a previous instance of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia type 2 (HIT2) or has known sensitivity to heparin. 5. Subject has comorbid conditions that may limit their ability to comply with study and followup requirements. 6. The patient has had &gt;2 previous arteriovenous accesses in treatment arm. 7. Subject is currently taking Aggrenox®. 8. Subject is in need of, or is scheduled for any major surgery within 30 days of the study procedure. 9. Subject is currently taking maintenance immunosuppressant medication such as rapamycin, mycophenolate or mycophenolic acid, prednisone (&gt;10 mg), cyclosporine, tacrolimus or cyclophosphamide. 10. Life expectancy is less than 12 months. 11. Subject is pregnant. NOTE: A negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours of the study procedure is required in all female subjects with reproductive capacity. 12. Subject is a poor compliance risk (i.e. history of IV or oral drug abuse). 13. The subject is enrolled in another dialysis or vascular investigational study.</criteria>
