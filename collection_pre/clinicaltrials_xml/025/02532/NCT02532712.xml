	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and PK of EC-18 After Oral Administration in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In vitro and in vivo efficacy studies and clinical trials have shown that EC-18 has a mode of action of improving neutropenia by promoting neutrophil production from hematopoietic stem cells and at the same time, efficiently controlling STAT6/Complement 3(C3), suggesting its potential to be developed as an orally administered new drug for treatment of neutropenia resulting from decreased neutrophils caused by administration of an anticancer agent. This study is a Dose block-randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Single and Multiple Ascending Dose Escalation, Phase I clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-dose and multiple-dose oral administration of the investigational product, EC-18 (study drug) in healthy adult male volunteers.</detailed_description>
