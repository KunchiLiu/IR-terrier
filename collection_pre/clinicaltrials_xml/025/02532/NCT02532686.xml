	<brief_summary>Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia has limitations such as residual positive and negative symptoms, cognitive deficits and intolerable side effects. Refractory schizophrenia is still a difficult clinical issue at present. According to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) hypothesis, adjuvant NMDA-enhancing agents may have therapeutic benefit. DAAOI-2, a D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) inhibitor, is a NMDA-enhancing agent. The aim of this project is to examine the effectiveness and safety of DAAOI-2 add-on treatment for treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia has limitations such as residual positive and negative symptoms, cognitive deficits and intolerable side effects. Refractory schizophrenia is still a difficult clinical issue at present. According to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) hypothesis, many clinical trials on NMDA-enhancing agents were studied. Adjuvant NMDA-enhancing agents, including glycine, D-amino acids such as D-serine, and sarcosine (a glycine transporter I inhibitor), revealed beneficial but limited efficacy for positive and negative symptoms. The aim of this project is to examine the effectiveness and safety of DAAOI-2 add-on treatment for treatment resistant schizophrenia patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo - controlled trial.</detailed_description>
