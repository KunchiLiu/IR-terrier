	<brief_summary>This study is designed to obtain and store samples of serum and liver tissue in HCV (HepC Virus)-infected patients being treated with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, and to determine the effect of new DAA therapies on HCV-related responses in the liver and peripheral blood. The introduction of new DAAs regimens that do not include IFN provides unique and novel opportunities to examine whether successful treatment-induced eradication of viral antigen results in reconstitution of T cell immunity. serum and liver tissue samples will be collected and stored in hopes of improving treatment and outcomes for future patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Hepatic Responses in Patients Receiving Direct-acting Anti-HCV Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to obtain and store samples of serum and liver tissue in HCV-infected patients being treated with DAA therapy. A liver biopsy will be performed pre-treatment for research reasons. A small liver sample that is not required for pathologic analysis will also be stored. Patients will undergo another liver biopsy at either 4 or 12 weeks after initiation of DAA therapy. Any patients with HCV-related liver disease (age &gt; 18) will be considered for this study. Patients will have a 120 ml blood draw for research purposes at baseline and 12 weeks after stopping DAA treatment along with a 60 ml blood draw at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. The liver biopsy at baseline and then either at 4 or 12 weeks will be examined using molecular techniques to measure transcription of key genes involved in the antiviral response.</detailed_description>
