	<brief_title>The Research of Standard Diagnosis and Treatment for HSPN in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) is one of the most common complications of Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and has become one of the main causes of chronic kidney disease in children. However, the diagnosis and treatment of HSPN is still based on the clinical experience, lacking of evidence-based support. This study is performed to explore the biological marker for early prediction of the prognosis and evaluate the efficacy and safety of various measures in the treatment of HSPN in children. The patients who are proved to get HSPN by renal biopsy will be given prednisone 2mg/kg/d, and randomized to receive cyclophosphamide pulse i.v.,mycophenolate mofetil p.o. or leflunomide p.o., we will follow up them for about 2.5 years and compare the efficacy and safety of these measures by monitoring several indexes.</detailed_description>
