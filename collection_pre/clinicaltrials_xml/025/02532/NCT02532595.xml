	<brief_summary>Conflicting evidence exists regarding the recommendations from the Orthopaedic section of the American Physical Therapy Association for treatment of Achilles tendinitis. Trigger point dry needling is effective in reducing pain in several body regions, but no published (TDN) studies are found reporting the effect on Achilles tendinopathy. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a treatment program performed including TDN, manual therapy and exercise will result in a significant improvement in pain, strength and function compared to a treatment program including manual therapy and exercise for Achilles tendinopathy. Subjects with Achilles tendinopathy that receive treatment including TDN, manual therapy and exercise will demonstrate a significant improvement in pain, strength and functional outcomes compared to the group that receives manual therapy and exercise.</brief_summary>
