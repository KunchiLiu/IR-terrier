	<brief_summary>Endotracheal intubation is the gold standard for securing the airway. However, while managing patients with difficult airways, various supraglottic devices have been used as rescue airway devices. The aim of this study is to compare the fiberoptic view through the internal aspect of the i-gel versus the Air-Q LMA in pediatric patients. By examining the fiberoptic view through these two devices, the investigators will determine which device provides a clearer passage to the glottic opening and is therefore the preferred conduit to aid endotracheal intubation in difficult airways.</brief_summary>
