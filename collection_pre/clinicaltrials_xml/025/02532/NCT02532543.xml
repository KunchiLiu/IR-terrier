	<brief_summary>This study is intended to provide statistically robust evidence that Symbios Demineralized Cortical-cancellous granule mix, Symbios OsteoGraf LD-300, and OsteoGraf/N-300 combined with Symbios OsteoShield Collagen Resorbable Membrane can adequately support the alveolus during ridge augmentation procedures, reducing the dimensional changes of both the alveolus and the overlying soft tissues. Additionally, a comparison between each material will be made, providing further evidence of each materials' ability to preserve the alveolus. It is intended to define in objective terms the response of the hard and soft tissues to ridge augmentation.</brief_summary>
