	<brief_title>Antiviral Efficacy of the Combination Treatment With Poly IC and Entecavir for Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the patients with chronic HBV infection will be divided into two groups: HBeAg (+) and HBeAg (-) group. Each group will be divided into two subgroups, which are treated with combination treatment of Entecavir and Poly IC and Entecavir monotherapy respectively. All the patients will be followed up for one year. From this study, the investigators want to study if Poly IC can enhance antiviral efficacy of Entecavir for chronic hepatitis B.</detailed_description>
