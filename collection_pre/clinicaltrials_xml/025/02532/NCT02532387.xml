	<brief_summary>Standardize the approach to outpatient Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outpatient Treatment of PE and DVT in the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the current protocol, we will study the outcomes most likely to influence emergency physician behavior, such as improved Emergency Department (ED) throughput, and decreased ED and Emergency Department Observation Unit (EDOU) length of stay. Metrics such as decreased admissions are also very important to hospital administrators so our results will have impact outside the ED as well. At the end of this study we will demonstrate that a carefully planned and data-driven approach to the outpatient treatment of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is safe, improves operational metrics, and reduces cost.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject is 18 years of age or older at time of enrollment. Subject is diagnosed with acute VTE (DVT or PE) in the MGH or BWH ED or transferred to the MGH or BWH ED (e.g from a clinic or outside hospital) with a diagnosis of acute VTE. Subject is treated as an outpatient (i.e. discharged) directly from the ED or admitted to the ED Observation Unit/ED Short Stay Unit on the outpatient treatment protocol. Subjects admitted from the ED to an inpatient service will not be enrolled as study subjects, but will be used as contemporary controls. Subjects who are unable to understand or provide informed consent. Subjects unable or unlikely to follow up (e.g. prisoners).</criteria>
