	<brief_title>Modulating Effects of Oil Palm Phenolics in Subjects With Pre-diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes Mellitus is a global health issue causing significant mortality and morbidity. According to Diabetes Atlas, the Middle East region currently leads with the highest number of diabetic patients, while Malaysia is rapidly catching up with an estimated prevalence of 12.2% (~3.3 million patients) by 2035. In Malaysia, the First National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS I) conducted in 1986 reported a prevalence of diabetes mellitus of 6.3%, which increased to 8.2% in the Second National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS II) conducted 10 years later, in 1996. By 2006, the prevalence of diabetes among Malaysian population aged 18 years and above had risen to 11.6% (NHMS III) and this figure rose further to 15.2% in year 2011 (NHMS IV). Type 2 diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder associated with insulin resistance, impaired insulin signalling and β-cell dysfunction, abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism, sub-clinical inflammation and increased oxidative stress; these metabolic disorders lead to long-term pathogenic conditions including micro- and macro-vascular complications such as neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, stroke, myocardial infarction and a consequent decrease in quality of life and increase in the rate of mortality. Patients who are at high risk of developing diabetes mellitus are considered pre-diabetes. Pre-diabetes is a term used to describe a high-risk state for the development of diabetes. Individuals with Pre-diabetes have higher plasma glucose than the normal range but lower than that in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Higher plasma glucose can be described as impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Pre-diabetes is defined as having fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of more than 5.6 mmol/L and less than 7.0 mmol/L; and 2-hr plasma glucose load level of more than 7.8 mmol/lL and less than 11.0 mmol/L. Currently, there are no FDA-approved drugs for pre-diabetes, thus all drugs prescribed for glucose control in pre-diabetic patients are used off label. Such patients are also known as to have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), with increased risks of developing both diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Early recognition of glucose intolerance would permit institution of preventive strategies which are efficacious, convenient, and cost-effective. Where lifestyle modifications are inadequate to suppress the onset of diabetes, pharmaceutical intervention such as metformin may be required. Based on the current understanding of pathophysiology of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, multiple pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been developed with the aim of improving glycemic control and prevention of diabetes complications, including the use of functional foods and their bioactive components. Recent studies suggest the potential of polyphenols as a supplementary treatment to delay or prevent the onset of diabetes owing to their biological properties. Polyphenols are natural phytochemical compounds found in fruits and vegetables. The most common group of phenolic compounds in our diet are phenolic acids and flavonoids. The two main classes are hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. Polyphenols are gaining popularity due to their various health-promoting effects including blood glucose modulation. The potential efficacy of polyphenols on glucose homeostasis and carbohydrate metabolism is being aggressively investigated in in vitro, animal models and clinical trials. The anti-hyperglycemic property of polyphenols is mainly contributed by the reduction of dietary carbohydrate absorption through intestines, improvement of β-cell function and insulin action, stimulation of insulin secretion, modulation of the enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The key enzymes responsible for the digestion of dietary carbohydrates to glucose are α-glucosidase and α-amylase. One of the most well-known properties of polyphenols especially phenolic acids on carbohydrate metabolism is the inhibition of these enzymes. Some investigations have shown that polyphenols are also able to regulate postprandial glycemia and inhibit the development of glucose intolerance by a facilitated insulin response and increased secretion of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagonlike polypeptide-1 (GLP-1). In addition, polyphenols are able to regulate the key pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism and hepatic glucose homeostasis. These include glycolysis, glycogenesis and gluconeogenesis, which are usually impaired in diabetes. In a study using diabetic rats, ferulic acid, a hydroxycinnamic acid derivate, has been found to effectively increase plasma insulin and suppress blood glucose level by elevating glucokinase activity and production of glycogen in the liver. Supplementation of diabetic rats with citrus bioflavonoids, was accompanied with increased hepatic glucokinase activity and glycogen content, attenuated hepatic gluconeogenesis via decrease the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and subsequent improvement of glycemic control. Green tea polyphenols have been shown to attenuate hyperglycemia and hepatic glucose output via down regulation the expression of liver glucokinase and upregulation of PEPCK. In an in vitro study, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), one of the most abundant catechins in green tea, activated the AMP-activated protein kinase as a required pathway for the inhibition of gluconeogenic enzymes expression. Dietary polyphenols also influence the peripheral glucose uptake in both insulin sensitive and non-insulin sensitive tissues. One study showed that phenolic acids stimulated glucose uptake as effective as metformin and thiazolodinedione, the main common oral hypoglycemic drugs used in diabetic patients. Other in-vitro studies showed that some polyphenols such as quercetin, resveratrol and epigalocatechin gallate improved insulin-dependent glucose uptake in muscle cells and adipocytes by translocation of glucose transporter to plasma membrane mainly through induction of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. AMPK has a key role in metabolic control as it is an important sensor of cellular energy status. The activation of this pathway is considered as a new treatment for obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and a main target for anti-diabetic drugs including metformin. Interestingly, the effect of polyphenols in activation of AMPK was reported to be 50-200 times more than metformin. Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress in pancreatic β-cells plays a pivotal role in the development of diabetes. It is believed that some polyphenols are able to protect β-cells from damage secondary to hyperglycemia and oxidation. Oral administration of phenolic-rich chestnut extract in diabetic rats had favourable effects on serum glucose and viability of β-cell through attenuation of oxidative stress, enhancing the natural antioxidant system, and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Some protective effects of polyphenols on β-cells are related to the ability to modulate key cellular signalling pathways. The anthocyanin-rich Chinese bayberry extract showed protective effects for pancreatic β cells against oxidative damage through up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1, modulation of ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and inhibition of β cell apoptosis. The current study focuses on the glucose-controlling properties of phenolic compounds extracted from oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), a high oil-producing tropical plant that also rich in phytochemicals. The technology for harvesting water-soluble antioxidants from the oil palm was recently developed enabling the recovery of oil palm phenolics (OPP) from the vegetation liquor of the palm oil milling process.. The major phenolic components in OPP are identified as caffeoylshikimic acid, protocatechuic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic acid. OPP has been found to exert various positive health effects parallel to the well-established physiological benefits of polyphenols. It has been shown that OPP protects against early type 2 diabetes and encouraging results suggest its role in modulating the development of diabetes. The current study aims to investigate and determine the effects of oil palm phenolics (OPP) on the blood glucose control in pre-diabetics. A Phase I clinical trial (NMRR ID: NMRR-08-1618-3108) was conducted in 2011 with the aim of evaluating the health benefits of OPP and evaluate any adverse reaction to the OPP preparation in healthy volunteers. The study using dose up to 150 ml of 1500 ppm GAE, twice daily, i.e. 450 mg GAE per day, involved 25 healthy volunteers and showed no serious adverse effects. Teratological studies showed that the OPP preparation did not result in teratogenic effects or OPP-induced toxicity. There were no observable developmental birth defects or congenital anomalies in the offspring of rats supplemented with OPP at both 1500 and 2400 mg/l gallic acid equivalents in their water supply for all three generations tested. Physical examinations including macroscopic observations for exencephaly, external eye defects, cleft palate/lip, maxillofacial development, hydrocephalus, integument, locomotion, equilibrium and muscular tremors did not reveal any abnormalities caused by OPP. The number of surviving offspring and growth milestones of the offspring were also not significantly different from the controls for the three generations studied. The histology of all organs tested, including liver, lungs, brain, kidneys, spleen, thymus, heart, testes and ovaries, was normal. To our best knowledge, there is currently no other clinical trial investigating the glucose controlling properties of oil palm phenolics (OPP) preparation in humans. Study reported that providing OPP between 900 and 1800 mg/lGAE ad libitum to Nile rats blocked diabetes progression in this spontaneous diabetes model. Based on an average rat weight of 300 g and 30-35ml/day OPP consumption, the average equivalent consumption by a 60kg human subject would be about 1000 ml, calculated based on the body surface area normalisation method. Thus, in order to exert clinically significant effect, the current study will apply up to 1000 mg GAE per day Doses as high as 3000 mg/l GAE in rats (which translates to 3000mg GAE consumption per day by humans) showed no adverse effects. Besides, investigators are also looking at the aspect of personalised medicine where some subjects with pre-diabetes may have better response to OPP than the others. Investigators are going to use the pharmacometabonomic approach to determine this patient group. Once identified, the future development of OPP could be more focused on this group of patients and lead to a more targeted product development and reduced unnecessary cost.</detailed_description>
