	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that viral specific T-cells (a type of white blood cell) can be generated from an unrelated donor and given safely to patients with viral infections.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Third Party Anti-Viral Cytotoxic T-Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Viral reactivation and infection is a major cause of morbidity in immunocompromised patients (including HSCT recipients). In this study we will draw blood from unrelated (third party) donors and use the blood to generate cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) with specificity for EBV, CMV and adenovirus. The CTL's will be frozen and infused or freshly infused into immunocompromised children with specific viral infections (EBV, CMV or adenovirus). Cells will be selected for infusion based on the recipient's HLA type and the viral specificity of the cells.</detailed_description>
