	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of the addition of sitagliptin to metformin with or without a sulfonylurea compared with the addition of dapagliflozin to metformin with or without a sulfonylurea on hemoglobin A1c (A1C) over 24 weeks of treatment as well as the overall safety and tolerability of sitagliptin in comparison to that of dapagliflozin after 24 weeks of treatment. The primary hypothesis is that the change from baseline in A1C in participants treated with the addition of sitagliptin is non-inferior compared to that in participants treated with the addition of dapagliflozin after 24 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
