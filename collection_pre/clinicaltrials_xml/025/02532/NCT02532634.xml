	<brief_title>Ramosetron, Aprepitant, and Dexamethasone Versus Palonosetron, Aprepitant, and Dexamethasone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, palonosetron is the clinically preferred antiemetic for Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).However the best 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor (5-HT3R) antagonists for use in a triple drug combination for high emetogenic chemotherapy(HEC) has not yet been determined in randomized trials. Previous anti-emetic guidelines stated that the anti-emetic activities of 5-HT3R antagonists were similar at equivalent doses. Based on the meta-analysis of various 5-HT3R antagonists in double regimens, the NCCN guideline has suggested palonosetron as a preferred 5-HT3R antagonist in the triple antiemetic drug combination. But in Asia, RAD is one of the most popular treatments for HEC-treated cancer patients. However, the lack of clinical studies has precluded the recommendation of RAD as a standard regimen for HEC-induced CINV. In two previous studies conducted in Korea, RAD regimen showed significant efficacy for prevention of CINV which is comparable to the efficacy reported from the studies evaluating with PAD regimen. If the efficacy of RAD regimen is evidently proven by this kind of randomized multicenter-trial, RAD regimen can be more recommended as a standard regimen for HEC-induced CINV.</detailed_description>
