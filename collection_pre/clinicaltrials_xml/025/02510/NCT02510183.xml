	<brief_title>P6 Acupressure Before Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prevention of postoperative complications is one of the main tasks of nurses. However, there are limited nursing interventions that can be done to prevent PONV. The American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses suggest nurses to teach patients with a high risk of PONV about acupressure application on P6 acupoint or to apply acupressure wristbands preoperatively. However this suggestion has a low evidence.</detailed_description>
