	<brief_summary>PIDD represent an expanding group of genetic disorders that compromise immunity against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The most severe forms of PIDD cause profound susceptibility to opportunistic infections due to impaired or absent T-cell immunity. These diseases can be rapidly fatal unless treated via hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Chronic viral illnesses are a common presenting feature of many of these disorders, and studies have shown that survival of HSCT is profoundly impacted by the patient's pre-transplant disease status. Primary infections with viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are common, and respiratory viruses such as adenovirus also frequently cause infection. In patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a prior study identified these viruses as the most common causes of mortality in the immediate period following HSCT. Though some forms of PIDD are amenable to HSCT without requiring conditioning chemotherapy, many forms require a variable degree of pre-conditioning to ensure that stable engraftment of the donor cells is achieved. The administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy used in the conditioning regimens can however increase the risk for regimen related toxicity and for some patients (especially those with active viral infections) this risk is particularly high, leading to high treatment related mortality rates. For these reasons, many such patients are not even considered candidates for HSCT or are delayed getting to HSCT and ultimately succumb to infection before they can receive the transplant. The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of administering third-party multivirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (mCTL) from adult CMV seropositive donors to treat refractory viral infections in patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDD) prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since recovery of virus-specific T cells is clearly associated with protection from infection with each of these viruses, adoptive immunotherapy to decrease the time to immune reconstitution is an attractive approach. Virus-specific T cells generated by repeated stimulation with antigen presenting cells (APCs) expressing viral antigens have been evaluated in clinical trials to prevent and treat viral infections in immunocompromised hosts. This approach eliminates alloreactive T cells. To broaden the specificity of single CTL lines to include the three most common viral pathogens of stem cell recipients, investigators reactivated CMV and adenovirus-specific T cells by using mononuclear cells transduced with a recombinant adenoviral vector encoding the CMV antigen pp65 (Ad5f35CMVpp65). Subsequent stimulations with EBV-LCL transduced with the same vector both reactivated EBV-specific T cells and maintained the expansion of the activated adenovirus and CMV-specific T cells. This method reliably produced CTLs with cytotoxic function specific for all three viruses, which investigators infused into 14 stem cell recipients in a Phase I prophylaxis study. They observed recovery of immunity to CMV and EBV in all patients but an increase in adenovirus-specific T cells was only seen in patients who had evidence of adenovirus infection pre-infusion. A follow-up study in which the frequency of adenovirus-specific T cells was increased in the infused CTLs produced similar results, thus highlighting the importance of endogenous antigen to promote the expansion of infused T cells in vivo. Nevertheless, all patients in both clinical trials with pre-infusion CMV, adenovirus or EBV infection or reactivation were able to clear the infection, including one patient with severe adenoviral pneumonia requiring ventilatory support. CTLs recognizing multiple antigens can therefore produce clinically relevant effects against all three viruses.</detailed_description>
