	<brief_title>Sevoflurane and Hyperperfusion Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative hyperperfusion syndrome is a common complication in moyamoya disease patients receiving revascularization surgery. Previously its incidence has been reported to be 17~50%, but little remains regarding frequency of reperfusion injury after revascularization surgery in patients with moyamoya disease. Volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane has been introduced clinically to reduce reperfusion injury and preconditioning with sevoflurane induced ischemic tolerance like as ischemic preconditioning. However, there was no report on the neuroprotective effect of sevoflurane postconditioning on ischemic/reperfusion injury in human brain. Therefore, We evaluated the neuroprotective effect of sevoflurane postconditioning on the incidence of postoperative hyperperfusion syndrome after revascularization surgery in moyamoya disease patients.</detailed_description>
