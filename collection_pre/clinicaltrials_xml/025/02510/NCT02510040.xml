	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria for Convergence Insufficiency (CI) Group: The following criteria must be met for the subject to be enrolled into the study: Adults ≥18 years of age (adult onset of CI not required) No strabismus surgery within the past 10 years CI Symptom Survey score ≥21 points Near exodeviation of ≥4∆ and at least 4∆ larger than at distance by PACT Distance exodeviation ≤15∆ by PACT Vertical deviation ≤2∆ at distance and near by PACT No constant exotropia at distance or near Reduced positive fusional vergence (PFV) at near (&lt;20∆ or fails Sheard's criterion that the PFV measures less than twice the magnitude of the near phoria) Near point of convergence (NPC) of ≥6 cm break Visual acuity 20/50 or better in both eyes by ETDRS or Snellen No paralytic strabismus (e.g., 3rd, 4th, or 6th cranial nerve palsies, skew deviation, Duane syndrome) No restrictive strabismus (e.g., blowout fracture, thyroid eye disease, post scleral buckle, Brown syndrome) No monocular diplopia No paretic strabismus, thyroid eye disease, myasthenia gravis, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, or eye movement abnormalities associated with known neurological disease. Patients with Parkinson's disease can be enrolled if nonparetic deviation. No inferior or superior oblique overaction defined as 2+ or greater Ability to fuse with prism in space (see section 2.4.1) Ability to understand and complete a survey Investigator is initiating treatment with prism, orthoptic exercises, botulinum toxin injection or surgery If initiating treatment with botulinum toxin or surgery, planned injection or surgery to be within 60 days of enrollment Single treatment modality is planned (e.g., no combined prism and orthoptic exercises) Treatment to be initiated has not been used within the past one year Eligibility Criteria for Divergence Insufficiency (DI) Group: The following criteria must be met for the subject to be enrolled into the study: Adults ≥18 years of age Adultonset DI (at ≥18 years of age) No prior strabismus surgery Symptoms of diplopia at distance with a frequency of sometimes or worse in primary position (in current glasses if wearing glasses) Distance esodeviation of 2∆ to 30∆ and at least 50% larger than at near by PACT No more than 5∆ difference between right and left gaze by PACT No more than 10∆ difference between the primary position at distance and either upgaze or downgaze ≤10∆ by PACT Any coexisting vertical deviation must be less than distance esodeviation and ≤10∆ by PACT Visual acuity 20/50 or better in both eyes by ETDRS or Snellen No paralytic strabismus (e.g., 3rd, 4th, or 6th cranial nerve palsies, skew deviation, Duane syndrome) No restrictive strabismus (e.g., blowout fracture, thyroid eye disease, post scleral buckle, Brown syndrome) No monocular diplopia No paretic strabismus, thyroid eye disease, myasthenia gravis, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, or eye movement abnormalities associated with known neurological disease. Patients with Parkinson's disease can be enrolled if nonparetic deviation No inferior or superior oblique overaction defined as 2+ or greater Ability to fuse with prism in space (see section 2.4.2) Ability to understand and complete a survey Investigator is initiating treatment with prism, orthoptic exercises, botulinum toxin injection or surgery If initiating treatment with botulinum toxin or surgery, planned injection or surgery to be within 60 days of enrollment Single treatment modality planned (e.g., no combined prism and orthoptic exercises) Treatment to be initiated has not been used within the past one year Eligibility Criteria for Smallangle Hypertropia (HT) Group: The following criteria must be met for the subject to be enrolled into the study: Adults ≥18 years of age Adultonset HT (at ≥18 years of age) No prior strabismus surgery Symptoms of diplopia at distance or near with a frequency of sometimes or worse in primary or reading position (in current glasses if wearing glasses) Vertical deviation ≥1∆ to ≤10∆ at distance and near by PACT No more than 4∆ difference from the primary in any gaze position by PACT Any coexisting esodeviation must be less than the vertical deviation Any coexisting exodeviation ≤10∆ by PACT No convergence insufficiency as defined in section 2.2.1 Visual acuity 20/50 or better in both eyes by ETDRS or Snellen No paralytic strabismus (e.g., 3rd, 4th, or 6th cranial nerve palsies, skew deviation, Duane syndrome) No restrictive strabismus (e.g., blowout fracture, thyroid eye disease, post scleral buckle, Brown syndrome) No monocular diplopia No paretic strabismus, thyroid eye disease, myasthenia gravis, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, or eye movement abnormalities associated with known neurological disease. Patients with Parkinson's disease can be enrolled if nonparetic deviation.
