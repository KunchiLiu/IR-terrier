	<brief_title>Is Hyacinth Exercise Better Than Kegel's Exercise in Women With Urinary Incontinence?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals who admit to have urinary leakage will be examined to determine the nature of their problem and individuals for whom Kegel exercises are likely to be for benefit will be recruited into this study. One hundred and eighty women who participants who agree to be randomized to Kegel's or Hyacinth exercises will be randomized. The treatment allocation will be sealed opaque enveloped and stored in a secure location. Participants will be blinded from the treatment arm, and as much as possible, participants in different arms of the study would be given different appointment dates to avoid contamination. Exercises will be prescribed by a trained personnel, and flexibility is added to the routine to enable tailoring to individual lifestyles and choices.</detailed_description>
