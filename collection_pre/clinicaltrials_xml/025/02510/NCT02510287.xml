	<brief_summary>The analgesic approach in labor can be done in different ways, among which the neuraxial approach has shown the best analgesic results and fetal outcomes. Currently, programmed epidural intermittent bolus has been included in the neuraxial approach for a better distribution of the solution into the epidural space as compared with the continuous infusion strategy. In this study, the investigators seek to compare both strategies in 132 laboring women.</brief_summary>
