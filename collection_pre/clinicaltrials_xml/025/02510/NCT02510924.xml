	<brief_summary>Airtraq sp has been proven effective for intubating patients presenting with difficult airway. The Airtraq sp allows visualisation of the tracheal inlet only for the intubator. By adding a smartphone with a dedicated app (Airtraq Mobile) to the Airtraq sp, the visualisation of the tracheal inlet is possible for all the airway providers. The investigators aim to demonstrate that the addition of the Airtraq Mobile app improves success rate of intubation (primary endpoint), as well as confort of the airway provider, shortens time for intubation and reduces injury to the patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Airtraq sp has been proven effective for intubating patients presenting with difficult airway. The Airtraq sp allows visualisation of the tracheal inlet only for the intubator. By adding a smartphone with a dedicated app (Airtraq Mobile) to the Airtraq sp, the visualisation of the tracheal inlet is possible for all the airway providers. The investigators aim to demonstrate that the addition of the Airtraq Mobile app improves success rate of intubation (primary endpoint), as well as confort of the airway provider, shortens time for intubation and reduces injury to the patients while their neck is imobilized by a cervical collar, creating a simulated difficult airway. Patients will be included if they necessitate an elective general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation. Exclusion criteria are related to difficult airway, ASA IV and patient refusal.</detailed_description>
