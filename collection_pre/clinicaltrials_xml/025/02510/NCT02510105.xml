	<brief_title>Tomodensitometric Study of Pulmonary Effects of Intrapulmonary Percussive Ventilation in ARDS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective clinical study in ICU of ventilated patients with ARDS. The morphologic pulmonary effects of IPV with VDR4 are not known to the investigators' knowledge. The main aim is to quantify recruited, normally aerated and overinflated parts of the lungs after a 1 hour treatment with IPV. Patients with ARDS (focal and non focal) consecutively admitted to the investigators' ICU are enrolled after informed consent. Patients are intubated and ventilated with Servo-I (GE) and ventilation is optimized according to ARDS-network recommandations. A first thoracic CT-scan is performed with ICU ventilator and then the patient is ventilated with VDR4 during 1 hour. A second thoracic CT-scan is then performed and the patient re-ventilated with ICU ventilator. Arterial blood gases and hemodynamic parameters are recorded during experiments. CT-scan are analysed and compared for normally aerated, overinflated and recruited lung parenchyma. Regions are determined thanks to their Hounsfield units (HU).</detailed_description>
