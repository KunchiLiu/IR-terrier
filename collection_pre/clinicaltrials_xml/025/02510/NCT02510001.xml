	<brief_summary>This trial is designed to try two new cancer drugs together for the first time. The investigators think that they might be effective in some types of bowel cancer. The first part of the trial will see what doses of the two drugs can safely be given together. Once the investigators have identified a suitable dose combination they will look at how effective treatment is in bowel cancers where either the RAS gene is mutated, or MET is over-active. In the trial the investigators will look at samples of blood, skin and tumour to check the drugs are working in the way expected. The trial will take place in three sites in the UK and 5 sites in Europe. The trial is funded as part of the European commission's FP7 program.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a two stage study. Firstly a dose escalation step is used to define the best dose for the drug combination, using the rolling 6 design where up to 6 patients are recruited at each dose level, and increasing the dose of one or other agent according to the side effects of treatment. An initial dose escalation phase was completed where 25 patients were enrolled, using the study treatment combination of PD-0325901 with PF-02341066. Following discontinuation of the MEKi (inihibitor), PD-0325901, the study was updated to include a further dose escalation phase using the new combination study treatment, MEKi, Binimetinib with METi, PF-02341066. The effects of this drug combination will be assessed to define the recommended dose level for the dose expansion phase of the study. Second the new drug combination is observed in 36 patients with bowel cancer for its efficacy and tolerability. patients who give consent will have their archival tumour samples tested for RAS and c-MET status. Potential participants will, after giving consent, undergo screening tests to ensure that it is safe for them to take part. These involve a detailed medical history, physical exam, blood tests, ophthalmology exam, ECG and ultrasound and skin biopsies. The size and extent of tumours is also assessed by CT and/or MRI scan. For the initial dose escalation phase, on assurance that the test results are satisfactory, patients start on PD-0325901 first for one week. On Day -7 a physical exam, ECG and blood test is performed, with a repeat blood test on Day -6. End of first week PD samples of blood are taken to observe the level of PD-0325901. Day 1 PF-02341066 is introduced after further clinical safety assessments. There are further blood samples taken over 24 hours to measure levels of PD-0325901 and PF-02341066 on days 21 and 28 of the first cycle. For the further dose escalation phase, again assuming that the screening test results are satisfactory, patients start on Day 1 with the combined treatment of PF-02341066 with Binimetinib. A physical exam, ECG and blood test is performed, with a repeat blood test on Day 2. There are further blood samples taken over 24 hours to measure levels of Binimetinib and PF-02341066 on day 21of the first cycle. Patients have weekly visits when side effects are reviewed and a physical examination is performed. On Day 15 a second skin biopsy is taken along with blood tests to assess liver and renal function. At the end of the first 4 weeks cycle, for the initial dose escalation phase, and at end of 8 weeks for the new combination therapy dose escalation phase, an ophthalmology exam is compared with the baseline assessment. For subsequent cycles in both the initial dose escalation and further dose escalation phases, visits remain weekly and include safety assessments as per Day 1. Blood levels of PD-0325901 or Binimetinib and PF-02341066 are measured on day 21 of even numbered cycles. In addition the tumour size is checked every second cycle, and the study treatment stopped if the tumour continues to grow. When patients stop taking the study treatment they will be reviewed after 4 weeks for any side effects and have a physical examination and other safety tests performed. For patients entering the expansion phase of the trial the procedures are similar, except that there is a pre-screening stage where tumour biopsies are required. Patients will have a sample of their tumour assessed, following consent, to determine their RAS and cMET status. This may involve a fresh biopsy. If suitable, the patient will be entered into the screening for the dose expansion phase and a fresh tumour biopsy may be taken if not already done so. The study schedule is the same as for the escalation phase using Binimetinib with PF-02341066. At the end of treatment a further, optional, tumour biopsy may be taken. After trial participation patients will be offered further care with the trial team or their referring oncology team as appropriate.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA (Inclusion criteria for the completed initial dose escalation phase using PF02341066/PD0325901 are listed in Appendix 7.) All patients Age ≥ 16 years ECOG performance status 01 (Appendix 1) Adequate respiratory function on clinical assessment Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% as determined by a multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram┼ Able to give informed consent prior to any screening procedures being performed and be capable of complying with the protocol and its requirements Haematological and biochemical indices within the ranges shown below: Haemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 9g/dl (transfusion to achieve this allowed ), Neutrophils ≥ 1,500/μl, Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μl, AST or ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN, patient with liver metastases ≤ 5 × ULN, Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2 x ULN, Serum Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN, Creatinine Clearance ≥ 50ml/min (Calculated by Cockcroft Gault equation, or by EDTA) (Appendix 2) Able to swallow oral medication Life expectancy of at least 3 months. Dose escalation phase: Patients with any advanced solid tumours Patients for whom the combination of PF02341066 with Binimetinib is a reasonable option. Dose expansion phase: Patients will be eligible for prescreening for this phase provided that: They have given informed consent to screening. They are willing to undergo a biopsy for assessment of tumour RAS mutation status and cMET assessment. The Investigator anticipates that they are likely to satisfy the eligibility criteria for the trial. Formal screening should not be performed until the tumour prescreening result is known. Eligibility for the trial, in patients passing prescreening, requires: Histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma that is RASMT (KRAS codon 12, 13, 61, 117, 146; NRAS codon 12, 13, 61, 117, 146) mutations) or RASWT/cMET+, with progressive disease on or within 6 months of completion of adjuvant therapy or after chemotherapy and/or targeted therapies for metastatic disease. No evidence for a mutation in BRAF at codon600 Metastases accessible for biopsy on 23 occasions At least one other measurable lesion (according to RECIST v1.1). Unsuitable for potential curative resection. ┼For nonUK territories: if echocardiogram (ECHO) cannot be performed, a MUGA scan may be performed in compliance with local policy, applicable national legislation and relevant approvals.
