	<detailed_description>Spasticity and constipation are major problems hindering improvement in motor development in children with cerebral palsy. Decreasing spasticity will have a positive effect on motor development and quality of life for the child and his family. The aim is to study the therapeutic and adverse effects of oral magnesium sulfate therapy on spasticity and constipation in infants and children with cerebral palsy. Hundred children with spastic cerebral palsy will be randomized to either intervention group n=50 will be treated with magnesium sulfate 4% orally for 28 days to treat spasticity and constipation in addition to their conventional treatment, or placebo group n=50 will receive conventional treatment and placebo.</detailed_description>
