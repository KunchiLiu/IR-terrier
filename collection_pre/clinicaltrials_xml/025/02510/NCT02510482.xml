	<brief_summary>Calcified aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is a progressive disease and nowadays, the cornerstone in diagnostics and follow-up is echocardiography. Cardiac biomarkers (such as cardiac troponins T and I and NT-pro-BNP) hold promise to fulfil a role in early recognition of complications concerning the aortic valve and decompensation. For this purpose, it is important to assess the normal biological variation (BV) of cardiac biomarkers in CAVS. The assessment of biological variation will contribute to a better understanding of fluctuation of cardiac biomarkers in subjects with stable CAVS. These data will improve monitoring of CAVS using cardiac biomarkers.</brief_summary>
