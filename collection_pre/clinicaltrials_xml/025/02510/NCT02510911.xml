	<brief_summary>Postoperative bowel paralysis is common after abdominal operations, including colectomy. As a result, hospitalization may be prolonged leading to increased cost. A recent randomized controlled trial from the University of Heidelberg showed that consumption of regular black coffee after colectomy is safe and associated with a significantly faster resumption of intestinal motility (Müller 2012). The mechanism how coffee stimulates intestinal motility is unknown but caffeine seems to be the most likely stimulating agent. Thus, this trial addresses the question: Does caffeine reduce postoperative bowel paralysis after elective laparoscopic colectomy? Patients after laparoscopic colectomy will receive either 100 mg caffeine, 200 mg caffeine, or 250mg corn starch (placebo) 3 times daily in identically looking gelatin capsules. The study is a randomized, controlled trial, with blinding of physicians, patients and nursing stuff (evaluating the endpoints). Primary endpoint will be the time to first bowel movement.</brief_summary>
