	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes is a major public health problem because of its increasing prevalence and morbidity and mortality that accompanies it. Therapeutic management of this pathology, lifestyle measures, dietary and physical activity are fundamental. Their observance is unfortunately too often insufficient, leading to a therapeutic climbing with first oral antidiabetic (OAD) then the use of insulin therapy. Yet there is now ample evidence that physical activity improves glucose control in these patients in particular improving insulin sensitivity after a training period but also after a single session of physical activity. Neuro-myo-electrical stimulation (NMES) is used in common clinical practice in physical therapy, patients with neurological or after orthopedic surgery in particular. In fact, this method enables improvement of volume and strength, even for denervated muscles. Recent studies have also shown the benefits of NMES in situations of cardiac or respiratory readjustments. In addition, NMES is used by top athletes supplements classical training in order to develop muscle strength or speed recovery. Investigators propose to test the impact of bilateral quadriceps NMES on insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients treated with OAD (excluding glitazone). To do this, investigators plan to assess their insulin sensitivity by the reference method of hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp before surgery, after a single session of bilateral quadriceps NMES and after a sequence of daily training 6 days a quadriceps NMES bilateral. Investigators hope to show an improvement in insulin sensitivity by this method, which would constitute an alternative to physical activity in the treatment of diabetes type 2. This procedure would be particularly interesting in diabetic subjects with type 2 counter- indications or an inability to perform a conventional physical activity.</brief_summary>
