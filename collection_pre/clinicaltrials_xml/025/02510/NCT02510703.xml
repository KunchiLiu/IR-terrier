	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes is associated with early and diffuse abnormalities of endothelial function, especially in the coronary arteries, which are a factor of poor prognosis. Following acute coronary syndrome, the endothelial function abnormalities usually persist for several weeks before regressing. Their persistence 6-8 weeks after myocardial infarction is a poor prognostic factor. Investigators assume that global abnormalities of endothelial function in patients with diabetes may be additive with segmental abnormalities in revascularized myocardium, and contribute to worsening the prognosis in these patients. Furthermore, there is no published data showing any relationship between calcium score and endothelial function abnormalities in these patients. The investigators seek a relationship between calcium score and persistence of abnormalities of coronary endothelial function in these patients. The main objective of this study was to compare coronary endothelial function by quantitative method (TEP at 15O-H2O) in diabetic patients and nondiabetic following acute coronary syndrome.</brief_summary>
