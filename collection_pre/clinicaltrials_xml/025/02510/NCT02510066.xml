	<brief_title>Efficacy and Mechanisms of Acupuncture for Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acupuncture may alleviate abdominal or back pain of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Acupuncture participants would receive electroacupuncture on Jiaji (Ex-B2) points for 3 times in a week. Placebo acupuncture participants would receive placebo acupuncture on non-point points for the same period. Pain scores on numeric rating scale (NRS) and blood levels of β-endorphin and nerve growth factor are compared.</detailed_description>
