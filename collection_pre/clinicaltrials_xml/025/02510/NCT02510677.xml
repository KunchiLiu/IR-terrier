	<brief_summary>The prognosis of patients with heart failure has improved due to recent breakthrough in medical treatment and cardiac resynchronization devices. However, there is no paraclinical parameter to assess response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). This is a major issue since about a third of implanted patients will not be improved by CRT. CZT SPECT allows to perform myocardial perfusion imaging in less than 4 minutes and is able to study myocardial perfusion, viability, left ventricular function, but also ventricular asynchrony. Using low-dose dobutamine gated SPECT and CZT camera, we aimed to assess left ventricular dyssynchrony in viable segments in patients with heart failure eligible for CRT.</brief_summary>
