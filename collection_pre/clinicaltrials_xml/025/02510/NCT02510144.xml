	<brief_summary>Propionibacterium acnes is the most common pathogen identified from a surgical site infection in the shoulder. Standard skin preps do not prevent this type of infection. Patients will undergo either a chlorhexidine or benzoyl peroxide prep in days leading up to surgery. Bacterial burden will be determined at the time of surgery.</brief_summary>
