	<detailed_description>Approximately 600 subjects diagnosed with opioid use disorder will be enrolled; approximately 300 subjects who completed the randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled study, RB-US-13-0001, and approximately 300 subjects who did not participate in study RB-US-13-0001. Following informed consent and completion of screening procedures, all subjects will receive SUBOXONE sublingual film, titrated to response. After 4-14 days of SUBOXONE film treatment, subjects will be evaluated for enrollment into the study.Eligible subjects will receive high dose RBP-6000 as an initial dose, followed by monthly injections of low or high dose RBP-6000, based on the medical judgment of the investigator. Subjects who participated in study RB-US-13-0001 will receive monthly injections for up to 6 months. Subjects who did not participate in study RB-US-13-0001 will receive monthly injections for up to12 months. At all injection visits continuous electrocardiogram recordings and pulse oximetry will be collected prior to injection and at least 4 hours after injection. Subjects will return to the clinic every 1-4 weeks for laboratory tests, complete study questionnaires,adverse event and injection site assessments.</detailed_description>
