	<brief_title>CBT-I for Psychosis: Guidelines, Preliminary Efficacy, and Functional Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this project is to develop guidelines for the clinical tailoring of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) for Veterans with psychotic disorders and insomnia, and to test the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of CBT-I for improving sleep-related functional outcomes in this population. Specific Aim 1: Develop empirically-derived guidelines for the clinical tailoring of CBT-I materials and procedures for Veterans with psychotic disorders through an iterative process with input from Veteran clients, CBT-I experts and providers, as well as those with expertise in psychotic disorders. Specific Aim 2: Establish the acceptability of CBT-I for Veterans with psychotic disorders and insomnia when delivered using guidelines developed in Specific Aim 1 in order to make further refinements to the guidelines in a preliminary trial with 6 Veterans with psychosis and insomnia. Specific Aim 3: Conduct a randomized controlled trial (n=60) to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of CBT-I in producing positive changes at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up on the outcomes of insomnia symptoms, sleep quality, and functioning.</detailed_description>
