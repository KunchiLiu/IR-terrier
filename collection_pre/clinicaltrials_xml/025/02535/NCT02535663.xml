	<brief_summary>To investigate the impact of consumption of dairy yogurt with rhamnogalacturonan (RG) in Korean citrus Hallabong peel polysaccharide on Natural Killer (NK) cell activity and circulating cytokine levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Consumption of Dairy Yogurt Enhanced Immune Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 120 nondiabetic and nonobese subjects. Over an 8 week period, the test group consumed one pack (150ml) of dairy yogurt with 50mg probiotics and 100mg Korean citrus Hallabong peel polysaccharide (60% RG, 20% mono- and di-saccharide, 5% polyphenol) each day, whereas the placebo group consumed the same product without Korean citrus Hallabong peel polysaccharide. NK cell activities (%) were measured based on the ratios of effector cells (E) (peripheral blood mononuclear cell, PBMC) from each participant to Target cell (T) (K562 cells) as 10:1, 5:1, 2.5:1 or 1.25:1.</detailed_description>
