	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of methoxyamine when given together with cisplatin and pemetrexed disodium and to see how well it works in treating patients with solid tumors or mesothelioma that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with standard treatment (advanced), or mesothelioma that does not respond to pemetrexed disodium and cisplatin or carboplatin (refractory). Methoxyamine may shrink the tumor and may also help cisplatin and pemetrexed disodium work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and pemetrexed disodium, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving methoxyamine together with cisplatin and pemetrexed disodium may be a better treatment for solid tumors or mesothelioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Methoxyamine, Cisplatin, and Pemetrexed Disodium in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Mesothelioma That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Mesothelioma That Is Refractory to Pemetrexed Disodium and Cisplatin or Carboplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of TRC102 (methoxyamine) with pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) and cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Arm A) II. To describe the toxicities of TRC102 combined with pemetrexed and cisplatin at each dose studied. (Arm A) III. To assess preliminary safety and activity in an expansion cohort of chemotherapy-naive advanced unresectable malignant mesothelioma patients. (Arm A) IV. To describe responses to the drug combination at each dose level. (Arm A) V. To detect activity of the combination of TRC102 and pemetrexed, as evidenced by tumor response in patients with advanced malignant mesothelioma previously treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin. (Arm B) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe pharmacokinetic parameters of TRC102 given concurrent with pemetrexed and cisplatin. II. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic parameters of TRC102 given concurrently with pemetrexed and cisplatin. III. To explore the feasibility of establishing pleural and peritoneal effluent-derived cell lines and to evaluate the response of cultured pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma cells to cisplatin, pemetrexed, and TRC102. IV. To document all objective clinical responses to TRC102 in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin. OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of methoxyamine followed by a phase II study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients receive methoxyamine orally (PO) on days 1-4, pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes, and cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue methoxyamine and pemetrexed disodium beyond course 6 if the patient continues to benefit from treatment at the discretion of the treating physician. ARM B: Patients receive methoxyamine PO on days 1-4 and pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue methoxyamine and pemetrexed disodium beyond course 6 if the patient continues to benefit from treatment at the discretion of the treating physician. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 8 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Arm A dose escalation: patients with histologically or cytologically proven advanced solid tumors for which standard treatments are not available, or for whom the current dose level of cisplatin in combination with pemetrexed is appropriate;
