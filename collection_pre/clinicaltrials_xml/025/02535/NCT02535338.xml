	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor AT13387 when given together with erlotinib hydrochloride and to see how well they work in treating patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer that has come back (recurrent) or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Erlotinib hydrochloride and Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride and Hsp90 Inhibitor AT13387 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic EGFR-Mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and tolerability of erlotinib hydrochloride (erlotinib) and Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 (onalespib) in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (PHASE I) II. To preliminarily assess efficacy of combination erlotinib and onalespib at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) determined in the phase I portion of the study in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who have not had a complete or partial response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 to frontline erlotinib within 6 months. (PHASE II, COHORT A) III. To preliminarily assess efficacy of combination erlotinib and onalespib at the RP2D in NSCLC patients whose tumor harbors an EGFR Exon 20 Insertion (an EGFR mutation not typically responsive to single agent erlotinib). (PHASE II, COHORT B) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity (primary aim phase II, secondary aim phase I). II. To evaluate in a preliminary manner the progression-free survival (PFS) and disease control rate (DCR) of patients treated with erlotinib/onalespib. III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the above drug combinations at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore plasma EGFR-mutant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as a biomarker by detecting changes in plasma EGFR-mutant DNA levels (including plasma EGFR-T790M) and new mutations that may represent resistance to treatment. II. To demonstrate knockdown of Hsp90 client oncoproteins via treatment with erlotinib and onalespib by multiplexed immunofluorescence in serial tumor biopsies. III. To establish patient derived xenotransplant models in EGFR-mutated NSCLC with a focus on tumors that lack response to single agent erlotinib and in patients with tumors harboring EGFR exon 20 insertions. OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 followed by a phase II study. Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) daily and Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 1 year and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PHASE I: Patients must have metastatic/recurrent, histologically confirmed NSCLC that harbors an EGFR activating mutation (Exon 21 L858R, Exon 19 deletion, Exon 18 G719X, Exon 21 L861Q) with progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 on a previous EGFRtyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) or; patients must have metastatic/recurrent histologically confirmed NSCLC that harbors an EGFR Exon 20 insertion with progressive disease on platinum containing chemotherapy PHASE II COHORT A: Patients must have metastatic/recurrent histologically confirmed NSCLC that harbors an EGFR activating mutation (Exon 21 L858R, Exon 19 deletion, Exon 18 G719X, Exon 21 L861Q) with stable disease by RECIST 1.1 as best response on erlotinib compared to pretreatment erlotinib imaging by RECIST 1.1 or progressive disease compared to pretreatment imaging by RECIST 1.1 after a minimum duration of treatment on erlotinib of 12weeks; patients must be enrolled within 6 months of initiation of erlotinib PHASE II COHORT B: Patients must have metastatic/recurrent histologically confirmed NSCLC that harbors an EGFR Exon 20 insertion with progressive disease on or after platinum doublet chemotherapy FOR PHASE I: If patient is on erlotinib at the time of signed consent, the patient does NOT need to be discontinued prior to initiation of erlotinib and onalespib; other EGFRTKIs must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to initiation of erlotinib and onalespib FOR PHASE II COHORT A: If patient is on erlotinib at the time of signed consent, erlotinib does NOT need to be discontinued prior to receiving treatment erlotinib and onalespib; last dose of erlotinib must be less than 28 days from when patient signs consent FOR PHASE II COHORT B: (EGFR Exon 20 Insertions): Prior EGFRTKIs including erlotinib is allowed; if patient is on erlotinib at the time of signed consent, erlotinib does NOT need to be discontinued prior to initiation of erlotinib and onalespib Local testing for EGFRmutations for this study is acceptable provided it was performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certified lab Patients with a prior history of brain metastases are eligible provided: The brain metastases have been treated The patient is asymptomatic from the brain metastases Corticosteroids prescribed for the management of brain metastases have been discontinued at least 7 days prior to registration Patients must have completed last chemotherapy &gt;= 3 weeks or radiotherapy &gt;= 2 weeks prior to receiving study drugs Patients must have recovered from adverse events attributable to previous treatment to =&lt;
