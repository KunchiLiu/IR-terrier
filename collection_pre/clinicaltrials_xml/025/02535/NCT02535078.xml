	<brief_summary>This study is a Phase Ib/II, multi-center, open-label study of IMCgp100 as a single agent and in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and/or tremelimumab in metastatic cutaneous melanoma. The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity of IMCgp100 in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736, programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] inhibitor), tremelimumab (CLTA-4 inhibitor), and the combination of durvalumab with tremelimumab compared to single-agent IMCgp100 alone. The study will enroll patients who have metastatic melanoma that is refractory to treatment with an anti-PD-1 inhibitor as well as patients naive to therapy in the metastatic setting. Recent biologic evidence indicates that optimal responses to programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) directed therapy require the presence of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment and thus therapies such as IMCgp100 that recruit these effector cells to the tumor may overcome pre-existing resistance to checkpoint blockade. This emerging biology of checkpoint inhibitor resistance suggests the combination of IMCgp100 with checkpoint inhibition may have enhanced activity in patients with pre-existing resistance.</brief_summary>
