	<detailed_description>Multimodal analgesia is widely advocated for the control of perioperative pain in an attempt to reduce the use of opioids and their side effects. Duloxetine is a selective inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake with demonstrated efficacy in chronic pain such as painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of duloxetine in fentanyl consumption during the postoperative period of patients undergoing elective spine surgery by intervertebral disc degeneration . Duloxetine as an analgesic agent in patients undergoing elective spine surgery: evaluation with fentanyl demand controlled by the patient. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of duloxetine in fentanyl consumption during the postoperative period of patients undergoing elective spine surgery by degenerative disc disease. Secondary endpoints were pain scores and the presence or absence of adverse effects such as headache, nausea, vomiting, itching, dizziness and drowsiness.</detailed_description>
