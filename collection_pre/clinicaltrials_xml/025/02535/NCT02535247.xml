	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, single-arm, open label 2-stage phase 2 study exploring monotherapy with the PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab (or MK-3475) given intravenously at a fixed dose of 200mg every 3 weeks for up to 36 cycles for patients with relapsed or refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL), who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy. The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival. Secondary outcomes are overall survival and response rate. Patients will be assessed for response with PET CT or CT every 12 weeks using the revised Cheson criteria. Correlative endpoints will be exploratory and assess PD-1 expression on peripheral blood lymphocytes; peripheral blood T-cell and NK-cell functional assays; PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on tumor tissue; and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as prognostic and predictive biomarkers.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Have a histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed/refractory mature Tcell lymphoma that has progressed after a minimum of 1 systemic therapy with any of the following Tcell histologies: Peripheral Tcell NHL, not other wise specified (PTCL, NOS) Anaplastic large cell Tcell lymphoma (ALCL) Anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive or negative Angioimmunoblastic Tcell lymphoma Subcutaneous panniculitis like Tcell lymphoma Enteropathy associated Tcell lymphoma Hepatosplenic Tcell lymphoma Extranodal NK/Tcell lymphoma, nasal type Adult Tcell leukemia/lymphoma; unclassifiable PTCL Transformed cutaneous Tcell lymphoma (CTCL) to PTCL with systemic involvement (not local skin transformation). 2. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial. 3. Be at least 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent. 4. Have measurable disease based as defined by at least one lesion that can be measured in least 2 perpendicular dimensions and measures at least 1.5 cm in its long axis. 5. Have provided tissue from an archival tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion obtained within 28 days prior to study enrollment. 6. Have a performance status of 0, 1 or 2 on the ECOG Performance Scale. 7. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined below, all screening labs should be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) Greater than or equal to 1,500 /mcL, OR Greater than or equal to1,000 /mcL if lymphomatous bone marrow involvement Patients with documented marrow involvement may receive GCSF to achieve this value Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000 / mcL, OR greater than or equal to 75,000 / mcL if lymphomatous bone marrow involvement Patients with documented marrow involvement may be transfused to this value. Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL or greater than or equal to 5.6 mmol/L Patients with documented marrow involvement may be transfused to this value. Serum creatinine OR Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) less than or equal to1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR greater than or equal to 60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels greater than 1.5 X institutional ULN Serum total bilirubin less than 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin less than the ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels greater than 1.5 ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 X ULN OR less than or equal to 5 X ULN for subjects with liver involvement by lymphoma International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants 8. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication (Reference Section 5.5.2). Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for greater than 1 year. 9. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. 1. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment. 2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. 3. Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., worse than Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. 4. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., â‰¤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. Note: Subjects with worse than Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy. 5. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy. 6. Has known active intraparenchymal lymphomatous central nervous system (CNS) lesions and/or lymphomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated CNS involvement by lymphoma may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain lesions, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. 7. Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjoegren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study. 8. Has evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, noninfectious pneumonitis. 9. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy. 10. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. 11. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial. 12. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the prescreening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment. 13. Has received prior therapy with an antiPD1, antiPDL1, antiPDL2, antiCD137, or antiCytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 (CTLA4) antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or checkpoint pathways). 14.

Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.</criteria>
