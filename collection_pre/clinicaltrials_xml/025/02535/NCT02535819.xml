	<brief_summary>Cataract is the clouding of the lens of the eye, which initially prevents clear vision and eventually progresses to blindness if left untreated. Cataract remains the leading cause of blindness and an important cause of visual impairment across the globe. Cataract surgery by ultrasonic phacoemulsification is the most common surgery practiced in France (600 000/year) Two sub-categories of phacoemulsification coexist : Endocapsulars techniques represented by Divide-and-Conquer and Phaco-Chop ; and Supracapsular techniques mainly represented by Subluxation (similar to Tilt-and-Tumble) The corneal endothelium plays an important role in maintaining the dehydrated state and the transparency of the cornea. Some degree of endothelial cell loss invariably occurs in all types of cataract surgery but the amount of endothelial cell loss may varies with the type of surgical technique The aim of the study is to evaluate the density of the central corneal endothelial cells before and after cataract surgery comparing two phacoemulsification techniques (Divide-and-Conquer vs Subluxation)</brief_summary>
