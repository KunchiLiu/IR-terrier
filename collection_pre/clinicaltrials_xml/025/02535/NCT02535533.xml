	<brief_title>SLM + Axitinib for Clear Cell RCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1 trial for safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination of axitinib and selenomethionine (SLM) for adult patients with advanced metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC). This will be a two part study consisting of a dose escalation and expansion study. Dose-Escalation Part 1 (6-12 patients) : SLM will be given twice daily for 14 days followed by SLM once daily in combination with axitinib 5 mg twice daily with titration according to package insert in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Expansion Part 2: In this phase (approximately 19 patients), will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SLM determined in the Escalation Part 1. It will be given orally twice daily for 14 days, followed by SLM once daily in combination with axitinib 5 mg twice daily with titration according to package insert in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
