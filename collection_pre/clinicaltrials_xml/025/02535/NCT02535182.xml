	<brief_summary>This is a an ancillary study designed to explore whether an additional cell signaling pathway (prenylation of Rap1) that was recently identified as being under beta-adrenergic control may be affected by beta-blocker use.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Using Propranolol To Promote Prenylation Of The Gtpase Rap1b In Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a proof of concept randomized controlled pilot study assessing whether prenylation and membrane localization of Rap1 in PBMCs can be altered in individuals undergoing autologous HCT for MM by administering a daily beta-blocker (propranolol) to 20 participants. Outcomes of patients on this clinical trial will be compared to 20 participants in a control arm.</detailed_description>
