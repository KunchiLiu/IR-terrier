	<brief_title>Clearblue Advanced Fertility Monitor Consumer Three Cycle at Home Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Clearblue Fertility Monitor is a personal monitor designed to be used with disposable test sticks for the semi-quantitative measurement of estrone-3-glucuronide (E3G) and luteinising hormone (LH) in women's urine. This personal information allows women to identify their fertile window and appropriately time intercourse in order to maximise their chances of conception. A new version of this monitor (Clearblue Advance Fertility Monitor) has been developed with enhanced functionality including the option to test for pregnancy. This study will assess the use of the new Clearblue Advanced Fertility Monitor in a home setting by female volunteers seeking to become pregnant, for three menstrual cycles or until pregnancy is achieved (whichever comes first). This is a single centre clinical study which will be conducted by volunteers at their residence and co-ordinated by the clinical department at SPD Development Company Ltd. The overall objective of the study will be to demonstrate the usage of the new Clearblue Advanced Fertility Monitor in a home setting, to assess the benefits of monitor usage and to compare monitor data to laboratory analyses on the same urine samples. In order to achieve these objectives, a minimum of 200 female volunteers representing the target consumer will be recruited to use the new Clearblue Advanced Fertility Monitor at home as per the instructions for use. This will involve them setting up the monitor, using the monitor for the duration of the study.. All volunteers will be required to complete a daily diary and to collect a daily urine sample. Volunteers who become pregnant on the study will be asked to continue to collect urine samples. At the end of the study all volunteers will complete a study questionnaire which includes questions relating to monitor usage and knowledge and behaviour regarding conception. Upon return to SPD, the urine samples will be tested by auto-analyser for various hormones.</detailed_description>
