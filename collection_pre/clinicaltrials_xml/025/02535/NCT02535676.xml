	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation) for treatment of negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The proposed design is a clinical trial, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants will receive ten sessions of active or sham stimulation in five consecutive days. 100 patients will be randomized into two groups (active tDCS vs sham tDCS) and will be assessed after the intervention: 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks after. As objectives, the investigators expect to see a clinical improvement of negative symptoms through scales PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale), Calgary, Auditory verbal hallucinations, SANS (Skills for Assessment of Negative Symptoms), and expect improvement on computerized cognitive tests. Another goal is to see improvement in biological markers related to schizophrenia, plasma and DNA will be stored.</brief_summary>
