	<detailed_description>This study aims to do the following: 1. To evaluate whether a health education and coaching strategy in overweight and obese adolescents (≥85th percentile) with high risk for type 2 diabetes is superior to usual care (single nutrition consultation) for weight management, clinical health outcomes (measures of glucose tolerance), lifestyle behavior outcomes (diet and physical activity) and outcomes of importance to patients such as satisfaction with the health care team, treatment goals, and psychosocial functioning. 2. To evaluate whether a health education and coaching strategy in obese adolescents with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) is superior to usual care (single nutrition consultation) for weight management, clinical health outcomes (measures of diabetes control), lifestyle behavior outcomes (diet and physical activity) and outcomes of importance to patients such as satisfaction with the health care team, treatment goals, and psychosocial functioning. 3. At baseline, before the interventions described in Aims 1 and 2, to identify key diet and physical activity factors, patient characteristics, or biomarkers which are predictive of diabetes risk. 4. At baseline, before the interventions described in Aims 1 and 2, can associations between glycemia, cardiometabolic risk factors, and diet and physical activity behaviors in overweight and obese adolescents who are at risk for type 2 diabetes be identified using the Bright Futures questionnaire, a survey for lifestyle behavior which is normally used in the clinic setting.</detailed_description>
