	<brief_summary>Allergy is a very common problem and can be a handicap in everyday life, specially when symptoms occur at work place. Some persons working with drosophila developed respiratory symptoms. Investigators tried to analyze if these manifestations could be due to a specific allergy to drosophila.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterisation of Occupational Allergy to Drosophila</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To do so, investigators invited laboratory workers who presented any symptoms in presence of drosophila to undergo skin prick tests in order to determine if a specific sensibilization to drosophila exists. Then, a blood sample is taken from these persons to research specific IgE directed against drosophila. By this way, investigators hope determine if a specific allergy to drosophila exists, its characteristics as prevalence, symptoms, populations concerned...in order to better protect laboratory workers and prevent allergy incidence.</detailed_description>
