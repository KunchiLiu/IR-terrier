	<brief_summary>A Phase III, multi-centre, double-blind randomised controlled trial in subjects with chronic antibiotic refractory pouchitis. Subjects will undertake a &lt;2 week screening period to provide baseline data and be assessed for eligibility. At the Baseline visit (Day 1) eligible subjects will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to either a) 240 mg alicaforsen enema or b) matching placebo. Study drug will be administered once nightly (on going to bed) up to and including week 6. Following the Day 1 Visit, subjects will return to the clinic for safety and efficacy assessments at Week 3, 6, 10, 18 and 26. Subjects may receive certain permitted medications as per Entry Criteria, which must remain at stable doses throughout the trial. Introduction of any new medication for pouchitis, or a dose change to an existing concomitant medication for pouchitis, other than those detailed in the protocol, will not be permitted. Clinical symptoms associated with pouchitis will be recorded daily by the patient in a diary card. Subjects will undergo endoscopic examination of their pouch (during Screening, and at Weeks 6 and 10). Where technically feasible, each endoscopy will provide at least one biopsy sample for histopathology. In addition to endoscopic, histopathologic and symptomatic assessments, Quality of Life will be assessed. Bloods for routine assessment, including haematology and biochemistry will be taken. Bloods and stool samples will be collected to evaluate relevant biomarkers.</brief_summary>
