	<brief_summary>Epidemiological studies have shown obesity to be a risk factor of asthma. Research evidence of obesity and atopic(ie. allergic)-related respiratory diseases, has been less clear. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the relationship between obesity and atopic-related respiratory disease in premenopausal women is mediated by a dietary imbalance of omega 6 and 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sixty young adult obese and non obese women, with, and without asthma, were studied using a cross-sectional design. Body composition was measured by plethysmography. A fasted blood sample was taken to measure: specific and total immunoglobulin (IgE) antibodies,biochemical markers of atopy; glucose and insulin to measure insulin sensitivity; estrogen(17β-estradiol) and sex hormone-binding globulin to measure estrogen status of the women; hormone-products of fat tissue ( leptin, adiponectin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukins (IL-6,IL-18), that have been associated with both obesity and immune processes involved in asthma and allergy. Dietary intake of omega 6: linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid(AA); and omega 3 fatty acids: α linolenic (ALA), eicosapentanoic (EPA) and docosahexanoic (DHA) and other nutrients were assessed by food frequency questionnaire.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For asthmatics, only individuals that were willing and capable of not using asthma medications for two days prior to laboratory testing. An individual was excluded from the study if she had a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, cigarette smoking, or eating disorders.
