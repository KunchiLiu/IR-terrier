	<brief_title>A Study of Enzalutamide in Combination With AZD5363 in Patients With mCRPC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with mCRPC will receive enzalutamide and AZD5363 (or enzalutamide and placebo in the randomised phase II) until confirmed disease progression. The trial aims to identify the safety and tolerability of enzalutamide and AZD5363 and identify recommended phase II dose of AZD5363 (phase I safety run-in). The randomised phase II will estimate and compare the anti-tumour activity of AZD5363 and enzalutamide, and placebo and enzalutamide as measured by response. The single stage phase II expansion cohort will estimate the anti-tumour activity of AZD5363 and enzalutamide in patients who have previously progressed on enzalutamide alone.</detailed_description>

Any other therapies for prostate cancer, other than Gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH) analogue therapy, such as progesterone, medroxyprogesterone, progestins (megestrol), or 5‐alpha reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride or dutasteride), must be discontinued at least 2 weeks before the first dose of study drug. 4. Participation in another clinical trial and any concurrent treatment with any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to trial entry / randomisation. 5. Prior limited field radiotherapy within 2 weeks or wide field radiotherapy within 4 weeks of trial entry / randomisation. 6.

History of loss of consciousness or transient ischemic attack within the previous 12 months of trial entry / randomisation. 8. Known brain or leptomeningeal involvement. 9. Use of potent inhibitors or inducers of Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19) (see Appendix B) within 2 weeks before trial entry / randomisation (3 weeks for St John's Wort) must be avoided. 10. Clinically significant abnormalities of glucose metabolism as defined by any of the following: 1. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type I or II (irrespective of management). 2. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C) ≥8.0% at screening (64 mmol/mol) (conversion equation for HbA1C [IFCC‐HbA1C (mmol/mol) = [DCCT‐HbA1C (%) 2.15] x 10.929) 3.

Patients in which corticosteroids cannot be stopped prior to entering the trial are allowed a maximum of 10mg of prednisolone per day or equivalent. In the case of corticosteroid discontinuation, a 2‐week (14 days) washout is required with a mandatory PSA check prior to starting the trial. If the PSA has declined compared to the value obtained prior to stopping corticosteroids, patients will not be eligible for study. Patients can only enter the study with a confirmed PSA increase. 18.
