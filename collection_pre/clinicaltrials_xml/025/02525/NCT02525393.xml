	<brief_summary>Patients were randomized in 3 groups: two intervent groups and a control group. The first group received two weeks of daily session of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS, 10 sessions) and, at least 6 months after, two weeks of daily transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS, 10 sessions); the second group received 10 daily session of tDCS and, after at least 6 months, 10 sessions of rTMS; the control group received 10 daily session of sham tDCS. Physiatric evaluations (ARAT scale), neuropsychological assessment and ERP (P300) were performed before (1 week) and after (1 week) the end of each treatment. Furthermore, all patients underwent follow-up neuropsychological assessment 6 months after the end of each stimulation period and follow-up physiatric evaluation at 3 and 6 months after the end of each stimulation period.</brief_summary>
