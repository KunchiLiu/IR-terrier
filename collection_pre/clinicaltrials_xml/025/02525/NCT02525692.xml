	<brief_summary>ONC201 is a new drug candidate that kills cancer cells but not normal cells in laboratory studies and completed a phase I clinical trial in advanced cancer patients. This clinical trial will be the first phase II clinical trial of ONC201 that will specifically enroll patients with advanced glioblastoma.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Glioblastoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Histologically confirmed World Health Organization Grade IV glioblastoma. Unequivocal evidence of progressive disease on contrastenhanced brain computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as defined by Response Assessment in NeuroOncology Criteria (RANO), or have documented recurrent glioblastoma on diagnostic biopsy. Previous first line therapy with at least radiotherapy and temozolomide. For Arm A: Any number of recurrences are allowable. For Arm B: First recurrence (only) glioblastoma who had a complete tumor resection at first diagnosis. For Arm C: Patients must have clinical and/or radiographic evidence of first recurrence of glioblastoma (only) and be eligible for salvage surgical resection as deemed by the site Investigator. Must be 12 weeks from radiotherapy. If patients are within 12 weeks of radiotherapy, then the progressive lesion must be outside of the highdose radiation target volume or have unequivocal evidence of progressive tumor on a biopsy specimen. From the projected start of scheduled study treatment, the following time periods must have elapsed: 5 halflives from any investigational agent, 4 weeks from cytotoxic therapy (except 23 days for temozolomide and 6 weeks from nitrosoureas), 6 weeks from antibodies, or 4 weeks (or 5 halflives, whichever is shorter) from other antitumor therapies. All adverse events Grade &gt; 1 related to prior therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or surgery) must be resolved, except for alopecia. Male or Female age ≥18 years. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 60% (see Appendix A). Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below, all screening labs should be performed within 14 days of treatment initiation: leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 mg/dL total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 x upper limit of normal AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤2.5 × upper limit of normal creatinine OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above normal. CT or MRI within 14 days prior to start of study drug. Corticosteroid dose must be stable or decreasing for at least 5 days prior to the scan. For Arm B: Corticosteroid dose must be stable or decreasing for at least 2 weeks prior to study entry. The effects of ONC201 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Male subjects should agree to use adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of therapy. Archival tissue for evaluation of correlative objectives (if available). Archival tissue is required for Arms B and C. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ONC201 or its excipients. Current or planned participation in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Active infection requiring systemic therapy. Prior stereotactic radiotherapy, convection enhanced delivery (CED) or brachytherapy must have had a biopsy to confirm radiographic progression is consistent with progressive tumor and not treatmentrelated necrosis. If the recurrent lesion is outside of any prior highdose radiation target volume or distant from the prior CED or brachytherapy site, subjects will be considered eligible Pregnant women because ONC201 is novel agent with unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ONC201, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ONC201. Known HIVpositive test on combination antiretroviral therapy. Known history of cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmias or bradycardia. Receiving therapeutic agents known to prolong QT interval will be excluded. History of CHF, or MI or stroke in the last 3 months will be excluded. Active illicit drug use or diagnosis of alcoholism. Prior bevacizumab for treatment of glioblastoma. The rationale for restricting enrollment to patients who have not had prior bevacizumab therapy is that data regarding the efficacy of any therapy after progression on bevacizumab therapy are lacking. Tumors with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or IDH2 mutations as determined by immunohistochemistry for the IDH1 R132H variant or by direct sequencing. IDH1/2mutant gliomas have a markedly longer overall survival rate compared to those with IDH1/2wildtype glioma (Parsons et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2009), indicating IDH1/2mutant gliomas have a distinct natural history. Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment within 3 years of start of study drug. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy. Any surgery (not including minor diagnostic procedures such as lymph node biopsy) within 2 weeks of baseline disease assessments; or not fully recovered from any side effects of previous procedures. Concomitant use of CYP3A4/5 inhibitors during the treatment phase of the study and within 72 hours prior to starting study drug administration. Concomitant use of potent CYP3A4/5 inducers, which include enzyme inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (see Appendix B), during the treatment phase of the study and within 2 weeks prior to starting treatment.</criteria>
