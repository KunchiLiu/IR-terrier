	<brief_title>Deceased Organ Donor Interventions to Protect Kidney Graft Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number of kidneys available for transplantation in the U.S. (~15,000/yr) does not meet demand (~80,000/yr). This discrepancy will likely worsen given the increasing U.S. prevalence of chronic kidney disease and is compounded by sizable organ attrition once organs have entered the donation process (25-30% attrition in Region 5). Furthermore, worsening renal function in donation after neurologic determination of death (DNDD) organ donors (an increasingly important source of allografts) is one of the strongest predictors of delayed graft function (DGF) and slow graft function (SGF) in the recipient. Both DGF and SGF are associated with decreased long-term organ survival and are of major concern to the transplant community. The investigators will accomplish this goal by extending an existing research infrastructure across several donor service areas. Infrastructure and logistics will be based on the investigators' successful completion of NCT01680744.</detailed_description>
