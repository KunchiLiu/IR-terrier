	<brief_summary>There is a dearth of research which takes a multi-compound approach to dietary interventions, in humans, aimed at improving outcome measures of cognition. Animal research in particular points towards fatty acids and flavonoids having a potentiating effect on each other, and possibly even being synergistic. Thus, study products will be administered in the present trial comprising both of these compounds, with a view to investigating their potential effects on cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective memory impairment (SMI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Cognitive Ageing Nutrition and Neurogenesis (CANN) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>240 participants, aged 55 or above, will be recruited (120 Norwich, 120 Melbourne; to include both MCI and SCI participants). Participants will be asked to take the study food each day for 12 months, and to come to the clinical assessment unit on 3 occasions, at baseline, 3 months and 12 months, to complete a cognitive task battery such that their performance may be investigated in the context of the intervention. Urine, blood and faecal samples will be collected and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be applicable to half of each population (i.e to 60 MCI and 60 SCI, 30 of each at Norwich and Melbourne).</detailed_description>
