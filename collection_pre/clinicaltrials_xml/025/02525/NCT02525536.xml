	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Trebananib (AMG 386 ) in Adult Japanese Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called trebananib (AMG 386). Trebananib (AMG 386) is being tested to treat people with advanced solid tumors. This study will look at the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of trebananib and response to treatment. The study will enroll approximately 18 participants. Once enrolled, participants will be assigned sequentially into 1 of the 3 cohorts: - Trebananib 3 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg), - Trebananib 10 mg/kg, - Trebananib 30 mg/kg. All participants will receive trebananib via 60 minute intravenous infusion. This study will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study is 14 weeks or more. Participants will attend the end-of-treatment visit 28 days after the last dose of study drug.</detailed_description>

C. Hepatic function, as follows: • AST &lt;=2.5*ULN (if liver metastases are present, &lt;=5*ULN). • ALT &lt;=2.5*ULN (if liver metastases are present, &lt;=5*ULN). • Alkaline phosphatase &lt;=2.0*ULN (if bone or liver metastates present &lt;=5*ULN). • Total bilirubin &lt;=2.0*ULN.

Life expectancy of 3 months, in the judgment of the investigator. 1. Has primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors, including any CNS lymphoma. 2. Has history of CNS metastases (including previously treated metastases) (The brain imaging test by CT or MRI will be performed at screening. If the imaging test was performed within 3 months prior to written informed consent, the result can be used to confirm the exclusion criterion.) 3. Has hematological malignancies. 4. Has unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy, defined as having not resolved to CTCAE grade 0 or 1, or to levels specified in the inclusion/exclusion criteria with the exception of alopecia. 5.

Has uncontrolled hypertension [diastolic &gt;90 millimeter of mercury [mmHg]; systolic &gt;150 mmHg]. Participant on antihypertensive medication must meet these parameters on a stable antihypertensive. 7. Has history of arterial or venous (deep vein) thrombosis within 1 year before enrollment. 8. Has presence of ascites or pleural effusion requiring medical intervention (example, drainage.) 9. Has history of bleeding diathesis or clinically significant bleeding including hemoptysis within 6 months of enrollment. 10. Has nonhealing wound, ulcer or fracture. 11. With head and neck cancer. 12. Has squamous cell tumor or lung cancer with large central (located adjacent to or within the hilum or mediastinum) tumor lesions &gt;=3 centimeter (cm), regardless of histology. 13. Has positive test for human immunodeficiency virus infection. 14. Has positive test for hepatitis C virus infection (positive hepatitis C virus antibody [HCVAb] or hepatitis B infection (positive hepatitis B virus antigen [HBsAg] or positive hepatitis B virus antibody [HBcAb])). 15. Had major surgery (requiring general anesthesia) within 4 weeks before enrollment. 16. Has minor surgery, placement of central venous catheter, or fine needle aspiration within 7 days prior to enrollment. 17. Is unable to tolerate IV administration, in the judgment of the investigator. 18. Has prior antitumor therapies, defined as: •Treatment with tumor directed antibody therapy within 4 weeks prior to Study Day 1, with the exception of bevacizumab and other monoclonal antibodies with a halflife &gt;10 days, which must be discontinued at least 8 weeks prior to Study Day 1. •Anticancer therapy including chemotherapy and retinoid therapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin) before Study Day 1. •Hormonal antitumor therapy within 4 weeks before Study Day 1. Does not include hormones for noncancer related conditions (example, insulin for diabetes, hormone replacement therapy). •Therapeutic or palliative radiation therapy within 4 weeks before Study Day 1 (participants must have resolution of any significant adverse effects from radiation therapy received prior to 2 weeks before Study Day 1). 19. Has any elective surgeries scheduled during their participation in the study. 20. Has prior radiation to abdomen. 21. Has concurrent or prior (within 4 weeks before Study Day 1) anticoagulation therapy excluding aspirin and antiplatelet agents. The concurrent use of low molecular weight heparin or low dose warfarin (&lt;=1 mg daily) for prophylaxis against thrombosis is acceptable. 22.
