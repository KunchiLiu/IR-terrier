	<brief_summary>Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most effective medical procedures. Except for the few early complications (acute infections and dislocations), the patient made a PTH can be assured of a significant improvement in its function and its short-term quality of life. However, clinical studies and records have shown that the lifetime of these implants was limited. The main cause of failure is the "aseptic loosening" influenced by many factors, foremost of which is due to periprosthetic osteolysis debris. This is a major concern for orthopedic surgeons loosening leads, in most cases, the recovery, the importance of osteolysis is a major cause of difficulties and poorer results. The main objective of the study is to compare, 2 years after the intervention, the penetration of the femoral head in the polyethylene and X3 in the acetabulum in N2VACÂ® conventional polyethylene.</brief_summary>
