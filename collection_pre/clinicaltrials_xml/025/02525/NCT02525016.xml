	<brief_summary>Intravenous lidocaine is efficient for management of post operative pain in abdominal surgery. As previously published in literature the investigators use it during bariatric surgery. Nevertheless plasmatic concentration of lidocaine is unknown in this population, despite a widespread use. Investigators propose in this work to bring an objective proof that administration of lidocaine based on a modified body weight is safe. Intravenous administration concerned the peri operative period. A total of six samples are taken for each patient. Investigators get approbation of local ethic committee for this work.</brief_summary>
