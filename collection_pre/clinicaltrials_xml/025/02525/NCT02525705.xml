	<brief_title>Dumping Syndrome After Operation of Esophageal Atresia Type III</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutive patients with type III and IV oesophageal atresia that are born in 8 different centers in France and Sydney (Australia) are included in the study, if willing. As soon as they weigh more than 4.150kg and if they are still younger than 3.5 months, an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) is performed. Glycemia and insulinemia are monitored every 30 minutes from intake to 240 minutes. Clinical signs that are presented are noted. If early hyperglycemia or late hypoglycemia are biologically or clinically observed, ascarbose treatment is initiated.</detailed_description>
