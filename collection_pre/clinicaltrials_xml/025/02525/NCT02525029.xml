	<criteria>Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) fitting one of the following categories: HighRisk aGVHD (ARM 1): Pediatric or adult (ages 1276 years) HCT recipients with highrisk acute GVHD, as determined by the refined MN acute GVHD risk score: http://z.umn.edu/MNAcuteGVHDRiskScore. Patients in this arm must start treatment within the first 7 days after onset of highrisk aGVHD. or SteroidRefractory aGVHD (ARM 2): Pediatric or adult (ages 1276 years) HCT recipient with grade IIIV steroid refractory or steroiddependent acute GVHD, defined as any one of the following: No response of acute GVHD after at least 4 days of systemic corticosteroids of at least 2 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent Progression of acute GVHD within 3 days of systemic corticosteroids of at least 2 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent Failure to improve to at least grade II acute GVHD after 14 days of systemic corticosteroids, with initial doses of at least 2 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent Flare of acute GVHD of at least grade II/IV severity despite tapering dose of steroids being &gt; 0.5 mg/kg/day. Adequate organ function at study enrollment defined as: Renal: 1.73m2Serum creatinine ≤2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 35% Voluntary written consent (adult or parent/guardian with minor assent for 12 through 17 year olds) Progressive malignancy Diagnosis of a hormone responsive malignancy Uncontrolled infection at initiation of protocol treatment Current thromboembolic disease requiring fulldose anticoagulation patients receiving pharmacologic prophylaxis for thromboembolic disease will be eligible Active or recent (within prior 3 months) thrombus, irrespective of anticoagulation status Pregnancy as assessed on baseline blood hCG level Unwilling or unable to stop supplemental sex hormone therapy (estrogen, progesterone, and/or testosterone preparations) Women or men of childbearing potential unwilling to take adequate precautions to avoid pregnancy from the start of protocol treatment through 28 days after the last treatment</criteria>
