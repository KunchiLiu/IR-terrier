	<brief_summary>Constitutional thinness (CT) is a recently defined entity as a differential diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN), considered to be the most frequent cause of low body mass index (BMI) in young women. CT subjects present no AN psychiatric traits, preserved menses, no biological signs of undernutrition and balanced energy metabolism despite a Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt;17 kg / m². CT familial aggregation, low body mass without a hormonal explanation, and specific appetite regulation profile suggest a specific genetic profile in these subjects. Objective: A family linkage study in order to identify genes involved in the constitutional thinness phenotype by using genome wide scan (GWAS) techniques Studied population: Fifty families including at least one well phenotyped CT index case (grade 2 or 3 of thinness according WHO classification). Blood or saliva is sampled for DNA extraction. Perspectives: Revealing eventual abnormalities could lead to a more precise diagnosis of constitutional thinness and new hypothesis in understanding extreme bodyweight mechanisms.</brief_summary>
