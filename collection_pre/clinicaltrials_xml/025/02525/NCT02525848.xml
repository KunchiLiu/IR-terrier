	<brief_title>Aprepitant Versus Gabapentin Prophylaxis for Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Laparoscopic Gynecological Surgeries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is frequently encountered in the surgical recovery room. Laparoscopic surgery is one important risk factor for increased incidence of PONV. Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant with known postoperative analgesic properties, has shown some activity against PONV. Results from clinical trials evaluating the anti-emetic efficacy of gabapentin are conflicting. Aprepitant, a neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist, blockades the central effects of substance P. Substance P is a neurotransmitter found in central areas associated with emesis such as the dorsal vagal complex and area postrema.</detailed_description>
