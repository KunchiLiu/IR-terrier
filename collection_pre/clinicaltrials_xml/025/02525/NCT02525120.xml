	<brief_title>Post Market Non-Inferiority Study Comparing Triojection® to Discectomy for Lumbar Disc Herniation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to compare clinical, economic and safety outcomes between Triojection and surgical discectomy. The study will include two follow-up phases: 1) an initial follow-up period during the first 6 months after treatment and (2) a long-term follow-up lasting an additional 18 months (2 years total). The hypothesis is that over the first six months after treatment, Triojection® will be non-inferior to discectomy with respect to the improvement in leg pain. This will be demonstrated using a non-inferiority margin of 19.4 points on the difference between baseline leg pain score and the average leg pain score recorded at 1 week, 1, 3 and 6 months.</detailed_description>
