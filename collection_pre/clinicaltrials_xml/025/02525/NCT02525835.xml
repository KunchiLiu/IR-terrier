	<detailed_description>This pilot study will test the hypothesis that a low sodium diet will decrease 23Na magnetic resonance imaging-determined skin sodium concentrations in patients with SLE and improve blood pressure and inflammation. Investigators plan to enroll 21 participants who will be randomized to low salt or high salt diet. Participants will eat the first diet for 28 days, and after a 2 week washout, Participants will eat the second diet (whichever the participant was not randomized to for the first phase). Participant will know what diet participant is on, study coordinator who does the assessment will be blinded to diet.</detailed_description>
