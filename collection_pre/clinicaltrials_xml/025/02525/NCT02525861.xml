	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is two-fold: (1) to further evaluate the safety and potential immunogenicity of GLASSIA following IV administration via in-line filtration; and, (2) to assess the effects of GLASSIA augmentation therapy on the levels of A1PI and various biomarkers in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) following intravenous (IV) administration at a dosage of 60 mg/kg Body weight (BW)/week active A1PI protein for 25 weeks in subjects with emphysema due to congenital A1PI deficiency.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Male or female: 1. For participants who will undergo bronchoscopy/BAL procedures: 18 to 65 years of age. 2. For participants who will be waived from undergoing bronchoscopy/BAL procedures (after adequate number of BAL evaluable participants has been reached): 18 years of age or older. 2. A1PI genotype of Pi*Z/Z, Pi*Z/Null, Pi*Malton/Z, Pi*Null/Null, or other "atrisk" allelic combinations (excluding MS, MZ, and SZ) 3. Endogenous plasma (antigenic) A1PI level of &lt;8 μM. 4. Participant must have at least one of the following: clinical diagnosis of emphysema, evidence of emphysema on computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest, and/or evidence of airway obstruction which is not completely reversed with bronchodilator treatment at the time of screening. 5. Participant is being treated with any respiratory medications including inhaled bronchodilators, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, or lowdose systemic corticosteroids (prednisone ≤10 mg/day or its equivalent), the doses of the participant's medications have remained unchanged for at least 14 days prior to screening. 6. Participant is a nonsmoker or has ceased smoking for a minimum of 13 weeks prior to screening (serum cotinine level at screening within normal range of a nonsmoker) and agrees to refrain from smoking throughout the course of the study. 7. If female of childbearing potential, the participant presents with a negative pregnancy test at screening and agrees to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of the study. 8. Participant is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol. 9. Participant must have pulmonary function at the time of screening meeting both of the following: 1. Postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥50% of predicted 2. If FEV1 is &gt;80% predicted, then FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) must be &lt;0.7. **Note: Inclusion criterion #8 is not applicable to participants who are enrolled after the target of 15 to 18 evaluable participants has been reached and who are therefore not required to undergo the bronchoscopy/BAL procedures. 1. Participant is experiencing or has a history of clinically significant pulmonary disease (other than COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, mild bronchiectasis, and stable asthma). 2. Participant is experiencing or has a history of cor pulmonale. 3. Participant routinely produces more than one tablespoon of sputum per day. 4. Participant has a history of frequent pulmonary exacerbations (greater than 2 moderate or severe exacerbations within 52 weeks prior to screening. 5. Participant is experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation at the time of screening (participant may be rescreened 4 weeks after the clinical resolution of an exacerbation). 6. Participant has clinically significant abnormalities (other than emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or mild bronchiectasis) detected on chest Xray or CT scan at the time of screening. (Past records obtained within 52 weeks prior to screening may be used, if available.) 7. Participant has clinically significant abnormalities detected on a 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at the time of screening. (Past records obtained within 26 weeks prior to screening may be used, if available.) 8. Participant has clinically significant congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III/IV symptoms. 9. Participant is experiencing an active malignancy or has a history of malignancy within 5 years prior to screening, with the exception of the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or stable prostate cancer not requiring treatment. 10. Participant has a history of lung or other organ transplant, is currently on a transplant list, or has undergone major lung surgery. 11. Participant is receiving longterm aroundtheclock oxygen supplementation. (The following are allowed: shortterm use of oxygen supplementation (eg, for the management of acute COPD exacerbation), oxygen supplementation required during night time only, and supplemental oxygen with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)). 12. Known history of hypersensitivity following infusions of human blood or blood components. 13. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency (&lt;8 mg/dL at screening). 14. Abnormal clinical laboratory results obtained at the time of screening meeting any of the following criteria: 1. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3.0 times upper limit of normal (ULN) 2. Serum total bilirubin &gt;2.0 times ULN 3. &gt;2+ proteinuria on urine dipstick analysis 4. Serum creatinine &gt;2.0 times ULN 5. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1500 cells/mm^3 6. Hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt;9.0 g/dL 7. Platelet count &lt;100,000/mm^3 15. Ongoing active infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Type 1/2 infection at the time of screening. 16. Participant has any clinically significant medical, psychiatric, or cognitive illness, or any other uncontrolled medical condition (eg, unstable angina, transient ischemic attack) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would impede the participant's ability to comply with the study procedures, pose increased risk to the participant's safety, or confound the interpretation of study results. 17. Participant has participated in another clinical study involving an investigational product or investigational device within 30 days prior to enrollment or is scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an investigational product or device during the course of this study. 18. Participant is a family member or employee of the investigator. 19. If female, the participant is nursing at the time of screening. 20. Participant has contraindication(s) to bronchoscopy such as recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, other cardiopulmonary instability, tracheal obstruction or stenosis, moderate to severe hypoxemia or any degree of hypercapnia, unstable asthma, Stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease, pulmonary hypertension, severe hemorrhagic diathesis, and cervical C1/C2 arthritis. 21. Participant has had lung surgery which may interfere with bronchoscopy. 22. Known history of allergic/hypersensitivity reactions to medications used during and for perioperative care associated with the bronchoscopy/BAL procedures, such as local anesthetics, sedatives, pain control medications. 23. Participant is receiving or requires longterm (&gt;4 weeks) immunosuppressive therapy, such as systemic corticosteroids at doses greater than 10 mg/day of prednisone (or its equivalent), mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. 24. If a participant is receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy (such as warfarin and clopidogrel), the participant is unwilling to or unable to safely discontinue anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy within 7 days prior to until at least 24 hours after the BAL procedures. An exception is lowdose aspirin alone which is allowed. Note: Exclusion criteria #20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 are not applicable to participants who are enrolled after the target of 15 to 18 evaluable participants has been reached and who are therefore not required to undergo the bronchoscopy/BAL procedures.</criteria>
