	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of albumin-bound paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in patients with advanced squamous cell lung cancers. The investigators would like to determine the percentage of patients with squamous cell lung cancers who experience shrinkage of their tumors following treatment with this regimen. This combination of drugs is not a standard therapy for patients with squamous cell lung cancers. However, each of these drugs, when given alone or with other chemotherapies, is FDA-approved for the treatment of this disease.</brief_summary>
