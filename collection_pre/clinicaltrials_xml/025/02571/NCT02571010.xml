	<brief_summary>This study aims to demonstrate that somatosensory rehabilitation of pain associated with static mechanical allodynia has superior efficacy over placebo treatment as well as over spontaneous changes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Efficacy of Somatosensory Rehabilitation of Pain by Vibrotactile Stimulation on Static Mechanical Allodynia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a monocenter study. 45 patients will be enrolled in the study, allocated by randomization in 3 arms of 15 patients each. During the 38 week duration of the study, enrolled patients will be assessed at: - initial evaluation (first week of the study), - intermediary evaluation for every week and every modification of intensity of pain, - final evaluation at 10 weeks, - follow-up evaluation at 6 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria 1. Male or female patients aged ≥18 years; 2. Static mechanical allodynia for less than 3 months, whatever its etiology and topography; 3. Probable peripheral or central neuropathic pain or defined according to the IASP criteria; 4. Neuropathic pain diagnostic questionnaire DN4 score ≥ 4/10; 5. Chronic pain with average intensity ≥ 4/10; 6. Analgesic treatment unchanged within 15 days prior to screening, and not planned to be modified during the study; 7. Patient who can attend followup visits during the study; 8. Patient affiliated to a health insurance plan or entitled; 9. Patient must be able to give informed consent in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines and local legislation and/or regulations. 1. Patient with neuralgia (spontaneous pain) with or without allodynia; 2. Patient not able to participate actively to the rehabilitation exercises for physical reason, cognitive reason (ability to understand instructions) or behavioural reason (e.g. addiction...); 3. Patient with complex regional pain syndrome (type I); 4. Patients for whom cares cannot avoid any touch with allodynia area; 5. Patient previously treated by a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS); 6. Prior treatment by somatosensory rehabilitation; 7. Duration of stay in the medical center &lt; 11 weeks; 8. Patient with cognitive disorder; 9. Allodynia area of the patient presenting with conditions not recommended for vibrotactile stimulation: wound, unhealed nerve suture, recent skin transplantation, fragile organ such as eye.</criteria>
