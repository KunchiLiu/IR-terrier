	<brief_summary>Trial name: PAracetamol and NSAID in combination: A randomised, blinded, parallel, 4-group clinical trial Trial acronym: PANSAID Background: Effective postoperative pain management is essential for the well-being and rehabilitation of the surgical patient. No "gold standard" exists after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and combinations of different non-opioid medications are used with virtually no evidence for additional analgesic efficacy compared to monotherapy. Objectives: The objective of this trial is to investigate the analgesic effects and safety of paracetamol and ibuprofen and their combination in different dosages after THA. Intervention: Patients are randomised to 4 groups: A) paracetamol 1 g x 4 and ibuprofen 400 mg x 4; B) paracetamol 1 g x 4 and placebo (ibuprofen); C) placebo (paracetamol) and ibuprofen 400 mg x 4; and D) paracetamol 0,5 g x 4 and ibuprofen 200 mg. Design: Placebo controlled, parallel 4-group, multicentre trial with adequate centralised computer-generated allocation sequence and allocation concealment with varying block size and stratification by site. Blinding of assessor, investigator, caregivers, patients, and statisticians. Sample size: 556 eligible patients are needed to detect a difference of 10 mg morphine the first postoperative day with a standard deviation of 20 mg and a type 1 error rate of 0,004 (two-sided) and a type 2 error rate of 0,10. We preplan the following sub-studies: 1. A re-analysis of benefit outcomes (pain and opioid consumption) with respect to the following sub-groups: sex, age, ASA-score, type of surgery (uncemented, cemented, or hybrid), surgical site (posterior approach vs. anterolateral approach) and anaesthetic technique (general anaesthesia vs. spinal anaesthesia) 2. A re-analysis of harm (adverse events and opioid related side effects) with respect to the following groups sex, age, ASA-score anaesthetic technique (general anaesthesia vs. spinal anaesthesia) and opioid consumption (in the intervention period). 3. Longer follow-up than the specified 90 days (1 year) 4. An analysis of the association between VAS-scores and opioid consumption 5. Time-to-event analyses regarding use of PCA-morphine 6. An analysis of the association between preoperative analgesic use and pain/morphine consumption 7. An analysis of the individual patients: how many will achieve "no worse than mild pain" (NRS&lt;3) More sub-studies may be performed post-hoc and they will be clearly identified as such.</brief_summary>
