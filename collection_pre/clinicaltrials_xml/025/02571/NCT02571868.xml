	<brief_summary>AtrioVentricular (AV) and InterVentricular (VV) delay optimization can improve ventricular function in Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) and is usually performed by means of echocardiography. St Jude Medical has developed an automated algorhythm which calculates the optimal AV and VV delays (QuickOptTM) based on Intracardiac ElectroGrams, (IEGM), within 2 minutes. So far, the efficacy of the algorhythm has been tested acutely with standard lead position at right ventricular (RV) apex. Aim of this project is to evaluate the algorhythm performance in the mid- and long-term with RV lead located in mid-septum.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute and Cronic Evaluation of AV/PV and VV Delay IEGM Based Optimisation Algorithm-QuickSept Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary end-point was to evaluate the relationship between the series of aortic flow Velocity Time Integral (aVTI) values calculated by the two methods at the PV, AV, and VV interval settings recommended by both the QuickOptTM and the standard ECHO optimization in CRT-D patients, at three index times: pre-discharge, at 6-month and at 12-month follow-ups. Secondary end-point was to define the correlation between the optimal AV, PV and VV intervals defined by ECHO, using aVTI measurements and by the QuickOptTM algorithm, IEGM-based.</detailed_description>
