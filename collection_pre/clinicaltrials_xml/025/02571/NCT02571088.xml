	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most frequent inherited disease in the world. Literature reports that SCD patients display intolerance to exercise, important muscle weakness and profound remodeling of skeletal muscle including amyotrophy and rarefied microvascular network. Because strenuous exercise induces acidosis, hemorheological alterations, endothelial activation and oxidative stress, it constitutes a potential triggering factor of sickling and vaso-occlusive crisis. As a consequence, physical activity is usually discouraged in patients with SCD. However, moderate and regular physical activity seems to be not only safe but also beneficial for SCD patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Training Program for Homozygous Sickle Cell Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Besides, endurance training is known to induce moderate muscle hypertrophy and increase microvascular network. Therefore, adapted, moderate and regular physical activity appears as a potential strategy able to improve muscle function, decrease symptoms of the disease and improve autonomy and quality of life of patients with SCD. However, it remains necessary to define the modalities of exercise therapy in SCD and to objectively evaluate the risks, limitations and gains on physical ability, muscle function and quality of life in patients with SCD.</detailed_description>
