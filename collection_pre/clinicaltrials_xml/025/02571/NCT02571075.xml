	<detailed_description>DESIGN: Design type: Prospective, randomized control trial Sample - Description of the population: All adults, greater than or equal to 18 years, undergoing a tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy at Womack Army Medical Center are eligible for participation in the study. - Sample Size: 100 subjects. A target of 45 subjects per group for a total of 90 subjects, and accounting for a 10 percent drop out rate. In Fiscal Year 12, 92 tonsilectomies in patients over the age of 12 were performed at Womack Army Medical Center. Therefore, the investigators anticipate the study will take up to 4 years to enroll 100 adult subjects. - Power Analysis: Under the assumption of a linear time by treatment interaction, assuming subject-level randomization, five time-points, power of 80 percent, a Type I error rate of 5 per cent and no attrition, to detect a 1.6 difference in pain score requires a total sample size of 90 subjects or 45 per treatment arm.</detailed_description>
