	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Animated Cartoon-aided Teaching of Intranasal Corticosteroid Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was a prospective randomized control trial in children aged 5 - 16 years with moderate to severe intermittent or persistent AR who had never used INCS. The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups; 1) Teaching how to use INCS by oral presentation and 2) by animated cartoon-aided teaching. Successful achievements were recorded when the patients were able to use INCS (all five-point checklists) correctly. If they were unable to use the INCS correctly after the first teaching, the same instruction would be repeated and the second assessment would be performed.</detailed_description>
