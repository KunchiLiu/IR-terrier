	<brief_summary>The purpose is threefold: Assess the anxiety reduction, the mood positive effect and the rise of quality of life when using methods of relaxation combined with virtual reality with patients suffering from generalized anxiety disorder in comparison of the effect of traditional relaxation therapy. Observe and evaluate the effect of perceived presence in synthetic environments in the virtual experience of relaxation. Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of stereoscopy during exposure to relaxing virtual environments for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. It is a comparative, randomized, two groups study (29 in each group): - Relaxation optimized virtual reality - Classical relaxation (without Virtual Reality). The protocol comprised for each groups 7 relaxing sessions (with or without virtual reality epending on the group). Each session lasted for approximately 30 to 35 minutes, including a 5-minute pause between immersive trials, in order to avoid cyber sickness in the virtual reality group. Expected results: a measurable therapeutic improvement produced by the combination of relaxation and virtual and its additional effect when compared to the traditional treatment. Measurements of variables and therapeutic effects will be carried out with psychometric measures. The creation process of the relaxing virtual environments has already been completed. The virtual environments are ready for use. The apparatus needed and in our possession include: - A laptop for generating virtual environments - A stereoscopic display - Apparatus for physiological measurements</brief_summary>
