	<brief_title>Serial Usage of Combitube in Anesthesiology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The oesophageal-tracheal Combitube (ETC) was designed for the use in the pre-hospital setting and has proven its value both there and in difficult airway management. The ETC is a double-lumen tube and as such it enables ventilation independent of its position in either the trachea or the oesophagus. Since laryngoscopy is not necessary for positioning the ETC, it is especially favoured in pre-hospital setting, but is also used in clinical setting. Objectives: Retrospective evaluation of a database of ETC routine uses during general anaesthesia.</detailed_description>
