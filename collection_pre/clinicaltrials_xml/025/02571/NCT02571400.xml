	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of delayed opioid cessation after surgery, where delayed opioid cessation is defined as patients taking opioids ≥90 days post-surgery. The study is also looking to determine specific patient factors that independently predict patients at risk of delayed opioid cessation. The study hypothesis is that 5-10% of patients will remain on opioid medications ≥90 days after surgery, and that pre-operative prescription opioid use, pre-operative perceived susceptibility to addiction, and symptoms of anxiety and depression will be associated with delayed opioid cessation post-surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can we Predict Patients at Risk of Long-term Opioid Use After Surgery?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Opioid analgesic use and its related harm are increasing in Australia. Opioid prescriptions have increased considerably over the last twenty years, and alongside this the investigators have seen an increase in prescription opioid misuse, and mortality associated with opioid use. Opioids are widely used in the treatment of acute post-operative pain. Current standards of post-surgical care advise patients to discontinue opioids once pain is minimal, leaving patients to self-taper their opioids with minimal instruction. This leads to a risk of delayed cessation of opioids in a post-surgical setting. Delayed opioid cessation after surgery has been minimally examined in the literature, and there is currently no optimal method to predict risk of delayed opioid cessation in patients undergoing surgery. There are 5 primary study procedures in the investigators research project: 1. Enrolment in the study: Subjects will be recruited and enrolled at the pre-operative admission clinic and day surgery unit at St Vincent's Private Hospital, Sydney. This study aims to enrol 1000 patients. 2. Informed consent: Patients who meet inclusion criteria, and agree to enrol in the study will be asked to read and sign an informed consent document. 3. Initial questionnaire: Trained nursing staff will administer an initial questionnaire to all patients participating in the study. This questionnaire will gather data regarding potential predictors of delayed opiate cessation including age, sex, operation type, pre-operative opioid use, depression traits, anxiety traits, addictive traits, perceived susceptibility to addiction, average hours of sleep per night, history of chronic pain, and perceived general health. 4. Follow-up questionnaire: At approximately 90 days post-surgery, a follow-up questionnaire will be administered to all enrolled subjects via phone call or email. This questionnaire will determine current pain scores and details regarding current pain medication usage. 5. Statistical analysis: Once data collection is complete, identifying details will be removed, and data will be entered into a password-protected electronic database. The investigators will analyse data from all patients and determine the prevalence of delayed opioid cessation, and which questionnaire items independently predict delayed opioid cessation. The final goal of this study is to develop a brief screening tool that can be used in a pre-operative setting, to predict patients who are at risk of delayed opioid cessation after surgery. Identification of these individuals will allow clinicians to more carefully monitor their high-risk patients in order prevent adverse effects, morbidity and mortality associated with opioid misuse.</detailed_description>
