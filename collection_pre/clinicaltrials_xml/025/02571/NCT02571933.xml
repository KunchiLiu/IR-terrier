	<brief_title>Face Validity and Cross-Cultural Acceptability of the FPS-R in Cameroon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twelve to fifteen pediatric patients complaining of pain from each of the four primary language groups treated at Mbingo Baptist Hospital (Grammar English, Pidgin English, French, and Fulfulde) will be enrolled in the study. Each patient enrolled will trial the Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) in his or her native tongue, before receiving standard analgesic treatment as ordered by the provider caring for the patient. One to two hours post analgesia, the patient will be reassessed and the FPS-R will be repeated. After completion of the second FPS-R, an audio-recorded cognitive interview will be performed by trained study personnel. These recordings will be transcribed into English and analyzed on a question-by-question basis to evaluate for themes pertaining to comprehension and understanding, ease of use, and reliability, within the different language groups. Enrollment in the study does not alter the routine pain management offered or received by patients. Rather, the FPS-R will be utilized on patients who are complaining of pain and who will be allocated to receive analgesia regardless of study enrollment.</detailed_description>
