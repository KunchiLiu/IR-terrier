	<brief_title>Dorzolamide-timolol Drops With Injections to Treat AMD,RVO or DME.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents, including bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept, have become the gold standard treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Various treatment modalities using these agents have been proposed, including monthly, pro re nata, and treat-and-extend philosophies. Despite frequent and consistent treatment with anti-VEGF therapy, there is a subset of patients who are incomplete or non-responders and have persistent evidence of exudation on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), including subretinal fluid (SRF) and/or intraretinal edema. While clearance of intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs is not completely understood, some studies have suggested that outflow through the anterior chamber may contribute. We hypothesized that by decreasing aqueous production, outflow may also be reduced which could delay the clearance of intravitreal drugs. As a result, we chose topical dorzolamide-timolol since it is a potent aqueous suppressant and is readily available due to its common use in the treatment of glaucoma. The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of topical dorzolamide-timolol on anatomic and visual outcomes in anti-VEGF non-responders with neovascular AMD. Significance: The results of this study will help delineate whether topical aqueous suppression may be useful as adjuvant therapy in patients receiving chronic intravitreal anti-VEGF injections.</detailed_description>
