	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to determine, wheather strict dietary intervention with the use of the DASH diet atop of optimal medical treatment reduces previously diagnosed coronary atherosclerotic lesions assessed witch coronary computed tomography.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Intervention to Stop COronary Atherosclerosis in Computed Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 180 patients with coronary atheroslerotc lesions confirmed in coronary computed tomography (CCT) will be analyzed in a 12-month observation time. Patients will be randomized to two groups in a 1:1 fashion. 1 - optimal medical treatment, 2 - strict dietary intervention with implementation of the DASH diet atop of optimal medical treatment. CCT scans will be performed at screening and at 12 months after randomization. Computed tomography imaging data describing atheroslerotic lesions will be assessed.</detailed_description>
