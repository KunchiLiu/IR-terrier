	<brief_title>Comparison of the Efficacy of Ketamine in Pediatric Patients With Idiopathic Scoliosis After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized unicenter clinical trial, parallel, double-blind study, placebo-controlled group. Involve the participation of Pediatric patients, aged between 11 and 18 years, of both genders, diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis and posterior spinal fusion surgery candidates included in the Anesthesia Physical Classification System (ASA) 1 or 2 classes. Both groups received remifentanil at doses of 0.3 mcg / Kg / min before surgical procedure and a bolus of 150 mcg / Kg of morphine hydrochloride, approximately 60 minutes before extubation, followed by PCA morphine hydrochloride administration. The patients in the experimental group are treated with a combination of ketamine, remifentanil hydrochloride and morphine while the control group will be treated with a combination of saline, remifentanil and morphine hydrochloride. Treatment of patients in the study is initiated during the induction of anesthesia and ends at the hospital discharge. The total duration of patient participation in the study is 6 months. During treatment the patients being admitted are monitored at regular intervals, at week 6, after the 3rd month and at 6 months post-intervention to assess the incidence of chronic pain. The entire study duration is approximately 24 months. The hypothesis of the study is that the combination of subanesthetic doses of ketamine to opioid drugs during the perioperative period reduces central sensitization processes, resulting in lower consumption of postoperative morphine with fewer adverse effects, postoperative faster recovery and less incidence of chronic pain. The post-operative analgesia is induced by the use of opioids or other analgesics associated with loco-regional techniques. The technique used in the investigators' center is the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with the administration of intravenous opioids. The association of ketamine to opioid treatment could reduce the consumption of these and can be useful in surgery. No clinical trials have been conducted in children with scoliosis, who underwent posterior lumbar fusion surgical procedure, evaluating the efficacy of post-operative association of ketamine to opioid drugs for both intra and post-operative periods.</detailed_description>
