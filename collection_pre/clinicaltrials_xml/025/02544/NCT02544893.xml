	<brief_title>Postoperative Analgesic Effects of Using Dexmedetomidine for Ultrasound Guided Thoracic Paravertebral Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>paravertebral block is commonly used in the treatment for acute and chronic pain.The duration of paravertebral block could theoretically be prolonged with neurolytic agents. Dexmedetomidine ,an alfa-2 adrenoreceptor agonist, is being used and adjuvant capable of prolonging duration of sensory and motor block on nerve blocks.</detailed_description>
