	<brief_summary>This is an exempt, retrospective study of a limited set of information obtained from patients' medical records at 10 to 12 substance abuse treatment programs combined with alcohol breath analyzer results during up to 3 years of aftercare monitoring. The study objectives are 1) to compare the compliance rates and likelihood of achieving sustained sobriety for aftercare patients in mandated (eg, impaired professionals) versus non-mandated monitoring programs and 2) identify components within patients' monitoring agreements that are significantly correlated with positive outcomes.</brief_summary>
