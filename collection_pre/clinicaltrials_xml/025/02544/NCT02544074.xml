	<brief_summary>The Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (SAGE) is a valid and reliable cognitive assessment tool used to identify both Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and early dementia. SAGE's self-administered feature, pen and paper format, and four equivalent interchangeable forms allows it to be given in almost any setting, does not require any staff time to administer and makes it practical to rapidly screen large numbers of individuals in the community or in their home.This trial is being conducted to study the validity of SAGE in a digital format (eSAGE) for cognitive screening. The investigators will analyze the data to learn the correlations between eSAGE and gold standard neuropsychological testing designed to differentiate normal cognition from MCI and early dementia. The investigators will also find out whether the paper (SAGE) and electronic (eSAGE) versions of SAGE could be used interchangeably or not.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will be recruited based on their eSAGE scores and evaluated with neuropsychological testing and medical history to determine their status as normal, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia. The investigators will analyze the data to learn the correlations between eSAGE and gold standard neuropsychological testing designed to differentiate normal cognition from MCI and early dementia. The investigators will also find out whether the paper (SAGE) and electronic (eSAGE) versions of SAGE could be used interchangeably or not.</detailed_description>
