	<brief_title>Trial of Immunomodulatory Therapy in High Risk Solitary Bone Plasmacytoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Solitary bone plasmacytoma (SBP) is a localised proliferation of malignant plasma cells (PCs) in the skeleton. The annual UK incidence is 0.4/100,000 (lower than multiple myeloma (MM)) with a peak age incidence at 68 years and there are estimated to be about 260 new cases per year in the United Kingdom (UK). The majority of patients with SBP ultimately progress to myeloma and this is likely due to occult disease not detected by conventional staging methods. Standard care for these patients is involved field radiotherapy (IFRT), but despite radical doses, two-thirds develop multiple myeloma at a median of 2 years, more so if there are high risk features. The IDRIS Trial is a phase III study where the investigators hope to demonstrate that adjuvant lenalidomide + dexamethasone following IFRT prevents the development of multiple myeloma in patients with high risk solitary bone plasmacytoma. Whilst a proportion of solitary bone plasmacytoma is cured with IFRT, it is clear that the majority will progress to multiple myeloma. The investigators are seeking to prevent this outcome by using adjuvant therapy in this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with newlydiagnosed SBP as defined by IMWG and BCSH guidelines 2. Treated with local radiotherapy as per BCSH guidelines 3. Radiotherapy completed within 28 days prior to registration 4. Age ≥18 years 5. Creatinine &lt;400µmol/L 6. ECOG performance status 02 7. Written informed consent 8. Willing to comply with the requirements of the Celgene pregnancy prevention programme 1. Multifocal plasmacytoma, solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma or myeloma 2. ≥10% bone marrow plasma cells 3. Clinical suspicion of failure to respond to radiotherapy 4. On, or planned for, systemic steroid therapy (e.g. Dexamethasone) unless otherwise agreed by the TMG. 5. Severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin &gt;2 x ULN or AST/ALT &gt;2xULN) 6. Pregnant or lactating women. 7. Nonhaematological malignancy within the past 3 years with the exception of (a) adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell skin cancer, or thyroid cancer; (b) carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast; (c) prostate cancer of Gleason grade 6 or less with stable prostatespecific antigen levels; or (d) cancer considered cured by surgical resection or unlikely to impact survival during the duration of the study, such as localised transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder or benign tumours of the adrenal gland or pancreas 8. Patients at a high risk of venous thromboembolism due to: 1. Treatment with erythropoietic stimulating agents (e.g. erythropoetin, epoetin alpha, neorecormon, aranesp) 2. Other risk factors not listed above 9. Patients with untreated osteoporosis 10. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes 11. Patients with glaucoma 12. Any other medical or psychiatric condition likely to interfere with study participation 13. Receiving treatment with an experimental drug or experimental medical device. Concurrent participation in nontreatment studies is allowed, if it will not interfere with participation in this study. Any experimental drug treatments must be stopped within 4 weeks prior to planned start of lenalidomide and dexamethasone.</criteria>
