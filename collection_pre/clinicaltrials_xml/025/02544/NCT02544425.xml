	<brief_summary>Open-labeled, multicenter phase II study of VIDL (VP-16, Ifosfamide, Dexamethasone, L-asparaginase) chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with stage III/IV extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VP-16, Ifosfamide, Dexamethasone, L-asparaginase Chemotherapy in Patients With Extranodal Natural Killer T Cell Lymphoma (VIDL+ASCT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is a rare and aggressive lymphoma subtype, but standard front-line therapy has not been established. The clinical outcome of patients (pts) with ENKTL after the treatment of conventional chemotherapy, especially pts with advanced stage, was generally poor. Therefore, high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as a consolidation could be one of promising strategies to improve the outcome of ENKTL. However, there have been few studies reporting the survival outcome or prognostic significances of front-line ASCT in pts with ENKTL. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the outcome of patients with advanced-stage ENKTL who had undergone front-line ASCT.</detailed_description>
