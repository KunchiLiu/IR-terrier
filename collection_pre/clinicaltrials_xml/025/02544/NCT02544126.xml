	<brief_title>Computer-Based Intervention in HIV-Positive Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression frequently occurs in young adults with HIV infection. When young adults with HIV experience depression, they are less likely to take their prescribed antiretroviral therapy (ART). When HIV occurs simultaneously with depression, individuals are more likely to have indicators in their blood that are linked risk for developing other illnesses in the future. The purpose of this project is to examine the ability of an avatar-based intervention, called eSMART-MH, to decrease depressive symptoms in HIV-positive depressed young adults.</detailed_description>
