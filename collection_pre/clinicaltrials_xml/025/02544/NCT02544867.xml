	<brief_summary>An emerging body of epidemiological evidence suggests that various forms of sedentary behavior, including TV viewing, occupational sitting, and total daily sitting, may be associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, overweight and obesity, type 2 diabetes, depression and psychological well-being. Importantly, many of these associations were independent of participation in moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity. We propose a pilot study to assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of two interventions targeting sedentary behavior. Since it is currently unknown what component of sedentary behavior exposure presents the greatest risk to health, we propose separate interventions to reduce overall sedentary time and to promote breaks in sedentary time.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Sedentary Behavior Interventions to Affect Acute Physiological Changes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary aim: To determine the acceptability and feasibility of selected personal, social and environmental strategies to reduce overall sitting time and increase the number of times participants stand up in a day. Secondary aim: To assess whether existing and new measurement approaches can detect specific changes in sedentary behavior. Exploratory aim: To establish whether specified intervention strategies were efficacious in reducing sedentary behavior and whether intervention effects were specific to the targeted sedentary behavior construct (e.g. decreased overall sitting time or increased number of breaks in sitting).</detailed_description>
