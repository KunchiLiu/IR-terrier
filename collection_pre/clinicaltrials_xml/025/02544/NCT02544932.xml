	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been known to have several pathophysiologic mechanisms including endothelial dysfunction of heart and vessel. This study was designed to determine the efficacy of NOAC therapy in the prevention of endothelial dysfunction and progression of atherosclerosis of AF subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pleotropic Effect of New Oral Anticoagulants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The properties of oral, direct inhibitors of factor Xa (e.g. rivaroxaban) and thrombin (e.g. dabigatran) have been examined the haemostasis and thromboembolism management. Preclinical studies have provided evidences for the effects of direct factor Xa or thrombin inhibition beyond anticoagulation, including anti-inflammatory and protective activities in atherosclerotic plaque development . Therefore, this study evaluates the protective effects of NAOC with the reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) measurements reflecting endothelial function by Endo-PAT2000 and intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery, which is used as a surrogate endpoint of atherosclerosis.</detailed_description>
