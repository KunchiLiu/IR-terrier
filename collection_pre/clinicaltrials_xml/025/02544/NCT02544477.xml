	<brief_title>High-flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Versus Conventional Oxygen Therapy After Pulmonary Lobectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC) treatment has been showed to have several clinical advantages compared with conventional oxygen therapy. Currently, no reports have described the effects of HFNC in postoperative patients after thoracic surgery. The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence of postoperative hypoxemia (defined as a PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt;300) in patients with lung cancer after pulmonary lobectomy. In the postoperative period after extubation, patients will be randomly assigned to either: 1. standard oxygen therapy group (control group) or 2. HFNC group (study group). In the control group, patients will receive oxygen treatment by means of a conventional face mask, with a level of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set to maintain peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) = 92% - 98%. Patients in the study group will be given HFNC treatment with a gas flow level = 50 L/min and a FiO2 set to maintain peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) = 92% - 98%. After 48 hours from study entry, all patients will be evaluated for possible interruption of oxygen treatment on the basis of their clinical conditions.</detailed_description>
