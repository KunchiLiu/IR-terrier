	<detailed_description>The present study is designed to confirm the therapeutic effects of heat-clearing and blood-activating Chinese medicinal components in treatment of Acute Cerebral Infarction (ACI) and to investigate the therapeutic mechanisms of multi-target anti-inflammatory action involved from the standpoint of pathology, cell and molecular biology, as well as immunology. In particular, investigators choose heat-clearing Ixeris of sonchifolia Hance(Kudiezi Injection) and blood-activating Panax notoginseng saponins(Xueshuantong Injection)as the therapeutic interventions to carry out the investigation, applying the key techniques such as Lentivirus-mediated RNA interference, co-immunoprecipitation and immunomagnetic beads. With the joint efforts, investigators hope to find out the combined therapeutic targets based on better understanding of the inflammatory pathology in ACI and illuminate the synergistic mechanisms involved, which may validate the Chinese medicine theory of"cerebral vascular damage due to heat toxicity" in the pathogenesis of ACI and yield new therapeutic strategies for ACI. As an international science and technology cooperation project, the study is of great significance in establishing an international technology platform of intervention target system for the treatment of ACI; moreover, it marks a key step forward for China to enhance China's international brands through exploring a successful mode of foreign cooperation in Chinese medicine.</detailed_description>
