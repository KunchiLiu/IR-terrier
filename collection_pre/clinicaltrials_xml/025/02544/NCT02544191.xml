	<brief_summary>Preliminary reports showed that hormonal treatment may improve the chance of retrieving viable testicular sperm from men with NOA. It was generally believed that gonadotrophin treatment would be ineffective in the presence of high plasma levels of endogenous gonadotrophin.The purpose of this study is to determine whether GnRHa(gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist) combined with hCG(human chorionic gonadotropin) and hMG(human menopausal gonadotropin) are effective in the treatment of non-obstructive azoospermia.</brief_summary>
