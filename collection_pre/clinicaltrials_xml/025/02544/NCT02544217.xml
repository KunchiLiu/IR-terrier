	<brief_summary>Mitochondrial Diseases are rare progressive, multi-system, often early fatal disorders affecting both children and adults. KH176 is a novel chemical entity currently under development for the treatment of inherited mitochondrial diseases, including MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes), Leigh's Disease and LHON (Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy). KH176 is a potent intracellular redox modulating agent targeting the reactive oxygen species which are important in the pathogenesis of disorders of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. After demonstrating a favourable safety profile in the pre-clinical testing, the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the compound will now be evaluated in healthy male subjects in this trial</brief_summary>
