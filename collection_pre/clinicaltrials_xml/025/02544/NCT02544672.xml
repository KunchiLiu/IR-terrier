	<brief_title>Function Benefits of a Myoelectric Elbow-Wrist-Hand Orthosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate the functional gains provided by a myoelectric Elbow-Wrist-Hand orthosis for CVA patients with hemiparesis. The subjects will be fit with the device, provided general training in the operation of the EMG-controlled technology, and then guided through a series of standard clinical outcome measures used routinely as part of stroke rehabilitation medicine. The outcome measures employed in this study include the Fugl-Meyer assessment, the Box and Blocks test, and a battery of common functional tasks and activities. These outcome measures will allow the researchers to approximate the changes in the subjects' ability to successfully perform functional tasks with and without the MyoPro device.</detailed_description>
