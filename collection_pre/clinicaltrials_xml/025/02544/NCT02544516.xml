	<brief_summary>In schizophrenia, dislocation of psychic functions involving a loss of contact with reality is frequently found. A fragmentation of motor and sensory perceptions could be held responsible (Fuchs, 2005). However, automatic integration between perception and action is the necessary condition to be in "relationship with the world." Affordance is the experimental link between object perception and actions potentially associated (Gibson (1977, 1979) explored by Stimulus Response Compatibility (SRC) paradigm. The existence of visual motor neurons leads us to postulate that the affordance effect can be assisted by a visuomotor priming of a hand in a position to grasp. With Tucker &amp; Ellis sensory motor compatibility task, we study the capacity of affordance in schizophrenia, as well as the impact of perceptual motor priming on these affordance effects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participants will perform cognitive tasks: reaction time (Alert TEA, Zimmermann and Fimm, 2005), Edinburgh laterality questionnaire (Oldfield, 1971), IQ test (IQ: PM38, Raven, 1960), and the PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Kay et al., 1987). Controls will only have the first three tasks (cognitive spots Alert and laterality). Then all will perform all tasks in successive order (task 1 and task 2). For both tasks, photographs of 20 objects of everyday life typical grip with one hand are presented in 4 orientations. The instruction is to say if the object is presented upright or inverted; The second task differs from the first only by the introduction of a prime: presenting a hand in position "catching" before the picture of an object</detailed_description>
