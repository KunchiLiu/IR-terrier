	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that Tadalafil treatment, by lowering Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), can prime an antitumor immune response and promote a permissive environment that should increase the efficacy of anti-tumor vaccine in a setting of minimal residual disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PDE5 Inhibition Via Tadalafil to Enhance Anti-Tumor Mucin 1 (MUC1) Vaccine Efficacy in Patients With HNSCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will perform a phase I/II placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with HNSCC whose tumor has recurred, or secondary primary tumor is detected, post conventional radiotherapy with or without prior surgery or chemotherapy. For these patients, salvage surgery is the only standard curative therapeutic option, post-surgical recurrence rate is high, and life expectancy is poor. Patients will be given Tadalafil (or Placebo) in combination with vaccination (anti-MUC1 + anti-Influenza vaccines or placebos) prior to surgery, and in 3 additional courses after surgery in combination with anti-MUC1/anti-Influenza vaccines (or placebo vaccines). A final booster vaccination (with anti-MUC1/anti-Influenza vaccines or placebo vaccines alone) will be administered approximately one-year post salvage surgery. Response to treatment will include antigen-specific immune response and characterization of the leukocytes subset. As a secondary endpoint, tumor recurrence at 2 years will be evaluated to determine whether a trend toward a beneficial prognosis might be observed in treated patients. Eligible patients who are unwilling to receive study treatment but who undergo standard curative resection and consent to be followed for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and/or to donate specimens for correlative research studies (blood and/or tumor) will also be included in all analyses as an additional non-randomized control group. These analyses may include all blood tests obtained as for non-control patients at specified study intervals and DTH testing as for non-control patients at specified intervals. Control group patients may elect to not undergo blood tests and or DTH testing at any specified time interval at their discretion but will continue to be followed for recurrence free survival.</detailed_description>
