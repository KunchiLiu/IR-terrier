	<brief_summary>Development of an active second-line treatment option for metastatic breast cancer patients previously pre-treated with anthracyclines and taxanes in neoadjuvant, adjuvant or palliative settings.For each randomisation arm, 100 patients will be included. The trial was performed as a 2-stage phase II study according to the optimal design by Simon with overall response rate as the primary objective. Study Design: Arm A Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 d1, 8;Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 d1, 8 q 3 weeks Arm B Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 d1, 8;Cisplatin 25 mg/m2 d1, 2,3 q 3 weeks</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer All patients were required to give written informed consent To have received a previous treatment with anthracyclines and taxanes Previous radiotherapy is allowed, whenever the radiated area is not the only disease location At least 4 weeks since the last previous antineoplastic treatment Patients must have recovered from all previous toxicities Karnofsky Performance status &gt;= 70% Adequate hematological, renal, cardiac and hepatic function Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks Patients able to comply and to receive an adequate followup Only bone metastases Active infection Previous treatment with one of the study drugs Application of other cytotoxic chemotherapy Insufficient renal function (creatinine clearance &lt; 60ml/min) Clinically unstable brain metastasis Pregnancy or lactation Other primary malignancies (other than carcinomainsitu of the cervix or adequately treated basal cell cancer of the skin) Abnormal liver function (bilirubin &gt; 2.0fold upper normal limit (UNL); Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase &gt;2.5fold UNL). In patients with hepatic metastasis, a value of Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase of up to 5fold UNL is permitted Males Second malignancy (except for cervix carcinoma in situ or skin carcinoma no melanoma with an adequate treatment). Previous malignancies are allowed if diseasefree survival is superior to 5 years, except for renal carcinoma or melanoma</criteria>
