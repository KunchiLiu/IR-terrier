	<brief_summary>Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an incurable disease and is needed to improve effective therapeutic strategies including targeted agents. Poziotinib is a panHER tyrosin kinase inhibitor (TKI) that showed stable activity with feasible toxicity for MBC patients as a salvage treatment strategy after failure of anthracycline and taxane in phase I trial. Poziotinib has rational benefit compared with other salvage agents, especially for patients with HER2 overexpression breast cancers. Additionally, a recent report showed that possible rational background for patients with HER2 mutation-positive breast cancers. Based on this rationale, the investigators are to conduct phase II single-arm study of poziotinib for patients with MBC who showed refractoriness to conventional treatments as salvage treatment.</brief_summary>
