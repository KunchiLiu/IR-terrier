	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to create a neonatal neurologic biological big data center named Neonatal Neurologic Intensive Care Network in China with neonatal systematic information, biological samples and genomics &amp; genetic data on neonates born with neonatal severe encephalopathy. It also can predict brain injury as cerebral function monitoring through big data and recommend appropriate treatment. In addition, the following samples will be collected in a bio-bank in for future studies: blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to create a neonatal neurologic biological big data center named Neonatal Neurologic Intensive Care Network in China with neonatal systematic information mainly including demographic, medical history, family condition, perinatal stage information, birth, growth &amp; feeding status, imaging, biological samples and genomics &amp; genetic data on neonates born with neonatal severe encephalopathy. It also can predict brain injury as cerebral function monitoring through big data and recommend appropriate treatment. There are seven children's hospitals from 6 provinces in China to join in the collaboration network in first recruiting. In addition, the following biological samples will be collected in a bio-bank for future studies: blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples.</detailed_description>
