	<brief_summary>MGCD265 is an orally administered receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets MET and other receptors. This study is a Phase 2 trial of MGCD265 in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has activating genetic changes of the MET gene (mutation or amplification [increase number of gene copies]). Testing for tumor gene changes can be performed in tumor tissue or blood samples. Patients must have previously received treatment with chemotherapy. The number of patients to be enrolled will depend on how many enrolled patients experience tumor size reduction. MGCD265 will be administered orally, twice daily. The study is designed to evaluate whether the number of patients experiencing tumor size reduction is substantially higher than would be expected with other available treatments.</brief_summary>
