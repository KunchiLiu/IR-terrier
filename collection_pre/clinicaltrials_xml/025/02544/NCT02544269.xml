	<brief_summary>The study evaluates the hemodynamic effect of lumbosacral plexus blockades versus spinal anesthesia for hip replacement. Half of participants will receive lumbosacral plexus blockade and the other half will receive continuous spinal anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Effect of Lumbosacral Plexus Blockade Versus Spinal Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients for total hip replacement will be randomized for surgical anesthesia with either lumbosacral plexus blockade or continuous spinal anesthesia. All patients will receive central venous, arterial and spinal catheters. Hemodynamics will be monitored with transpulmonary thermodilution and pulse contour analysis. Perineural injection of study medicine around the lumbar and sacral plexus will be performed guided by ultrasound and nerve stimulation. Study medicine will be injected in divided doses in the spinal catheter. Treatment will be blinded using double-dummy technique. After the first intrathecal dose of study medicine, the hemodynamic response will be monitored for 60 minutes. Patients will then be transferred to the operating room, where total hip replacement will be performed in lumbosacral plexus blockade or spinal anesthesia according to randomization.</detailed_description>
