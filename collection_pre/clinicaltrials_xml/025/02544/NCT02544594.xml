	<brief_title>Clinical Study of Extra-Corporal Life Support in Cardiogenic Shock Complicating Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiogenic shock is a serious complication of a myocardial infarction. Despite optimal treatment the mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock still exceeds 50% and surviving patients mostly suffer from severe heart failure due to an impaired cardiac function. This study compares standard treatment plus Extra-Corporal Life Support (ECLS) versus standard treatment alone in patients with cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction. The main study hypothesis is to explore if additional treatment with ECLS preserves cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction) in patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction.</detailed_description>
