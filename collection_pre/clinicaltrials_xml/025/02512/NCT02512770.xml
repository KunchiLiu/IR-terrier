	<brief_title>Hemodynamic and Respiratory Effects of Esophageal Dilation in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal strictures in children may develop as a secondary to a surgically repaired esophageal atresia (anastomatic strictures) or as a result of chemical injury after caustic ingestion. Emerging strictures are dilated with balloon catheter at regular intervals. The possibility of various complications depending on the level of the stenosis during the dilation of esophagus. During Esophageal dilation may be pressed into airways and/or vascular structure.</detailed_description>
