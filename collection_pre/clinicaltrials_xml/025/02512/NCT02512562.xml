	<criteria>1. Subject has provided written consent. 2. In the investigator's opinion, the subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions, and protocolstated restrictions and is likely to complete the study as planned. 3. Subject is in good health as deemed by the investigator, based on the findings of a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECG. 4. Male or female, 1860 years of age. 5. Body mass index (BMI) 1832 kg/m2, inclusive. The minimum weight is 50 kg. No more than 25% of subjects may be enrolled with a BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2. 6. A female subject is eligible to participate in this study if she is of nonchildbearing potential (defined as females with a documented tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level within the laboratory's reference range for postmenopausal females)). A postmenopausal female receiving hormone replacement therapy who is willing to discontinue hormone therapy 28 days before study drug dosing and agrees to remain off hormone replacement therapy for the duration of the study may be eligible for study participation. 7. If male, subject is surgically sterile or practicing specific forms of birth control until 6 months after the end of the study. Males must agree to refrain from sperm donation from checkin through 6 months after dosing. 8. Willing to avoid prolonged sun exposure while taking SMV and through followup. Subjects should also be advised to use a broad spectrum sun screen and lip balm of at least sun protection factor (SPF) &gt; 30 to help protect against potential sunburn. 1. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) females, confirmed by a positive HCG laboratory test or females contemplating pregnancy. Men whose female partners are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy from the date of screening until 6 months after their last dose of study drugs. 2. Clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic, neurologic, thyroid or any other medical illness or psychiatric disorder, as determined by the Investigator and/or Sponsor's Medical Monitor. 3. Positive screening test for hepatitis B, C or HIV serology. Subjects previously infected with HCV and achieved a sustained virologic response with treatment (no detectable HCV RNA 6 months post treatment) are eligible. 4. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the study's objectives or the wellbeing of the subject or prevent the subject from meeting the study requirements. 5. Participation in an investigational drug trial or having received an investigational vaccine within 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to study medication. 6. Clinically significant abnormal ECG findings. Particularly, a history or family history of prolonged QT syndrome (e.g., torsade de pointes) or sudden cardiac death. 7. ECG with PR &gt; 200 ms, QRS &gt; 120 ms, QTcF &gt; 450 ms, as assessed by centrally read 12 lead ECG at the screening visit. 8. Clinically significant blood loss or elective blood donation of significant volume (i.e., &gt; 500 mL) within 60 days of first dose of study drug; &gt; 1 unit of plasma within 7 days of first dose of study drug. 9. Abnormal heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature or blood pressure values outside of the normal range (evaluated in a semirecumbent or recumbent position after 5 minutes of rest). One repeat measurement after an additional 5 minutes of rest is permitted. 10. Evidence of active infection. 11. Unwilling to abstain from alcohol for at least 1 week prior to the start of dosing through the study completion visit. 12. History of regular alcohol intake &gt; 7 units per week of alcohol for females and &gt; 14 units per week for males (one unit is defined as 10 g alcohol) within 3 months of the screening visit. 13. History of tobacco use or used nicotinecontaining products within 3 months of the screening visit. 14. The subject has a positive prestudy drug screen. 15. The use of concomitant medications, including prescription, over the counter medications, herbal medications, inducers or inhibitors of CYP450 enzymes or drug transporters (including Pgp) within 14 days prior to the first dose of study medication is excluded, unless approved by the Sponsor's Medical Monitor. Occasional use of acetaminophen is permitted. 16. Exposure to more than four new investigational entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. 17. Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients of AL335, ACH3102 or SMV. 18. Subjects of East Asian ancestry. 19. Abnormal biochemistry or hematology laboratory results obtained at screening. Elevated bilirubin in subjects with suspected Gilbert's disease is allowed. 20. Unwillingness or inability to comply with the study protocol for any other reason.</criteria>
