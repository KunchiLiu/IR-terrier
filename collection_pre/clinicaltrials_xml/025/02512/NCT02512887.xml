	<brief_summary>Hypospadias is one of the most common congenital malformations of the genitalia in boys, and is typically managed by surgical intervention. During pediatric urological surgery, caudal anesthesia is one of the most common regional anesthetic techniques used. Also known as caudal block, it has been shown to be a safe and effective anesthetic technique in children with a low incidence of anesthesia-related complications.While the reported incidence of complications directly associated with caudal block is low, there is scarce and inconclusive evidence on the impact of caudal anesthesia on the incidence of surgical complications. As a result, the objective of this superiority, randomized controlled trial is to assess whether the use of caudal anesthesia, when compared to dorsal penile block, is associated with a higher rate of urethrocutaneous fistulas and glans dehiscence post hypospadias repair.</brief_summary>
