	<brief_summary>Based on accumulating evidences showing that hypothyroid status is associated with poor prognosis among acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, the study is designed to evaluate whether replacement treatment with levothyroxine could have beneficial effects on patients with AMI and hypothyroidism. This is a multicenter prospective computerized-randomized trial stratified by ejection fraction with a 1:1 ratio to levothyroxine group or standard therapy group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reverse the HYpoTHyroid Status in Acute Myocardial InfarCtion (RHYTHMIC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis is that reversing the hypothyroid status with levothyroxine on top of standard therapy for AMI is safe and has beneficial effects on cardiac function, myocardial perfusion/metabolism and myocardial fibrosis.</detailed_description>
