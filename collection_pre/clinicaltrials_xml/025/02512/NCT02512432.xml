	<detailed_description>Use of asymmetrical corneal inserts to reduce or eliminate myopia and astigmatism in patients with keratoconus, who are no longer able to achieve adequate vision with their contact lenses or spectacles, so that their functional vision may be restored and the need for corneal transplantation may potentially be deferred.</detailed_description>
