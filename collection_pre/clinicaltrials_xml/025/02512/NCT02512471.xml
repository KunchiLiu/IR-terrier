	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine the minimum effective volume of local anesthetic (ropivacaine 0.275% and 0.325%) required to produce an effective double-injection USG-SCB for surgical anesthesia in 90% of patients (MEV90) in young group (18-40 years) and in middle aged group (40-65 years) of patients scheduled for elective surgery of one upper limb distal to the shoulder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Minimum Effective Volume of Ropivacaine in Ultrasound-guided Supraclavicular Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is based on biased coin design, and the volume of LA for the next patient is determined by the result of the last one. In the case of block failure, the volume will be increased by 2ml. Conversely, block success will result in either a reduction in volume by 2ml (probability 11%) or no change in volume (probability 89%). A blinded assistant will assess sensory and motor blockade in each nerve territory ( the median, radial, ulnar and musculocutaneous nerves) at 10-min intervals up to 30 min after completion of the block. Finally, MEV90 is calculated by isotonic regression.</detailed_description>
