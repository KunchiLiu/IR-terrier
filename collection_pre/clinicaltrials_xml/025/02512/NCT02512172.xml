	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Enhancing Response to MK-3475 in Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is being done to test the safety and effectiveness of the combination of intravenous (IV) romidepsin and/or oral CC - 486 with IV MK-3475 in people with microsatellite stable advanced colorectal cancer. The use of CC - 486 in this research study is investigational. The word "investigational" means that the oral form of CC - 486 is not approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Oral CC - 486 has only been given to a very small number of people so far, and this combination has never before been given together to people. Romidepsin has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (blood cancer). It is not approved by the FDA for use in other cancers. MK-3475 is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins that the immune system uses to fight infection. Researchers have designed MK-3475 to block PD-1. PD-1 is a molecule that can shut down an immune response to infection or a cancer cell. An antibody to PD-1 can stop it from turning off an immune response and may be able to boost the immune system against the cancer. People with advanced colorectal tumors that are microsatellite stable (MSS) may join this study. Tumors that are MSS positive are not deficient in repair of DNA. This is a pilot study that will look at different ways of making MSS colorectal tumors sensitive to MK-3475 by giving 14 or 21 days of an epigenetic agent (oral CC - 486 and/or romidepsin). Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like drawing numbers from a hat) to one of three study drug combinations: A. Oral CC - 486 taken daily for 21 days (and later shortened to 14 days if there are side effects) and IV MK-3475 given every 2 weeks. B. IV romidepsin given once weekly for 3 weeks and IV MK-3475 given every 2 weeks C. Oral CC - 486 taken daily for 21 days (and later shortened to 14 days if there side effects) and IV romidepsin given every 2 weeks and IV MK-3475 given every 2 weeks. Each arm is repeated every 28 days and will continue until the point that the study drug are no longer working. It will not be possible to cross over onto another arm if a participant's disease does not respond to the study drugs. In this study investigators are looking for the following information: - What effects, good and/or bad, the combination of oral CC - 486 and/or romidepsin in combination with MK-3475 has on participants' cancer; and - If the genetic and chemical make-up of participants' blood and tumor cells play a role in a response to oral CC - 486 and/or romidepsin in combination with MK-3475.</detailed_description>

Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment 4. Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier 5. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosureas or mitomycin C) prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered from adverse events due to a previously administered agent 6.

Any clinical or radiological ascites or pleural effusions 12. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator 13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial 14. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial 15. Has received prior therapy with an antiPD1, antiPDL1, antiPDL2, antiCD137, antiOX40, antiCD40, or antiCytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 (CTLA4) antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or checkpoint pathways).
