	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SYR-472 when administered at a dose of 25 mg once weekly using placebo as a control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by severe renal impairment or end-stage renal failure and inadequate glycemic control despite diet and/or exercise therapy (if given) or despite treatment with one other antidiabetic drug in addition to diet and/or exercise therapy (if given); and to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of SYR-472 when administered at a dose of 25 mg once weekly to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by severe renal impairment or end-stage renal failure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, comparative study (Treatment Period I) and a phase 3, multicenter, open-label, long-term study (Treatment Period II) using placebo as a control to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SYR-472 when administered orally at a dose of 25 mg once weekly to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by severe renal impairment or end-stage renal failure and inadequate glycemic control despite diet and/or exercise therapy (if given) or despite treatment with one other antidiabetic drug in addition to diet and/or exercise therapy (if given).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. The participant has a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. 2. The participant has a fasting Cpeptide level of 0.6 ng/mL or higher at the start of the screening period (Week 6) and Week 2 of the screening period. 3. The participant has a hemoglobin value of 10.0 g/dL or higher at the start of the screening period (Week 6) and Week 2 of the screening period. 4. The participant has an HbA1c value of 7.0% or higher but less than 10.0% at Week 2 of the screening period, unless the participant who is undergoing hemodialysis (Patients with Endstage Renal Failure) has a HbA1c value of less than 7.0% at Week 2 and glycated albumin value of 20% or higher. 5. The participant has an HbA1c value of 7.0% or higher but less than 10.0% at Week 2 The participant has an HbA1c value difference between the start of the screening period (Week 6) and Week 2 of the screening period within 10.0%* of the HbA1c value at the start of the screening period (Week 6). The participant who is undergoing hemodialysis (Patients with Endstage Renal Failure) has an HbA1c value of less than 7.0% at Week 2 and glycated albumin value of 20% or higher. The difference of the glycated albumin values from the start of the screening period (Week 6) to Week 2 is 10%* or less of the glycated albumin values at Week 6. *: rounded to one decimal place 6. The participant has been on a fixed diet and/or exercise therapy (if given) from at least 6 weeks prior to the start of the screening period (Week 6). 7. The participant meets any of the following: The participant has not received any antidiabetic medications (including insulin preparations) from at least 6 weeks prior to the start of the screening period (Week 6). The participant is being treated with one oral hypoglycemic drug* starting from at least 6 weeks prior to the start of the screening period (Week 6) at a fixed dose and regimen. *: any one of the following medications: mitiglinide calcium hydrate, repaglinide, acarbose, miglitol, or voglibose The participant is being treated with one insulin preparation** starting from at least 6 weeks prior to the start of the screening period (Week 6) at a fixed dose and regimen (≤40 units/day) of the insulin preparation. Any one of the following insulin monotherapies: mixed (rapidacting or shortacting insulin containing no more than 30% volume), intermediateacting, or longacting soluble insulin preparations 8. The participant is not undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and has severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (Ccr) &lt;30 mL/min at the start of the screening period (Week 6)], or the participant is undergoing hemodialysis and has endstage renal failure. 9. In the opinion of the investigator or subinvestigator, the initiation of hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis at least within 12 weeks after starting the investigational product is not expected. [in cases where the participant is not undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (patients with severe renal impairment)] 10. The participant has been undergoing hemodialysis starting from at least 6 months prior to informed consent and, in the opinion of the investigator or subinvestigator, the participant is clinically stable. [in cases where the participant is undergoing hemodialysis (patient with endstage renal failure)] 11. The participant is male or female and is aged 20 years or older at the time of informed consent. 12. A female participant of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner agrees to use routinely adequate contraception from signing of informed consent until one month after the end of the study. 13.

The participant signs and dates a written, informed consent form prior to the initiation of any study procedures. 1. The participants has clinically evident hepatic impairment [e.g., AST or ALT ≥2.5 times the upper limit of normal or total bilirubin of ≥2.0 mg/dL at the start of the screening period (Week 6) or at Week 2 of the screening period]. 2. The participant has any serious cardiac diseases, cerebrovascular disorders, or serious pancreatic or hematological diseases (e.g., participants who require inpatient treatment or are hospitalized for treatment within 24 weeks prior to the start of the screening period). 3.
