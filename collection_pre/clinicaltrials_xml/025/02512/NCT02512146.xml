	<brief_title>The Expression of the Ionotropic Glutamate Receptors in Colon of IBS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ionotropic glutamate receptors participate in pain in nervous system. In this study,participants will examine the expression of the ionotropic glutamate receptors in colon of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and evaluate the relationship between the ionotropic glutamate receptors and IBS symptoms. Participants may futher study the mechanism using cell experiment.</detailed_description>
