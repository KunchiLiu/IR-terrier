	<brief_title>In Vitro Study of the Effect of Gadolinium Contrast on Fibrocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gadolinium contrast is administered to patients during MRI imaging. Recently, the investigators have observed potential gadolinium toxicity in some patients. To investigate this, the investigators propose to collect clinical data and lab data obtained as a part of clinical care. The investigators also plan to obtain 25 cc of peripheral blood at 2-4 weeks, 4-6 weeks and again at 3 months to identify unique monocyte signatures, gene polymorphisms, and to quantitate circulating fibrocytes (in fresh blood and after culture). Plan to enroll 15 patients with kidney, pancreas or liver transplant and exposed to gadolinium contrast agents, 15 non-transplant patients exposed to gadolinium contrast and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls not exposed to gadolinium contrast.</detailed_description>
