	<brief_summary>Background: To compare the effectiveness of open flap debridement (OFD) alone and OFD along with either Autologous Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) or Titanium Platelet Rich Fibrin (TPRF) in the treatment of intrabony defects (IBDs). Materials and methods: Study was conducted on subjects reporting to the Department of Periodontics, The Oxford Dental College and Hospital, Bangalore. 38 subjects with 90 periodontal IBDs of moderate to severe periodontitis were selected and assigned to OFD alone (group I) or OFD with Autologous PRF (group II) or OFD with TPRF (group III). In each subject, a minimum number of two sextants were present with probing pocket depths (PPD) ≥5mm in at least three teeth.</brief_summary>
