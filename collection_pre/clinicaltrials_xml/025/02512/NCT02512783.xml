	<brief_summary>This is a double blind, randomized, controlled study. The sedationist performing the sedation procedure will inject the appropriate amount of either a 1% Lidocaine solution or a placebo before the administration of Propofol. A research staff will observe the patient simultaneously with the induction of Propofol to determine the patient's pain level, as measured by the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of premedication with 1% Lidocaine in decreasing the burning sensation caused by intravenous Propofol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decreasing Propofol Injection Pain by Pre-Treatment With Lidocaine in Pediatric Procedural Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Propofol is a short-acting, intravenously administered anesthetic. It has become a popular choice for procedural sedation in both children and adults. Despite its many advantages, Propofol is associated with a burning sensation during injection. Propofol pain begins within the first few seconds after administration and often lasts approximately 10-20 seconds until the patient is asleep. Lidocaine is often used in an attempt to reduce Propofol injection pain, but neither its delivery mode nor concentration has been standardized. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of premedication with 1% Lidocaine in decreasing the burning sensation caused by intravenous Propofol. This is a double blind, randomized, controlled study. The sedationist performing the sedation procedure will inject the appropriate amount of either a 1% Lidocaine solution or a placebo before the administration of Propofol. A research staff will observe the patient simultaneously with the induction of Propofol to determine the patient's pain level, as measured by the FLACC scale.</detailed_description>
