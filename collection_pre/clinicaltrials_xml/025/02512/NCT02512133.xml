	<brief_summary>To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP) and number of glaucoma medications lowering of microinvasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) with the implantation of the trabecular device Hydrus (Ivantis) as a solo procedure and 360Â° selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) to treat primary open angle glaucoma (POAG).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MIGS VS SLT Comparison in Glaucoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible study patients diagnosed with POAG and not sufficiently controlled by, intolerant of, or non-compliant with their current IOP-lowering regimen. Patients with IOP&gt;21 mm Hg upon at least two consecutive measurements. Study subjects with typical glaucomatous visual field (VF) loss on Octopus or Humphrey automated perimetry (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) and glaucomatous alterations to the optic nerve head. Visual field classified as glaucomatous according to the European Glaucoma Society guidelines. Exclusion criteria : eye surgery in the previous 6 months, any previous surgery for glaucoma, evidence of glaucoma of a type other than POAG, and medication with systemic or topical steroids.</detailed_description>
