	<brief_summary>This research study is looking at a small device that measures white blood cell (WBC) counts by being placed against the finger nail for participants who are undergoing stem cell transplantation at Massachusetts General Hospital or have a hematologic malignancy and are being seen as an outpatient.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non Invasive Optical Imaging of WBC Count</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to obtain data that would support the use of a method to obtain WBC counts from images of small blood vessels called capillaries. These would be obtained by pressing a small device on the surface of participants' finger nails to look through the nail. These images will be obtained using a portable microscope called the Dino-Lite Digital Microscope. Having a non-invasive way to quickly measure WBC counts could be useful for a variety of healthcare applications.</detailed_description>
