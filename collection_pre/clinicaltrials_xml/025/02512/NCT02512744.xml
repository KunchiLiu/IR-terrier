	<brief_summary>Multicenter randomized trial centered on critically-ill tracheostomized patients, comparing two different decannulation protocols: 1. based on capping trials to decide decannulation, 2. based on the aspiration frequency to decide decannulation time. High-flow conditioned oxygen therapy will be applied to all patients through the tracheal cannula. In patients included in the suctioning frequency based protocol along the study period and in patients included in the capping trial protocol along periods out of capping trials.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Criticallyill tracheostomized patients weaned from mechanical ventilation (24 consecutive hours disconnected). Patients consedered nondecannulable at time of randomization: 1. unconscious patient (motor component of GCS score &lt;6 points). 2. Severe swallowing function (based on drink test). 3. Airway patency problem (based of intolerance of occlusion test). 4. Neuromuscular diseases. 5. Patients with a Sabadell score &gt;2.</criteria>
