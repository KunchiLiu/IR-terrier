	<brief_summary>Children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for cancer or blood disorders frequently develop gastrointestinal, metabolic and infectious complications related to preparative high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation-related toxicity. Parenteral nutrition (PN) with lipid emulsion is commonly required while gastrointestinal complications preclude adequate oral or enteral intake. PN and lipids may increase the risk of metabolic and infectious complications in HCT patients who are inherently immune compromised. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids has been linked to improvements in outcomes in several populations. Provision of fish oil lipid emulsion (FOLE), rich in omega-3 fatty acids, to children undergoing HCT is an innovative nutritional strategy that could mitigate the metabolic and inflammatory side effects of HCT and its treatment. With its potential to safely maintain essential fatty acid status, normalize blood lipids and alleviate the inflammatory response to illness, the use of FOLE may reduce the risk of infections, regimen-related toxicity, and other morbidities after HCT. A randomized, controlled pilot study is proposed to test the safety and tolerability of FOLE, compared to standard lipid emulsion, in 20 children during hospitalization for HCT. Results of this study will provide the preliminary data needed for a larger clinical trial examining the effect of FOLE on important clinical outcomes in this population. This novel approach to nutritional care of this high-risk group will advance clinical knowledge of the impact of FOLE, and will support further investigation into nutritional adjuncts to pediatric cancer treatment.</brief_summary>
