	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, first-in-human (FIH), randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose sequential group study in healthy male subjects. The objectives are to study the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and effects on glucose homeostasis (pharmacodynamics) of AZD9567, an oral differentiated non-steroidal selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator (SGRM). The study will also assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of prednisolone 60 mg in comparison with high doses of AZD9567 and placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, first-in-human (FIH), randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose sequential group study in healthy male subjects. The objectives are to study the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and effects on glucose homeostasis (pharmacodynamics) of AZD9567. Additional exploratory variables (Inflammation biomarkers, ECG modelling and taste assessment) will also be evaluated. The study will also assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of prednisolone 60 mg in comparison with high doses of AZD9567 and placebo. The study will be conducted at a single study centre with a planned number of subjects of up to 72 healthy males, aged 18 to 55 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. Healthy male subjects aged 18 to 55 years with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venipuncture. Have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 29.9 kg/m2 inclusive and weigh at least 50 kg and no more than 100 kg inclusive. Normal OGTT at screening (&lt;7.8 mmol/L). Serum cortisol levels within normal limits at screening (collected as part of the clinical chemistry panel). Able to understand, read and speak the German language. History of any clinically important disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study. History or presence of gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic or renal disease, or any other condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs. History of or active or latent tuberculosis (TB), or at risk for having acquired TB (social workers or prison staff in countries with endemic rates of TB, having lived with patients with known TB). History suggesting abnormal immune function, as judged by the investigator. Any contraindications to be treated with prednisolone (allergy to any ingredient, systemic fungal infection, certain type of malaria, inflammation of the optic nerve, or herpes infection of the eye, scheduled to have a live or attenuated live vaccination or taking mifepristone). History of severe affective disorder including depressive or manicdepressive illness them self or first degree relatives. History of previous steroid psychosis Any clinically important illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4 weeks of the first administration of IMP. Any latent or chronic infections (e.g., recurrent sinusitis, genital or ocular herpes, urinary tract infection) or at risk of infection (surgery, trauma, or significant infection), or history of skin abscesses within 90 days prior to the first administration of IMP. Any clinically important laboratory abnormalities (clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation or urinalysis results), as judged by the investigator. In particular a subject with an abnormal value in alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), creatinine, thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH), fasting glucose, International Normalised Ratio (INR), haemoglobin (Hb), white blood cell (WBC), absolute neutrophil or platelet count will be excluded. Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C antibody and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Abnormal vital signs, after 10 minutes supine rest, defined as any of the following: Systolic BP (SBP) &lt; 90mmHg or ≥ 140 mmHg, Diastolic BP (DBP) &lt; 50mmHg or ≥ 90 mmHg, Pulse &lt; 45 or &gt; 85 beats per minute (bpm). Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of the resting ECG and any clinically important abnormalities in the 12lead ECG, as considered by the investigator that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc interval changes, including abnormal STTwave morphology, particularly in the protocol defined primary lead or left ventricular hypertrophy. Prolonged QTcF &gt; 450 ms or family history of long QT syndrome. PR(PQ) interval shortening &lt; 120 ms (PR &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 120 ms is acceptable if there is no evidence of ventricular preexcitation). PR (PQ) interval prolongation (&gt; 240 ms) intermittent second (Wenckebach block while asleep is not exclusive) or third degree AV block, or AV dissociation</criteria>
