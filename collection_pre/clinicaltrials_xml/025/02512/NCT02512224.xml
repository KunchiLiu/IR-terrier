	<brief_title>Comparison of Outcomes Between Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data were acquired from patients selected from a national inpatient database covering 1,057 hospitals in Japan. Participants had received artificial nutrition between April 2012 and March 2013, were 20 years or older, and did not have cancer. Participants were grouped into two groups: those receiving parenteral nutrition and those receiving enteral nutrition. The investigators performed one-to-one propensity-score matching between the groups. The primary outcome measurements were mortality rates at 30 and 90 days after the start of the procedure. The secondary outcomes were post-procedural complications, pneumonia, and sepsis. The investigators analyzed survival length of stay after the procedure using a Cox proportional hazards model.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>investigators selected participants aged 20 years or older who had undergone either parenteral nutrition by central venous port insertion or enteral nutrition by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, percutaneous transesophageal gastrotubing, or ileostomy between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2013. Patients who received both gastrostomy and central venous port insertion were assigned to the gastrostomy group. investigators excluded participants who had been diagnosed with cancer.</criteria>
