	<brief_summary>There are few disease prevention programs or programs to manage somatic disorders in a psychiatric context. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact in the medium term of a global program to promote dental health on buccodental hygiene in patients with schizophrenia and the ability of these patients to follow the intervention. This is an interventional trial, randomized in clusters. The participating establishments will be randomized to the "intervention" group (promotion program) or the "control" group (surveillance). For each patient, the study will last 12 months altogether and will include an initial evaluation of dental health, a 6-month education program for dental care (for patients in the "intervention" group) and a follow-up at 6 and 12 months after the start of the study. The follow-up will evaluate dental health and quality of life.</brief_summary>
