	<brief_title>Impact of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation, Associated With Upper Limb Robot-assisted Therapy, on Motor Recuperation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>tDCS and RAT will be used in chronic stroke patients to improve a variety of functions such as motor functions with upper limb. tDCS will be applied in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised fashion. A session of RAT will be associated with tDCS/placebo. Behavioural data will be collected before and after tDCS, associated with RAT.</detailed_description>
