	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate and compare the intervention effects of combining exercise and cognitive training (either sequentially or simultaneously in a dual-task paradigm) in elderly with mild cognitive impairment. The investigators hypothesize that (1) both sequential and dual-task training can induce greater improvements in the outcome measures than single mode of training; (2) the improvement in cognitive functions and other outcomes may differ between the groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evolving Methods to Combine Cognitive and Physical Training for Individuals With Mild Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background and study aims: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or minor neurocognitive disorder is a syndrome defined as an intermediate stage between cognitively intact and clinically diagnosed dementia. The age-adjusted prevalence of MCI in Taiwan is approximately 18%, while women have higher prevalence for MCI than men. The progression rate from MCI to dementia ranges from 10 to 15% each year, and over 50% of the MCI population will develop into severe cognitive impairment or dementia in 5 years. Therefore, early detection of the individuals who manifest MCI and provide appropriate interventions may help reduce the burden of their caregivers and the medical expenses of the health-care system. Previous studies found that cognitive training or exercise has emerged as an important therapeutic approach for individuals with MCI. However, the intervention effects of combining exercise and cognitive training remain to be determined. Furthermore, whether exercise and cognitive training should be administered in sequential order or simultaneously is an important question to pursue. The overall goal of this study is to determine and compare the intervention effects cognitive training, exercise, and combining cognitive and exercise training in individuals with MCI. Who can participate? Individuals with MCI. What does the study involve? The participants will receive a total of 36 training sessions, and each session will contain 90 minutes of training. Training frequency will be 2-3 times per week for 12-18 weeks. All participants will received pretreatment test, post treatment test, and a 6-month follow-up test. What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? The possible benefits include improvement in cognitive, physical, and daily functions. There are no risks for participating. Where to conduct the study? The investigators anticipate recruiting a total of 80 participants from geriatric day care centers and nursing homes from multiple cities in Taiwan.</detailed_description>
