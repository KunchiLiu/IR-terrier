	<brief_summary>A Phase III, Randomized, Open-Label, Controlled, Multi-Center, Global Study of First-Line MEDI4736 Monotherapy and MEDI4736 in Combination with Tremelimumab Versus Standard of Care Chemotherapy in Patients with Stage IV Urothelial Cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of MEDI4736 With or Without Tremelimumab Versus Standard of Care Chemotherapy in Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multi-center, global Phase III study to determine the efficacy and safety of MEDI4736 monotherapy and MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab versus SoC (cisplatin + gemcitabine or carboplatin + gemcitabine doublet) first-line chemotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with histologically or cytologically documented, unresectable, Stage IV transitional cell carcinoma (transitional cell and mixed transitional/non-transitional cell histologies) of the urothelium (including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra) and to allow sufficient flexibility for Investigators and patients to select the agents that reflect their normal clinical practice and national guidelines. The patients enrolled in the study will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive treatment with combination therapy, monotherapy, or SoC (cisplatin + gemcitabine or carboplatin + gemcitabine, based on cisplatin eligibility). Patients will be treated with MEDI4736 or MEDI4736 with tremelimumab, or treated with SoC until progressive disease (PD) is confirmed, unacceptable toxicity occurs, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met. Patients will be followed for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with histologically or cytologically documented, unresectable, Stage IV transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium who have not been previously treated with firstline chemotherapy. Patients eligible or ineligible for cisplatinbased chemotherapy. Cisplatin ineligibility is defined as meeting 1 of the following criteria: • Creatinine clearance (calculated or measured) &lt;60 mL/min calculated by CockcroftGault equation (using actual body weight) or by measured 24hour urine collection for determination • Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade ≥2 audiometric hearing loss • CTCAE Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy • New York Heart Association ≥Class III heart failure. Tumor PDL1 status, with Immunohistochemical (IHC) assay confirmed by a reference laboratory, must be known prior to randomization. Prior exposure to immunemediated therapy, including but not limited to, other anti cytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated protein 4 (CTLA 4), antiPD1, antiPDL1, or antiPDL2 antibodies, including therapeutic anticancer vaccines. Prior local intervesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy is allowed if completed at least 28 days prior to the initiation of study treatment. History of allogenic organ transplantation that requires use of immunosuppressive agents. Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. The following are exceptions to this criterion: • Patients with vitiligo or alopecia • Patients with hypothyroidism (eg, following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on hormone replacement • Any chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy • Patients without active disease in the last 3 years may be included but only after consultation with AstraZeneca • Patients with celiac disease controlled by diet alone may be included but only after consultation with AstraZeneca. Brain metastases or spinal cord compression unless the patient's condition is stable and off steroids for at least 14 days prior to the start of study treatment. Patients with suspected or known brain metastases at screening should have an MRI (preferred)/CT, preferably with IV contrast to access baseline disease status. Active infection including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of investigational product (IP). The following are exceptions to this criterion: • Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (eg, intra articular injection) • Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent • Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (eg, CT scan premedication). Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP. Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine during the study and up to 30 days after the last dose of IP.</criteria>
