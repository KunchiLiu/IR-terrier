	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out if individuals with tight hamstring muscles who receive dry needling in addition to a standard stretching exercise program, show an improvement in hamstring tightness and function compared to individuals with tight hamstrings who receive either sham dry needling or no needling (blunt needle) in addition to a standard stretching program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hamstring Tightness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tightness of the hamstring muscles is a risk factor for injury. Currently, there is no data on the effect of dry needling on hamstring extensibility or functional performance measures among asymptomatic individuals with hamstring muscle tightness. The investigator wants to assess if individuals with tight hamstring muscles who receive dry needling in addition to a standard stretching exercise program, exhibit reduced hamstring tightness and improved functional performance compared to individuals with tight hamstrings who receive either sham dry needling or no needling (blunt needle) in addition to a standard stretching program.</detailed_description>
