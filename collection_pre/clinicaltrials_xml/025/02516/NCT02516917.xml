	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate the application of the Attention Training Technique in children with ADHD aged 7-11 years old. The research aims to investigate both the feasibility of this technique in this population as well as whether it can improve symptoms, behaviour and executive functioning.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Feasibility of a Brief Attention Training Technique in Improving Behaviour and Attention in Children With ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioural disorder characterised by core symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. Its prevalence ranges between 3-9% of school-aged children, making it one of the most common presentations in child and adolescent mental health services. In the last 10 years, research into the effectiveness of attention training as an intervention for children with ADHD has been increasing. This has tended to follow assumptions that children with the disorder either lack skills in focusing and maintaining their attention and/or have neurological deficits in areas responsible for attention functions. Results have been encouraging, with study participants demonstrating improvements in symptoms and behaviour following a course of attention training. However, the method and length of training has varied across studies. This study aims to investigate a treatment called the Attention Training Technique (ATT) that approaches attention difficulties in this disorder from a different perspective. Instead of viewing inattention as a result of structural or skills deficits, it posits that children with ADHD have these skills, but are perhaps unaware of the flexibility and control they have over them. This treatment aims to increase this awareness and subsequently improve ratings of attention, behaviour and other areas of executive functioning.</detailed_description>
