	<brief_summary>This study will investigate whether switching symptomatic COPD patients from a fixed-dose combination of salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d. to a fixed dose combination of QVA149 110/50 µg o.d. leads to improved lung function and airflow. It will also assess the effect on symptom burden, breathlessness, and use of rescue medication after this switch.</brief_summary>
