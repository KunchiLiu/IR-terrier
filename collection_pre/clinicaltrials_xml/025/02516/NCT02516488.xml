	<brief_title>Comparison of CLE in Vivo Diagnosis and ex Vivo Examination Against Surgical Histopathology of CPL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is to assess the ability of nCLE (AQ-Flex) to accurately diagnose the type of CPL by comparing in vivo and ex vivo CLE patterns to final histopathology of surgically resected CPLs. The primary endpoints are whether or not the CLE diagnosis correlates with final diagnosis (yes vs. no).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For in vivo nCLE (needlebased confocal laser endomicroscopy) (Part 1): Patient age 18 years and older All patients referred for EUSFNA (endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration) of accessible CPL (cystic pancreatic lesion) The minimum size of the cyst should be â‰¥ 1.5 cm as determined by prior crosssectional imaging studies. For ex vivo pCLE (probebased confocal laser endomicroscopy) (Part 2): All patients must satisfy inclusive criteria for in vivo nCLE. All patients should have completed EUSguided nCLE. All patients should have a CPL lesion referred for surgical removal based on recommended international consensus guidelines1 and interdepartmental consensus pancreatic tumor board meeting (departments of surgical oncology, radiology, pathology and gastroenterology). Patient participated and completed in vivo nCLE (Part 1) Unable to obtain informed consent Unable to tolerate the procedure Women with known pregnancy at time of procedure Patient age less than 18 years Bleeding diathesis Lesion not accessible by EUS guided FNA Allergy to fluorescein.</criteria>
