	<brief_summary>Accurate optical diagnosis of colorectal polyps could allow a "resect and discard" strategy with surveillance intervals determined based on the results of the optical biopsy. The investigators perform education to characterize the histology of diminutive and small colorectal polyps by using narrow band imaging (NBI). After education program, the investigators prospectively evaluate real-time optical biopsy analysis of polyps with NBI by 16 academic based gastroenterologists.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Real-time Diagnosis of Colorectal Polyps Using Narrow-Band Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an extension of quality assurance program in Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center. This study is composed of four periods. First, a computer based education program on the accuracy of predicting polyp histology with NBI (NICE and WASP classification) will be performed by 16 endoscopists (experts and non-experts in NBI) during August 2015. In the second period from September 2015 till October 2015, 1st phase real- time optical diagnosis for diminutive and small colorectal polyps will be activated. All endoscopists will have feedback on their accuracy of optical diagnosis for polyps, and discuss the NBI findings that mismatched by histologic diagnosis all together per one month. Third, the result of 1st phase real-time optical diagnosis will be analyzed from November 2015 till December 2015. In this period, endoscopists with low accuracy of 1st phase real-time optical diagnosis will be re-educated using a computer based training module. The last period from January 2016 till August 2016, 2nd phase real-time optical diagnosis for polyps will be activated. Performance will be evaluated by comparing optically predicted diagnosis with actual histologic diagnosis. Cumulative sum analysis will be used to determine the learning curve for each endoscopist. Negative predictive value for the prediction of nonneoplastic polyp and concordance of surveillance intervals for diminutive polyps diagnosed optically with high confidence will also be measured.</detailed_description>
