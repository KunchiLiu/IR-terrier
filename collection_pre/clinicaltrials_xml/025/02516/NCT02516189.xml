	<brief_title>Strength Training for Elderlies and Their Effects on Muscle Fatigue and Microcirculation - Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose The primary research question is: Do muscular strength training programs can improve functional capacity, muscle performance and microcirculation in the elderly? Hypothesis: Strength training program will promote electromyographic changes during the development of peripheral muscle fatigue and microcirculatory blood flow contributing to functional autonomy. Secondary Research Questions 1. Does the strength training program in the elderly improve the standard of electromyographic fatigue? Hypothesis: Elderly practitioners of strength exercise program showed increased neuromuscular efficiency and electromyographic fatigue index. 2. Do the strength training program in the elderly improve peripheral microcirculation? Hypothesis: A regular program of strength exercise in the elderly increases the blood flow in peripheral microcirculation changing the process of muscle fatigue. These biomechanical and physiological changes contribute to increased functional autonomy and reducing the risk of falls in the elderly.</detailed_description>
