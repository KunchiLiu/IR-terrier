	<brief_title>Comparative Bioavailability Study of Two Misoprostol Formulations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostaglandin E2 (dinoprostone) given vaginally or intra-cervically, and oxytocin have been the most commonly used preparations for induction of labour. Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue. Misoprostol has anti-secretory and mucosal protective properties and was originally developed in the 1970s for the prevention of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced peptic ulcers. It is now used much more widely for 'off-label' indications like medication abortion, medical management of miscarriage, cervical ripening before surgical procedures, treatment of postpartum hemorrhage, and induction of labour. The lack of a specific license for CytotecÂ® to be used in obstetrics and gynecology has led to a number of problems regarding correct dose and dose regime. The study is an open-label, randomized, single-dose, comparative, parallel design, bioavailability study followed by repeat dosing of of two formulations misoprostol in healthy adult females being induced to go into labour. The drug shall be administered orally or sublingually.</detailed_description>
