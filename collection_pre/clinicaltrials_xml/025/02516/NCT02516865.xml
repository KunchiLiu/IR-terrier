	<detailed_description>We are piloting a 3-arm, unblinded, randomized controlled trial in postpartum women; with 10 participants in each study group. Women will be recruited at 2-6 months postpartum, with the intervention lasting through 12 months postpartum. Data collection will include:1) Physical activity; 2) Maternal body composition; 3) Questionnaires to assess:motivation to adopt healthy behaviors, body attitudes, infant feeding practices; 4) Process evaluation to assess: likes and dislikes about the intervention program, suggestions for improving the intervention, reasons for leaving the study. The proposed study time period is 6 months for study recruitment, 18 months to carry out the study, and 6 months for data analysis (total 2 years).</detailed_description>
