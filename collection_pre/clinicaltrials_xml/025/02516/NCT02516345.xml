	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial of an Incentive-based Physical Activity Program Targeting Both Children and Adults (FIT-FAM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is overwhelming evidence that sustained physical activity reduces the risk of many common diseases. Yet, data reveal low levels of physical activity among working age adults and their children in Singapore. One strategy that has been successfully employed to influence behaviours of parents is to use their children as an intermediary. This strategy has a successful track record in public health, where children have helped their parents quit smoking and wear seatbelts. In this study, the investigators propose to test whether children can promote increased physical activity of a working parent at the same time that they increase their own activity level. This proposal is an extension of a prior study where the investigators showed that modest financial incentives can increase physical activity levels among children. The investigators now propose to conduct a follow-on trial where the reward is tied not only to the child's own steps, but to that of a parent. Rewards will be based on step activity measured through a state-of-the-art wireless step counter worn on the wrist or hip. Just as children were motivated to increase their own activity levels in efforts to achieve the incentive, the investigators hypothesize that they will also be effective advocates for increasing the activity levels of their parents. Specifically, the investigators propose to conduct a 12 month two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of the family based incentive scheme on working parents' physical activity as measured via accelerometry. The investigators hypothesize that parents in the family-based incentive arm (FBI) will show a greater number of daily steps at the interim 6 month assessment and the final 12 month assessment point compared to parents in the child based incentive (CBI) arm, as measured by accelerometry. Secondary aims test the effects of the intervention on parent's and child's MVPA bout minutes per week, MVPA minutes, and other physical activity endpoints measured by accelerometry, child's steps, parent's and child's activity levels throughout the intervention period measured by the pedometer, and on health outcomes and health-related quality of life of parents at follow-up.</detailed_description>
