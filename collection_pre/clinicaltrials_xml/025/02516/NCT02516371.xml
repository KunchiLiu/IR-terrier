	<brief_title>Lymphocytes Subpopulation in Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The host's inflammatory response in the tumor microenvironment could effect cancer progression and prognosis. As components of systemic inflammatory response, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets are being recognised to have an important role in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. To date, a number of peripheral blood-derived inflammation-based scores such as the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet- lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and so on have been proposed as prognostic markers in numerous types of cancers. But, very little is known of their impact in subpopulation of lymphocytes. The investigators try to evaluate the activity of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and find out the relationship among clinical prognosis.</detailed_description>
