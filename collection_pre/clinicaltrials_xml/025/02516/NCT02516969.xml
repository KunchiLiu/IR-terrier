	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the 1-year local control in patients with operable, recurrent previously-irradiated squamous cell head-and-neck cancers with or without adjuvant SBRT. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the locoregional progression-free survival (PFS) distant PFS, overall PFS (local + regional + distant), and overall survival (OS), to evaluate the acute and late toxicities of adjuvant SBRT in the re-irradiation setting following salvage surgery, to determine prognostic factors that may predict the likelihood of local failure, regional failure, or OS in this cohort to guide future management, to compare the impact of adjuvant SBRT versus a wait-and-see approach on patient reported quality of life (PR-QoL), and to compare surgical versus SBRT-induced immunological serum markers in relation to local control.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically proven recurrent or secondprimary headandneck cancer receiving prior radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Prior radiotherapy to a dose of ≥50Gy No evidence of distant metastases Macroscopic complete salvage surgery with curative intent (surgery was not performed only for biopsy or palliation). Final pathology and imaging must indicate a R0 or R1 resection (no gross disease remaining). Highrisk pathologic features must be present: compromised/positive surgical margins (≤ 2mm) or extranodal extension (patient with other highrisk features gross perinueral invasion, bone invasion, angiolyphatic invasion, or a constellation of these factors may be eligible based on casebycase basis at discretion of principal investigator). Karnofsky Performance Status ≥60 (ECOG 02) Any number or type of prior chemotherapy is allowed (patient may receive concurrent or adjuvant systemic therapy such as cetuximab at the discretion of the treating oncologic team) Evidence of distant metastases on any staging or imaging modality Women who are breast feeding, or have a positive pregnancy test (reproductive age should use effective birth control during study if randomized to SBRT treatment arm) Any patient with gross residual disease following salvage surgery Any comorbidity or condition of sufficient severity to limit full compliance with the protocol per assessment by the principal investigator.</criteria>
