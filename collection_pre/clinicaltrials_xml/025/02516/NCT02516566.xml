	<brief_title>Effects of PEEP on Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter During Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effects of positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation on intracranial pressure have not been evaluated in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. We aim to investigate the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation on intracranial pressure assessed by sonographic optic nerve sheath diameter in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.</detailed_description>
