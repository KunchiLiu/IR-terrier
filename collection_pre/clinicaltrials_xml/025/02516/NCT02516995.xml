	<brief_summary>Merge the data of ultrasound with that of the anatomical and functional MRI is necessary since the high dose rate Curietherapy is carried out under ultrasound guidance. The investigators will recruit prostate cancer patients to evaluate the quality of the data, their sensitivity to exam conditions (patient position, volume of endorectal probe, gold grains implanted before intensity modulated radiotherapy , IMRT) and to merge data from different sources with the purpose of estimating the opportunities of integration treatment plan for Curietherapy broadband. The nuclear magnetic resonance imaging provides precise anatomical study, but also provides access to a functional approach to the tumor mapping of water diffusion coefficient (DW-MRI), for dynamic imaging with injection contrast agent (DCE-MRI) and finally by spectroscopic imaging (IRMS). This multimodality imaging project is part of a multidisciplinary context, involving close collaboration between clinicians, medical physicists, and physicists of the teams participating in this project (Institut Gustave Roussy and U2R2M-CIERM hospital Kremlin-Bicetre).</brief_summary>
