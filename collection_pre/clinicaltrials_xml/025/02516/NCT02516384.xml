	<brief_summary>Inflammatory bowel disease is a condition caused by gastrointestinal immune system dysregulation and affected by both genetic and environmental factors. Differences in intestinal bacteria exist between IBD patients and healthy controls, but the role of intestinal bacteria in the development and treatment of IBD remains largely unknown. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the transfer of gastrointestinal bacteria from a healthy donor to a patient with altered microbial diversity with the intent of restoring a normal bacterial balance. Most studies focus on its use in treating Clostridium difficile (CDI), an infection characterized by dysbiosis. Given the role of dysbiosis in IBD, the investigators hypothesize that FMT may be beneficial in IBD. The purpose of this study is to prospectively examine the safety of FMT in the management of ulcerative colitis (UC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) in the Management of Ulcerative Colitis (UC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with significant morbidity and mortality. Current therapies remain limited by side effects and loss of response over time, and there is an ongoing need for new therapies. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which has proven to be safe and effective in the management of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been proposed as a therapy for UC. There have been studies examining the role of FMT in UC, but they have shown mixed results, and have not examined the underlying immunologic and microbial changes to explain how and why FMT works from specific donors and in certain recipients. Furthermore, no studies have examined the long-term safety of FMT in patients with UC. This proposal aims to examine: (a) the short- and long-term safety of FMT in patients with UC, (b) the efficacy of FMT as a therapy for mild-moderate UC, and (c) the microbial and immunologic changes that occur after FMT, to help understand how and why it works in this group of patients.</detailed_description>
