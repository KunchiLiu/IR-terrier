	<brief_title>OMNIA Efficacy on Body Fat Mass Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overweight and obesity represent a serious public health issue. These conditions are characterized by an abnormal or excessive accumulation of body fat mass and they are related to an increase risk of developing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular, diabetes, arthrosis and certain kind of cancer (breast; colon). It's thus necessary to find new products able to counteract both overweight and obesity. Omnia is a food supplement based on a Phaseolus vulgaris extract. It has pancreatic amylase inhibition properties. In the following clinical trial, OMNIA will be administrated to a group of overweight subjects in order to evaluate its efficacy on reducing the body fat mass. Its action will be compared to a placebo administered to a second group of overweight volunteers with the same modalities as OMNIA.</detailed_description>
