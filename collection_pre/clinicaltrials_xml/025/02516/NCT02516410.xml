	<brief_summary>Study to evaluate the efficacy of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor through Week 12 in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation on the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene and with a second CFTR mutation that is not likely to respond to VX-661 and/or ivacaftor therapy (F508del/not responsive [NR]).</brief_summary>

History of any comorbidity that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the subject An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation, or changes in therapy (including antibiotics) for pulmonary disease within 28 days before Day 1 (first dose of study drug). History of solid organ or hematological transplantation. Ongoing or prior participation in an investigational drug study or use of commercially available CFTR modulator within 30 days of screening.
