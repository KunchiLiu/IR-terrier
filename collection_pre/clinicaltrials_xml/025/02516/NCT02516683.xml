	<brief_summary>Background: The incidence of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) was reported to be in the range of 5-30%, but limited number of long-term follow-up results. Objective: To investigate the long term clinical course of PI-IBS after Shigellosis. Setting: A Shigellosis outbreak in a tertiary referral hospital with about 2,000 employees in Korea at 2001. Patients: A Shigella-exposed cohort of 124 hospital employees who had been infected by Shigella sonnei due to contaminated food in the employee-cafeteria in Gangnam Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea, at December 2001. A control cohort of age and sex-matched, non-infected 105 contemporary hospital employees. Measurements: Questionnaire survey for bowel symptoms at 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10 years after outbreak.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Long Term Clinical Course of Postinfectious Irritable Bowel Syndrome After Shigellosis; A 10 Year Follow up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postinfectious-IBS (PI-IBS) can be defined as the acute onset of new IBS symptoms in an individual, who has not previously met the criteria for IBS, immediately following an acute illness characterized by 2 or more of the following: fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or a positive bacterial stool culture. Our group previously have reported clinical course of PI-IBS in a homogenous cohort which was comprised of patients recovered from Shigellosis. And in current study, we finally report a collective result of 10-year long-term follow-up of our small, but well-followed, homogenous cohort of PI-IBS after Shigellosis.</detailed_description>
