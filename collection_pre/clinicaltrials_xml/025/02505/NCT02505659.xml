	<brief_summary>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACR) rupture is a common lesion of sportsmen that leads to functional deficits which are difficult to overcome. To prevent from an unfavorable evolution, patients can either get a non-surgical treatment or an ACR surgery, which is very common. Knee functional performance level could impact on the postoperative outcome and it's of common knowledge that early re-education after an ACR rupture improves knee functioning. Patients with an ACR rupture enrolled in this study will be randomized either in an experimental group (with preoperative reeducation) or in a control group (without preoperative reeducation). Both groups will then have post-operative re-education (40 sessions) based on HAS recommendations. The main aim of this study is to assess the impact of preoperative re-education on knee functional performance 4 month after surgical reconstruction of an ACR. Secondary aims are to determine the impact of the 4-week preoperative re-education on knee functional performance after an ACR rupture, before surgery and 7 months after surgery. Functional performance, muscular strength, proprioception and anterior knee laxity will be measured at inclusion (V0), 4-5 days before surgery (V1), 4 month (V4M) and 7 months (V7M) after surgery. Lysholme-Tegner scoring and IKDC2000 questionnaire will be added to the previous assessments.</brief_summary>
