	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to summarize our experience with and to evaluate the feasibility of transvaginal four-dimensional hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography using SonoVue (4D-HyCoSy) for assessment of fallopian tubal patency, women attending the fertility clinic are recruited. All of the patients are tried to be examined with 4D-HyCoSy,some of who undergone laparoscopy and dye. Then the results of 4D-HyCoSy and lap and dye are compared. All of the patients will be followed up. The complications of 4D-HyCoSy will be evaluated and the pregnancy outcomes will be recorded.</brief_summary>
