	<brief_title>Meal Presentation and Liking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will complete four experimental sessions, where a main entree with high- or-low volume vegetables (either added as a side item or mixed with the main entree) will be served for lunch, to determine the impact that presentation and liking may have on the consumption of energy dense foods. Once screened participants arrive for their first experimental session, they will record the foods and beverages they consumed in the past 24 hours, as well as write down the minutes of physical activity they participated in, within that same 24 hour period. The participants will rate their hunger, fullness, and liking of foods using a 100 mm VAS. After completing these forms, participants will be presented the appropriate meal, for their condition. Following the presentation of the meal, the participant will rate their liking of the meal appearance and then be instructed to eat as much or as little as they want of the meal provided in 20 minutes. At the completion of the allotted time, the meal will be removed, and the participant will evaluate their level of hunger, fullness, and liking of the foods consumed. The session will conclude with the collection of the hunger, fullness, and liking forms.</detailed_description>
