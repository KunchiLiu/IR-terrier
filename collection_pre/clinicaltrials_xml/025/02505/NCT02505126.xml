	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial on the Efficacy of tDCS) in Reducing Alcohol Consumption in Non-abstinent Patients (REDSTIM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>340 patients are expected and randomized in two groups: 170 patients with active tDCS and 170 patients with placebo tDCS Visit 1 : Patients will received one daily session (13:20:13) during 5 consecutive days: current flows continuously twice for 13min with a rest interval (no stimulation) of 20 min. Visit 1 to 7 : Change from baseline to week 24 in Total Alcohol Consumption (TAC) and Number of Heavy Drinking Days (HDD) will be evaluated in each group. Evaluation on alcohol consumption (daily drinking diary, alcohol craving and severity) and other assessments like mood, quality of life, safety.
