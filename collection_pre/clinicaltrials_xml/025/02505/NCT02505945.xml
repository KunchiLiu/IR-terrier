	<brief_summary>This study compares mechanical sphincter augmentation (LINX Reflux Management System) to double-dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the management of reflux symptoms related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The CALIBER Study Randomized Controlled Trial of LINX Versus Double-Dose Proton Pump Inhibitor Therapy for Reflux Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, multicenter, 2:1 randomized, cross-over, two arms - Control arm: Double-dose PPI [Omeprazole 20 mg BID (twice a day)] - Treatment arm: LINX Reflux Management System Up to 20 study centers throughout the U.S. will participate. Approximately150 patients will be enrolled into the study. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 into the double-dose PPIs arm (100 subjects) and the LINX arm (50 subjects).</detailed_description>
