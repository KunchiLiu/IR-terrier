	<brief_title>Nadolol Versus Propranolol in Children With Infantile Hemangiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of oral propranolol in comparison with oral nadolol in patients with IH. Patients will be randomly assigned to either propranolol or dose equivalent nadolol. The duration of the study will be 24 weeks, however, patient will be monitored for up to 1 year post study enrolment. Both efficacy and safety will be closely monitored and captured.</detailed_description>
