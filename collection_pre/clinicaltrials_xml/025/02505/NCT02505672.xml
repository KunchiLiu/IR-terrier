	<brief_summary>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is usually treated with chemoradiotherapy. While the effects of this treatment on cochlear function is well characterized, its effect on vestibular function is not well studied. In this study the investigators will study the vestibular function of 50 patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy for NPC both before and after treatment in order to better define its effects. All patients will undergo a validated questionnaire (dizziness handicap index), posturography, audiometry and vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials.</brief_summary>
