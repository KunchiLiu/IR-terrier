	<brief_summary>This is an exploratory, open, prospective multi-centre study of VB10.16 immunotherapy in patients with high grade HPV16+ Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (HSIL; CIN2/3). This study will recruit approximately 27-40 female patients with high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (HSIL, CIN 2/3) at multiple sites in Europe.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Exploratory Safety and Immunogenicity Study of HPV16+ Immunotherapy VB10.16 in Women With HSIL; CIN 2/3)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be divided into two phases, a dosing and expansion phase. During the dosing phase the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 2 different vaccination schedules of 3 mg VB10.16 immunotherapy will be established in a minimum of 12 patients with histology confirmed CIN 2. During the expansion phase the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the selected vaccination schedule will be evaluated in approximately 15 to 20 patients with histology confirmed HPV16+ CIN 2/3.</detailed_description>
