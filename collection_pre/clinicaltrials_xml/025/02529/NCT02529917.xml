	<brief_summary>Forty physically active men and women aged 18-45y will take part in an 8-week resistance training program, randomized (double blind) 1:1 into each of two groups. Twenty participants will be randomized to receive 60 g/d of hemp powder (containing approximately 40 g protein and 9 g oil) supplementation and 20 randomized to receive 60 g/d of soy supplementation (matched to the hemp for macronutrients and calories) during eight weeks of training. Each participant will complete testing before and after the intervention for assessment of body composition (lean tissue, fat, and bone mass), strength, central fatigue, markers of inflammation, and bone resorption. Over the 8-weeks of training, participants will train four-five days per week for 1-1.5 hours per session with exercises targeting all major muscle groups. The training will involve a "two day split" where different muscle groups are trained on two consecutive days (day 1 involves chest, back, and arms; day 2 legs, shoulders, and abdominals). Resistance training will provide the necessary stimulus for protein synthesis to optimize the effect of a protein-containing nutritional supplement. The hemp or soy powder will be consumed in two doses (i.e. 30 g powder containing 20 g protein per dose) immediately after exercise sessions and one hour after exercise. This dosing regimen is optimal for stimulating muscle protein synthesis and building muscle mass . On the one non-training day per week the two doses will be consumed with meals.</brief_summary>
