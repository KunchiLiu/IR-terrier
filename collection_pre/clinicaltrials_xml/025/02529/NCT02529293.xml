	<brief_summary>This is a double-blinded, randomised, single-centre phase I pilot trial for exploring the feasibility of a pivotal clinical trial establishing bioequivalence between BioChaperone insulin lispro U-200 and BioChaperone insulin lispro U-100 in healthy subjects. Each subject will be randomly allocated to a sequence of four treatments, i.e. two single doses of BioChaperone insulin lispro U-200 of 0.2 U·kg BW-1 and two single doses of BioChaperone insulin lispro U-100 of 0.2 U·kg BW-1 on four separate dosing visits.</brief_summary>
