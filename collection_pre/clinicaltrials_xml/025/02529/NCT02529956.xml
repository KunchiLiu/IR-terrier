	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Subject is male or female, aged ≥ 18 years to ≤ 70 years at Screening. Female subjects must either be postmenopausal (at least 1 year), permanently sterilized or, if of childbearing potential, must be willing to use at least 2 effective methods of contraception, including a barrier method during the study period. Effective methods of contraception are methods of birth control, which result in a low failure rate when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, oral contraceptives, progesteronereleasing intrauterine systems or the TCu 380A intrauterine device, complete sexual abstinence, or vasectomized partner. Male subjects with partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use a condom when sexually active. Both male and female subjects must use the above mentioned contraception for 20 weeks after administration of study drug (anticipated 5 halflives) Subject has had a confirmed diagnosis of mild to moderate plaquetype psoriasis for at least 6 months involving ≤ 5 % of body surface area (BSA) (excluding the scalp) Subject has a body mass index of ≤ 35 kg/m^2 at Screening Subject has a minimum of 2 psoriatic lesions with at least 1 plaque in a site suitable for biopsy Female subject who is pregnant, or plans to become pregnant during the study, or lactating, or sexually active with childbearing potential who is not using a medically accepted birth control method Subject has received systemic nonbiologic psoriasis therapy (methotrexate [MTX], steroids, cyclophosphamide) or psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA)/ultraviolet A (UVA) phototherapy within 4 weeks prior to Screening Subject has received treatment with biologic agents within 12 months prior to the study Subject has received live attenuated vaccination within 6 weeks prior to Screening or intends to have such a vaccination during the course of the study Subject has received any investigational drug or experimental procedure within 90 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, prior to IMP administration Subject requires treatment with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug during the study period. Paracetamol will be permitted for use as an antipyretic and/or analgesic Subject has an active infection (eg, sepsis, pneumonia, abscess) or has had a serious infection (resulting in hospitalization or requiring parenteral antibiotic treatment) within 6 weeks prior to IMP administration. When in doubt, the Investigator should confer with the UCB Study Physician Subject has a history of a positive tuberculosis (TB) test or evidence of possible TB or latent TB infection at Screening that cannot be attributed to a prior Bacillus CalmetteGuérin inoculation Subject has renal or liver impairment, defined as: For women, serum creatinine level ≥ 125 μmol/L; for men, ≥ 135 μmol/L, or ALT and aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 2x ULN, or Alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &gt; 1.5x ULN (an isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5x ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin is &lt; 35 %) Subject has active neoplastic disease or history of neoplastic disease within 5 years of Screening (except for basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ that has been definitively treated with standard of care)</criteria>
