	<criteria>1116 years old middle school students from two locations in Guangdong Province. With ≤ 1.00 Diopter of myopic refractive error in each eye. With uncorrected vision ≤ 6/12 in both eyes thought to be due to refractive error (that is, correctable to at least 6/7.5 with subjective refraction by an optometrist). With informed consents(There are two types of informed consents. One of them is whether the parents of the students agree their kids to participate in the project. The other informed consent is whether the parents agree their kids to have the cycloplegic refraction. If the students were admitted to participate in project but without being agreed to have cycloplegic refraction by their parents , they would have non cycloplegic retinoscopy.). Those corrected VA can not up to 6/7.5 with subjective refraction by an optometrist. Those with significant strabismus or vision abnormality (keratopathy, cataract, vitreous macular diseases ), or with vision deficiency ( amblyopia ) children are to be excluded. Children developing acquired vision problems other than myopia.</criteria>
