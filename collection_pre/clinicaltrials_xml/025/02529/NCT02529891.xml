	<brief_summary>Exacerbations of the disease are a hallmark of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), affecting the decline of pulmonary function, quality of life and increasing morbidity. The use of validated biomarkers could help to identify the etiology of exacerbation and to prescribe antibiotherapy when indicated. The analysis of exhaled air allows measuring different volatile organic compounds (VOC) which reflect local or systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. The relationship between the presence of some of these compounds and the exacerbation of COPD has never been studied. The aim of this study is to identify a cluster of VOC in COPD patients during an acute exacerbation of the disease, compared to a stable condition (3 months after discharge). Investigators also will seek for a relationship between VOC and the etiology of exacerbation (bacterial, viral, inflammatory).</brief_summary>
