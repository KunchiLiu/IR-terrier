	<criteria>Have advanced or metastatic cancer and be an appropriate candidate for experimental therapy. Part B: Have a diagnosis of bladder cancer. Part B and C: Have alterations of FGFR3. Have adequate organ function. Have discontinued previous treatments for cancer and have resolution, except where otherwise stated in the inclusion criteria, of all clinically significant toxic effects of prior chemotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy to Grade ≤1 by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 (v 4.0). If participant is of reproductive potential, must agree to use medically approved contraceptive precautions during the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug. If the participant is a female of childbearing potential, must have had a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of the first dose of study drug and must not be breastfeeding. Have received treatment within 28 days of the initial dose of study drug with an investigational product or nonapproved use of a drug or device (other than the study drug/device used in this study) or are concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study. Have preexisting corneal disease that may interfere with assessment for potential eye toxicity during the study. Have preexisting Grade ≥2 skin disorder (for example, erythema, dermatitis). Have serious preexisting medical conditions (left to the discretion of the investigator). Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis (screening not required). Participants with treated CNS metastases are eligible for this study if they are not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants, and their disease is asymptomatic and radiographically stable for at least 28 days. Have current acute or chronic leukemia. Have an active fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or viral (A, B, or C) hepatitis (screening is not required). Have a second primary malignancy that, in the judgment of the investigator and sponsor, may affect the interpretation of results. Curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of any origin is allowed. Have Fridericiacorrected QT interval (QTcF) &gt;480 milliseconds on screening electrocardiogram (ECG). Have a serious cardiac condition, such as congestive heart failure; New York Heart Association Class III/IV heart disease; unstable angina pectoris; myocardial infarction within the last 3 months; valvulopathy that is severe, moderate, or deemed clinically significant; or arrhythmias that are symptomatic or require treatment (not including participants with ratecontrolled atrial fibrillation).</criteria>
