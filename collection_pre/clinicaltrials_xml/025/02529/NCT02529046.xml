	<detailed_description>The aim of this investigation was to analyze the effects of eight weeks of CLA supplementation associated with aerobic exercise on body fat and lipid profile in obese women. The investigators performed a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial with 28 obese women who received 3.2 g/d of CLA or 4 g/d of olive oil (placebo group) while performing an 8-week protocol of aerobic exercise. Dietary intake (food record), body fat (DXA) and biochemical analysis (blood sample) were assessed before and after the intervention period.</detailed_description>
