	<brief_summary>The mainstay treatment for reducing the symptoms of angina and long-term risk of heart attacks in patients with heart disease is stent implantation in the diseased coronary artery. Whilst this procedure has revolutionised treatment the incidence of secondary events remains a concern. These repeat events are due in part to continued enhanced platelet reactivity, endothelial dysfunction and a phenomenon called 'restenosis' i.e. the stent becomes blocked ultimately requiring another expensive and risky procedure. In this study it will be determined whether a once daily inorganic nitrate administration might favourably modulate platelet reactivity and endothelial function leading to a decrease in restenosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating the Effects of Dietary Nitrate on Vascular Function, Platelet Reactivity and Restenosis in Stable Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To address the aims a proof-of-concept study will be conducted to ascertain whether a dietary nitrate approach might prove useful adjunctive therapy improving vascular function in patients with stable angina post elective angioplasty. Design: A prospective randomised, single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial Setting: Patients with stable angina and single/multiple coronary artery stenosis undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who are haemodynamically stable (systolic BP&gt;100 mmHg). These patients will be recruited at The Barts Health Heart Centre, based at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. This is one of the biggest centres in the United Kingdom, serving a population of almost two million people from The City of London and The North East up to the M25 and is a 24/7 centre performing approximately 2000 non-primary angioplasties a year. The study will take place in the Clinical Trials Unit, William Harvey Heart Centre. Target population: A total of 246 patients (male and female, age 18-85) with stable angina as per requirements indicated above. Follow-up will take place in the Clinical Trials Unit, William Harvey Research Institute. Treatment: Patients will be randomised (using an on line randomisation database) to receive 70 ml of a beetroot juice concentrate containing 4-5 mmol nitrate or nitrate-deplete placebo juice concentrate. This intervention will be taken by the patient daily from one day prior to re-establishment of flow with PCI and stent implantation. Analysis: We will analyse the results based on an intention to treat analysis. We will also carry out further per protocol analyses and a subgroup analysis on patients who are on organic nitrates as part of their routine therapy and a comparison of DES (drug-eluting stents) versus BMS (bare-metal stents).</detailed_description>
