	<brief_summary>Maintenance of analgesia during a patient stay in the hospital has been an important area of investigation after demonstrating a direct correlation between level of sedation and mortality in the ICU setting. This study will investigate the use of accelerometers in determining patient sedation level.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring Sedation in the Intensive Care Unit Using Wireless Accelerometers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of the study is to use accelerometers to track patient movement while under sedation in the ICU. Analysis of patient movement may reveal objective means to measuring patient level of sedation. Average length of stay is estimated to be one week.</detailed_description>
