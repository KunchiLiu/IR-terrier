	<brief_title>Pre-Marketing Feasibility Evaluation of the UriCap-RM - Urine Collection in Hospitalized Male Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following various disease conditions such as trauma, orthopedic surgery, and infections etc., patients may be bedridden and unable to void in a bedpan or to make their way to the toilet. Others may be incontinent of urine. In such situations an indwelling catheter is often placed to relieve patients while they are incapacitated; in many cases a catheter is placed despite lack of urinary retention. Indwelling catheters, although effective, are associated with discomfort, pain, and urinary tract infections. In other cases diapers or absorbent pads may be used, or a condom-type urine collection device. These may be associated with skin irritation and infection. The study will evaluate the UriCap-RM non-invasive urine collection device in hospitalized men.</detailed_description>
