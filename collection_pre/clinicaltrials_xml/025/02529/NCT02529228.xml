	<brief_title>Combined Effects of Meal Frequency and Protein Load on Cardiometabolic Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardio-Metabolic Disease (CMD) is the leading cause of death globally &amp; in Singapore. Large scale epidemiological evidence confirmed that elevated postprandial Glucose, Insulin, Triglycerides are major risk factors for CMD. Recent evidence suggests benefits from high protein diets but the health effects of eating smaller meals remain enigmatic. The aim of this study is to examine Meal frequency (2-large vs 6-smaller isocaloric meals), under High or Low Protein loads on acute postprandial health biomarkers . The investigators hypothesized that Higher Protein &amp; Higher Meal Frequency would be beneficial for cardiometabolic health.</detailed_description>
