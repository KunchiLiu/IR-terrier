	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if a high-protein meal leads to a better postprandial (after a meal) blood lipid profile compared to a high-monounsaturated meal.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Meal Composition on Blood Lipids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect of a high-protein diet compared to a high-monounsaturated fat diet on fasting lipids is controversial (1,2), In addition, these studies did not examine the effect of a high-protein compared to a high-monounsaturated meal on postprandial lipid concentrations. Postprandial lipid responses are important to examine since they are associated with heart disease (3,4). In addition, most individuals in Western countries are in a postprandial state for majority of the day. The present study will compare the effect of a high-protein meal versus a high-monounsaturated fat meal on postprandial lipid responses.</detailed_description>
