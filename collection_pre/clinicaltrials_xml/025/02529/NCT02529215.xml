	<brief_summary>Communication and teamwork failures are the leading causes of errors in healthcare settings. In situ mock code simulations are a potential means to train team-based skills using simulation within real clinical care environments where errors occur; however, debriefing discussions often focus on gaps in learners' clinical skills as opposed to team functioning. This study aims to determine whether learners who are pre-trained using just-in-time simulation regarding CPR quality and medication administration will exhibit improved performance with respect to these skills during in situ mock codes as well as improved team functioning.</brief_summary>
