	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to fully test a culturally/religiously-tailored, church-based HIV screening intervention (TIPS) against a standard HIV information intervention on HIV screening rates at 6 and 12 months with adult African American church members and community members who use church outreach services. Our secondary outcome is to reduce sexual risk behaviors with this same population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Church-based HIV Screening: Taking It to the Pews</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is to fully test a culturally/religiously-tailored, church-based HIV screening intervention against a standard HIV information intervention on HIV screening rates at 6 and 12 months with adult AA church members and community members who use church outreach services. In this two-arm clustered, randomized community trial, churches will be matched on SES, membership size, and denomination, then randomized to treatment condition. It is projected that 14 churches (7 churches per arm; 110 church and community members per church; 1,540 participants total) will be required to detect significant increases in HIV screening in the intervention arm. Intervention content is guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Intervention delivery will be guided by a Community Engagement and Social-Ecological approach. This approach includes church leaders delivering culturally/religiously-appropriate HIV education and screening materials (e.g., sermon guides, HIV screening testimonials, church bulletins) and activities (e.g., pastors modeling receipt of HIV screening, HIV screening events) from a church-based HIV Tool Kit through multilevel church outlets (community-wide, church-wide services, ministry and outreach groups, individual) to increase intervention reach and dosage. It was hypothesized that this church-based HIV screening intervention will significantly increase HIV screening rates vs a standard HIV information intervention in AA church-populations at 6 and 12 months. The role of potential mediators and moderators related to receipt of HIV screening will be evaluated and a process evaluation to determine modifiable implementation fidelity, facilitators, barriers, and costs related to increasing church-based HIV testing rates will be conducted. This intervention study could provide an effective, scalable model for HIV screening interventions in AA churches.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All participants must be: aged 18 to 64; willing to participate in 3 surveys after church services or church outreach activities Willing to provide contact information (two phone numbers, mailing and email address, phone numbers for two persons with whom they have ongoing contact) Attend church at least once a month or use church outreach services, such as food and clothing programs, at least 4 times per year. Minors 18 and under are intentionally excluded since the intervention study has been designed specifically for adults with information of how HIV affects the African American adult population.</criteria>
