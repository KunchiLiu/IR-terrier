	<brief_summary>Severe obesity (SO), defined as BMI≥95th percentile, has increased worldwide among adolescents. American studies estimated that 1.3-2.8% of 12-19-year-old individuals have a BMI &gt;40 kg/m2 or a BMI &gt;35 kg/m2 with at least one serious co-morbidity. The immediate and long-term risks associated with SO in adolescents include cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, obstructive sleep apnoea and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, the results of sleeve gastrectomy in adolescents are still uncertain. Objective and hypotheses: Investigators aimed to assess the long-term safety, efficacy, and cardiovascular risk changes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in adolescents with SO. Method: Longitudinal retrospective study of 22 adolescents with SO who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Clinical and metabolic variables immediately before surgery and after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months were assessed.</brief_summary>
