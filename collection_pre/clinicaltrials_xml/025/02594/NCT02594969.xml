	<brief_summary>The goal is this study is to investigate the effects of dilute bleach on the skin of subjects with atopic dermatitis and those with healthy skin. The second goal is to evaluate the effects of different moisturizers on the skin barrier of subjects with and without atopic dermatitis. The investigators hypothesize that the bleach bath will increase the skin pH, decrease the skin hydration, and increase skin water loss in all study subjects. Secondly, the investigators hypothesize that moisturizers with the lowest pH and the highest water to oil ratio will result in improved skin barrier function. Furthermore, the investigators believe there will be a greater improvement in patients with atopic dermatitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Diluted Sodium Hypochlorite Solution and Moisturizers on Skin Barrier Function in Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study has two main parts. Subjects in both groups will have one forearm in a dilute bleach bath and the other arm in a water bath for 10 minutes. The change in skin will be measured using different painless devices. The second part of the study involves application of 4 various moisturizers. The change in skin will be measured over a period of time using the non-invasive devices.</detailed_description>
