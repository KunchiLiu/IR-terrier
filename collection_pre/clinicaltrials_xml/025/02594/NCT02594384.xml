	<brief_title>A Phase I Dose Escalation Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of LAM-002A In Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LAM-002A is supplied as 25 mg capsules and will be administered twice daily (BID) by mouth with a cycle length of 28 days. Patients will be advised to take the doses at the same time each day, approximately 12 hours apart on an empty stomach (no food within 2 hours prior to dose, or within 2 hours after dose). A 3 + 3 design will be utilized to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients (i.e., &lt; 33%) experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the dose cohort. Once the dose and schedule are established, additional patients will be treated to better characterize the safety, tolerability, preliminary anti-tumor activity, PK and pharmacodynamics of the study drug.</detailed_description>
