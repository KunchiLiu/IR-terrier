	<brief_summary>To investigate whether the administration of Glucerna achieves less glycaemic variability, defined as the mean absolute glucose (MAG) change, and better glycaemic control compared to a standard high-carbohydrate enteral formula. Continuous glucose monitoring technology will be used to evaluate glycaemic variability and glycaemic control.</brief_summary>
