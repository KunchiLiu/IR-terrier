	<detailed_description>This is a single center 4-arm randomized pilot study to assess if the rate of completion of Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) is increased by the addition of financial incentives. Potentially eligible subjects will be identified via a data abstraction by Penn Data Store. We will conduct Electronic Medical Record (EMR) reviews on randomly select patients from the data abstraction using PennChart to confirm eligibility until 1,080 patients are identified. We will then randomize these 1,080 patients to one of four arms during the intervention phase. - Arm 1: mailed FIT kit (usual care) - Arm 2: mailed FIT kit + a gift card included in mailing (unconditional fixed incentive) - Arm 3: mailed FIT kit + guarantee of receiving a gift card if kit is returned within two months (conditional fixed incentive) - Arm 4: mailed FIT kit + entry in a 1/10 chance lottery to receive a gift card if kit is returned within two months (conditional lottery incentive) All 1,080 subjects will receive the mailed FIT kit. Subjects whose FIT results are not recorded in PennChart will receive a follow-up phone call via Interactive Voice Response (IVR) three weeks after the kit was mailed to the subject. Subjects whose FIT results are not recorded in PennChart will receive a follow-up mailed reminder six weeks after the kit was mailed to the subject. Subjects will receive follow-up regardless of the arm to which they are randomized. A random sub-sample of 200 subjects will be called at least twelve weeks after the kit was mailed to the subject to complete a questionnaire. Verbal consent will be obtained from this sub-sample. This phone call will occur after the intervention and follow-up phases are completed. Analysis will occur after the sub-sample questionnaire phase is completed.</detailed_description>
