	<brief_summary>The investigators are performing this research study to determine whether having low iron-sulfur cluster levels can cause a disease known as pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH is defined as abnormally high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. Usually, small specialized structures inside each human cell called mitochondria are in charge of generating energy within lung arteries for normal function. During situations of disease or stress, lung arteries undergo a change in teh function of mitochondria, resulting in the development of PH. In studies on mice, investigators have learned that alterations in the production of specific metal complexes called iron-sulfur clusters are responsible for these changes. This makes it more likely that mice will develop PH. In this study, the investigators want to find out if alteration of iron-sulfur cluster formation leads to increased likelihood of developing PH in humans.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TEST GROUP Study Visit One - Consent by PI or Sub-Investigator - Medical History Review by interview and chart review by PI/Sub-Investigator and Research Coordinator - Physical Exam by PI or Sub-Investigator - Vital Signs by research coordinator - Pregnancy Test via blood for women who are of child bearing age by research coordinator - Blood work (kidney/liver, blood count, coagulation, B-HCG, iron studies, and plasma for microRNA) processed at Presby Lab - Blood draw (3.5 tablespoons) drawn by research coordinator. This blood is to isolate PBMCs for generation of iPSCs (in case the skin biopsy does not work). In this case, the investigator's lab will take the blood and skin biopsy and ship directly on ice to the investigator's collaborator at Yale (Yibing Qyang). - ECG, done by research coordinator and read by PI/Sub-Investigator - 6 Minute Walk Test, done by research coordinator - Skin Biopsy from underarm or inner thigh by Dr. Laura Ferris. Patients will be escorted by research coordinator to the 3rd floor of Falk to the Dermatology Clinic. All visits will occur in Outpatient Cardiology at Presby 5B clinic except the Skin Biopsy as noted. This visit will last 6-7 hours. Study Visit Two - Right Heart Catheterization will be done in Presby's Cath Lab by PI/Sub-Investigator. Duration ~ 3 hours - IF the results show that the pressure in the lung vessels is elevated without exercise AND there is no other abnormality in the heart function, the investigator will NOT need to perform exercise testing. In that case the patient will have resting echocardiography. (determined by PI/Sub-Investigator) - In all other cases, patients will have an Exercise Right Heart Catheterization and a Rest and Stress Echocardiography. (Determined by PI/Sub-Investigator - Resting Echocardiogram completed in the echocardiogram lab at Presby by a trained sonographer. Results given to PI/Sub-Investigator. Duration ~ 30-45 minutes - Exercise Echocardiogram completed in Presby's cath lab. If patient unable to exercise medication (Dobutamine) will be given. Duration ~ 1-2 hours - Exercise Right Heart Catheterization will be completed in Presby Cath Lab by Dr. Ishizawar. Duration ~ 2-3 hours CONTROL GROUP Study Visit One - Consent by PI or Sub-Investigator - Medical History Review by interview and chart review by PI/Sub-Investigator and Research Coordinator - Physical Exam by PI or Sub-Investigator - Vital Signs by research coordinator - Pregnancy Test via urine for women who are of child bearing age by research coordinator - Blood work (kidney/liver, blood count, coagulation, iron studies, and plasma for microRNA) - Blood draw (3.5 tablespoons), drawn by research coordinator.

	<criteria>Test Group: 1. consenting individuals age 1860 years of age) 2. have a confirmed genetic homozygous mutation (including ISCU1/2, FXN, BOLA3, NFU1) that causes the impairment of ironsulfur cluster formation; such a subject will not be excluded from this study even if that patient's first degree relative(s) does not enroll in this pilot study. 3. clinical indication for RHC and advanced CPET with documentation of a physician referral. These indications include dyspnea, dyspnea on exertion, heart failure, and exercise intolerance where the etiology is not known or the symptoms are out of proportion to any documented comorbidities 4. Insurance preapproval for RHC and advanced CPET for subjects living in the United States and who have health insurance; no such preapproval is necessary for subjects living outside the United States 5. No records of a prior RHC documenting normal pulmonary arterial and right heart filling pressures with normal cardiac output. Control Group: 1. Consenting individuals age 1860 years of age) 2. First degree family member (mother, father, sister, brother, son, or daughter) of recruited individual in the test group; 3. Have a confirmed heterozygous genetic mutation (including ISCU1/2, FXN, BOLA3, NFU1). Test Group: 1. Inability to exercise on a stationary bike 2. Impaired decision making capacity 3. Inability to consent to procedures 4. Children less than 18 years of age and adults older than 60 years of age 5. Current pregnancy 6. Inability to tolerate CPET, echocardiography, or PET scan 7. Prior RHC documenting normal pulmonary arterial and right heart filling pressures with normal cardiac output. Control Group: 1. Impaired decision making capacity 2. Inability to consent to procedures 3. Current pregnancy 4. Children less than 18 years of age and adults older than 60 years of age 5.
