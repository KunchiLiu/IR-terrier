	<brief_title>Ph3 Study To Determine Safety,Tolerability&amp;Tumor Response Of Oraxol Compared To Taxol In Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized, multicenter study in approximately 360 adult female subjects with histologically- or cytologically-confirmed breast cancer that is metastatic for whom treatment with IV paclitaxel monotherapy has been recommended by their oncologist. Approximately 400 subjects will be enrolled to provide 360 evaluable subjects. The subjects must have measurable metastatic target lesion disease as per RECIST v1.1 criteria. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either Oraxol or IV paclitaxel (as Taxol or generic).</detailed_description>
