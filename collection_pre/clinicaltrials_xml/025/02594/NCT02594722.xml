	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) had systemic repercussion and lead to peripheral muscular dysfunction. Muscular atrophy limits aerobic capacity and is a major limitation of daily activity and quality of life. Technologies likes' neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) are currently being adapted and tested to support exercise training. The investigators hypothesized that functional electrical stimulation cycling improves VO2 and aerobic capacities during exercise compared to endurance training.</brief_summary>
