	<brief_title>Shock Wave Lithotripsy Versus Visual Cystolitholapaxy in The Management of Patients Presenting With Calcular Acute Urinary Retention: A Randomized Controlled Trial.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who present with acute urinary retention due to stone in the urethra or urinary bladder will be randomly assigned to receive treatment either by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy or by endoscopic visual cystolitholapaxy where patients and stone characteristics will be recorded and the outcome including the intraoperative and postoperative complications and the stone free rate will be also evaluated</detailed_description>
