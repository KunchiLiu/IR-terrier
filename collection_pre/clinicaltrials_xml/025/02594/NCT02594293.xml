	<brief_summary>This study evaluates whether Peg-IFN alfa-2a can reduce the recurrence rate of hepatitis B in 96 weeks after nucleoside analogue (NUC) withdrawal. The HBV HBeAg-Negative patients who received NUC anti-virus treatment for 2.5 years and reached stopping rule in 《Chinese chronic hepatitis B prevention and treatment guidelines》(2010) were randomly assigned into three groups: One group discontinue the NUC treatment and follow up for 96 weeks,One discontinue the NUC treatment ,receive Peg-IFN alfa-2a 180 μg by week for 24 weeks and follow up for 72 weeks,The other discontinue the NUC treatment ,receive Peg-IFN alfa-2a 180 μg by week for 48 weeks and follow up for 48 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pegylated Interferon(Peg-IFN) in Reducing Relapse Rate in Patients After Discontinuation of NUC Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NUC is a potent inhibitor of hepatitis B viral(HBV) replication, but long-term therapy may be required. Therefore, NUC resistance is an important clinical risk resulting from long-term therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) management. Discontinuation of NUC is a feasible strategy to reduce resistance. However, the high rate of relapse after cessation of NUC treatment in CHB patients remains a big problem. NUC treatment of how to safely stop drug needs to be solved. Peg-IFN can clear HBV by direct anti-viral and immune regulation mechanisms including enhancing natural killer cell response, increased cluster of differentiation 8(CD8 +) T lymphocytes and other mechanisms to restore and enhance the immune response in patients with CHB. Response to PEG-IFN is frequently sustained after a finite treatment course due to its immune modulating capacity.</detailed_description>
