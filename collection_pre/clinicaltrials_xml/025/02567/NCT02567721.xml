	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot study to explore the potential use of routinely collected data in General Practitioner (GP) practices to conduct enhanced safety surveillance of seasonal influenza vaccines in the UK, as recommended in the EMA interim guidance on enhanced safety surveillance for seasonal influenza vaccines in the EU.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-authorisation Safety Study (PASS) of Influenza Vaccine in United Kingdom (UK)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data routinely collected as part of clinical consultations in primary care will be extracted from nine General Practitioner (GP) practices in order to estimate medically attended Adverse Events of Interest (AEIs), for people who have received an influenza vaccine. This study will also actively follow patients who were exposed to seasonal influenza vaccination for 7 days in three of the nine GP practices using a customised card-based adverse drug reaction reporting system, in order to determine whether a more active approach to surveillance can capture higher rates of AEIs.</detailed_description>
