	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Comparing Endometrial Transformation With Subcutaneous Progesterone Versus Intramuscular Progesterone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to compare predecidualization and endometrial receptivity as gene expression by using subcutaneous progesterone 25 mg/day versus intramuscular progesterone 50 mg/day in healthy women of childbearing age. Both, the two drugs and the doses administered in this clinical trial, are routine clinical practice. A controlled ovarian stimulation will be previously performed and following routine clinical practice for 10-12 days at standard doses of subcutaneous FSH 150-225 IU/day, according to BMI and number of antral follicles. A GnRH antagonist shall be administered, being initiated according to donor's follicular growth from greater or equal14 mm diameter follicles. Final maturation shall be performed with a bolus of GnRH agonist when there exist at least 3 follicles greater or equal17 mm diameter, and therefore performing follicular puncture 36 hours after the bolus of agonist has been administered. If the donor meets the inclusion criteria, she will be informed of the study and, if she agrees, she will sign the informed consent. Randomization shall be performed in 2 arms; arm 1 will be administered subcutaneous progesterone 25 mg/day (Prolutex; Angelini, Spain), and arm 2, intramuscular progesterone 50 mg/day (Prontogest IBSA, Italy). In each arm 12 donors (ITT population) will be included. The randomization to a treatment group shall be performed the day the follicular puncture has been programmed. To that purpose, a randomized consecutive sampling will be used by means of assignment tables. The medication will be administered by a person not involved in the assessments and responsible for group assignment, data centralization and drug assignment. At day 5 (5 days after follicular puncture):endometrial thickness measurement by means of transvaginal ultrasound and perform endometrial biopsy and take two samples: 1 sample to Anatomical Pathology and 1 sample to Endometrial Receptivity Array (ERA).</detailed_description>
