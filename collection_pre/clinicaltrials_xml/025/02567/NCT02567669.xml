	<brief_summary>This study examines the extent of systemic muscle loss and the degree of fatigue experienced by breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. This study seeks to identify whether muscle loss occurs outside the radiation fields and if muscle loss is correlated with the degree of fatigue.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Muscle Loss and Fatigue as a Consequence of Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study uses a patient reported survey to assess fatigue prior to radiotherapy for breast cancer. Fatigue is measured again at the completion of radiation treatments and at one and three months following completion of radiation. Muscle measurements are made outside the treatment area using ct scans prior to radiation treatment, at the completion of radiation treatment and at one and three months after radiation treatment. The degree of fatigue and changes in muscle will be assessed. Changes will be correlated to determine if muscle loss contributes to fatigue.</detailed_description>
