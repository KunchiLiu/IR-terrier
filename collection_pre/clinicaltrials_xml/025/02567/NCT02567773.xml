	<brief_summary>GSK2881078 is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) that is being evaluated for effects on muscle growth and strength in subjects with muscle wasting to improve their physical function. Part A of this study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GSK2881078 in healthy, older men and post-menopausal women who will take daily dosing for 28 days and be followed for a total of 70 days. Part B of this study will characterize the effect of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibition on the GSK2881078 pharmacokinetics. Part B will only be conducted if safe and efficacious dose is identified in Part A. Part A will include healthy older males and post-menopausal females; and randomize approximately 60 subjects (about 15 per cohort [4 cohorts]) to complete approximately 48 (about 12 per cohort). Part B will enroll one cohort of approximately 15 healthy male subjects to complete approximately 12. The study duration will be approximately 115 days for Part A and 122 days for Part B.</brief_summary>

Male subjects with a family history of early onset (55 years of age or younger) prostate cancer or 2 or more direct family members with prostate cancer. Unable to refrain from prescription or nonprescription drugs as described in protocol. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study.

Metal implants (contraindicated for MRI and disrupt DXA imaging). These include intraorbital metal fragments. Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment. For potent immunosuppressive agents, subjects with presence of hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) should also be excluded. A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Subjects who previously received GSK2881078 are allowed to participate in this trial, with the same timeline restrictions. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) &gt;4.0 nanograms (ng)/mL.
