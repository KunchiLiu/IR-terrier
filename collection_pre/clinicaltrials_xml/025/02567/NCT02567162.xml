	<brief_summary>The aim of this project is development of a comprehensive, prospective, multinational, multicenter, hospital-based, data repository for patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multinational Survey of Epidemiology, Morbidity, and Outcomes in Intracerebral Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MNEMONICH is a disease-specific registry of prospectively collected data obtained from the integration and harmonization of preexisting single-center data sets. It was formed to provide clinician-scientists around the world a comprehensive database to direct future studies toward better understanding of ICH. MNEMONICH will help examine global variability in the prevalence of ICH and identify research priorities. New data for MNEMONICH will be prospectively collected on a wide range of features including demographics, medical history, dates and times of symptom onset, presentation symptoms, hemodynamic signs, initial and chronic medical therapy, diagnostic imaging, laboratory and genetic analyses, pathological data, and surgical and medical management. Future research will be based upon ad hoc analysis of this data.</detailed_description>
