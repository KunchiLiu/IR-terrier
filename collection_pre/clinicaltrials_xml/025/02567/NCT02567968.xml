	<brief_summary>At present clinicians have no way to reverse anesthesia. Patients wake when their bodies clear the anesthetic. Most people wake quickly, but some do not. All patients have memory and other cognitive problems after waking from anesthesia. In studies on animals, the investigators observed that caffeine caused rats and mice to wake much more rapidly from anesthesia. This was true for all the animals tested. The investigators would like to see if this holds true in humans. Will caffeine accelerate waking from anesthesia? Will it reverse the cognitive deficits associated with anesthesia, after waking? The investigators hope to start with a very modest pilot program. Each volunteer will be anesthetized twice. Each volunteer will be anesthetized one time and allowed to wake without the aid of any other drugs and the other time they volunteer will receive a relatively low dose of caffeine after anesthesia. If no adverse effects are observed in the Pilot program, the investigators will expand the study. At this dosage of caffeine, animal studies suggest approximately a dozen volunteers will be required to complete the study.</brief_summary>
