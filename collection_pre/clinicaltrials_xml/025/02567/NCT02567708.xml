	<brief_summary>This study is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled (with rescue medication), two period crossover study in subjects with persistent uncontrolled asthma, currently not treated with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or long acting beta 2 agonist (LABA). This study is the first administration of GSK2269557 to asthmatic subjects, and the aims of the study are to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of four weeks of treatment with orally inhaled GSK2269557 1000 microgram (mcg) in subjects with persistent uncontrolled asthma. In a sub-study, biological mediators will be measured from induced sputum and blood. Approximately 50 subjects will be randomised into the study (including approximately 16 subjects in the sputum sub-study). Each subject will complete two treatment periods: subjects will be randomised to receive GSK2269557 1000 mcg in one treatment period, and matching placebo in the other treatment period. Each treatment will be administered once daily for 28 days (+/- 2 days) via the DISKUSâ„¢ dry powder inhaler (DPI). The study will consist of a Screening Visit; a Run-in Period (approximately 2 weeks in duration); two 28-day Treatment Periods (each with 4 clinic visits); a 4-week Washout Period (between the Treatment Periods); and a Follow-up Visit. The total duration of the study for each subject will be approximately 16 weeks. DISKUS is a registered trademark of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between 18 and 70 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Documented history of bronchial asthma, first diagnosed at least 6 months prior to the screening visit and currently being treated only with an intermittent short acting beta 2 agonist (SABA) or other noncorticosteroid controllers. Non corticosteroid controllers (e.g. leukotriene receptor antagonists [LTRAs]) must be discontinued from Screening until the end of Treatment Period 2. Able to replace current SABA treatment with salbutamol metered dose inhaler (MDI) at Screening for use as needed for the duration of the study. Judged capable of withholding salbutamol for at least 4 hours prior to FEV1 assessments. No use of an ICS or LABA for at least 12 weeks prior to first dose of study medication. A best prebronchodilator FEV1 &gt;=60 percent (%) of the predicted normal value at screening. FEV1 increase by &gt;=12% and &gt;=200 milliliter (mL) over baseline value within 1040 minutes of inhalation of 400 mcg salbutamol MDI (a spacer device may be used if required). Positive skin prick test to common aeroallergen(s) at screening (not historical). Sputum substudy only: Able to produce &gt;100 milligram (mg) of sputum at screening or during the runin period. Body weight &gt;=45 kilogram (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 1832 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2) (inclusive). Male subject: Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from the first dose of study medication until completion of the followup visit. 1. Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia. 2. Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options below: Contraceptive subdermal implant with a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label; Intrauterine device or intrauterine system with a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label; Oral contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone, injectable progestogen; Contraceptive vaginal ring; Percutaneous contraceptive patches. Female subject: is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: 1. Nonreproductive potential defined as premenopausal females with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion Hysterectomy Documented bilateral oophorectomy; Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol levels consistent with menopause [refer to laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels]). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. 2. Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed below in the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) modified list of highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in females of reproductive potential (FRP) requirements from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until completion of the followup visit. Contraceptive subdermal implant that meets the effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label; Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label; Oral contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone; Injectable progestogen; Contraceptive vaginal ring; Percutaneous contraceptive patches; Male partner sterilization with documentation of azoospermia prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject; Male condom combined with a vaginal spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository). This list does not apply to FRP with same sex partners, when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle or for subjects who are and will continue to be abstinent from penilevaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis. These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in the protocol which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and the protocol. The informed consent must be signed prior to any study related procedure, including change in asthma medication. History of lifethreatening asthma, defined as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnoea, respiratory arrest and/or hypoxic seizures.
