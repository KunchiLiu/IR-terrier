	<brief_summary>Anesthetics agents has variety inflammation during the cancer surgery. This perioperative inflammation can influence to cancer metastasis or recurrence. The purpose of this study is to prove the variation of immune cell activity between preoperative and postoperative period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of the Anesthetic Effect on the Activity of Immune Cell in Patient With Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients were allocated randomly to receive propofol or sevoflurane. Also, a total of 18ml of blood sample was obtained for total 3 times in consecutive order. 1. immediate before anesthesia induction 2. postoperative 1 hours 3. postoperative 24 hours Serum in blood will be obtained and activity of helper T cell, natural killer cell and level of serum cytokine will be evaluated by flow cytometry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</detailed_description>
