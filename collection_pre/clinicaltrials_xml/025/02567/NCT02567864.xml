	<brief_summary>The goals of this research project are: 1) to develop a senior-tailored Healthy Beat Accupunch (HBA) exercise program for community-dwelling older adults, 2) to test the effects of a six-month, instructor-led HBA exercise program, and 3) to evaluate the feasibility, compliance, and long-term effects of a six-month, DVD-guide HBA exercise program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development and Evaluation of the Healthy Beat Accupunch (HBA) Exercise Program for the Community Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A three-year, longitudinal, triangulation research method will be applied. First Year (Phase I): A preliminary HBA exercise program, including hard copy descriptions and DVD demonstrations of each exercise, will be mailed to the 16 experts in the Delphi advisory panel for their critique and evaluation. First Year (Phase II): A quasi-experimental, one-group, pretest-posttest design will be used to pilot-test the feasibility of the HBA exercise program on a group of 35 community-dwelling older adults in a community care station. Second Year: A cluster randomized controlled trial will be used to test the effects of a six-month, instructor-led HBA exercise program on the functional fitness (cardiovascular-respiratory function, body flexibility, muscle strength, and muscle endurance), perceived health status, and sleep quality of the community-dwelling older adults. Through the use of convenience sampling strategy, eight community care stations with approximately 240 older adults in Kaohsiung will be recruited and randomly assigned based on their community care stations to a HBA experimental group or a wait-list control group. Participants in the experimental group will receive the HBA exercise program led by trained and certified instructors, three times per week, 40 minutes per practice for six months; participants in the wait-list control group will continue with their regular daily activities. One pre-test and two post-tests, three months apart, will be conducted. Third Year: Using the same method as in the second year, participants from the second year will continue practicing the HBA exercise program, but guided by a DVD, for another six months. The feasibility, compliance, and effectiveness of the DVD-led HBA exercise program on the community-dwelling older adults will be tested, and another two post-tests, three months apart, will be conducted on the same outcome measurements as in the second year.</detailed_description>
