	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind, crossover trial that will recruit a cohort of non-treatment seeking Cannabis use disordered participants. Participants will then undergo either active, or sham rTMS to the LDLPFC, and cue-induced craving, and risky decision making will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Excitatory rTMS to the Left Dorsolateral Pre-Frontal Cortex to Reduce Cannabis-Cue Induced Craving</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our primary aims are to determine the effect of a single session of 10 Hz L DLPFC rTMS on cannabis cue induced craving (Aim1), and behavioral tasks of impulsive decision making (Aim2), in non-treatment seeking individuals with Cannabis Use Disorder. The aims of the study will be accomplished by performing a double-blind, sham-controlled crossover trial. Non-Treatment seeking individuals with CUD will be recruited through media advertisements, as well as via a pre-established database of non-treatment seeking individuals who have participated in previous Cannabis trials and agreed to be re-contacted. Interested individuals will undergo a brief phone screen to determine if they meet general inclusion/exclusion criteria, and if so will be invited to meet with study personnel in order to sign informed consent, and undergo a screening visit. There will then be two experimental visits separated by at least one week. During each of these visits participants will undergo either a real, or sham rTMS treatment, as well as a cannabis cue Paradigm. Data on craving as well as on impulsive decision making will be collected before and after each treatment.</detailed_description>
