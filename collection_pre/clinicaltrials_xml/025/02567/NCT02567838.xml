	<brief_title>Lidocaine Gel During Transrectal Sonography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TRS is the common procedure to diagnose or exclude gynecologic disease in virgin women. This procedure can be associated with significant pain, both on insertion of the ultrasound probe as well as on manipulating the probe. The investigators evaluated a new technique for pain relief during TRS. In all, 80 consecutive subjects undergoing TRS at obstetric and gynecologic department were randomized to receive either lidocaine gel(Instillagel) or placebo(Aquagel) rectally prior to probe insertion. The pain encountered before, during, and after the procedure was graded by the patient on a 10-point visual analogue score. The gel-associated side effect was also evaluated by phone survey after 2 day of procedure. The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the use of topical lidocaine gel in reducing pain associated with transrectal gynecologic ultrasonography.</detailed_description>
