	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of inflammation on central nervous system (CNS) glutamate, white matter pathology and alterations in behavior and cognition in middle-aged patients with major depression. Depression is associated with significant alterations in glutamate concentrations and white matter integrity, which has been associated with decreased antidepressant response, poor functional outcome, and cognitive impairment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study involves behavioral assessments, neurocognitive testing, blood sampling and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. Goals of this study are to determine the impact of inflammation on glutamate concentrations in the basal ganglia and on the integrity of white matter tracts in the basal ganglia and other subcortical regions of middle-aged depressed versus non-depressed individuals and to associated the impact of glutamate and white matter changes on behavioral symptoms among the same group of patients.</detailed_description>
