	<brief_title>Brain Irradiation and Tremelimumab in Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Simon 2-stage single-arm design (n=17) will be employed to evaluate for preliminary efficacy. A maximum of 17 subjects will be accrued to the efficacy arm. After the first 3 patients are enrolled in the efficacy arm, a 6 week enrollment hold will be conducted in order to ensure safety before additional patients are enrolled. An interim assessment will then occur after the first 9 subjects have enrolled, and the accrual to this arm will proceed only if a pre-specified futility threshold is met. Patients not requiring continuation of HER2 directed therapy, such as trastuzumab, will be enrolled in this arm.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of CNS metastases for whom SRS or WBRT is indicated, as determined by radiation oncologist assessment Age 18 and older at the time of consent Written informed consent and authorization obtained from the subject/HIPAAappointed legal representative prior to performing any protocolrelated procedures including screening evaluations ECOG performance of 02 with anticipated life expectancy of ≥12 weeks Histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast cancer NonCNS progression of disease as assessed by the investigator/treating physician, for which a change in systemic therapy is planned OR achievement of stable or responsive nonCNS disease for which a holiday from the current systemic therapy is planned, as assessed by the investigator/treating physician. Measurable nonCNS disease, defined by RECIST1.1 criteria Recovered from all toxicities associated with prior treatment, to acceptable baseline status or grade 1 or less (for lab toxicities see below limits for inclusion,), except for toxicities not considered a safety risk, such as alopecia or vitiligo. Peripheral neuropathy must be grade 2 or less Adequate organ and marrow function, as defined below: platelets ≥ 75x 103/μL; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/μL; hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL; total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal) except subject with documented Gilbert's syndrome (≤5 x ULN) or liver metastasis, who must have a baseline total bilirubin ≤3.0 mg/dL; AST and ALT ≤ 3 x ULN, unless associated with hepatobiliary metastases, in that case ≤5 x ULN serum creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dL (or glomerular filtration rate ≥ 50 ml/min as determined by the CockcroftGault equation); Negative hepatitis B serologic tests. If positive results are not indicative of active or chronic infection, the subjects can enter the study at the investigator's discretion Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner must use a highly effective method of contraception prior to the first dose of investigational product, and must agree to continue using such precautions for 6 months after the final dose of investigational product; cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. They must also refrain from egg cell donation for 6 months after the final dose of investigational product; Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause); A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. The acceptable methods of contraception Nonsterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception from Days 1 through 90 post last dose. In addition, they must refrain from sperm donation for 90 days after the final dose of investigational product LVEF ≥50% for patients enrolling in the HER2 directed therapy arm CNS complications for whom urgent neurosurgical intervention is indicated (e.g., resection, shunt placement) Known leptomeningeal metastases not amenable to radiotherapy. Patients receiving radiotherapy for leptomeningeal metastases are eligible Received any prior monoclonal antibody against CTLA4, programmed cell death 1 (PD1) or programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to compounds of similar biologic composition to tremelimumab or any constituent of the product Patients unable to obtain MRI for any reason (e.g., due to pacemaker, ferromagnetic implants, claustrophobia, extreme obesity) Concurrent enrollment in another therapeutic clinical study or receipt of an investigational product within the last 4 weeks (participation in the survival followup period of a study is not an exclusion criterion) Medical conditions (aside from newlydiagnosed brain metastases) for which the chronic use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications are indicated. Note: inhaled and topical steroids are permitted Subjects should not be vaccinated with live attenuated vaccines within one month prior to starting tremelimumab treatment Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or study results Any serious uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection that would impair the subject's ability to receive investigational product, such as conditions associated with frequent diarrhea History of chronic inflammatory or autoimmune disease (e.g., Addison's disease, multiple sclerosis, Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc) with symptomatic disease within the last 3 years prior to randomization. Note: Active vitiligo or alopecia or a history of vitiligo or alopecia will not be a basis for exclusion Active or history of inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., colitis, Crohn's), irritable bowel disease, celiac disease or other serious gastrointestinal chronic conditions associated with diarrhea. Active or history of systemic lupus erythematosus or Wegener's granulomatosis History of sarcoidosis syndrome Active recent (&lt;6 months) history of diverticulitis. Note that diverticulosis is permitted No active, second potentially lifethreatening cancer Pregnant or breast feeding at time of consent Any condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of information and consent and compliance with the requirements of this protocol Known positive for HIV, chronic or active hepatitis B or C Patient is unable to receive IV contrast Neuroimaging evidence of midline shift</criteria>
