	<brief_summary>This study is being done to learn about the interaction of alcohol consumption and HIV on brain function. The proposed study will have two broad objectives. The first is to incorporate functional neuroimaging (FMRI) approaches, along with additional Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) methods that will enable a delineation in both functional and cerebral metabolic disturbances affecting specific functional brain systems that are associated with the interaction of ethanol (ETOH) consumption on Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-associated brain dysfunction. Recent data indicate that HIV infected patients with heavy ETOH consumption have FMRI abnormalities and exhibit alterations on other neuroimaging measures compared to moderate drinkers and people who do not drink at all. The second objective is to examine the extent to which reductions in ETOH consumption among heavy drinkers with HIV infection result from a motivational intervention. The findings from this study will provide important information on how heavy ETOH and HIV interact to affect the brain functional responsiveness, and the extent of improvement that might be gained by reducing heavy ETOH use.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this research study, participants will be randomized (much like flipping a coin) by a computer program to either no counseling or FMRI during the baseline visit in the second session for this visit. Each time point (baseline, 3 months and 9 months) consists of 2 participant sessions. Session 1) at baseline is for the purposes of recruiting and determining if participants meet study criteria; during all visits, study criteria are reviewed to ensure that enrolled participants are still eligible. After determining eligibility, study information is explained by the research assistant and consent is then obtained. Additional psychiatric and substance use assessment and neurological and will be performed. Blood and urine specimens will be obtained and sent to lab for measurement of immunological, virologic, and hepatic status and other biomarkers. The remainder of the blood specimens will be frozen and banked for future analyses. All blood specimens banks for future analyses will be deidentified. A neurocognitive assessment performed by a research assistant. The duration will be approximately 120 minutes. Session 2) will occur within one week of visit one. It will consist of an MRI scan lasting approximately 50 minutes. Functional imaging will be conducted during this MRI time. All participants will undergo all procedures at baseline, and three and nine months.</detailed_description>
