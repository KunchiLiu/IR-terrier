	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing intracranial procedures may experience severe hypertension and tachycardia due to intracranial hypertension and to increased release of adrenaline. Preventing perioperative sympathetic activity is of great importance. A common technique is using b-blockers like esmolol, which effectively block perioperative hemodynamic changes during intracranial surgery. A2 agonists, like Dexmedetomidine-Dex are now being used as a component of a balanced anesthesia during neurosurgical procedures. This study aimed to evaluate whether esmolol or dex attenuates perioperative changes in patients undergoing elective craniotomy with fast track neuroanesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Esmolol Versus Dexmedetomidine During Intracranial Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients scheduled for elective craniotomy are randomized to receive Dex 1γ/Kg over 10 minutes following by continuous infusion of Dex 0.7γ/Kg (group D) or esmolol 500mcg/Kg over 5 min following by continuous infusion of 300mcg/Kg/min (group E). Patients in both groups are subjected to a standardized anesthesia comprising of induction with propofol, fentanyl, rocuronium, and maintained with Oxygen-air: 1/1, sevoflurane and bolus fentanyl in order to access the same level of anesthesia (BIS 40-50). The hemodynamic variables at various stages of surgery (HR-heart rate, MAP-Mean arterial pressure) and recovery characteristics are also recorded. It is also performed monitoring of cerebral oximetry (INVOS).</detailed_description>
