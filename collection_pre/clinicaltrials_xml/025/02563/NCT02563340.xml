	<brief_summary>This study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) on chronic antibody-mediated rejection (cAMR) after kidney transplantation. Chronic AMR is diagnosed according to Banff criteria 2013 based on renal graft biopsy and donor specific antibodies (DSA) examination. cAMR patients are assigned to MSCs group or control group. Patients in control group are prescribed to current desensitization therapy including at least one of the following treatments: plasmapheresis (PP), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), rituximab or Bortezomib, depending on individual pathological and immunological features (eg. DSA type and titer) of each study subjects. Patients in MSCs group receive additional BM-MSCs therapy besides desensitization treatments as in control group. Allogeneic BM-MSCs (1*10^6/kg) are intravenously administered every two weeks for four consecutive doses. All cAMR patients are followed up for one year. Renal function, DSA level, pathological features, patient/graft survival, and severe adverse events are monitored during the follow-up period. Immunological features of patients in both groups are consecutively examined.</brief_summary>
