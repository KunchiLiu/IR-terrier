	<detailed_description>Carbon dioxide insufflation during colonoscopy significantly reduces discomfort (pain, bloating and flatulence) during up to 24 hours after the procedure. So far, it has not been studied in inflammatory bowel disease patients who represent specific patient population indicated for colonoscopy.
