	<brief_summary>This study is designed to investigate whether allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) can promote function recovery in patients with poor early graft function after kidney transplantation from Chinese Donation after Citizen Death (DCD). DCD kidney transplant recipients with poor early graft function (with or without dialysis) post transplant are equally randomized into MSCs group or control group. Patients in MSCs group are administered MSCs treatment. Allogeneic BM-MSCs (1*10^6/kg) from third party are given intravenously for four consecutive doses every week after enrollment. Patients in control group receive placebo. Renal allograft function (eGFR), rejection, patient/graft survival and severe adverse events up to 12 months post enrollment are monitored.</brief_summary>
