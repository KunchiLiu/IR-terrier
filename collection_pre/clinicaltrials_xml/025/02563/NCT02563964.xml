	<brief_summary>Myocardial infarction (MI) frequently recurs after non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) that may be related to insufficient vulnerable plaque identification using invasive coronary angiography. Furthermore, the natural behaviour of vulnerable plaques in NSTEMI over time and their relation with biomarkers need further exploration. More accurate identification and assessing long-term behaviour of vulnerable plaques may improve therapeutic strategies and clinical outcome. The investigators hypothesize that fully integrated 18Fluoride Sodium-Fluoride (18F-NaF) Positron Emission Tomography/Cardiac Magnetic Resonance imaging (PET/CMR) increases the ability to detect vulnerable plaques as compared to coronary angiography. This prospective study in 33 consecutive patients with NSTEMI aims to: 1. Compare coronary vulnerable plaque detection between 18F-NaF PET/CMR and invasive coronary angiography, 2. Investigate the correlation of coronary vulnerable plaques using 18F-NaF PET with myocardial infarction using CMR, both at baseline and during follow-up, 3. Examine systemic arterial 18F-NaF-uptake using PET/CMR and their relation with systemic events (cerebrovascular accidents, transient ischemic attacks, or peripheral arterial disease), and 4. Examine the relation between vulnerable plaques and plasma biomarkers.</brief_summary>
