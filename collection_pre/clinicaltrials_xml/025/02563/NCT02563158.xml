	<brief_title>Study of Liver Resection With Versus Without Hepatic Inflow Occlusion for the HBV-related HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) imposes a huge burden of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Asia. Liver resection remains the mainstay of treatment for HCC. Hepatic inflow occlusion, known as the Pringle maneuver, is most commonly used to reduce blood loss during liver parenchymal transection. A major issue about this maneuver is the ischemia-reperfusion injury to the remnant liver. And the hemodynamic disturbance to the tumor-bearing liver remains an oncologic concern. Given the technical advances in living donor liver transplantation, vascular occlusion can be avoided in liver resection by experienced hands. This study aims to compare the perioperative and long-term outcomes of liver resection for HBV-related HCC without versus with hepatic inflow occlusion. This study will include eligible patients with HBV-related HCC elected for liver resection. 57 patients will be enrolled in each randomized arm to detect a 20% difference in the serum level of total bilirubin on postoperative day 5 (80% power and Î± = 0.05). The secondary endpoints include procedural parameters, perioperative liver function and inflammatory response, postoperative morbidity and mortality, and long-term outcomes. Patients will be followed for up to five years. Data will be statistically analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. This prospective randomized controlled trial is designed to evaluate the feasibility of liver resections for HBV-related HCC without vascular occlusion. Clinical implication of its outcomes may change the present surgical practice and fill the oncologic gaps therein.</detailed_description>
