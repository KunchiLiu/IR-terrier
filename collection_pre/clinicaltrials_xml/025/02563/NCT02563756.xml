	<brief_summary>Patients with medial gonarthritis are randomised to a unicompartmental or a total knee replacement. Primary outcome: Thigh muscle cross sectional area and radiological attenuation measured by CT Secondary aims: functional tests, gait analysis, health related quality of life and patient related outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Unicondylar- or Total Knee Replacement? Patient Satisfaction, Function and Muscle Mass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: The investigators aim with the present study was to compare patient related outcome measurements, knee function and muscle mass in patients operated with an UKR or a TKR for medial gonarthritis. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that a greater number of patients might benefit from a less invasive surgery in terms of increased quality of life, function and muscle mass. Primary Outcome: Thigh muscle cross sectional area and radiological attenuation measured by CT. Secondary outcomes: Functional tests (timed up and go, 30s sit and stand, forward reach, forward step down, 6 min walk and 40 m walk test), knee strength (Biodex isokinetic dynamometer) and patient reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS). A number of PROMs: Health related quality of life (EQ-5D), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) as well as 3D movement and gait analysis. Inclusion criteria: Unilateral medial osteoarthritis of the knee (Kellgren 3b-4), aged 50 or above. Exclusion criteria: Insufficient anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Fixed varus deformity &gt;10°, fixed flexion deformity &gt;10°, flexion &lt;100°. Previous high tibial osteotomy on the same side. Any neurological disease affecting strength or locomotion in any leg. Body mass index (BMI) &gt;35. Rheumatoid disease. Symptomatic osteoarthritis of the contra lateral knee or any hip. Insufficient written or spoken Swedish.</detailed_description>
