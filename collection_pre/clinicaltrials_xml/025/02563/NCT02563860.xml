	<detailed_description>Excess neuronal cholesterol plays a role in the pathophysiology of Rett syndrome(RTT) and the investigators hypothesise that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the CNS will reduce neuronal cholesterol and lead to improvement in Rett syndrome related symptoms. Goal: To determine the optimal dosing regiment of Lovastatin for patients with RTT and to identify the most appropriate primary outcome measure for the subsequent Phase 3 study. Phase 2, dose escalation study. Primary outcome: Gait speed Secondary outcomes: respiratory function, cognition, EEG (encephalopathy), Rett syndrome severity scale, neurodevelopmental assessment (QOL) 20 ambulatory female patients with genetically confirmed.</detailed_description>
