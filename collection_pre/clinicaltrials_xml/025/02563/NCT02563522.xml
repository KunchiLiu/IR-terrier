	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of VM202 in the Treatment of Chronic Non-Healing Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 7-month study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of intramuscular (IM) injections in the calf of VM202 in patients with chronic nonhealing foot ulcers. Three hundred patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio of VM202 or placebo injections: - Active -VM202 + standard of care - 200 patients - Control - Placebo (VM202 Vehicle) + standard of care - 100 patients</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Documented symptomatic PAD, with one or more of the following criteria satisfied: ABI &gt; 0.40 and ≤ 0.90 (i.e., mild to severe PAD without critical limb ischemia) in target limb TBI ≤ 0.7 in the target limb Toe pressure of &lt; 55 mm Hg in the target limb A history of intermittent claudication with previous related intervention in a leg Documented history of Type I or II diabetes with current treatment control (HbA1c of ≤ 12.0% at Screening) and currently on oral medication and / or insulin No significant changes anticipated in diabetes medication regimen At Screening, subject has one ulcer on the target foot that fulfills all of the following criteria: Present for ≥ 2 weeks and ≤1 year Full thickness and not involving bone, tendon, or capsule (probing to tendon or capsule) No sign of infection or osteomyelitis Ulcer must be 0.5 cm2 6.5 cm2 as measured at Screening Visit prior to debridement Subjects will undergo protocoldefined standardized wound care during screening (for two weeks or longer). Subjects will be considered screen failures and will not receive study injections on Day 0 (baseline) if the target ulcer does not meet all entry criteria (see above) as well as being confirmed as nonhealing. Be capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and signing the informed consent document prior to being subjected to any study related procedures If female of childbearing potential, negative urine pregnancy test at screening and using acceptable method of birth control during the study. Will require revascularization in the target leg within 3 months of randomization; Unhealed prior amputation; In the investigator's assessment, will require an amputation in the target leg within 3 months of randomization; Subject diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (CLI; Rutherford score ≥ 4); Subjects with target foot ulcer with an etiology of vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, necrobiosis lipoidica, hydrostatic pressure/venous insufficiency, any neoplasms (basalioma, Kaposi's sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, etc.), or due to a burn; More than one (1) ulcer on target foot; The study ulcer increased by 50% or more at baseline from screening, and, in the opinion of the investigator, the increase is due to patient noncompliance with wound care instructions or due to other mitigating factors that may interfere with interpretation of study results; Evidence of active infection (e.g., cellulitis, osteomyelitis) or deep ulceration exposing bone or tendon in the foot planned for treatment; Any gangrene; Current fracture in the target foot; Target ulcer located on Charcot foot; Heart Failure with a New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of III or IV; Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 35 kg/m2 at Screening; Stroke or myocardial infarction within last 3 months; Unstable angina; Uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; 200 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) &gt; 110 mmHg at baseline/screening evaluation; Ophthalmologic conditions pertinent to proliferative retinopathy or conditions that preclude standard ophthalmologic examination; Inflammatory disorder of the blood vessels (inflammatory angiopathy, such as Buerger's disease); Subjects with advanced liver disease including decompensated cirrhosis, jaundice, ascites or bleeding varices; Subjects currently receiving immunosuppressive medications chemotherapy, or radiation therapy; Positive HIV or AntiHuman TCell Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV) at Screening; Active Hepatitis B or C infection as determined by Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), Hepatitis B core antibody (IgG and [immunoglobulin M] IgM; HBcAb), Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis C antibodies (AntiHCV), at Screening; Specific laboratory values at screening including: Hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) &lt; 3,000 cells per microliter, platelet count &lt;75,000/mm3, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal or any other clinically significant lab abnormality which in the opinion of the investigator should be exclusionary; Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 Patients with a recent history (&lt; 5 years) of or new screening finding of malignant neoplasm except basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (if excised and no evidence of recurrence for at least 1 year); patients with family history of colon cancer in any first degree relative are excluded unless they have undergone a colonoscopy in the last 12 months with negative findings; Subjects with any comorbid conditions likely to interfere with assessment of safety or efficacy or with an estimated life expectancy of less than 1 year; Subjects requiring &gt; 81 mg daily of acetylsalicylic acid. If &gt; 81 mg are taken at screening, subjects may be enrolled if willing/able to switch to another medication for the duration of the study; Subjects requiring regular (daily) COX2 inhibitor drug(s) or high dose steroids (except inhaled steroids or ocular steroids); subjects may be enrolled if willing/able to undergo medication washout prior to the first dosing and to refrain from taking these drugs during the study; Major psychiatric disorder in past 6 months; History of drug or alcohol abuse / dependence in the past 2 years; Use of an investigational drug in the past 3 months; use of an investigational biologic in the past 12 months; concurrent participation in investigational protocol or unapproved therapeutics; and Unable or unwilling to give informed consent.</criteria>
