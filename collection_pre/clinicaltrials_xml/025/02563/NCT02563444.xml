	<brief_summary>The investigators want to evaluate the accuracy of an ultrasound fusion guiding system in the positioning of a needle (here the accuracy is evaluated with a 22G spinal needle), by comparing the path indicated by the ultrasound fusion (virtual line) and the path actually obtained on the control CT scan (real line). Compared with ultrasound guidance alone or CT scan alone, the results are expected to be more accurate, saving time and irradiation (not evaluated here).</brief_summary>
