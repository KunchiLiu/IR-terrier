	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to perform an evaluation of the structural changes in the abdominal wall after harvesting a DIEP flap in breast reconstruction. 15 women undergoing secondary, unilateral breast reconstruction were recruited to the study and underwent a 2 year postoperative CT scan of the abdomen (without contrast). Structural changes were assessed by comparing the abdominal CT scans performed prior to surgery with the 2 year postoperative CT scans.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study was to perform an evaluation of the structural changes in the abdominal wall after harvesting a DIEP flap in breast reconstruction. 15 women undergoing secondary, unilateral breast reconstruction were recruited to the study and underwent a 2 year postoperative CT scan of the abdomen (without contrast). Structural changes were assessed by comparing the abdominal CT scans performed prior to surgery with the 2 year postoperative CT scans. The following structural changes were evaluated at four specific levels of the abdomen by two radiologists (among the authors): 1) rectus diastasis, 2) thickness and width of the rectus muscles, 3) thickness of the adipose tissue, 4) hernias (in the zone between the xiphoid process and the symphysis). The measurement levels chosen were: 1) 7 cm below the xiphoid process, 2) umbilicus level, 3) "central zone" (between level 2 and 4), 4) 5 cm above the symphysis Statistical analysis were performed to see if the structural measurements were significantly different comparing preoperative CT versus 2 year postoperative CT.</detailed_description>
