	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Sub-retinal Transplantation of Retinal Pigmented Epithelial Cells in Patients With Dry AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a Phase 2, double-masked, randomized, parallel group, sham surgery/placebo control, multi-center trial. Subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either the treatment or control group respectively. Subjects randomized to the treatment group will receive transplantation with 200,000 MA09-hRPE (human embryonic stem cell derived retinal pigmented epithelial)cells in one eye. Subjects randomized to the control group will have a sham surgery without transplantation of MA09-hRPE cells. The study eye must meet all eligibility criteria. If both eyes meet all eligibility criteria, then the study eye will be the eye with the worst Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) score at screening. If both eyes have identical BCVA scores, then the study eye will be chosen by the Investigator and the subject. There will be 3 cohorts, each with a different regimen of low-dose IMT [tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)]. Subjects will be randomized to treatment or control within cohorts, defined by severity of BCVA in the study eye at Screening. Enrollment in Cohort 1 and 2 will be concurrent. Enrollment into Cohort 3 will begin once Cohort 2 is fully enrolled.</detailed_description>
