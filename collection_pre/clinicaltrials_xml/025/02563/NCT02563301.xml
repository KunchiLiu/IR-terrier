	<brief_summary>Tracheal intubation is more difficult in patients in whom cervical spine immobilisation is maintained during tracheal intubation. The McGrath Series 5 videolaryngoscope offers a potential solution. The relatively short radius of the blade curvature combined with the internal arrangement of optimal components means that the glottis can be seen without the need for alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and tracheal axes. The investigators propose that the McGrath Series 5 videolaryngoscope will improve the view of the larynx in patients with limited neck movements, making intubation quicker, easier and possibly safer.</brief_summary>
