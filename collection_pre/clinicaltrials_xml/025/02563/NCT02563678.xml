	<brief_summary>In this small pilot study, participants (patients and healthy volunteers) will have blood drawn before and after the study intervention (hyperbaric chamber session or normal pressure oxygen breathing. This blood will be analyzed for neutrophil oxidative burst and cytokine analysis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators are interested in studying the influence of hyperbaric oxygen on neutrophils (a kind of white blood cell) and cytokines (cell proteins). Hyperbaric oxygen can enhance the way the immune system works, but the investigators don't fully know how that happens. the investigators are doing this study to learn more about this question.</detailed_description>
