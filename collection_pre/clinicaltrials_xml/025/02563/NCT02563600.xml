	<brief_summary>Patients on the waiting list for physiotherapy treatment for pelvic floor dysfunction will be randomly divided into three groups: - a group that gets a telephone call before their invitation letter is sent. - a group that gets a telephone call after their invitation letter is sent. - a group that does not receive a telephone call. The phone call is a brief 5-10 minute call, which will be semi-structured. It will remind the patient of their appointment time, it will outline what the treatment involves and highlight the potential benefits and drawbacks, and allow the patient to ask questions about the treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Brief-tele Support on Attendance at Physiotherapy Sessions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims: The research aims to assess the impact of a brief telephone call to patients with pelvic floor problems who are on a waiting list for physiotherapy treatment. Non-attendance at sessions currently runs at about 50%, and steps to reduce this would be beneficial to patient health and NHS efficiency. Participants and Recruitment: Consecutive patients who have been referred for physiotherapy treatment for pelvic floor dysfunction will be asked if they would like to participate in the study. The initial approach will be made through a letter, which will give information about the study, and will make clear that their treatment will not depend on their participation in the study. Patients on the waiting list for physiotherapy treatment for pelvic floor dysfunction will be randomly divided into three groups: - a group that gets a telephone call before their invitation letter is sent - a group that gets a telephone call after their invitation letter is sent - a group that does not receive a telephone call. The phone call is a brief 5-10 minute call, which will be semi-structured. It will remind the patient of their appointment time, it will outline what the treatment involves and highlight the potential benefits and drawbacks, and allow the patient to ask questions about the treatment.</detailed_description>
