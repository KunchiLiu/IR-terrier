	<brief_summary>In this study, participants with MSI-H or dMMR advanced colorectal carcinoma will be randomly assigned to receive either pembrolizumab or the Investigator's choice of 1 of 6 standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of advanced colorectal carcinoma. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab will prolong progression-free survival (PFS) compared to current SOC chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
