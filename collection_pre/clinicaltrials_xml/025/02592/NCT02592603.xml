	<brief_summary>Serrated Polyposis Syndrome (SPS) is a high-risk condition for colorectal cancer (CRC). SPS patients have a cumulative CRC risk of 1.9% in 5 years despite a strict endoscopic surveillance in specialized centers. Proximal serrated lesions are endoscopically challenging to detect due to their unremarkable morphology. Endocuff is a novel device comprised of a cap with a row of finger-like projections with a unique dynamic shape that help to flatten mucosal folds during withdrawal of the instrument in order to improve detection of lesions. Recent studies have reported an increase of detection rate and mean per patient of adenomas with Endocuff-assisted Colonoscopy compared with Standard Colonoscopy. The purpose of this study is to assess the usefulness of Endocuff-assisted Colonoscopy to detect serrated lesions in SPS patients undergoing surveillance compared to Standard Colonoscopy in a randomized fashion</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endocuff for Surveillance of Serrated Polyposis Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to own data and similarly to previous published studies, patients diagnosed of Serrated Polyposis Syndrome undergoing annual surveillance after clearance of all serrated lesions â‰¥ 5mm, have a mean of 5 serrated lesions per patient at follow-up colonoscopies. The study was powered to establish a 25% significant increase in the mean of serrated lesions per patient in the Endocuff-assisted colonoscopy group. Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05, a beta risk of 0.2 and a loss rate of 10% in a bilateral contrast, a sample size of 124 patients (62 in each arm) are required to achieve statistic significance.</detailed_description>
