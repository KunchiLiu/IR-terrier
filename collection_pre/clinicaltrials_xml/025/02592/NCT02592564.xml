	<brief_title>Brain Plasticity and Cellular Aging After Internet-delivered CBT for Social Anxiety Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy for social anxiety disorder has previously demonstrated to target and affect the brain´s fear network, typically neural response in the amygdala ameliorate after effective psychological treatment. Commonly, neuroimaging studies have performed brain imaging at pre- and post-intervention, yet, longitudinal study designs including several repeated measures of neural response over the course of treatment are currently missing in anxiety disorder. In the current study the participants will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at four occasion. a) Twice before treatment initiation (9 weeks apart), b) at week 4 (during treatment), c) and directly after treatment termination. Biological aging can be quantified at the individual cell level by measuring telomere length in peripheral immune cells (leukocytes). Telomeres are located at the end of each chromosome and protect the genetic material during cell division. Telomerase is an enzyme that can lengthen telomeres, and have in this way a protective function against accelerated cellular aging. Variations in these bodily processes have been associated with psychiatric manifestations such as anxiety and depression. In the current study the participant´s telomere length and telomerase activity will be assessed at three occasion. a) Twice before treatment initiation (9 weeks apart), and b) directly after treatment termination.</detailed_description>
