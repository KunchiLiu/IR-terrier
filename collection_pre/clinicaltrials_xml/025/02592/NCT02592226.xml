	<brief_summary>The ventilation of the patient under general anesthesia is an old problem and extensively studied, especially in visceral surgery, higher risk of postoperative complications. Studies have recently shown the impact of a lung-protective ventilation in visceral surgery, however obese patients are often excluded, and alveolar recruitment maneuver has never been studied independently. The investigators are conducting a randomized controlled prospective study to investigate the clinical value to achieve alveolar recruitment maneuver routinely in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The objective is to show the reduction in dyspnea, oxygen dependency: reflection of atelectasis and the incidence of postoperative complications.</brief_summary>
