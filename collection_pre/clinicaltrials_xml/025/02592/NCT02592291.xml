	<brief_title>Mobile Health Self-Management and Support System for Chronic and Complex Health Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals with chronic and complex conditions such as those with spinal cord injury (SCI),Cerebral Palsy (CP), Spina Bifida (SB), and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), often require complex self-management routines to manage various needs such as bowel and bladder, skin integrity, and general health and wellness. Tasks such as self-catheterization, bowel regimens, skin checks, and routine administration of medications require consistent follow-through to prevent complications. Early detection and treatment of problems such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) or wounds, can prevent serious complications like osteomyelitis and sepsis which can result in hospitalization, death, and expensive medical care. The investigators have developed an innovative mobile health (mHealth) system aimed at improving self-management skills and preventing and detecting early signs of secondary medical complications. The system consist of a mobile health applications (apps), a clinician portal and a two-way secure communication system between the two. People with complex care regimens can use the apps to get reminders or cues to carry out their self care routines such as bowel/bladder routines, take medications, report success with their activities or new problems (e.g. new wound, UTI symptoms etc.), and track symptoms of depression. A clinician can use the portal to view the report and communicate with the users through a secure communication system that is embedded in the apps. This study will assess the benefits of using the system in improving users' wellness and self-management skills compared to those who receive standard of care only.</detailed_description>
