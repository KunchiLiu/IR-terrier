	<brief_summary>There is an interest to assess nutritional status of vitamins in humans in a non-invasive way, i.e. by avoiding taking blood samples. Saliva could potentially be an alternative to blood for this purpose. The suitability of saliva for status determination will be investigated by analysis of (forms of) vitamins A and E, B1, B2, B3, B6 and C in both saliva and blood.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Occurrence of Selected Vitamins in Saliva and Blood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is an interest to assess nutritional status of vitamins in humans in a non-invasive way, i.e. by avoiding taking blood samples. Saliva could potentially be an alternative to blood for this purpose. However, literature data on vitamins in saliva is scarce. The occurrence is best demonstrated for 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 where already indications for a correlation to blood levels have been observed in a small scale supplementation study. Occurrence of (forms of) vitamins A and E, B1, B2, B3, B6 and C has been reported but is less well documented. Some information is somewhat ambiguous and for none of these latter vitamins blood levels have been investigated in parallel to saliva.</detailed_description>
