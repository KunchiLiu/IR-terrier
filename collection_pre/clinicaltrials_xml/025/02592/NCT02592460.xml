	<brief_summary>Animal studies have shown that the level of pain sensitivity is highly dependent on the amount of polyamines in food. This fundamental observation of a nutritional approach to pain led the authors to develop diets completely depleted in polyamines whose anti-nociceptive properties have been confirmed in animals. Postoperative pain after foot surgery are currently fairly well controlled but at the cost of a high consumption of grade II analgesics which is associated with a high rate of side effects (nausea, vomiting ...). The investigators' hypothesis is that a diet low in polyamines may have an additive effect on pain control and reduce the consumption of level 2 analgesics. The objective of this study is to show the efficacy of a polyamines-poor diet on postoperative pain in ambulatory surgery of the foot.</brief_summary>
