	<brief_summary>Four months of interval walking (IW) training results in substantial weight loss in opposition to energy-expenditure matched continuous walking (CW) training. The reason for this is unclear. This study will assess if IW leads to greater exercise-induced suppression of appetite and ad libitum food intake compared to CW and no exercise. Subjects with type 2 diabetes will be included in a crossover, counter-balanced, controlled study, where each subject will undergo three trials. Trials will be identical except the following interventions: 1. One hour of rest (CON) 2. One hour of interval walking (repeated cycles of 3 min of fast and 3 min of slow walking; IW) 3. One hour of continuous walking (CW) matched to IW with regards to energy-expenditure. After the interventions subjects will undergo a liquid mixed meal tolerance test (450 kCal), with regular measurements of appetite-related hormones (insulin, ghrelin, Leptin, Cholecystokinin, PYY). Three hours into the mixed meal tolerance test, a standardised ad-libitum meal test will be served and intake will recorded. Free-living energy intake via food records will be assessed during the following 32 hours.</brief_summary>
