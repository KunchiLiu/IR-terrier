	<detailed_description>The study objective is to document the clinical and device performance outcomes of the Evolut R system used in routine hospital practice in a large patient cohort for the treatment of symptomatic native aortic valve stenosis or a stenosed, insufficient, or combined surgical bioprosthetic valve failure necessitating valve replacement. Prospective, single arm, multi-center, observational, post market study. In Australia and Canada it is a prospective, single arm, multi-center pre-market study. Up to 60 centers worldwide. Geographies may include Europe, Australia, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Canada. Approximately 1000 implanted subjects, consented for follow-up through three years. For each subject, data will be collected preoperatively, intra-operatively, at hospital discharge, 30 days, 1, 2 and 3 years.</detailed_description>
