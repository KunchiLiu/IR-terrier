	<brief_title>Manipulating Tobacco Constituents in Male Menthol Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FDA has the regulatory authority to reduce, but not eliminate, nicotine from cigarettes. The Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee has noted, among other things, that removal of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit the public health. A parent study (NCT02048852) examines the potential impact of these two regulatory actions alone and in combination in female menthol smokers. This supplemental study will recruit an additional group of male menthol smokers, which will examine whether there are gender differences in manipulating flavors and nicotine concentrations in cigarettes on smoking behavior. The approach to add the opposite sex allows findings of sex/gender to be incorporated in the design and development of new technologies (i.e., modified cigarettes). Emerging research shows that women may be more responsive to the non-nicotine sensory aspects of smoking such as menthol flavor, whereas men may smoke primarily for nicotine intake. Consequently, this study expects to observe gender differences in response to manipulating flavors and nicotine content in cigarettes.</detailed_description>
