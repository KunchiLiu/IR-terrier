	<brief_summary>Breast cancer is the most common cancer type among women. Treatment in many cases involves axillary lymphadenectomy followed by radiation therapy. This increases the risk of lymphedema development which occurs in up to 30% of such cases. The present treatment paradigm is conservative with compression garments. There is a need for more effective treatment options and regenerative medicine offers hope for a change to a more curative approach. This Phase 2 trial will examine the efficacy and safety of treatment with freshly isolated adipose-derived stromal cells administered as a cell-assisted lipotransfer to the affected axillary region.</brief_summary>
