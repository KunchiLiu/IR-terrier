	<brief_title>Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis and Extraesophageal Reflux</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a chronic viral disease, which affects children and adults as well. It is characterised by grow of squamous cell tumours on mucosa of aerodigestive tract, with predilection for the larynx. The disease is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). However, in contrast to the low incidence of RRP, HPV prevalence is common. It is indicated that other factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of RRP. One such factor might be extraesophageal reflux (EER). We investigated whether patients with RRP suffer more often from EER.</detailed_description>
