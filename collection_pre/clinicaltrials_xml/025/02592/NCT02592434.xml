	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Of Tofacitinib In Pediatric JIA Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized withdrawal, double blind, placebo controlled study of pediatric subjects (2 to &lt;18 years of age) with JIA. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of tofacitinib versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of JIA at Week 26 of the double blind phase as measured by the percentage of subjects with disease flare (according to PRCSG/PRINTO Disease Flare criteria) after Week 18 of the open label run in phase.All eligible subjects enrolled in the study will initially receive open label tofacitinib for 18 weeks (run in phase). At the end of the 18 week run in phase, only subjects who achieve at least a JIA ACR 30 response will be randomized to the 26 week double blind, placebo controlled phase. Subjects who do not achieve a JIA ACR 30 response at this time point will be discontinued from the study. In addition, subjects who experience a single episode of disease flare at any time during the study (including the open label run in and double blind phase) will also be discontinued from the study. All subjects participating in this study, including those discontinued from the study, will have the option, if eligible (based on inclusion and exclusion criteria), of enrolling in the tofacitinib JIA long term extension study (A3921145). Subjects who are eligible for the 26 week double blind phase will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to either active tofacitinib or placebo. For subjects with polyarticular course JIA (ie, extended oligoarthritis, polyarthritis RF+, polyarthritis RF , systemic JIA with active arthritis but without active systemic features), randomization will be stratified by JIA category and baseline CRP (normal, above normal). For subjects with psoriatic and enthesitis related arthritis, randomization will be stratified by JIA category. Approximately 210 subjects will be enrolled in the open label run in phase. Among subjects with polyarticular course JIA, stratification will target at least 50% with a baseline CRP above the upper limit of normal. The first cohort (ie, polyarticular course JIA) will have at least 170 subjects enrolled in the run in phase with the minimum number of JIA categories as follows: 24 with extended oligoarthritis, 20 with polyarthritis RF+, 62 with polyarthritis RF-, 20 with systemic JIA with active arthritis but without active systemic features. Additional cohorts (ie, psoriatic and enthesitis related arthritis) will include a minimum of 20 subjects with psoriatic arthritis, and 20 subjects with enthesitis related arthritis. The overall target minimum number of subjects to be enrolled in the study by age is as follows: 20 subjects 2 to &lt;6 years, 20 subjects 6 to &lt;12 years, and 20 subjects 12 to &lt;18 years. The duration of subject participation among those who complete the study (without discontinuation) is expected to be approximately 44 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female aged 2 to &lt;18 years. 2. Must meet International League Against Rheumatism (ILAR) JIA diagnostic criteria for one of the following categories with active disease for at least 6 weeks: Extended oligoarthritis; Polyarthritis (RF+); Polyarthritis (RF); Systemic JIA with active arthritis but without active systemic features in the prior 6 months and at the time of enrollment; Psoriatic arthritis; Enthesitis related arthritis. Subjects with polyarticular course JIA (ie, extended oligoarthritis, polyarthritis RF+, polyarthritis RF , systemic JIA with active arthritis but without active systemic features) must have a minimum of 5 active joints (an active joint is defined as a joint with swelling or, in the absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by either pain on motion or tenderness) at screening and baseline to be eligible for study entry. Subjects with psoriatic or enthesitis related arthritis must have a minimum of 3 active joints (an active joint is defined as a joint with swelling or, in the absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by either pain on motion or tenderness) at screening and baseline to be eligible for study entry. Treatment with stable doses of a Non Steroidal Anti inflammatory Drug (NSAID) and/or a stable dose of an oral glucocorticoid, and/or a stable dose of methotrexate is permitted. For subjects receiving an oral glucocorticoid: Glucocorticoids may be administered at a maximum dose of 0.2 mg of prednisone equivalent per kilogram per day or 10 mg per day for ≥ 2 weeks before baseline, whichever is lower. For subjects receiving methotrexate (MTX) treatment: MTX may be administered either orally or parenterally at doses not to exceed 25 mg/wk or 20 mg/m2/week (whichever is lower); participants must have taken MTX for 3 months and be at a stable dose for at least 6 weeks before baseline. Subjects taking MTX must be taking folic acid or folinic acid in accordance with local standards. For subjects with psoriatic arthritis, the following topical treatments for psoriasis are allowed: non medicated emollients for use over the whole body; topical steroids including hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone acetate ≤1% for the palms, soles, face, and intertriginous areas only; tar, salicylic acid preparations, and shampoos free of corticosteroids are permitted only for the scalp 3. Inadequate response or intolerance to at least one Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drug (DMARD), which may include MTX or biologic agents; in the case of ERA and psoriatic arthritis, inadequate response to Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). 4. No evidence or history of untreated or inadequately treated active or latent tuberculosis (TB) infection as evidenced by the following: 1. A negative QuantiFERON ®TB Gold In Tube test performed within the 3 months prior to screening. A negative purified protein derivative (PPD) test can be substituted for the QuantiFERON® TB Gold In Tube test only if the central laboratory is unable to perform the test or cannot determine the results to be positive or negative and the Pfizer medical monitor is informed and agrees on a case by case basis. 2. Chest radiograph without changes suggestive of active tuberculosis (TB) infection within 3 months prior to screening is recommended and should be performed according to local standards of care or countryspecific guidelines. 3. No history of either untreated or inadequately treated latent or active TB infection. If a subject has previously received an adequate course of therapy for either latent (9 months of isoniazid in a locale where rates of primary multi drug resistant TB infection are &lt;5% or an acceptable alternative regimen) or active (acceptable multi drug regimen) TB infection, neither a PPD test nor a QuantiFERONGold®TM test need be obtained. A chest radiograph should be obtained if not done within the 3 months prior to screening. To be considered eligible for the study, the chest radiograph must be negative for active tuberculosis infection. A subject who is currently being treated for latent TB infection can only be enrolled with confirmation of current incidence rates of multidrug resistant TB infection, documentation of an adequate treatment regimen, and prior approval of the Sponsor. 5. Fertile males and females who are, in the opinion of the investigator, sexually active and at risk for pregnancy with their partner(s) must be willing and able to use a highly effective method of contraception as outlined in this protocol during the study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study medication. 6 Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. 7.
