	<brief_title>Phase I Dose Escalation Study of BAY 1163877 in Japanese Subjects With Refractory, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Japanese males or female aged ≥ 20 years Histologically or cytologically confirmed refractory, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who are not candidates for standard therapy at discretion of investigator High FGFR expression levels based on archival or fresh tumor biopsy specimen analysis. Bladder cancer subjects with low overall FGFR expression levels can be included if activating FGFR3 mutations are confirmed. Subjects must have at least one measurable or evaluable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Life expectancy of at least 3 months Recovery to National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03) Grade &lt; 2 level or recovery to baseline preceding the prior treatment from any previous drug / procedurerelated toxicity (subjects with persistent alopecia, anemia, and/or hypothyroidism can be included) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 02 Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function Prothrombin timeInternational normalized ratio (PTINR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ≤ 1.5 times ULN. Subjects being treated with anticoagulant, e.g. warfarin or heparin, will be allowed to participate provided no prior evidence of an underlying abnormality in these parameters exists History or current condition of an uncontrolled cardiovascular disease including congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) &gt; Class 2, unstable angina (symptoms of angina at rest) or newonset angina (within last 3 months) or myocardial infarction within past 6 months and cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy (betablockers or digoxin are permitted) Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% as assessed by echocardiography performed Subjects with history and/or current evidence of endocrine alteration of calcium phosphate homeostasis (e.g. parathyroid disorder, history of parathyroidectomy, tumor lysis, tumoral calcinosis). Calcium (Ca) x (time) phosphate (PO4) should be &lt; 70 mg²/dL². Current evidence of corneal disorder / keratopathy including but not limited to bullous / band keratopathy, corneal abrasion, inflammation / ulceration, keratoconjunctivitis etc. (to be confirmed by ophthalmologic examination). Preexisting cataract is not an exclusion criterion. Moderate or severe hepatic impairment (subjects with ChildPugh score B or C cannot be included.) Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection Subjects with an active hepatitis B and/or C infection requiring treatment Anticancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy during the study or within 5halflives of anticancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy before start of study treatment. Systolic blood pressure ≤ 110 and pulse rate ≥ 100/min, or diastolic blood pressure ≤ 70 mmHg and pulse rate ≥ 100/min Uncontrolled hypertension as indicated by a resting systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥100 mmHg at screening</criteria>
