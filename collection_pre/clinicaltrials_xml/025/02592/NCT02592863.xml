	<brief_summary>Imbalance, dizziness and vertigo as a result of problems in the inner ear (vestibular dysfunction) are becoming increasingly more prevalent in Americans 40 years of age and older. The symptoms have a severe impact on affected individuals with detrimental effects on work, travel, social and family life. These patients see doctors often with no relief in their symptoms. The most promising help for these patients is to use medication that will increase blood flow to the inner ear. Pentoxifylline (Trental) has been shown to increase microvascular blood flow.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trental for the Treatment of Vertigo/Dizziness/Imbalance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One potential cause of vestibular dysfunction is a decrease in or insufficient blood flow to the inner ear. Studies have shown that when the blood flow is decreased to the inner ear, patients will become dizzy and off balance. This study will use validated instruments to evaluate the effectiveness of Trental in patients that present to our providers with vertigo, dizziness, or imbalance and meet inclusion criteria. They will be blinded and randomized to treatment or placebo, which they will take for ~12 weeks. Patients will completed validated surveys 3 times (beginning, middle and end of study) as well as account for the number of times they have fallen and if they have missed any work due to their symptoms.</detailed_description>
