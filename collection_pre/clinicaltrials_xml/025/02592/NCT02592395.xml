	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see how well electrochemotherapy works at treating people with Stage III pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Electrochemotherapy is a treatment that combines electroporation and chemotherapy administration. Electroporation uses an electric current to produce holes in pancreatic tumor, which causes the tumor cells to die or take up a higher concentration of administered chemotherapy agent. This study will test the safety and look at the effect of electrochemotherapy in the treatment of stage III pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This study will also help to find the safest and most effective amount of electroporation voltage to apply to this type of tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of FOLFIRINOX Electrochemotherapy in the Treatment of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I dose escalation trial using a 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme to evaluate the maximum tolerated field strength dose of administered irreversible electroporation in combination with chemotherapy. During the first cycle of chemotherapy, patients will receive electroporation of the primary pancreatic tumor prior to administration of chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX. The schedule of administration of FOLFIRINOX will be administered as per standard of care. The investigators will use non-invasive dynamic magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to detect and describe changes within the tumor. Safety will be determined by assessing the number of class three or higher toxicity events in cohorts of 6 patients at progressively higher electroporation voltages. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be defined as one voltage level less than the voltage at which two or more patients out of six total patients have a class three or higher toxicity event.</detailed_description>
