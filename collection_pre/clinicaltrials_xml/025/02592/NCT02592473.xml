	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of performing prostatic artery embolization (PAE) using endovascular techniques and particle embolics in men suffering from lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prostate Artery Embolization (PAE) for Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study is a prospective, non-randomized clinical trial assessing the safety and feasibility of prostatic artery embolization. Fifty adult male subjects will be enrolled and treated in this study. Patients who provide informed consent and are deemed eligible for participation will undergo prostatic artery embolization in the Interventional Radiology department at the University of Virginia. After performing an angiogram to identify the prostatic arteries, tiny particles known as Embozene Microspheres will be injected into the prostatic artery. Injecting these particles into the prostatic artery will slow blood flow to the prostate and thus shrinking the size of the prostate. By shrinking the size of the prostate, it is hopeful that it will provide relief of lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPH. Subjects will be followed for 2 years as part of their participation in this study.</detailed_description>
