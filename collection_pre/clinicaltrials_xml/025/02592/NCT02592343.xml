	<brief_summary>The primary goal is to study patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI) treated with lyophilized Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) in an open-labelled controlled trial. The treatment failure rate will be evaluated as defined by the persistence of diarrhea and a positive C. difficile toxin assay. The safety, clinical response, and relapse rate in patients will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Trial of Lyophilized Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Recurrent Clostridium Difficile Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrence of CDI following a course of standard antibiotic therapy is high, especially in the elderly patients over 65 years of age, in hospitalized and in the immunocompromised patients. As CDI is characterized by intestinal dysbiosis. Fecal Microbiology Transplantation (FMT) has been investigated as alternative treatment for CDI and has been determined to be effective and safe. One of the major challenges of offering FMT is the availability of suitable donors. A donor may no longer be able to continue to donate for a number of reasons and this may lead to temporary interruption of FMT in centers which offer the program. In order to continue to offer FMT whenever needed, we will investigate the efficacy of lyophilized FMT. The lyophilization (freeze-drying) process works by dehydrating a frozen donor stool sample to complete dryness, using controlled temperature and pressure gradients. This lyophilized process results in a powdered form of the sample. Studies have shown that lyophilized donor stool samples have similar microbial compositions as the same fresh sample.The technique of freeze drying has been used for decades for the industrial storage of microbes and has been used. Preliminary study of lyophilized stool for FMT has been performed in dogs. Preliminary efficacy data in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease suggest equal efficacy as compared to fresh stool, although controlled study has yet to be performed. Should the lyophilized FMT (L-FMT) demonstrate to be equally or more effective than frozen FMT, there would be significant advantages. As with frozen FMT, lyophilized FMT will allow patients to receive FMT immediately as it can take up to two weeks for a donor's screening laboratory testing results to be available. Lyophilized FMT will also be more cost effective as less number of donors will need to be screened given the prolonged shelf life of lyophilized FMT which can be kept at above the freezing temperature. 9 This will also allow wider distribution and accessibility especially to the regions with limited capacity to manufacture FMT.</detailed_description>
