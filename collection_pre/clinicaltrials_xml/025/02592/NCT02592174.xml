	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to measure the prevalence of according to the Frascati classification in a HIV-infected population aged between 55 and 70 years (exposed group) and to compare it with the prevalence of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) in unexposed subjects from the general population-based cohort CONSTANCES, matching subjects on age, gender, geographical origin and socioprofessional category.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence, Characteristics and Risk Factors of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders in Subjects Between the Ages of 55 and 70 Years: An Exposed/Unexposed Cross Sectional Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives are: - To study factors associated with Asymptomatic Neurocognitive Impairment (ANI) or Mild Neurocognitive Disorders (MND) by distinguishing the impact of traditional risk factors of neurocognitive impairment and those related to HIV infection, - To compare in the exposed and unexposed population physical characteristics, complaints and comorbidities, - To compare global neurocognitive scores in both populations after standardized normal reduction of each test. Methodology: HIV-infected subjects aged between 55 and 70 years will be recruited in centres that support people who living with HIV usually. The study will be proposed consecutively to all subjects aged between 55 and 70 year. A brief inquiry will collect motives on subjects that refuse to participate. A minimum of 70 subjects by 5 years age categories will be included. Unexposed subjects will be recruited in the same regions as their HIV-infected counterparts from the CONSTANCES database, a general population health cohort, after random selection matched on age, gender, geographical origin and socioprofessional category (2 HIV-unexposed subjects for 1 exposed subject). Data collection will follow the same methods as in the CONSTANCES cohort, in particular the neurocognitive tests by trained neuropsychologists.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For the HIVinfected, inclusion criteria are: An age between 55 and 70 years including, A HIVviral load &lt;50 copies/mL for at least 24 months (with a minimum of three viral loads during the 24 months period, and a last viral load within 6 months of inclusion). Blips, defined by a transitory elevation of viral load &lt; 200 copies/ml, are not considered as an exclusion criteria if objectified twice or less during the 24 months period, A CD4 cells level ≥ 200 cells/µL during the 12 months preceding inclusion, with a last CD4 cells value &lt; 6 months from inclusion, free and informed consent, Patient enrolled in or a beneficiary of a Social Security programme (State Medical Aid is not a Social Security programme) Noninclusion criteria are: Delirium or active central nervous system disease Major psychiatric disease, sensory loss, illiteracy, language barrier inducing difficulties in neurocognitive assessment, Neurocognitive extensive evaluation in the last 6 months, History of neurological disease with clinical sequels, Subjects participating in a study excluding participating in another study, Vulnerability, such as an age under 18, tutorship, guardianship, or subjects deprived of liberty by a legal or administrative decision. Inclusion criteria for the subjects from the CONSTANCES cohort are an age between 55 and 70 years. Noninclusion criteria are the same as the HIVinfected subjects, as well as reported HIVinfection or antiretroviral treatment.</criteria>
