	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of JNJ-64041757 a live attenuated double deleted (LADD) Listeria monocytogenes (bacteria in which two virulence genes, which encode molecules that help cause disease, have been removed) when administered intravenously to participants with advanced (Stage IIIb) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC (adenocarcinoma).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety &amp; Immunogenicity of JNJ-64041757, Live-attenuated Double-deleted Listeria Immunotherapy, in Subjects With Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, open-label, multicenter and 2-part study in participants with advanced (Stage IIIb) or metastatic (Stage IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (adenocarcinoma). Part 1 of study will be Dose Escalation phase to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on safety and pharmacodynamic assessments and Part 2 will be Dose Expansion Phase to evaluate 2 expansion cohorts (Cohort 2A and 2B) after the RP2D for JNJ-64041757 is determined in Part 1. The study will consist of a Screening Period (from signing of informed consent until immediately before the first dose), an open-label Treatment Period (from the first dose of study drug until the End-of-Treatment Visit); and a Post treatment Follow-up Period (after the End-of Treatment Visit until study discontinuation). Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in part 1, antigen-specific T-cell response in part 2 and incidence of adverse events in both the parts will be primarily evaluated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diseaserelated criteria for Part 1 and Part 2: 1) Histologically or cytologically documented nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma; 2) Stage III b or IV disease; 3) Tested for presence of echinoderm microtubuleassociated proteinlike 4 anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4ALK) rearrangement; 4) Received at least 2 prior lines of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved systemic therapy, of which one therapy has to be a platinumcontaining regimen OR failed or completed a firstline platinumcontaining regimen and refused a secondline regimen despite being informed about the different therapeutic options and their specific clinical benefit by the investigator; the content of this informed consent discussion including the therapeutic options reviewed by the investigator needs to be documented and the subject needs to sign a specific consent form; Diseaserelated criteria for Cohort 2B only: 1) Mesothelin protein overexpression, defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as detection of the protein by greater than or equal (&gt;=) 50 percent (%) of tumor cells on archived tumor material; 2) Primary tumor or metastatic lesion(s) amenable to tumor core biopsies At least 1 measurable tumor lesion per RECIST v1.1 (exception: subjects in Part 1 are not required to present with measurable disease) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status score of 0 to 1 At least 28 days since the last chemotherapy or immunotherapy prior to the first dose; at least 14 days since the last radiation prior to the first dose (exception: palliative radiotherapy for pain can be used greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 7 days prior to or after infusion) Untreated brain metastases. Subjects must have completed treatment for brain metastasis, and be neurologically stable off steroids, for at least 28 days prior to first dose of study drug History of listeriosis or vaccination with a listeriabased vaccine or prophylactic vaccine (eg, influenza, pneumococcal, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis [dTP/dTAP]) within 28 days of study treatment Known allergy to both penicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Participants who are allergic to only one of these antibiotics are allowed to enroll Concurrent treatment with antiTumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) therapies, systemic corticosteroids (prednisone dose greater than [&gt;]10 mg per day or equivalent) or other immune suppressive drugs within the 2 weeks prior to Screening. Steroids that are topical, inhaled, nasal (spray) or ophthalmic solution are permitted Positive test result for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)</criteria>
