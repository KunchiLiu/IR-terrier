	<brief_title>The Immunogenicity of Simultaneous Administration of Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine and 23-valent Pneumococcal Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The immunogenicity of simultaneous administration of quadrivalent influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine was unknown. We compare the immunogenicity of simultaneous administration of quadrivalent influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine with that of separate administration. 162 Participants are randomly assigned to one of the two study groups; Simultaneous administration group: receive injections of pneumococcal vaccine and influenza vaccine simultaneously. Sequential administration group: receive injections of pneumococcal vaccine 2 weeks after the injection of the influenza vaccine. We compare the immunogenicity of the two groups.</detailed_description>
