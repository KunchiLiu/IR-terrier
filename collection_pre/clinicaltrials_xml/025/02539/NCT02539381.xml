	<brief_summary>Visual impairment can affect up to 70% of stroke survivors, but many do not have their vision adequately assessed in hospital. An unidentified visual defect can cause significant problems for recovery and quality of life. The Stroke Vision app (an application currently scaled for a 10" Android tablet) has been developed to act as a screening tool for visual problems in stroke survivors; to help identify visual problems earlier and thereby improve rehabilitation outcomes. The app includes a suite of tests for assessing the patient's acuity, their visual fields and to aid in the identification of visual neglect / inattention. Furthermore, it includes educational information on visual stroke in order to better educate staff, patients and their carers. This study seeks to validate the novel digital assessments included in the Stroke Vision app against the current methods used for screening (clinical examination by confrontation field testing). Both screening measures will be compared with the gold standard methods for visual assessments, Octopus perimetry for fields and paper-based methods for visuospatial neglect</brief_summary>
