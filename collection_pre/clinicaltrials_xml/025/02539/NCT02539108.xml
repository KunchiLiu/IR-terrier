	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the 2015-2016 formulation of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine, administered in a 1- or 2-dose schedule, in accordance with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations, in children 6 months to &lt; 9 years of age. Objective: - To describe the safety of the 2015-2016 formulation of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine, administered in a 1- or 2-dose schedule, in accordance with ACIP recommendations, in children 6 months to &lt; 9 years of age. Observational objectives: - To describe the immunogenicity of the 2015-2016 formulation of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine, administered in a 1- or 2-dose schedule in accordance with ACIP recommendations, in children 6 months to &lt; 9 years of age. - To submit available sera from each subject to Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) for further analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the FDA to support formulation recommendations for subsequent influenza vaccines.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study participants will be assigned to the appropriate age group (6 months to &lt; 36 months of age or 3 years to &lt; 9 years of age) based on the subject's age at the time of enrollment. Participants aged 6 months to &lt; 36 months will receive a 0.25 mL dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine and those aged 3 years to &lt; 9 years will receive a 0.5 mL dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine. Participants, for whom 2 doses of influenza vaccine are recommended per ACIP guidance, will receive a second dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine during Visit 2 (28 days after Visit 1). Solicited adverse event (AE) information will be collected for 7 days after each vaccination, unsolicited AE information will be collected from Visit 1 to Visit 2 or to Visit 3 for those subjects receiving 2 doses. Serious adverse event (SAE) information will be collected from Visit 1 to Visit 2 or Visit 3, as appropriate. Immunogenicity will be evaluated in all subjects prior to vaccination on Day 0 (Visit 1) and at Day 28 after the final vaccination using the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) technique. For each influenza vaccine strain, pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean titers (GMTs) will be calculated.</detailed_description>
