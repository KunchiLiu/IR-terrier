	<brief_summary>This study investigated whether vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism is altered in primary open-angle glaucoma subjects carrying the risk allele and vitamin D deficiency is an important factor in the development of glaucoma. Primary open-angle glaucoma patients and age-matched people in the Han population were enrolled. Serum levels of 1a, 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 were measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. Vitamin D receptor polymorphic analysis was studied by real-time polymerase-chain reaction high resolution melting analysis.</brief_summary>
