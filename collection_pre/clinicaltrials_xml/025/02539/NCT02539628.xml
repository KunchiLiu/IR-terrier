	<brief_summary>The investigators believe sufficient spread to all nerves within the adductor canal—and thereby sufficient analgesia—can only be obtained by bolus injections and not by continuous infusions via a catheter. The aim of the study is to investigate whether an adductor canal block performed as repeated intermittent boluses provides superior pain relief to continuous infusion. The investigators hypothesize that adductor canal block performed as intermittent boluses via a catheter will reduce morphine consumption and pain as well as enhance ambulation and muscle strength compared with continuous infusion.</brief_summary>
