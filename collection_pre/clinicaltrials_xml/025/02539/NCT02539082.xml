	<brief_title>the Safety and Efficacy of Collagen Injection in Patients With Plantar Fasciitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-trial study. Sixty subjects will be participated in it. The study will be explained to the subjects and they voluntarily agreed to participate in it. Their eligibility to participate in the study will be checked, and the patient will receive collagen or a placebo (normal saline) in the plantar facia through randomization. They will be asked to follow the guidelines of the investigators during the study and to visit the hospital seven times, including for screening and the date of re-injection. . At each visit, the subjects undergo a VAS, a clinical laboratory tests, and a physical exam to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Regenseal. (*Re-injection could be maximum 2times at visit2 and 3, one week apart based on the investigator's judgment after the initial injection. If the subject gets injection on the screening date, the total number of his or her visits will be six.)</detailed_description>
