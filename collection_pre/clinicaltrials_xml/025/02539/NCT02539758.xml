	<brief_summary>Lowering intraocular pressure remains the mainstay of therapy in the management of glaucoma. The effect of ocular massage on intraocular pressure in patients with acute primary angle closure was the important thing.This was a prospective study, in which 20 eyes from 20 patients had acute angle closure. When they went to the hospital, ocular massage was performed without any medication. Intraocular pressure was detected by Goldmann tonometer, and Lenstar LS900 optical biometry observed changes of anterior chamber depth before and after ocular massage. Anterior chamber depth, anterior chamber angle and ciliary body were observed by Ultrasound biomicroscopy after massage, and anterior chamber angle was also checked by gonioscope after massage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Ocular Massage on the Management of Elevated Intraocular Pressure After Acute Angle Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Primary angle closure glaucoma is still the most common type in Asia. Lowering intraocular pressure remains the mainstay of therapy in the management of glaucoma, since it has been shown to be effective in reducing optic nerve damage and loss of vision. The objective of this study was to evaluate to assess the effect of ocular massage on intraocular pressure in patients with acute primary angle closure. Methods : This was a prospective study, in which 20 eyes from 20 patients had acute angle closure. When they went to the hospital, ocular massage was performed without any medication. Intraocular pressure was detected by Goldmann tonometer, and Lenstar LS900 optical biometry (Lenstar LS900) observed changes of anterior chamber depth before and after ocular massage. Anterior chamber depth, anterior chamber angle and ciliary body were observed by Ultrasound biomicroscopy (after massage, and anterior chamber angle was also checked by gonioscope after massage.</detailed_description>
