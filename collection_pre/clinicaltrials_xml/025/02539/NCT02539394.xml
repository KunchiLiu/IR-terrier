	<brief_title>Effect of Topical Corticosteroids on Dysphagia in Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Dysphagia is a serious post-operative concern in patients following anterior cervical surgery. Although many experts have acknowledged that dysphagia is often incompletely understood and defined, there is a significant amount of literature to support the significance of this clinical entity. This is the first randomized study to examine the use of topical steroids for the prevention of dysphagia postoperatively after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Study Design: This study is a single site, double blinded randomized control trial. All individuals undergoing 2-4 level ACDF that meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to either: 1. treatment arm or 2. control arm. Both arms will undergo their planned surgeries and will receive the exact same procedure and standard of care as if they were not enrolled in a study. The only difference is that the treatment arm will receive 40 mg of Methylprednisolone Acetate delivered with one Hemostatic Matrix Kit injectable delivery vehicle prior to closure in the prevertebral soft tissues. The control group will receive only Hemostatic Matrix Kit prior to closure in the prevertebral soft tissues. Outcomes: Patients will be asked to fill out questionnaires that assess dysphagia, general swallowing difficulty, and how neck pain impacts their quality of life. Additionally Radiographic images will be obtained at set time points to evaluate soft tissue inflammation and bony fusion.</detailed_description>
