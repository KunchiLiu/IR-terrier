	<brief_title>A Post-marketing Research on Jinyebaidu Granule in Treating Patients With Acute Upper Respiratory Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Inclusion criteria - Patients diagnosed as acute upper respiratory infection. - Patients with acute upper respiratory infection diagnosed as Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) syndrome wind-heat attacking the Lung (type of heat pathogen invading the defensive Qi of the lung). - Acute upper respiratory infection onset time is less than 36 hours. - Patients aged 18 to 70 years old. - Patients agreed to participate this study and sign the informed consent. 2. Effectiveness evaluation - TCM symptoms: fever, sore throat, cough with or without expectoration, headache, thirst, change of tongue body, tongue coating and pulse. - Signs: swollen tonsils, pharyngeal hyperemia. - Body temperature 3. Safety evaluation - Clinical symptoms and signs of adverse event reaction - Signs: blood pressure, respiration, heart rate, body temperature; - Routine blood test and urine routine; - Liver function and renal function: Alanine transaminase (ALT)、glutamic-oxalacetic transaminease(AST)、serum creatinine(SCr)、urea nitrogen(BUN) ; - Incidence of electrocardiogram(ECG) abnormalities. 4. Cost-effectiveness evaluation cost calculation - The direct medical costs include: the registration expenses, examination expenses, laboratory test expenses, Treatment costs, Chinese medicine expenses, Chinese herbal medicine expenses, western medicine expenses; Indirect medical costs: transportation costs, lost income patients; Adverse drug reactions cost: the cost of treatment due to adverse drug reactions. - Effect Evaluation:Symptoms and signs score, physical examination, the incidence of complications. 5. Number of participants 600 participants will be divided into two groups, the experimental group (n=300)and the control group (n=300).Each group will be stratified into three layers according to fever, sore throat, fever and sore throats. 100 patients will be included in each level. 6. Dose regimen - treatment group: Jinyebaidu granule, blunt, 10g/time, three times a day; Compound Shuanghua granules placebo, blunt, 6g /time, 4 times a day. - Control group: Compound double flowers particles, blunt, 6g/time, 4 times a day; Jinyebaidu Granule placebo, blunt, 10g/time, three times a day. 7. Course of treatment：5 days</detailed_description>
