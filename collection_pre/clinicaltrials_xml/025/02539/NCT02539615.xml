	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure the performance of the ForeCYTE Breast Aspirator for the collection and processing of Nipple Aspirate Fluid (NAF) specimens for cytology. Including collecting, processing and shipping samples, training staff, processing samples, sample interpretation and accurate and timely reporting in a manner resembling routine clinical use. The study will include a subset of patients who are known carriers of a BRCA germline mutation. NAF from this subset will be submitted for molecular testing in addition to cytology.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Healthy, female, age 3055 years, from whom bilateral specimens can be obtained. The following additional considerations apply: Women with prior mastectomy/lumpectomy may be considered for NAFcollection in the contralateral (nonoperated) breast only if they were: Stage I or Stage II at the time of surgery; Have completed any and all hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy at least one year prior to inclusion; Are considered diseasefree (NED No Evidence of Disease) at the time of study entry; Women under the age 30 may be enrolled if they are within 10 years of the age at diagnosis of breast cancer in a firstdegree relative. No subject under the age of 21 may be enrolled. 2. Any woman for whom NAFcytology testing is considered to be beneficial by her physician. This includes, but is not limited to women with first and/or second degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancer. Known presence of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation is allowed but not required. If known, any such mutation will be noted on the Case Report Form. The protocol does not provide for testing of women without known germline mutations. 3. Nonlactating and nonpregnant. 4. Good general health as determined by medical history, breast disease/cancer history, and clinical breast exam. 5. Willing to give informed consent and follow study procedures as directed. Exclusion Criteria 1. Medical condition/psychiatric conditions making subjects a poor candidate for study, as determined by the Principal Investigator. 2. Pregnancy or suspicion of pregnancy. 3. Open cutaneous wounds or atopic dermatitis in the area of the nippleareolar complex. 4. No or inverted nipple on the breast unfit for fluid collection, or significant prior surgery in the area of the nippleareolar complex. 5. Participation in an investigational drug or device study less than 30 days prior to enrollment in this study. 6. Pregnancy, childbirth, or lactation less than 90 days prior to enrollment in this study. 7. Acute illness, including taking antibiotics, analgesics, antipyretics and/or cold medications less than 7 days prior to enrollment in this study.</criteria>
