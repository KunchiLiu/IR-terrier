	<criteria>Patient has evidence of myocardial ischemia or a positive functional study Target lesion has a visually estimated stenosis of ≥50% and &lt;100% Target lesion is located in a native coronary artery with average reference vessel diameter ≥ 2.5mm and ≤ 3.5mm Target lesion length must be ≤ 20mm Baseline TIMI flow ≥ 2 The patient has experienced an acute myocardial infarction (AMI: STEMI or NSTEMI) within 72 hours of the procedure and either CKMB or Troponin has not returned to within 2X ULN. Patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40% Patient has unprotected left main coronary disease with ≥50% stenosis The target vessel is totally occluded (TIMI Flow 0 or 1) Target lesion involves a bifurcation (a lesion with a side branch ≥ 1.5 mm in diameter containing a ≥ 50% stenosis). Target lesion is located within a bypass graft Target lesion has possible or definite thrombus</criteria>
