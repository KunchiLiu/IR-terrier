	<brief_summary>Urolithiasis is a universal problem, a large part of patients will be affected by multiple stones throughout their lifetime, with estimated recurrence rates of 75% within 20 years. The high recurrence rate requires an increasing amount of imaging follow-up. US-NCCT real-time fusion (Fusion) enables lesion assessment and follow up using both modalities as reference for each other. Our study proposes a novel approach for short term follow up of patients using Fusion instead of repeat NCCT exams. the goal of the study is to create an initial proof of concept that Fusion is effective for follow up of known urinary stones. the study is a prospective study on Patients with an obstructing ureteral stone found on a NCCT. Patients will undergo Fusion (using General Electric Logiq E9) after NCCT. The primary endpoint was the ability to locate the ureteral stone using US with guidance of the NCCT as a "Road Map".</brief_summary>
