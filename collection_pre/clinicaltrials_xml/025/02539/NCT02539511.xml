	<brief_summary>Alcohol use disorders remain a significant public health problem. The pharmacological facilitation of behavioral treatment represents a promising strategy for addressing disordered drinking. Alcohol use disorders are recognized to be associated with various vulnerabilities that complicate the course of treatment and that may be amenable to glutamate modulators. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial is to test various glutamate modulators in conjunction with motivational enhancement therapy (MET) for alcohol use disorders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glutamatergic Modulation of Disordered Alcohol Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals diagnosed with alcohol dependence will be randomized to receive a single infusion of glutamate modulators during week 2 while engaged in a 5-week course of MET. They will meet with staff twice weekly, except for week 2 during which they will present to the clinic three times. Clinic visits include MET sessions, psychiatric monitoring, assessments, and study procedures (e.g., medication administration).</detailed_description>
