	<brief_summary>Though BiPAP is an increasingly common tool used by pediatric critical care physicians and there is promising data suggesting a role for BiPAP in the management of status asthmaticus, more information is needed to more definitively clarify the extent of its benefit, as well as when during an asthma exacerbation and in whom it is the most beneficial. In this study, which is among the first randomized studies of BiPAP use for status asthmaticus in the pediatric population, the investigators hope to better elucidate these issues to help guide clinicians' future management decisions.</brief_summary>
