	<brief_summary>Hypothesis is that the occurrence of nocturnal Vaso-Occlusive Crisis (VOC) and priapism in adults might be related to episodes of nocturnal desaturation secondary to a sleep apnea syndrome. Investigator hypothesize that chronic biological consequences of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (hypercoagulability, endothelial dysfunction ...) favour VOC and acute manifestations (nocturnal desaturation) favour nocturnal VOC. The confirmation of this hypothesis will lead investigator to propose a systematic screening of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with nocturnal VOC. Moreover, systematic treatment of OSA in sickle cell patients could help significantly reduce the number and severity of nocturnal VOC.</brief_summary>
