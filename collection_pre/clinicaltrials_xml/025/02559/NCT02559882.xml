	<brief_title>How to Test Success of a Renal Denervation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We aim to test the response to adenosine infusion, cold pressure test, flow mediated dilation of renal artery before and after a clinical indicated renal denervation. Renal Denervation is not a study intervention</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female patients 18 years to 85 years of age, with a diagnosis of resistant hypertension (office sitting blood pressure &gt;140/90 mmHg and 24hour blood pressure &gt;130/80 mmHg in patients treated with at least three antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic) and a clinical indication for a renal denervation. Secondary cause of hypertension Anatomical contraindication to renal denervation (renal artery diameter less than 4 mm or more than 8 mm), multiple renal artery, length to bifurcation less than 2 cm Heart failure (normal ejection fractions on echocardiography and no clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure). Alcohol or drug abuse, Malignancy (unless healed or remission &gt; 5 years) Pregnancy Know allergy to contrast medium Participation in another study within the last month</criteria>
