	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of linaclotide for the treatment of Irritable Bowel syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C), in children age 7-17 years. This study includes up to a 4-week Screening Period, and a 2 to 3-week Pretreatment Period. Patients age 7-11 will receive oral liquid or oral solid capsule and patients 12-17 will receive solid oral capsule formulation. Children ages 7-11 years meeting the entry criteria will be randomized to 1 of 3 doses of linaclotide or placebo for 4 weeks. Children ages 12-17 years meeting the entry criteria will be randomized to 1 of 4 doses of linaclotide or placebo for 4 weeks. This 4-week study will assess the effects of linaclotide on bowel movement frequency, as well as other bowel symptoms of IBS-C.</brief_summary>

Improvement with defecation 2. Onset associated with a change in frequency of stool 3. Onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool Patient meets modified Rome III criteria for child/adolescent Functional Constipation (FC): For at least 2 months before the Screening Visit, the patient has had 2 or fewer defecations (with each defecation occurring in the absence of any laxative, suppository, or enema use during the preceding 24 hours) in the toilet per week. In addition, at least once per week, patient meets 1 or more of the following: 1. History of retentive posturing or excessive volitional stool retention 2.

History of large diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet Patient is willing to discontinue any laxatives used before the Pretreatment Visit in favor of the protocolpermitted rescue medicine Patient has an average of fewer than 3 spontaneous BMs (SBMs) per week during the 14 days before the randomization day and up to the randomization. An SBM is defined as a BM that occurs in the absence of laxative, enema, or suppository use on the calendar day of the BM or the calendar day before the BM Patient or parent/guardian/LAR or caregiver is compliant with eDiary by completing both the morning and evening assessments for 10 out of the 14 days immediately preceding the Randomization Visit Patient reports having more than 1 loose, mushy stool (eDiaryrecorded stool consistency of 6 on the Pediatric Bristol Stool Form Scale [pBSFS]) or any watery stool (eDiaryrecorded stool consistency of 7 on the pBSFS) with any SBM that occurred in the absence of laxative use on the calendar day of the BM or the calendar day before the BM during the 14 days before the randomization day and up to the randomization Select medical history or conditions that may be related to other causes of constipation or may interfere with safety and efficacy analyses Patient has required manual or hospitalbased disimpaction any time prior to randomization Patient is unable to tolerate the placebo during rhe Screening Period</criteria>
