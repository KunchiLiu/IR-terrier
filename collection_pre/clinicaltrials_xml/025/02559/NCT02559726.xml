	<brief_summary>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common genetic cardiovascular disease. Outflow-tract gradient of 30 mmHg or more under resting conditions is an independent determinant of symptoms of progressive heart failure and death. The investigators hypothesize that the electrical approach by dual chamber pacing could improve symptoms and reduce outflow-tract obstruction in a specific sub-group of selected patients with a mechanical hyper-synchronicity. The aim of the study is to identify and describe this phenomenon in HCM with (O-HCM) and without (NO-HCM) outflow-tract obstruction thanks to innovative multi-imaging approach.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The concept of physiological ventricular desynchrony was described recently with technics of myocardial deformation analysis applied in animal models. Authors confirmed the existence of a time delay in the contraction of the apical walls before basal walls. In O-HCM, the outflow-tract obstruction could be explained by a mechanical hyper-synchronicity between apical and basal walls. This study aims to describe the possible hyper-synchronized contraction in O-HCM and NO-HCM patients unlike the physiological desynchrony observed in healthy volunteers (HV) For this purpose, three imaging tests will be used at baseline: echocardiography (TEE), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium enhancement only in HCM, and 3-dimensional electrocardiographic mapping (ECM) combined with computed tomography-scan. No follow-up is planned for this study.</detailed_description>
