	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if a new diagnostic research agent named 68Ga-RM2 can show prostate cancer on a PET/CT scan. 68Ga-RM2 stands for Galium-68 labeled DOTA-4-amino-1-carboxymethylpiperidine-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2. This study is being done because there are unmet medical needs to improve the current ways of detecting prostate cancers before surgery.</brief_summary>
