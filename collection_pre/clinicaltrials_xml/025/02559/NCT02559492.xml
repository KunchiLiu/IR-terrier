	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, Phase 1b, platform study in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will be divided into 2 parts (Part 1a and Part 1b). Part 1a will evaluate a JAK inhibitor with JAK1 selectivity (INCB039110) in combination with an IDO1 inhibitor (epacadostat; INCB024360; Group A) and INCB039110 in combination with a PI3K-delta inhibitor (INCB050465; Group B) to determine the MTD or PAD and the recommended Part 1b doses for each combination. Once the recommended dose has been identified for each treatment group in Part 1a, subjects with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled into expansion cohorts based upon prior treatment history with a PD-1 pathway-targeted agent (Part 1b).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female, age 18 years or older. Willingness to provide written informed consent for the study. Part 1a: Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have failed prior standard therapy (including subject refusal or intolerance). Part 1b: Subjects with endometrial cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, microsatellite unstable colorectal cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, triple negative breast cancer, or transitional cell carcinoma of the genitourinary tract that have had disease progression after available therapies for metastatic disease that are known to confer clinical benefit, been intolerant to treatment, or refused standard treatment. Part 1b: Must have documented confirmed disease progression on a prior programmed cell death1 (PD1) pathway targeted agent or must be PD1 pathwaytargeted treatment na√Øve.
