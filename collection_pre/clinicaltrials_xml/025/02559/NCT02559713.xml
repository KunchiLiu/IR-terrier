	<brief_title>Postmarketing Vedolizumab Milk-Only Lactation Study in Lactating Women With Active Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. This post-marketing milk-only lactation study will assess concentrations of vedolizumab in breast milk of lactating women with active UC or CD who are receiving vedolizumab therapeutically. The study will enroll approximately 12 participants. All participants who received an established vedolizumab maintenance regimen (at least two 300 mg doses of vedolizumab once every 8 weeks prior to delivery of infant and one 300 mg dose of vedolizumab postpartum) will receive their scheduled dose of vedolizumab on day 1 of the study at the clinic, study site or other healthcare provider (HCP) office: 30-minute IV infusion of 300 mg vedolizumab. This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is 3 months. Participants will make visits to clinic, study site or HCP office at Screening, Check-in (Day -1). Visits on Days 4, 8, 15, or 29. may be completed at the participant's home setting in the presence of a qualified nurse, or at a clinic, study site or other HCP office. The study exit/follow-up safety assessment will occur on Day 57(±3).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>nclusion Criteria: 1. Is capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements. 2. Signs and dates a written, informed consent form and any required privacy authorization prior to the initiation of any study procedures. 3. Is female and at least 18 years of age at the time of informed consent. 4. A female participant of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner agrees to use routinely adequate contraception from signing of informed consent and throughout the duration of the study. 5. Is on established vedolizumab maintenance therapy (received at least two 300 mg vedolizumab IV once every 8 weeks doses prior to the delivery of infant and one 300 mg once every 8 weeks dose of vedolizumab postpartum), which has been commenced by the participant's treating physician for the treatment of active UC or CD prior to enrolling in this study. 6. Has delivered a single, normal term infant (at least 37 weeks' gestation) that is, a motherinfant pair is required. 7. Is at least 6 weeks postpartum by Day 1. 8. Lactation is well established and the mother is exclusively breast feeding her infant (or not providing more than 1 supplemental bottle of formula/day) when enrolled in the study. 9. Participant has independently decided to be treated with vedolizumab or to breastfeed prior to providing consent to participate in this study. 10. Plans to continue breastfeeding at least throughout the duration of this study. 11. Agrees to use only the emollient or nipple cream recommended by the investigator for use during the sampling period. 1. Has received any investigational compound or approved biologic or biosimilar agent, except for vedolizumab within 60 days prior to enrollment in the study. Within 30 days prior to enrollment, the participant has received any of the following for the treatment of underlying disease: Nonbiologic therapies [example (eg), cyclosporine], other than those listed in the protocol. An approved nonbiologic therapy in an investigational protocol. 3. Is expected to receive additional vedolizumab treatment between Day 2 and Study Exit/Followup (Day 57). 4. Has received natalizumab treatment. 5. Has received any live vaccinations within 30 days prior to vedolizumab administration. 6. Has a positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen, antibody to hepatitis C virus, at Screening or a known history of human immunodeficiency virus infection (eg, common variable immunodeficiency, human immunodeficiency virus infection, organ transplantation). 7. Has clinically significant infection (eg, pneumonia, pyelonephritis) or chronic infection within 30 days prior to enrollment. 8. Is an immediate family member, study site employee, or is in a dependent relationship with a study site employee who is involved in the conduct of this study (eg, spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress. 9. Has evidence of unstable or uncontrolled, clinically significant cardiovascular, central nervous system, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, hematological, coagulation, immunological, endocrine/metabolic or other medical disorder, including serious allergy, asthma, hypoxemia, hypertension, seizures or allergic skin rash that, in the opinion of the investigator, would confound the study results or compromise participant safety. Additionally, if there is any finding in the participant's medical history, physical examination, or safety laboratory tests giving reasonable suspicion of a disease that would contraindicate taking vedolizumab, or a similar drug that might interfere with the conduct of the study. 10. Had any surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia within 30 days prior to enrollment or is planning to undergo major surgery during the study period. 11. Has any history of malignancy, except for the following: (a) adequately treated nonmetastatic basal cell skin cancer; (b) squamous cell skin cancer that has been adequately treated and that has not recurred for at least 1 year prior to enrollment; and (c) history of cervical carcinoma in situ that has been adequately treated and that has not recurred for at least 3 years prior to enrollment. Participants with remote history of malignancy (eg, greater than (&gt;) 10 years since completion of curative therapy without recurrence) will be considered based on the nature of the malignancy and the therapy received and must be discussed with the sponsor on a casebycase basis prior to enrollment. 12. Has a history of any major neurological disorders, including stroke, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor, or neurodegenerative disease. 13. Has a positive progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy subjective symptom checklist at screening. Has any of the following laboratory abnormalities during the Screening Period: Hemoglobin level &lt;8 g/dL. White blood cell (WBC) count &lt;3*10^9/L. Lymphocyte count &lt;0.5*10^9/L. Platelet count &lt;100×109/L or &gt;1200*10^9/L. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;3*the upper limit of normal (ULN). Alkaline phosphatase &gt;3*ULN. Serum creatinine &gt;2*ULN. 15. Has a current or recent history (within 1 year prior to enrollment) of alcohol dependence or illicit drug use. 16. Has active psychiatric problems that, in the investigator's opinion, may interfere with compliance with the study procedures. 17. Is unable to participate in all the study visits or comply with study procedures. 18. Has history of breast implants, breast augmentation, or breast reduction surgery. 19. Has a prior history of difficulty establishing lactation. 20. Has a positive urine/blood drug result for drugs of abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) at Screening. 21.
