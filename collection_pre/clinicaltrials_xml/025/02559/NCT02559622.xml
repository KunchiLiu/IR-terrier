	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of treatment with 300 mg or with 150 mg secukinumab (administered weekly for 4 weeks followed by four-weekly administration) on endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness after 12 weeks and for up to 52 weeks in subjects with chronic plaque-type psoriasis. Furthermore soluble biomarkers will be assessed to evaluate the influence of secukinumab on cardiovascular risk. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed in a subpopulation to assess the treatment effect on arterial vessel wall morphometry in atherosclerosis prone vascular beds.</brief_summary>
