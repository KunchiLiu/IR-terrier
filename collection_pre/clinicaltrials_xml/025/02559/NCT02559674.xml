	<brief_summary>This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multi-center, competitive enrollment and dose escalation study of ALT-803 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in conjunction with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>QUILT-2.001: ALT-803 in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer in Conjunction With Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses, to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and designate a dose level for Phase II study (RP2D) of ALT-803 administered in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. To access the anti-tumor activity of ALT-803 administered in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as measured by objective response rate, overall survival, progression-free survival, time to progression, and duration of response in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. To Characterize the pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity, and serum cytokine profile of ALT-803 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in treated patients. To correlate circulating cell free DNA and circulating tumor DNA with clinical outcomes of the study in treated patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. For dose escalation phase (Phase Ib) distant metastatic disease or unresectable disease and not a candidate for down staging to resection. For expansion phase (Phase II) distant metastatic disease only. For dose escalation phase (Phase Ib) 0 or 1 prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer. Prior gemcitabine is allowed, however prior nabpaclitaxel is not allowed. For expansion phase (Phase II) no prior therapy for pancreatic cancer is allowed except for adjuvant therapy as long as it was completed ≥ 6 months prior to study treatment start Have at least one untreated and progressing tumor lesion that can be accurately measured according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor Prior radiation is allowed if the index lesion(s) remains outside of the treatment field or has progressed since prior treatment. Radiation therapy must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to the baseline scan Resolved acute effects of any prior therapy to baseline or Grade ≤1 The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0, 1 or 2 Life expectancy ≥12 weeks Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) &gt; 40mL (milliliter)/min; Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN (Upper limit of Normal) Platelets ≥100,000/uL (microliter) Hemoglobin ≥ 9g/dL Absolute Lymphocytes ≥800/uL Absolute neutrophil count/absolute granulocyte count ≥1500/uL Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 X ULN, or ≤ 3.0 X ULN (for patients with Gilbert's Syndrome) aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase ≤ 2.5 X ULN, or ≤ 5.0 X ULN (if liver metastasis present) Normal clinical assessment of pulmonary function Negative serum pregnancy test if female and of childbearing potential Subjects, both females and males, with reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraceptive measures for the duration of the study Must provide informed consent and HIPPA authorization and agree to comply with all protocolspecified procedures and followup evaluations No women who are pregnant or nursing No known hypersensitivity to gemcitabine or nabpaclitaxel No concurrent herbal or unconventional therapy No prior therapy with IL15 or IL15 analog No ongoing toxicity from prior anticancer treatment that may interfere with study treatment. All toxicities attributed to prior anticancer therapy other than alopecia and fatigue must resolve to grade 1 or baseline before administration of the study treatment. No positive Hep C serology or active Hep B infection No congestive heart failure &lt; 6 months No unstable angina pectoris &lt; 6 months No myocardial infarction &lt; 6 months No history of ventricular arrhythmias or severe cardiac dysfunction No history of uncontrollable supraventricular arrhythmias No New York Heart Association Class &gt; II congestive heart failure No marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval No known autoimmune disease requiring active treatment. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of enrollment. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease No known prior organ allograft or allogeneic transplantation No known HIVpositive or AIDS unless patient is on a stable highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen, have CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) counts &gt;350, with no detectable viral load on quantitative polymerase chain reaction test No untreated central nervous system metastases, or if treated must be neurologically stable for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment No corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose of ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone (or equivalent) No psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance No other illness that in the opinion of the investigator would exclude the subject from participating in the study No active systemic infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy No anticancer treatment including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, other immunotherapy, or investigational therapy within 14 days before treatment start No disease requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which the patient has been diseasefree for 3 years after surgical treatment.</criteria>
