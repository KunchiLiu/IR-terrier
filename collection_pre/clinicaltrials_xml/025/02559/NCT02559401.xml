	<brief_summary>Currently, standard-of-care tractography is based on information obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI is a diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) technique that is routinely obtained on neurosurgical patients to assist in pre-operative planning. The primary objective of the proposed study is to determine the ability of msHARDI-based tractography to discern fibers in edematous brain regions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>brain lesions, including but not limited to tumors, epileptic foci, and vascular abnormalities, in or around eloquent brain regions (i.e., motor, language); clinical need for preoperative 'advanced imaging' (which includes conventional DTI); age between 1880 years of age; male or female gender. Eloquent regions include: Temporal and frontal lobes (speech/language); bilateral occipital lobes (vision); bilateral parietal lobes (sensation); and bilateral motor cortex (movement). a contraindication for obtaining an MRI scan (e.g. implanted devices, retrained foreign body) pregnancy absence of the capacity to make medical decisions or provide informed consent.</criteria>
