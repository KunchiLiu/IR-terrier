	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the delivery of SR-T100 from the topical gel (containing 2.3% solamargine in Solanum undatum plant extract) by determining the plasma levels of solamargine in subjects with AK while administration of a 25 cm2 contiguous or non-contiguous dermal treatment area.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiple-dose Pharmacokinetic Study of Solamargine in Patients With Actinic Keratosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is an open-label, multiple-dose, pharmacokinetic study. In stage 1, plasma concentration of solamargine will be examined after the test products were administrated to 5 subjects with Actinic Keratosis (AK). Thereafter, an interim report based on the results of stage 1 will be submitted for Taiwan Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) review to determine stage 2 will be conducted or not. For stage 2, another 5 subjects with AK will be enrolled to complete the study. The subjects will be recruited from AK patients of Taiwan. All subjects will sign an informed consent form (ICF). A copy of the signed ICF will be handed to the subjects. The subjects will be screened on an outpatient basis within 1 month prior to entry according to defined inclusion and exclusion criteria (medical history, personal history, physical examination, and laboratory values). The subject must be qualified for the study by fulfilling all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. In the study period, study drug will be given once daily for sixteen consecutive weeks. Specifically, subjects will receive a single dose of 0.3-0.5 g topical SR-T100 gel (containing 2.3% solamargine in Solanum undatum plant extract) in 25 cm2 skin area covered by occlusive dressing at least 20 hours a day.</detailed_description>
