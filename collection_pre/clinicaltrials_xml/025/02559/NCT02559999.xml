	<brief_summary>Determine objective markers of pain perception remains a major scientific and medical issue. Various tools have been proposed to objectify pain, but their adaptability to different clinical contexts are limited. Our working hypothesis considers that the research for markers of immediate pain perception should be based on an electrophysiological approach, based on the combined analysis of EEG and autonomic responses.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project aims to study the cortical and autonomic responses induced by tonic painful stimulation compared to those induced by comparable sensory and stressful stimulations, by combining high density EEG, cutaneous sympathetic, cardiovascular and pupillary recordings.</detailed_description>
