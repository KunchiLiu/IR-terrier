	<criteria>Diagnosis: Subjects must have a diagnosis of highrisk (defined in protocol) neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma (nodular or intermixed) verified by histology or demonstration of clumps of tumor cells in bone marrow with elevated urinary catecholamine metabolites. Subjects must be age ≤ 21 years at initial diagnosis Subjects must not have had prior systemic therapy except for localized emergency radiation to sites of lifethreatening or functionthreatening disease and/or no more than 1 cycle of chemotherapy per a low or intermediate risk neuroblastoma regimen (as per P9641, A3961, ANBL0531, or similar) prior to determination of MYCN amplification status and histology. Specimens will be obtained only in a nonsignificant risk manner and not solely for the purpose of investigational testing. Adequate liver function must be demonstrated (defined in protocol) Subjects must have adequate renal function defined as a Serum creatinine based on age/gender (defined in protocol) Adequate Cardiac Function (defined in protocol) Ability to tolerate PBSC collection: No known contraindication to PBSC collection. A negative serum pregnancy test is required for female participants of child bearing potential (≥13 years of age or after onset of menses) Both male and female postpubertal study subjects need to agree to use one of the more effective birth control methods during treatment and for six months after treatment is stopped. These methods include total abstinence (no sex), oral contraceptives ("the pill"), an intrauterine device (IUD), levonorgestrol implants (Norplant), or medroxyprogesterone acetate injections (Depoprovera shots). If one of these cannot be used, contraceptive foam with a condom is recommended. Informed Consent: All subjects and/or legal guardians must sign informed written consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional guidelines Subjects who are 1218 months of age with INSS Stage 4 and all stage 3 subjects with favorable biologic features (ie, nonamplified MYCN, favorable pathology, and DNA index &gt; 1) are not eligible. Lactating females are not eligible unless they have agreed not to breastfeed their infants. Subjects receiving any investigational drug concurrently. Subjects with any other medical condition, including but not limited to malabsorption syndromes, mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with the interpretation of the results or which would interfere with a subject's ability to sign or the legal guardian's ability to sign the informed consent, and subject's ability to cooperate and participate in the study</criteria>
