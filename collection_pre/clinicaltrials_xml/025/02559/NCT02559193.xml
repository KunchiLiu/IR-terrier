	<brief_summary>The Study is a single-arm prospective trial of patients receiving at least one medication with a known association between genetics and drug metabolism. All patients will undergo genetic testing as determined by their treating physician. The specific genes tested will, in general, be based upon the drugs the patients are taking or those that the patient's treating physician is considering as potential substitutes for current medications.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this data collection only trial design, the PGx test is not a protocol-specified procedure. Rather, patients are eligible if they have undergone PGx testing within the last 90 days. Thus, PGx testing will not be performed solely for inclusion in this clinical research initiative.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Patient underwent PGx testing for alleles appropriate to the target drugs within the prior 90 days ("index PGx test"); 2. Male or female patients 18 years or older who have given their written Informed Consent to participate in a Clinical Study based on voluntary agreement a through explanation of the patient's participation is provided to them. Patients must have adequate reading and writing abilities such that they can comprehend and answer the questions on the patient completed assessments and Informed Consent Form; 3. Patient was receiving at least one medication known to be associated with allelic variation at the time of the index PGx test), including overthecounter medications; 5. Patient has a history of at least one TDAE over the 12month period preceding receipt of PGx test results, or has experienced inadequate efficacy from a target drug and receiving medical coverage through a private insurance. 1. Patient is currently hospitalized; 2. Patient's medical and medication history is unavailable over the 90day period preceding the receipt of PGx testing; 3. Patient is unable to provide an accurate history due to mental incapacity; 4. Patient is known to have undergone prior PGx testing for genes specific to the target drug(s), exclusive of the PGx test relating to this Study.</criteria>
