	<brief_title>Modified Bortezomib-based Combination Therapy for Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common hematological malignancy in Chinese elderly population. The application of novel drugs improved the clinical outcome and survival of MM patients,even though MM remains an incurable hematological malignancy. Bortezomib is a typical one among these novel agents, its application resulted in great success, but its adverse events and high expense restricted its widely usage. Investigators modified the dose and frequency of bortezomib administration in combination therapy: Patients in the modified group received regimen with bortezomib (1.6mg/㎡) as an intravenous bolus once weekly on day 1, 8 in a 3 weeks cycle, in combination with dexamethasone,with or without doxorubicin/ cyclophosphamide/mitoxsnteone/thalidomide，while patients in the control group received similar combination therapy except with conventional bortezomib (1.3mg/㎡) administration twice weekly on day 1,4, 8,11. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the modified bortezomib-based therapy may attain a similar efficacy as the conventional ones.</detailed_description>
