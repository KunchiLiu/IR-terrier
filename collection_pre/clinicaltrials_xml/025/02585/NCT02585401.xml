	<detailed_description>The source of information for the study will be self-reported data collected from physicians using standard questionnaires with closed-ended response choices.

Questionnaires will be tested in local languages, to assure that the introductory material, consent forms, and questionnaire items (question stems and response choices) are culturally appropriate and easily and correctly understood by individuals similar to those who will participate</detailed_description>
