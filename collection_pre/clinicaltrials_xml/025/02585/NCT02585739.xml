	<brief_summary>Cluster headache (CH) is a rare, excruciating primary headache disorder. A genetic basis has been suggested by family and twin studies, but the mode of transmission seems to vary and the amount of heritability is unclear. The number of genetic association studies investigating variants implicated in the pathophysiology of CH is limited. The HCRTR2 1246G &gt; A and the ADH4 925A &gt; G polymorphisms have been associated with CH. The former has been confirmed and may affect the hypothalamic hypocretin system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible link between SPINK 1 gene and cluster headache.</brief_summary>
