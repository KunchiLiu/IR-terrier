	<brief_title>Transanal Decompression Tube Versus Stent for Acute Malignant Left-sided Colonic and Rectal Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 8-47 % of patients with colorectal cancer will present with colonic obstruction. Left-sided colonic and rectal cancer is responsible for nearly 70% of acute colonic obstruction. Emergency colonic surgery for acute obstruction is associated with a higher mortality and morbidity rate than elective surgery. Preoperative decompression results in a less dilated bowel that is more amenable to an elective surgery. Both transanal decompression tube and stent can serve a good preoperative decompression effect and serve a good bridge to surgery. Investigators aim to compare the clinical outcomes of transanal decompression tube as a bridge to surgery with stent as a bridge to surgery for acute malignant left-sided colonic and rectal obstruction.</detailed_description>
