	<brief_summary>Day surgery is performed in the same way as in full hospital admission, allowing same-day discharge without increased risk. It provides many grounds for patient satisfaction. Progress in surgical and anesthesia techniques now allows this form of management to be developed and prioritized. Day-care surgery for prolapse has been little studied. The present study is intended to help extend its future implementation, the primary objective being to assess the feasibility of the day-care approach in prolapse surgery. The secondary objectives are to study criteria of non-eligibility for day-care prolapse surgery, reasons for patients' refusal, causes of failure, predictive factors for failure, patient satisfaction, postoperative complications, 2-year anatomic and functional results, pain, quality of life and sexuality, and postoperative onset of dyspareunia and urinary incontinence. The design is for a prospective non-randomized study conducted in 3 gynecologic surgery sites managed by the Lyon hospitals board (Hospices Civils de Lyon).</brief_summary>
