	<brief_title>Aspiration Treatment of Perianal Abscess</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anorectal abscess is a common condition, caused by cryptoglandular polymicrobial infection, where the traditional treatment is surgical drainage. Anorectal abscess is associated with recurrence rates between 6-44 % after surgical drainage and persistent subsequent fistula up to 37 %. Inadequate incision, missed abscess components or fistulas can be the cause of recurrence . Surgical drainage is associated with discomfort from prolonged wound healing, affecting the daily activities as well as the potential risk of complicated scaring and fecal incontinence. Less invasive method with pus aspiration under antibiotic cover has been shown to be safe in terms of recurrence rate and subsequent fistula formation and well tolerated by the patients with less morbidity and wound complications and a potential lower risk of fecal incontinence. However, this has been shown only in few studies with small population and no randomized controlled study comparing the two approaches has been conducted or published to our knowledge. The risk factors of recurrence and subsequent fistula formation are not that clear but age below 40 years, absence of diabetes mellitus and recent smoking are shown to be risk factors for developing recurrent abscess and fistula. Applying aspiration and antibiotics method for the treatment of perianal abscess can be an advantage for the society due to a shorter recovering period, quicker return to daily activity and work and avoiding wound healing problems and sphincter damage; thus lower expenses. The results of this study have the potentials to reveal the risk factors of developing fistula after perianal abscess.</detailed_description>
