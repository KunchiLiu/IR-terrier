	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to analyze factors affecting Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation in anti-HBc positive patients with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with rituximab and compare HBV reactivation rates by duration of prophylactic treatment with tenofovir to contribute to the establishment of an effective prevention strategy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in a randomized, open-label, multi-center design. On Day 1 of chemotherapy, approximately 90 subjects screened and determined eligible will be randomized to either Group A or Group B in a 1:1 manner for study participation. - Group A: Upon the EOC, subjects will receive tenofovir 300mg for approximately 6 months (24 weeks) and undergo treatment and follow-up every 12 weeks for up to 72 weeks post chemotherapy. - Group A: Upon the EOC, subjects will receive tenofovir 300mg for approximately 12 months (48 weeks) and undergo treatment and follow-up every 12 weeks for up to 72 weeks post chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
