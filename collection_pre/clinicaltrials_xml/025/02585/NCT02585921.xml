	<brief_summary>The number of persons actively waiting on the national solid organ waiting list continues to rise while the number donating organs has failed to keep pace. This is a particular problem for some portions of northeastern Ohio where the donation rate is as low as 32%. Adolescents are an important group for organ donation efforts as they have not yet applied for a driver's license and represent the majority of future donors. Yet many organ donation interventions have not targeted adolescents. The investigators propose to utilize existing high school teen summits developed by our Consortium partners to evaluate the effectiveness of existing donation interventions. Together, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled 2x2 factorial trial to evaluate the independent and combined effects of two donor education interventions on consent for organ donation on the electronic Ohio Donor Registry. One thousand six hundred students over the age of 15.5 years from Cleveland-area high schools will be enrolled.</brief_summary>
