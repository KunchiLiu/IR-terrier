	<brief_summary>Stem cells have promising potential in treating diabetes. However the therapeutic outcome in diabetic patients will profoundly depend on their delivery to pancreas. Our objective is to label stem cells with PET tracer F18-FDG to carry out in vivo cell tracking. The labeled stem cells will be given through different routes (intravenous and intraarterial)and tissue distribution studied. Patients will be followed up for the next 6 months. Glucagon stimulated C peptide will be measured at baseline and at 6 months and HOMA IR and HOMA beta will be calculated.</brief_summary>
