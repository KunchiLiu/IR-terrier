	<brief_summary>At St.Olavs Hospital each year about 400 patients are treated for femoral neck fractures, 250 of them receiving hemiarthroplasty. Implementation of fast-track clinical pathways reduces morbidity and enhances recovery of patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty. One of the key prerequisites for early rehabilitation is optimized pain relief. Local infiltration anesthesia with Ropivacaine is part of a multimodal pain regimen for patients receiving hemiarthroplasty at St.Olavs Hospital, although the pain reducing effect of local Ropivacaine after hemiarthroplasty has not been investigated in clinical trials. In this study it will be investigated whether a single shot with Ropivacaine reduces acute postoperative pain and opioid requirement after hemiarthroplasty. The findings of this study will have a direct impact on patient treatment.</brief_summary>
