	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Intepirdine (RVT-101) in Subjects With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease on Donepezil: MINDSET Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 study seeks to confirm a demonstrated treatment effect of intepirdine (RVT-101) on both cognition and activities of daily living when added to stable donepezil treatment in subjects with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment. This study will also provide further information on the safety and tolerability of the 35-mg dose of intepirdine (RVT-101) when used in combination with donepezil compared to donepezil alone. This study is being conducted under the agreement of a Special Protocol Assessment by FDA. Subjects completing this study will be eligible to enroll in a 12 month open-label study of RVT-101 (RVT-101-3002) in which concomitant medications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease including memantine will be allowed.</detailed_description>
