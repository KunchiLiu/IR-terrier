	<brief_summary>Arterial hypertension has been recognized as a major causal factor for atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. In light of its worldwide increasing prevalence and incidence and the accompanied increase in the risk of stroke, thromboembolic events and mortality, AF has emerged as a global healthcare problem. Early diagnosis of AF, prior to the occurrence of complications is a recognized priority for the prevention of strokes. Once diagnosed, anticoagulant therapy is the cornerstone in the management of the risk of stroke in AF patients. The 2012 ESC Guidelines recommend the use of a risk factor-based approach to stroke risk stratification for AF patients. This study aims towards gaining real-world data on the prevalence of non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) among hypertensives in Greece. The rate of ESC guideline-adherent antithrombotic therapy on the basis of stroke and bleeding risk assessments, and factors influencing treatment decision-making will be assessed as well in patients diagnosed with the arrhythmia. Finally, potential differences in the NVAF prevalence in adequately and inadequately controlled hypertensives will be documented.</brief_summary>
