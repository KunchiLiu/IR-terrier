	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) have distinctive characteristics: they are old, frail, with several co-morbidities and take multiple medications. Hemodynamic instability, cerebral embolism, sedation, general anesthesia and hospitalization in intensive care expose those patients to postprocedural delirium. Acute neurocognitive dysfunctions are associated with adverse outcomes in these population. The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of delirium and neurocognitive disorders in elderly patients after TAVI.</brief_summary>
