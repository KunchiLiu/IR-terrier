	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, disabling, progressive condition characterised by severe problems with movement for which medical treatment in the longer term can be unsatisfactory. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment, which directly stimulates the nerve cells affected inside the brain to help overcome the difficulties with movement. Classically, DBS stimulates in a manner that is constant and independent of a patients underlying condition as reflected in their brainwave activity. Recent research has suggested that adjusting DBS in real time using analyses of brain signals recorded from DBS electrodes (termed closed loop DBS) nay be better than classical DBS in alleviating difficulties with movement. However, it remains unclear whether closed-loop DBS also leads to fewer unwanted side effects on movement control.In order to answer this question, the investigators will analyze DBS activity and activity recorded from the surface of the head in PD patients undergoing DBS surgery. During the recordings patients will perform different movement tasks. DBS has been found to reduce patients' ability to suppress inappropriate movements in certain tasks and performance in these tasks will be the core point of interest. The recordings will be conducted three times: During closed loop DBS, classical DBS and while the stimulator is turned off. This will allow the investigators to assess putative differences in the effect of closed loop and classical DBS with regards to wanted and unwanted effects on movement control and to elucidate their correlates in the brain.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Study participants will be PD patients undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Whether or not a patient is selected for DBS surgery is determined by the patient's clinical team purely on independent clinical grounds. Only those patients who have been accepted for DBS treatment by their clinical neurologist and functional neurosurgeon will be introduced to the project and have their details passed on to the research team for further information and formal consenting. Able to give informed consent. Lack of capacity to consent (judged by the clinician taking consent as not having sufficient mental capacity to understand the study and its requirements). This is including anyone who, in the opinion of the clinician taking consent, is unlikely to retain sufficient mental capacity for the duration of their involvement in the study. Cognitive impairment/lack of capacity to perform experimental task. We will additionally conduct a short (10 min) quantitative assessment of cognitive function using a validated test (MMSE). Patients with a score &lt; 20 will be excluded from the study.</criteria>
