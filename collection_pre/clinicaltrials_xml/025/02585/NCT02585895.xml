	<criteria>Male or female, ≥ 18 years of age Subject has been receiving regular apheresis for LDLC lowering for at least 3 months immediately prior to lipid screening and has a treatment goal of LDLC &lt; 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L), and has been receiving LDLC apheresis during the last ≥ 4 weeks prior to lipid screening at regular QW or Q2W schedule and with no changes in apheresis type Subject is receiving lipidlowering pharmacological background therapy which includes a highintensity statin dose (moderateintensity statin dose with attestation that a higher dose is not appropriate for the subject) unless the subject has a history of statin intolerance Lipidlowering therapy status (ie, any therapy for lowering lipids, including apheresis type and frequency) must be unchanged for ≥ 4 weeks prior to LDLC screening Preapheresis LDLC is ≥ 100 mg/dL (≥ 2.6 mmol/L) and ≤ 190 mg/dL (≤ 4.9 mmol/L) at screening Fasting triglycerides ≤ 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L) at screening. Exclusion criteria: Known homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia Missing any apheresis session is medically contraindicated or inappropriate Stopping apheresis would be inappropriate in the opinion of the investigator even if LDLC is controlled to &lt; 100 mg/dL with other therapies Myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or stroke within 3 months prior to randomization.
