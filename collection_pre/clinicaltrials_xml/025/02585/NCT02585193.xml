	<brief_summary>While some evidence on weight change elicited from commercially available weight loss programs, such as Weight Watchers, is available, there is little evidence evaluating any health-related outcomes that result from losing weight through these programs. In addition, little data exists on the adherence and satisfaction of these types of programs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate body weight and health-related outcomes that are achieved from participating in a Weight Watchers program, along with program adherence and satisfaction. Men and women (N=150) that are participating in Weight Watchers weight loss program will undergo assessments at the University of Pittsburgh to evaluate outcomes related to the Weight Watchers 6 month intervention. Assessment visits, separate from the intervention, will take place at baseline (0 months), 3 months and 6 months for approximately 90 minutes at the Physical Activity and Weight Management Research Center. Participants will be asked to undergo assessments of body weight, height, aerobic stamina, functional fitness, flexibility, and complete a series of questionnaires related to demographics, program satisfaction, sleep quality, happiness, and food cravings. Adherence to the program will be measured by the number of group sessions attended.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Commercial Program on Weight Loss and Health Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a body of evidence that has evaluated the effect of Weight Watchers, a commercially available weight loss program, on changes in body weight. The current investigation aims to add to this body of evidence by providing additional data on changes in body weight and enhance the current evidence-base in regards to evaluating other health-related outcomes. There is no evidence that demonstrates whether or not the weight loss as a result of the Weight Watchers program elicits changes in health-related outcomes related to aerobic capacity, flexibility, functional fitness, sleep, and other psychological measures. Additionally, within a scientific research protocol, measures of adherence and satisfaction have not been evaluated. This study will evaluate these outcomes beyond weight changes achieved across the 24-week program.</detailed_description>
