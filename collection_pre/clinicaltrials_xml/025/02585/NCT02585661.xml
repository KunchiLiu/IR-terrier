	<brief_title>Iron Bioavailability From Dairy Product</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center trial will be double-blind, controlled randomized with a crossover trial. One group (n=10) will start the study with the consumption of a Fe-54 salt fortified dairy product, while the other group will start the study with the consumption of Fe-57 salt fortified dairy product. The day after, in a cross over design, subjects will be administered the alternative test product. A blood sampling will be performed 14 days after the last stable isotope administration to allow the measurement of Fe stable isotope ratios and the calculation of Fe absorption. The duration of the trial will be 16 days in total. The total sample size is 20 enrolled subjects. Patients will be healthy females aged 18-40 years old</detailed_description>
