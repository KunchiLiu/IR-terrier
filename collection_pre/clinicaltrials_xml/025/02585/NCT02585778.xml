	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: - To demonstrate the superiority of alirocumab in comparison with placebo in the reduction of calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with diabetes treated with insulin and with hypercholesterolemia at high cardiovascular risk not adequately controlled on maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy. - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab in patients with diabetes treated with insulin. Secondary Objective: To demonstrate that alirocumab is superior in comparison to placebo in its effects on other lipid parameters (ie, measured LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C], apolipoprotein B [Apo B], total cholesterol [TC], lipoprotein a [Lp(a)]), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG) levels, triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TGRL), apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1), apolipoprotein CIII (Apo C-III), and LDL particle number and size).</brief_summary>
