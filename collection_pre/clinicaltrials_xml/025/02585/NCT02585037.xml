	<brief_summary>The Kinesio Taping® method, therapeutic bandage, is another feature can be used in physical therapy, aiming to muscle enhancement, weakened muscles correction, analgesia, among others, by cutaneous stimulation of mechanoreceptors. This study aims to evaluate the efficiency of the use and effects offered by Kinesio Taping® method, changes in muscle strength of grip in normal subjects for clinical application.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes in Grip Strength by Using Bandage Kinesio Taping</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A sample of 45 subjects will be divided randomly into three groups (G1: muscle activation technique; G2: muscle inhibition technique; G3: Placebo Effect) aged over 18 years male or female, where it will be initially measured the strength of grip with a dynamometer Jamar® pressure. Then the Kinesio Taping® bandage will be applied in an "I" format in the wrist flexor muscles of a dominant and non-dominant limb in G1, G2, and G3 groups. Investigators will follow the application protocol suggested by method of technical. To provide the facilitation of muscle activity (G1 group) a Kinesio Taping® bandage will be applied to the muscle starting at its origin up to the location of muscle insertion. For inhibition of muscle activity (G2 group), the bandage will be placed over the muscle starting at the insertion location and ending at the muscle origin. For the control group (G3 group) the bandage will be placed from the lateral extremity to the medial axis. The measurement of grip strength was carried out in four stages: immediately before placing the Kinesio Taping®, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after its application. After collecting the data statistical Investigators will held the analysis of the data.</detailed_description>
