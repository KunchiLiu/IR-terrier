	<brief_summary>This study is comprised of 2 phases to study the impact of a text message system on overall adherence to a web-based smoking cessation program. Phase I uses a full factorial design to identify the most optimal text message intervention to maximize adherence to the BecomeAnEX.org smoking cessation program. Phase II is a randomized controlled trial that compares regular BecomeAnEX users to those who will receive the optimized text message intervention (from Phase I) in conjunction with BecomeAnEX for impact on long-term abstinence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Text Messaging to Improve Adherence to Web-Based Cessation Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is comprised of 2 active phases, all conducted with registered users on BecomeAnEX.org, a well-established smoking cessation website. Phase I involves the initial development and optimization of the text message intervention. The investigators will examine the impact of 4 experimental text message intervention features on smokers' adherence to a web-based cessation intervention during the first 3 months of program enrollment. The investigators will utilize a full factorial design where participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 levels of each of the following features: 1) personalization (yes/no), 2) integration (yes/no), 3) dynamic tailoring (yes/no), and 4) message intensity (standard vs. decreasing). The primary outcome in Phase I will be a composite metric of utilization. Phase II involves a 2-arm randomized trial that compares WEB alone to WEB plus the text message intervention from Phase I that yields optimal adherence (WEB+OA_TXT). The randomized trial will use a repeated measures design, with assessments at baseline, 3, 9, and 15 months. Follow-ups at 3, 9, and 15 months correspond to 0, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. The primary outcome is 30-day point prevalence abstinence (ppa) at 9-months. The investigators will assess and validate smoking status at all follow-ups. Other outcomes include motivation to quit, quit attempts, and continuous abstinence.</detailed_description>
