	<brief_summary>Drug efficacy testing is one of the most important tasks that is routinely undertaken by the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) in Tanzania and has been recommended by the World health Organisation to monitor the efficacy of artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) and possibly detect evolution/emergency of tolerance/resistance to these drugs. Currently, Artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) is the only ACT recommended by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and therefore testing of new ACTs such as dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQ) is important because alternative drugs are urgently required. Meanwhile, NMCP is revising the guidelines for treatment of malaria in Tanzania and DHA-PQ has been earmarked as an alternative ACT to be used together with ALu. However, efficacy and safety data of DHA-PQ is missing since no studies have been done in Tanzania. Thus, a study is proposed to assess the efficacy and safety of DHA-PQ Vs ALu and provide important data which will enable the NMCP to make informed decisions; and possibly recommend DHA-PQ in the new Malaria treatment guidelines as the second line drug for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the country.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients aged between 6 months 10 years, without severe malnutrition and with a slideconfirmed monoinfection of P. falciparum, and asexual parasitemia between 250 200000 asexual parasites/Âµl will be included. Other inclusion criteria will include, absence of dangers signs (see Exclusion Criteria), axillary temperature &gt; 37.5oC or a history of fever within the past 24 hours and ability to swallow oral medications. The ability and willingness to attend scheduled followup visits and an informed consent provided by parent or guardian will also be considered as important inclusion criteria without which a patient will not be enrolled into the study. Patients shall not be excluded on the basis of reported prior treatment with other antimalarial drugs other than DHAPQ within the past 24 hours if they have fever (axillary temperature &gt; 37.50C) and parasitemia. Patients should have stable residence within the catchment area throughout the study period The exclusion criteria will include: presence of general danger signs or signs of severe falciparum malaria according to the definitions of WHO (Appendix 6), severe anaemia (Hb &lt; 5 g/dL) and mixed or monoinfection with species other the P. falciparum. Others will include severe malnutrition (defined as a child whose growth standard is below 3 zscore or symmetrical oedema involving at least one of the feet or a midupper arm circumference &lt; 110 mm. Patients with febrile conditions due to diseases other than malaria (e.g. measles, acute lower respiratory tract infection, severe diarrhoea with dehydration) or other known underlying chronic or severe diseases (e.g. cardiac, renal and hepatic diseases and HIV/AIDS) will be excluded. Furthermore, patients under regular medication, which may interfere with antimalarial pharmacokinetics and those with a history of hypersensitivity reactions or contraindications to the artemisininbased therapy, piperaquine or the alternative treatment, will not be included into the study</criteria>
