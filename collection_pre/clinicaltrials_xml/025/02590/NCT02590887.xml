	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the health effects of the 4 weeks intake of a drink manufactured from lupine protein hydrolysates in healthy volunteers. For that, blood markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, carbohydrate, lipid, protein and liver metabolism, together with general hematology and blood coagulation will be assessed at baseline time (day 0) and after (day +14, +28 and +42) drink ingestion.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective of the present study is to verify the hypothesis that the intake of the drink based on lupine peptides has beneficial effects on the immune and oxidative status. The secondary objectives are: - Assess the effect of the drink on biological parameters of the carbohydrate, lipid, protein and liver metabolism as well as hematology and blood coagulation. - Assess whether the new product is well tolerated. - Evaluate the effect of the drink on the general health of the volunteers through a general health test of 36 items. - Determine the degree of drink acceptability through the acceptability Likert test.</detailed_description>
