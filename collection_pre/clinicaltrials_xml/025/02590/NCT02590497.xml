	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies the correlation between the genetics and brain images of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma before surgery. The genetic characteristics of a tumor are an important way to predict how well it will respond to treatment. Imaging, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), takes detailed pictures of organs inside the body, and may also provide information that helps doctors predict how brain tumors will respond to treatment. If MRI can provide doctors with similar information about the tumor as the tumor's genes, it may be able to be used to predict tumor response in patients whose tumors cannot be reached by surgery or biopsy to get tissue samples.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation Between the Genetic and Neuroimaging Signatures in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Patients Before Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the correlation between the genetic and neuroimaging signature of glioblastoma. II. Determine the correlation between the neuroimaging signature of glioblastoma and prognosis. OUTLINE: Patients undergo MRI before and after gadolinium contrast administration, including 3-dimensional (3D) volumetric T1-weighted sequence, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence, diffusion weighted imaging, and perfusion MRI. Tissue samples are also analyzed for the tumor genetic profile.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who will be undergoing surgery for newlydiagnosed glioblastoma Subtotal, gross total or biopsy patients will be eligible Confirmation of pathology as glioblastoma Tissue analysis demonstrating pathology other than glioblastoma Patients with a contraindication to having MR imaging (e.g. pacemaker) or contrast MR administration (e.g. hypersensitivity to gadolinium or renal insufficiency above the institutional threshold for administration of contrast); patients with hypersensitivity to MR contrast may be able to participate if it has been established that premedication will mitigate the hypersensitivity reaction</criteria>
