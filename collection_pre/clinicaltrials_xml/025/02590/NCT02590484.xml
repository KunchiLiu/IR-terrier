	<brief_title>The Cervix as a Natural Tamponade in Postpartum Hemorrhage Caused by Placenta Previa and Placenta Previa Accreta</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Placenta previa and placenta accrete carry significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The maternal mortality in women with placenta accreta may reach as high as 7-10%. Several techniques have been described in the literature for controlling massive bleeding associated with placenta previa cesarean sections, including uterine packing with gauze, balloon tamponades, the B-Lynch suture, insertion of parallel vertical compression sutures, a square suturing technique and embolization or ligation of the uterine and internal iliac arteries, but there is a wide variation in the success rate of these maneuvers. In a case report, Dawlatly et al. (2007) described a simple technique of suturing an inverted lip of the cervix over the bleeding placental bed that was successful in controlling the bleeding, saving the patient's life, and preserving her uterus. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of this Dawlatly stitch as a natural tamponade for controlling postpartum haemorrhage in cases of placenta previa and/ or placenta previa accreta.</detailed_description>

When the ultrasound result was not conclusive for placenta accreta, MRI was performed. 3. All participating women desired to preserve their fertility 4. Patients with focal (partial) placenta previa accreta/ placenta previa. 1. placenta percreta. 2. diffuse placenta accreta or increta. 3. uncontrollable postpartum hemorrhage.</criteria>
