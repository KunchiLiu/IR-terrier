	<detailed_description>Physiological flexions and extensions in hip and knee joints cause dramatic deformity in stented femoral and superficial femoral arteries, both axially and angularly. As a result, stents get broken, restenosed or thrombosed. Some researchers report a 20 to 46% two-year incidence of broke stents in the superficial femoral artery, while restenosis and occlusion incidence vary from 21.8% to 53.3% . In addition to axial and angular stress, contributing to this untoward effect is musculofascial sheath which houses the artery in distal thigh. Investigators suggest that standard stenting of an artery be augmented by incision of the anterior musculofascial sheath (septum intermuscular vastoadductoria) that will increase the mobility of distal part of the femoral artery, which will decrease frequency breakage of stents. Review of the world literature yielded no peer instances of such improvement of stenting outcomes in the said arteries.</detailed_description>
