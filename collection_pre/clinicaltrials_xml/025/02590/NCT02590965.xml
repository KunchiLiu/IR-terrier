	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib plus best supportive care in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer who failed to second-line standard chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial of Fruquintinib in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 90 subjects will be randomized to Fruquintinib plus best supportive care or placebo plus best supportive care at a 2:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) gene status: mutant vs. wild type vs. unknown. All subjects will receive Fruquintinib/placebo for consecutive 3 weeks, followed by one-week rest. A treatment cycle consists of 4 weeks. Tumor assessment will be performed every 4 weeks in the first 3 cycles, and every 8 weeks since the 4th cycle, until disease progression. Further treatment and survival follow-up after progression will be recorded.</detailed_description>
