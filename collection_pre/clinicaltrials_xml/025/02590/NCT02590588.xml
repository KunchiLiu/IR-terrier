	<brief_summary>The investigators expect to enroll 15 participants with relapsed or refractory IgM-associated AL amyloidosis onto this Phase II clinical trial. Idelalisib will be self-administered orally at a dose of 100 mg twice daily (may be increased to 150 mg (one tablet) twice daily after 3 months at investigator discretion). Participants will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or decision to withdraw from the trial. Disease evaluations will be performed every three months until disease progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Idelalisib for Immunoglobulin M (IgM)-Associated Primary (AL) Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study includes the use of Idelalisib to treat previously treated patients with IgM-associated AL Amyloidosis at Boston Medical Center. Boston Medical Center is internationally recognized as a leader in amyloidosis research and patient care through the activities of the multidisciplinary Amyloid Center at Boston University. The problematic cell in most forms of AL amyloidosis shares similarities with multiple myeloma. However, in the small subset of AL Amyloidosis patients with an IgM paraprotein, the cells are more typically related to lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Because clonal CD20+ lymphoplasmacytic cells are usually responsible for IgM paraproteins, treatment paradigms based on Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) may be more appropriate than myeloma-based strategies. Idelalisib has been shown to be active and well tolerated in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma including chronic lymphocytic lymphoma, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with or without Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM). The side effect profile of idelalisib merges well with the known predisposition to toxicity of amyloidosis patient. The investigators expect to enroll 15 participants with IgM-associated AL amyloidosis onto this Phase II clinical trial. Idelalisib will be self-administered orally at a dose of 100 mg (1 tablet) twice daily (may be escalated to 150 mg (one tablet) twice daily after 3 months at investigator discretion). Participants will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or decision to withdraw from the trial. Disease evaluations will be performed every three months until disease progression.</detailed_description>
