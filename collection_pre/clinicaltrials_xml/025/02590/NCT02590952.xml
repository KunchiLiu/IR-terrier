	<brief_summary>Epitinib (HMPL-813) is a selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Epitinib has demonstrated strong inhibitory effects on multiple tumors with overexpressed EGFR or sensitive EGFR mutations in pre-clinical setting. This first-in-human study is conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity(DLT), safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of Epitinib.</brief_summary>
