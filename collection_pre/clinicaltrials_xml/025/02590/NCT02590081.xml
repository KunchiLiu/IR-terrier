	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous dextrose 5% solution compare with normal saline (standard care) in wash back procedure during haemodialysis in patients with end stage renal failure (ESRF) with respect to systolic blood pressure control over 3 months period. The primary objective is to establish efficacy of 5% dextrose solution compared with normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution) with respect to systolic blood pressure control in subjects with end stage renal failure (ESRF) on regular hemodialysis. Secondary objectives include monitoring the change in body weight, thirst level and body fluid volume.</brief_summary>
