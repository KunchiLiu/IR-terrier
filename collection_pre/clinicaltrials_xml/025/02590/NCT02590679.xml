	<brief_summary>Venus-P Valve (Venus Medtech, Shanghai, China) is the first self-expandable interventional Pulmonary Valve, which is composed of a Nitinol multilevel support frame with a tri-leaflet porcine pericardial tissue valve, and a 14-22 Fr delivery catheter. The purpose of the multi-center trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Venus-P Valve for percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) in patients pulmonary regurgitation and native right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) after surgical repair of RVOT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-center Trial of Percutaneous Pulmonary Valve Implantation With Venus-p</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical experience to date with transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement has been limited to two balloon expandable systems, namely the Melody Valve (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN) and the Sapien valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). Both valves have undergone clinical trials with good medium-term valve durability. Although both the Melody and the Sapien valves have been used in native outflow tracts with good success , limitations to the extended application of these valves have generally centered on the maximum diameter of the RVOT. Indeed in the majority of patients requiring pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), these balloon expandable systems are not large enough to maintain stable valve position within the dilated native RVOT.Therefore more recent efforts have concentrated on a self-expanding system to provide valve competence despite significant dilation of the native RVOT. Venus-P Valve (Venus Medtech, Shanghai, China) is the first self-expandable interventional Pulmonary Valve, which is composed of a Nitinol multilevel support frame with a tri-leaflet porcine pericardial tissue valve, and a 14-22 Fr delivery catheter. The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Venus-P Valve for PPVI in patients pulmonary regurgitation and native RVOT after surgical repair of RVOT.</detailed_description>
