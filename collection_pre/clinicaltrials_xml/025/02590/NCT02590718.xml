	<brief_summary>The study is carried out in a prospectively randomly controlled way. In the context of acknowledgement and understanding from parents, by comparing with traditional process (lying without the pillow and fasting water and food for four hours following lumbar puncture), an optimized postoperative management (lying without the pillow for half an hour following lumbar puncture) is randomly selected. All children will be evaluated by the FLACC (The face, legs, activity, cry, consolability behavioral tool) scale to assess the degree of pain after lumbar puncture. Any postoperative condition will be recorded and analyzed. A questionaire about bad memory during lumbar puncture for all parents and children will be investigated in order to establish an optimized lumbar puncture management process.</brief_summary>
