Several hysteroscopic systems to resect endometrial polyps are currently available. Among Others bipolar systems and microscissors or graspers, both of theme make part of routine clinical practice and are universally accepted. The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of bipolar resection energy polypectomy versus microscissors or graspers These procedures assume a lower cost and are associated with a lower surgical risk due to their realization without anesthesia . Hypothesis: Resection of polyps outpatient laser diode has a similar or superior to that of the bipolar electrode tolerability. The diode laser is a viable , quick , simple technique with a high percentage of resection and high degree of satisfaction of patients</brief_summary>
