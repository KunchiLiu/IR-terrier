	<brief_title>Early Cholecystectomy in Patients With Mild Gallstone Acute Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute pancreatitis is a prevalent disease, responsible for 220.000 hospital admissions per year in the USA. In Chile, during year 2012 there were 76.463 hospital admissions for this diagnosis, with a mean hospital stay of 11,8 days and 25 deaths per year associated with this disease (250 deaths from 2002 to 2012). The most frequent etiology of pancreatitis in Chile is gallstones, which can be present in 80% of the patients admitted for acute pancreatitis. This can be explained by the high prevalence of gallstones among these patients. Since Acosta and Ledesma demonstrated the association between gallstones and acute pancreatitis in 1974, cholecystectomy has been the most efficient treatment option to prevent recurrence that can reach even 30-40% in the first two weeks after the first episode. There is consensus in delaying the time of the cholecystectomy in patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis where mortality can be as high as 80% in patients presenting with severe cases. However, the vast majority of the patients will present with a mild pancreatitis requiring no more than basic medical support. In these patients, the role of surgery during the same hospital admission has been clearly demonstrated. There is no current consensus with respect to the safety of performing cholecystectomy in patients with mild pancreatitis within 48 to 72 hours after the hospital admission. There are few well-designed observational studies and only one randomized clinical trial, which has demonstrated a significant decrease in hospital stay (7 to 4 days), without increasing the rate of complications or mortality. According to some models of analysis and decision, this strategy could reduce costs associated with prolonged hospital stays and improve the quality of life of these patients without jeopardizing patient safety.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults are included between the age of 18 and 70 with mild gallstone pancreatitis. A subject is classified as having gallstone pancreatitis if they meet two or more of the following: (according to the Atlanta Consensus reviewed 2012) 1. abdominal pain consistent with acute pancreatitis (acute onset of a persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back); 2. serum lipase activity (or amylase activity) at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal; and 3. characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on contrastenhanced computed tomography and less commonly magnetic resonance imaging or transabdominal ultrasonography. The classification of Mild pancreatitis: (according to the Atlanta Consensus reviewed 2012) 1. absence of organ failure (absence of SIRS and Score Marshall &lt;2) 2. absence of local (pancreatic or peri pancreatic changes in computed tomography) or systemic complications (exacerbation of preexisting comorbidity) Imaging confirmation of gallstones or biliary sludge. Ethanol abuse Acute cholangitis (defined as a temperature &gt;38.6Â°C, right upper quadrant pain and tenderness, and significant hyperbilirubinemia) Moderate or Severe acute pancreatitis (according to the Atlanta Consensus reviewed 2012) Prior diagnosis of choledocholithiasis Prior gastric bypass surgery Prior open supraumbilical surgery Patient refusal to participate Severe preexisting medical comorbidities contraindicating cholecystectomy Pregnancy Incapacity to give informed consent (mental illness)</criteria>
