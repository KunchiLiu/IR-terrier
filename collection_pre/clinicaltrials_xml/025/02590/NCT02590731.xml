	<brief_summary>Introduction: Femoral neck fracture is a devastating injury with serious medical and social consequences. One third of these patients have some degree of impaired cognitive status. Despite of this, a high proportion of hip fracture trials exclude patients with cognitive impairment. The investigators aimed to evaluate whether moderate to severe cognitive impairment could predict walking ability, quality of life, functional outcome, reoperations and mortality in elderly patients treated with hemiarthroplasty. Methods: This cohort study included a consecutive series of 188 patients treated with hemiarthroplasty for an displaced femoral neck fracture. Patient were assessed for estimated preoperative and 1 year postoperatively with regard to walking abilities, cognitive status, quality of life with EQ-5D and hip function with Harris hip score.</brief_summary>
