	<brief_summary>Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare, but significant heart disease affecting young women in the puerperal period. Thus far, no specific treatment has been approved to treat this disease. PPCM has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild heart failure to severe cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock and death. A significant proportion of survivors have persistent chronic heart failure leading to disabling symptoms and decreased quality of life. Animal studies have suggested that prolactin is central to the development of PPCM. Prolactin has pro-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects that may promote PPCM. Bromocriptine, a central dopamine agonist known to decrease prolactin levels, might thwart its deleterious effects in women suffering from PPCM. Following this rationale, bromocriptine should improve myocardial function in women suffering from PPCM and thus, improve cardiovascular outcomes and healthcare outcomes.</brief_summary>
