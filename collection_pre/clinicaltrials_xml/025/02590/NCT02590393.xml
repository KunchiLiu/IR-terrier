	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn more about the nicotine and non-nicotine chemicals that are part of e-cigarettes and their effects on cigarette smokers by assessing smokers' experiences with different e-cigarettes using a battery of self-report, biochemical, and behavioral indices. This is not a smoking cessation study; smokers will not be asked to quit smoking, and e-cigarettes will not be used as a medical device or therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of Nicotine and Non-Nicotine Alkaloids in E-Cigarette Use and Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will shed light on the behavioral effects of: 1) varying e-cigarette nicotine content, known to be important in maintaining conventional cigarette use; and 2) varying e-cigarette non-nicotine tobacco alkaloid (NNTA) content, about which little is known regarding the role in product use or dependence. The study will assess the effects of e-cigarette nicotine and NNTA content on cigarette smokers who will be randomized to conditions that manipulate the nicotine and NNTA content of e-cigarettes. The study will include N = 375 adult smokers of menthol or non-menthol cigarettes with randomization of enrolled participants to one of three groups (125/group). Group 1: Nicotine + NNTAs. (Standard Nicotine Standard NNTA group) E-cigarette cartridges will contain tobacco extract with nicotine + NNTA amounts in the range of typical commercial cigarettes, with a ratio of NNTA:nicotine that is also typical of commercial cigarettes. Group 2: Nicotine control (Standard Nicotine Low NNTA group). E-cigarette cartridges will contain the same concentration of nicotine, but 1/10th of NNTAs as in Group 1. This group will control for nicotine content and allow for evaluation of the roll of various levels of NNTAs in e-cigarette use. Group 3: Vehicle control (Low Nicotine, Low NNTA Group). E-cigarette cartridges will contain less than 1/10 of the nicotine in the other two groups, and NNTA levels will be correspondingly low. This group will control for changes in cigarette consumption that may occur due to study participation or to the non-nicotine behavioral/sensory factors entailed in e-cigarette use, which could influence cigarette consumption.</detailed_description>
