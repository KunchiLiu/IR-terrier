	<brief_summary>Pelvic ring fractures in the elderly are associated with high morbidity during standard conservative treatment due to immobility. Furthermore the risk of long term dependence even after the fracture has united is high. In analogy to the treatment of hip fractures in a similar patient population, patients might benefit from surgical treatment due to a reduction in pain and early mobilization.</brief_summary>
