	<brief_title>Feasibility of Short Breast MRI (SBMRI) for Screening Patients at High Risk for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If you agree to take part in this study, you will have the short breast MRI scan (the scan for research purposes) with contrast on a different day than your scheduled routine MRI screening scan with contrast. You will have your routine scan the first day and the research scan at least 1 day after. The research scan will take about 10 minutes to complete. After your short breast MRI scan is completed, you will complete a questionnaire about your comfort level and experience of the research scan. It should take about 10 minutes to complete the questionnaire. This is an investigational study. The short breast MRI is considered investigational. Up to 200 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
