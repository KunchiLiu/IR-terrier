	<brief_summary>Background: When children have severe irritability and temper outbursts, they can be so cranky or angry that it leads to problems at home, in school, and with friends. This is called Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) and there have been no psychological treatments developed specifically for children with this problem. Researchers think two forms of therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Interpretation Bias Training (IBT), might help children with DMDD. Objective: To test two whether IBT and CBT can decrease severe irritability in children and youth. Eligibility: Children 8-17 years old with DMDD. Their symptoms must have started before age 10. Design: Participants will be screened with a review of their symptoms. Parents and participants will answer questions. Participants can do only one or both of these treatments if they wish. Those who wish to do both will start with IBT. Participants who do CBT will have 12-16 weekly meetings of research talk therapy. A parent will participate in part of the sessions. Participants will talk about what makes them irritable and how it affects them. They may be put in situations that might make them annoyed or irritable. Participants will rate how intense their irritability is. Parents and participants will complete rating scales, questionnaires, and interviews. Participants will do practice activities at home. Participants doing IBT will have up to 14 sessions over 10 weeks. Participants will view 15 faces, one at a time, on a computer. They will choose if the face looks happy or angry on a computer. Sometimes the computer gives feedback. Participants will complete some sessions at the NIH and some at home. Participants and parents answer questions about their progress.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Psychological Treatments for Youth With Severe Irritability.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: This purpose of this protocol is to further the development of two potential nonpharmacologic treatments for youths with chronic, severe and impairing irritability. The first potential treatment is Interpretation Bias Training (IBT), a computer-based training designed to shift emotional judgments of ambiguous faces away from angry, and toward happy, judgments. The first component of this protocol includes a randomized, trial of active IBT in youth with severe irritability. The second potential treatment is a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting severe irritability; a goal of this protocol is to develop and pilot the use of a CBT designed to treat severe irritability. Specifically, for CBT, this protocol includes work designed to develop treatment procedures; train clinicians on the methods; and collect pilot data that could provide justification for a randomized controlled trial of CBT for irritability. Objective 1a: Assess the efficacy of Interpretation Bias Training (IBT) in youths with severe irritability, operationalized as those meeting criteria for DSM-5 Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). To accomplish this objective, we will conduct a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of active Interpretation Bias Training in 40 youths with DMDD. Subjects will be randomized to receive four IBT training sessions (active vs. placebo, in a double-blind design) over four days followed by weekly mood ratings for two weeks. Primary outcome measures in this trial will assess changes in irritability using the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI: clinician-rated, parent-rated, and child-rated) and Clinical Global Impressions-improvement (CGI-I). After completing the RCT, all participants who continue to show irritability as measured by a Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) rating of 3 or greater, will receive four open, active IBT sessions, delivered on the same schedule as in the RCT and using the same primary outcome measures. Objective 1b: Pilot the efficacy of weekly booster additional IBT sessions (IBT extension), beyond those in Objective 1a, to extend or augment the impact of IBT on irritability in youths with DMDD. To accomplish this objective, we will extend IBT up to three times a week, for up to eight weeks for individuals who continue to show symptoms of irritability. Specifically, anyone who, after completing Open Active IBT, continues to show clinical impairment due to irritability, as measured by a Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) rating of 3 or greater, will be eligible to continue with Active IBT training. Primary outcome measures for the IBT extension will assess changes in irritability using the ARI (clinicianrated, parent-rated, and child-rated) and CGI-I. Objective 2: Develop and pilot the use of a manualized CBT for severe irritability in youth with DMDD. To accomplish this objective, we will talk with children and their parents (e.g., elicit hierarchies of irritability inducing events); develop methods and procedures focusing on exposure exercises (e.g., in-vivo, role-play, imaginal); compile a manual for the new CBT; train clinicians on use of the procedures in the manual; and pilot the new CBT as an open treatment in N=60 DMDD youth. Primary outcome measures for CBT will assess changes in irritability using the ARI (clinician-rated, parent-rated, and child-rated) and CGI-I. Secondary Objective 1a and 1b: Assess the effect of IBT on clinical measures of depression, anxiety, and functional impairment. Secondary Objective 2: Assess the effect of the CBT for irritability on clinical measures of depression, anxiety, and functional impairment. Subjects can participate in one or both of these potential treatments. If they opt to do both, IBT will occur first and there will be a four-week wash-out period before starting pilot work with CBT. Study population: The study is taking place at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). All outpatients, ages 8-17, enrolled in NIMH-DIRP Protocol 02-M-0021, who are in stable treatment in the community will be invited to participate in this study. Design: The first part of the protocol will involve conducting a randomized controlled trial of IBT in 40 youths who meet criteria for DMDD. The goal of this novel, potential treatment is to decrease the severity of the child s irritability. Subjects will also be offered up to eight weeks of Extension of Open Active IBT sessions. The second part of the protocol will involve developing a CBT targeting severe irritability. After developing the CBT treatment and training staff to conduct it, we will pilot it in 60 children. If this pilot study has promising results, we will apply to the IRB for permission to conduct a randomized trial of this psychotherapy. Subjects can elect to participate in the IBT randomized controlled trial and extension sessions only, CBT treatment development and piloting only, or both. If subjects elect to participate in both, they will complete the IBT arm first, followed by the CBT arm, with a one-month wash-out period in between. Outcome measures: The main outcome measures will assess changes in irritability using the ARI (clinician-rated, parent-rated, and child-rated) and CGI-I. Secondary measures include parent and self-report measures of depression, anxiety, anger, social status, and aggression, as well as clinician ratings of depression, anxiety, and impairment. Data for ecological momentary assessments (EMA) will be collected using secure technology, with procedures approved by the NIMH ISSO; subjects and their caregivers will be asked a set of 15 questions relating to recent experiences and emotions.</detailed_description>
