	<brief_summary>Using European data from patients included in the Named Patient Program (NPP) and from the early post-marketing authorization period, the present study aims to describe patient characteristics and to describe the effectiveness of Daclatasvir (DCV)-based regimens in Europe. This will be a retrospective cohort study of patients who received treatment with a DCV-based regimen in the following context: - Patients enrolled within the European NPP in one of the following countries Austria, Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom; or - In those countries where DCV is commercially available (ie, Sweden, Germany, United Kingdom), patients who received DCV during the early post-marketing authorization period The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of effectiveness of DCV-based regimens in a population that differs from population in the clinical trials, and therefore will provide additional valuable information to inform clinical practice. This study intends to estimate primarily the effectiveness of DCV-based regimens as measured by the sustained virologic response at post treatment follow-up visit week 12 (SVR12). As well as estimate the effectiveness of DCV-based regimens as measured by SVR12 after the end of Hepatitis C virus (HCV). This study intends also to describe as secondary objectives the characteristics (ie, demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment patterns of patients starting a new DCV-based regimens) of patients receiving DCV as well as the effectiveness of DCV-based regimens as measured by: - On-treatment virological response at post treatment follow-up visit Week 4; and - Virological response at the end of treatment (EOT); and - The sustained viral response at post treatment follow-up visit Week 4 (SVR4) and post treatment follow-up visit Week 24 (SVR24); and - The occurrence of virological failure (on-treatment and relapse). An exploratory objective will be to assess the concordance between SVR4 and SVR12 among the overall population treated with DCV.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients participating in the DCV NPP from 7 European countries (Austria, Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, and UK). The following patients were eligible to participate in the NPP The patient have a serious or lifethreatening condition that is impacting life expectancy within 12 months. There are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatments options exist for the patient, and/or currently available treatment options have been exhausted. The patient was ineligible to participate in a clinical trial, or there was no ongoing clinical trial in the patientÂ´s country of residence to treat his/her HCVinfection. In countries where DCV is commercially available at time of study initiation(Sweden, UK, and Germany), patients treated with DCV during the early postmarketing authorization period. Patients initiating any DCVbased regimen during the inclusion periods. Recorded in one of the HCV data sources used for the study. Patients included in the DCV Compassionate use program (CUP) (AI444237 Protocol) open in 6 European countries (Germany, Austria, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway and UK) after Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) opinion for the DCV CUP in Europe will be excluded since these patients will be analyzed as part of separate datasets.</criteria>
