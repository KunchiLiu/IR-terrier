	<brief_title>An Investigation of a New Laryngeal Mask Airway LMA Protector</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This new disposable silicone airway device provides access and functional separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts. The airway tube is elliptical in cross section ending at the laryngeal opening. The device contains 2 drainage channels (male and female port) proximally that continues into a common distal opening posterior to the distal airway cuff bowl. The female port allows a gastric tube to be passed into the stomach, whilst a suction tube may be attached to the male suction port offering removal of gastric fluid around the upper oesophagus sphincter.</detailed_description>
