	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is the evaluation of system accuracy following ISO 15197:2013 (E), clause 6.3 in which accuracy requirements and applicable test procedures for blood glucose monitoring systems intended for self-monitoring of blood glucose by patients are stipulated. In this study, system accuracy evaluation will be performed with CE-marked BGMS (BGMS = Blood Glucose Monitoring System) common among insulin pump users - Accu-Chek Aviva Nano and Accu-Chek Performa Nano (Roche Diagnostics), FreeStyle Lite (Abbott Diabetes Care), OneTouch Verio IQ (LifeScan) Contour Next Link 2.4 (Bayer Healthcare Diabetes Care) and Accu-Chek Mobile with three different reagent system lots for each BGMS. The study will be performed in 2 parts. Each part will comprise testing of 3 BGMS.</brief_summary>
