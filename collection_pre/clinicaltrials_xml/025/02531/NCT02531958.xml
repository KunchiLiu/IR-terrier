	<brief_summary>Recently, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has recommended removal of the 300mg/day limit on dietary cholesterol intake due to a lack of evidence supporting a connection between cholesterol intake and increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Previous work has shown that daily intake of eggs actually favorably alters many parameters associated with CVD risk. Conversely, emerging research suggests that choline, a nutrient in eggs, may be converted into trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) by the intestinal microbiota. TMAO is thought to increase the risk for CVD. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine a threshold of daily egg intake at which the risk for CVD is not negatively impacted in a young, healthy population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to establish a threshold of egg intake at which CVD risk is not negatively altered in young, healthy individuals. Participants (age 18-30, healthy lipid profile) will undergo a 2-week washout period followed by daily intake of 1, 2, and 3 eggs per day for 4 weeks each. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and following each 4-week dietary period. Samples will be analyzed to determine the impact of daily intake of increasing numbers of eggs on blood lipids, TMAO, biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, and expression of cholesterol-related genes.</detailed_description>
