	<brief_summary>Background: - The blood-brain barrier separates the brain from the rest of the body. Epilepsy is a neurological disease that causes seizures. It can affect this barrier. Researchers think a contrast agent called mangafodipir might be better able to show areas of the brain that epilepsy affects. Objective: - To see if mangafodipir is well tolerated and safe. To see if it can show, on an MRI, areas of the brain that epilepsy affects. Eligibility: - People ages 18-60 who: - Have epilepsy not controlled by drugs - Are enrolled in protocol 01-N-0139 - Healthy volunteers Design: - Participants will be screened with: - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood and urine tests - Participants will have up to 6 visits in 1 3 months. Those with epilepsy will have an inpatient stay lasting 2 10 days. Visits may include: - Video-EEG monitoring for participants with epilepsy (not for healthy volunteers) - An IV catheter put in place: a needle guides a thin plastic tube into an arm vein. - Getting mangafodipir through the IV. - 5 MRI scans over a 10-day period: a magnetic field and radio waves take pictures of the brain. Participants lie on a table that slides into a metal cylinder. They are in the cylinder for 45 90 minutes, lying still for up to 10 minutes at a time. The scanner makes loud knocking sounds. Participants will get earplugs. - A final MRI at least 2 weeks after receiving mangafodipir. Gadolinium is given through an IV catheter.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of Blood-Brain-Barrier Breakdown Using Manganese Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Drug-Resistant Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: The primary goals of this pilot study is to determine if (1) administration of mangafodipir is well tolerated by healthy volunteers and patients with epilepsy and if (2) peri-ictal administration will allow focal entry of mangafodipir through the blood-brain-barrier and manganese enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) visualization of seizure foci. Secondary objectives are further exploration of MEMRI properties in patients with epilepsy and comparison with healthy volunteers. Study population: 16 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, and up to 16 healthy controls. Design: Screening of enrolled participants will include a medical history, physical exam, blood and urine laboratory testing. Patients and healthy volunteers will be imaged interictally with a gadolinium enhanced MRI session. For patients, the administration of mangafodipir will be done as an inpatient during long-term video EEG recording, to ensure administration in the peri-ictal period. Patients and controls will receive a baseline MRI scan, iv mangafodipir injection and will then be serially scanned with non-contrast MRI scans. Outcome measures: The primary outcomes are (1) clinical safety parameters of mangafodipir administration, and (2) the difference between T1-weighted signal intensity in the brain measured after mangafodipir administration in the seizure onset zone identified by standard clinical, EEG, and imaging studies, and the homologous contralateral region.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: HEALTHY VOLUNTEER: Age 1860 Able to give written informed consent directly. PATIENTS: Age 1860. Able to give written informed consent directly. Drug resistant epilepsy participants will be defined as having clinically documented seizures with consistent EEG evidence as defined by the 1981 International Classification of Epileptic Seizures, refractory to standard antiseizure treatment for at least one year prior to enrolling in this study and with an average of at least one seizure per month. This criterion will be established by preliminary screening in the NINDS Clinical Epilepsy Section outpatient clinic under protocol 01N0139, and if necessary, inpatient video EEG monitoring. Seizure focus localization will be determined by standard clinical, neurophysiologic, and imaging studies. Prior or concurrent enrollment in 01N0139 is required. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: HEALTHY VOLUNTEER: No current or history of neurological disease, including epilepsy and multiple sclerosis Same exclusion criteria as patients PATIENTS: General exclusions: A history of drug or alcohol abuse/dependence History of brain disease other than epilepsy. Known cause for seizures, other than mesial focal sclerosis, such as tumor or infection. Positive test for HIV. History of postictal psychosis or postictal aggression Brain abnormality such as a brain tumor, stroke, brain damage from head trauma or blood vessel abnormalities, on an MRI scan. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Planning to get pregnant in the next 2 months Claustrophobia to a degree that the subject would feel uncomfortable in the MRI machine. Cannot lie on their back for at least two hours. Risk for MRI scan, (e.g., any nonorganic implant or other device such as a cardiac pacemaker or infusion pump or other metallic implants, objects or body piercings that cannot be removed, or history of being a welder or metal worker due to small metal fragments in the eye) history of clinically significant medical disorders other than epilepsy, such as liver or kidney disease, that could potentially increase the risk of CNS damage due to manganese exposure major lab abnormality, including clinically significant abnormal range values in AST, ALT, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, BUN, creatinine previous presumed occupational exposure to manganese (i.e., having worked in a mine, foundry, smelter, dry cell battery manufacturing facility, or agriculture) allergy to manganese ongoing treatment with calciumchannel blocker irondeficiency anemia Gadolinium enhanced MRI component specific exclusions: Estimated GFR &gt; 60, tested within 1 week of scan allergy to gadolinium</criteria>
