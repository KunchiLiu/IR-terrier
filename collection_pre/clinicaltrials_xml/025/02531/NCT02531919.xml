	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I trial studies the safety of long-term use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with cancer. Sodium bicarbonate may neutralize tumor acidity and as a result may inhibit the spread of the tumor to other parts of the body (metastases) and improve survival.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if the dose concentration of 0.5 g/kg/day sodium bicarbonate is feasible and well tolerated as measured by the proportion of subjects with first evidence of adherence failure. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if the dose concentration of 0.5 g/kg/day sodium bicarbonate is safe for long term consumption (90 days) as measured by blood pressure, resting pulse rate, and basic metabolic panels to assess metabolic alkalosis. OUTLINE: PHASE I (RUN-IN/ADJUSTMENT): Patients receive sodium bicarbonate orally (PO) dissolved in water thrice daily (TID) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-10. The dose may be adjusted as necessary. PHASE II (LONG TERM): Patients continue to receive sodium bicarbonate PO TID or BID for a total of 90 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
