	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of CARESTREAM Dual Energy and Digital Tomosynthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The acquisition system will consist of using site equipment including the CARESTREAM DRX-Evolution x-ray system, and the predicate CARESTREAM DRX Plus detector and the investigational DE-DT application. DE Study Design Thirty to forty (30-40) patients will receive a DR standard of care chest exam using the DRX Plus detector and a DE exam. Each DE patient exam includes high energy and low energy image exposures using the investigational device. These images are used by the DE console software to generate additional DE images (e.g. bone and soft tissue). DT Study Design Fifteen to twenty (15-20) patients will receive a DR standard of care chest exam using the DRX Plus detector, and a DT exam. Each DT patient exam includes a scout image (chest PA) and a DT scan using the investigational DT SW. The DT scan is used by the DT console software to generate tomographic images. 11 phantoms of various anatomy will be imaged with linear tomography (LT) as predicate and DT for investigational.</detailed_description>
