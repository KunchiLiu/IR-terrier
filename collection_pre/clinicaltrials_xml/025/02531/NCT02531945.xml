	<brief_summary>The main objective of the study is to investigate the correlation between the measurement of the Cobb angle (angle of scoliosis) by conventional radiography and angle measured by surface topography. The device used in this research to the topography examination is three-dimensional morphometry device of AXS Medical society : the BIOMOD L.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Surface Topography for Monitoring Scoliosis Patients Aged 10-13 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For usual follow-up visit, patients will have a x-ray examination of the spine and the surface topography. The measurement of the angle of scoliosis is achieved by two independent operators for both methods. Patients then have a follow-up visit at 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
