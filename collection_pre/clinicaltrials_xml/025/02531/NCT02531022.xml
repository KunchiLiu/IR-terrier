	<brief_summary>This study will use a randomized, controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a home-based physical activity program using wearable devices and financial incentives. All participants in will establish a baseline step count during the first two weeks and then proceed to a 16-week intervention period and 8-week follow-up period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Increasing Physical Activity After Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Among patients that survive an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been demonstrated to effectively reduce risk of re-infarction, cardiac mortality, and all-cause mortality. However, despite cardiac rehabilitation being a Class I (standard of care) recommendation in multiple American Heart Association acute myocardial infarction guidelines, more than 80% of eligible patients do not receive appropriate cardiac rehabilitation and much of this is due to challenges in access to these programs. Recent innovations in technology allow us to passively monitor an individual's physical activity using wearable devices. Incentives designed using insights from behavioral economics have been demonstrated to motivate device engagement and behavior change. A remotely-monitored cardiac rehabilitation program could improve access for many individuals and potentially be more cost-effective because it is less resource- and personnel-intensive. The objective of this study is to use a randomized, controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a home-based physical activity program using wearable devices and financial incentives.</detailed_description>
