	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to use a new imaging drug called 11C-choline that is used with a PET/CT scan to see prostate cancer when it cannot be seen well on other scans, such as bone scans, CT or MRI.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must have biopsyproven adenocarcinoma of the prostate initially treated with curative intent (surgery and radiation therapy are most common treatments but other treatments are also eligible). Biochemical recurrence defined as any of the following: 1. PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL in at least two sequential tests for patients treated with surgery. 2. PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL above the post therapy nadir for patients treated with radiation therapy, brachytherapy or cryotherapy. 3. PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml above the most recent therapy nadir for patients who have received additional treatment in the recurrent setting Patient must have undergone standardofcare restaging that does not clearly identify site(s) of active disease, or such prior studies must show equivocal findings for which further workup is considered necessary to make clinical decision. Standard staging examinations may include one or more of the following: CT or MRI, bone imaging (either Tc99m bisphosphonate scintigraphy MDP or F18 sodium fluoride PET), FDG PET, or In111 capromab pendetide scintigraphy no older than 3 months of consent date. Age ≥ 18 years. Patient must be able to tolerate PET/CT imaging. Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document. Patient must not have claustrophobia that would preclude PET/CT imaging or other contraindications to CT imaging.</criteria>
