	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of JNJ-56021927 (Apalutamide) in High-risk Prostate Cancer Subjects Receiving Primary Radiation Therapy: ATLAS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of apalutamide plus GnRH agonist compared with GnRH agonist among participants with high-risk, localized or locally advanced prostate cancer receiving primary radiation therapy (RT). The study will include a Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, a Posttreatment Phase, and a Long-term Follow-up Phase. Participants will either receive either apalutamide (experimental) or bicalutamide 50 milligram (mg) capsule plus placebo as control group. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt;= 18 years Indicated and planned to receive primary radiation therapy for prostate cancer Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of an intact prostate, and 1 of the following at diagnosis: 1) Gleason score &gt;=8 and &gt;=cT2c, 2) Gleason score &gt;=7, PSA &gt;=20 nanogram per milliliters (ng/mL), and &gt;=cT2c Charlson index (CCI) &lt;=3 An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) grade of 0 or 1 Adequate organ function: (1) aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), within normal limits (WNL), (2) serum creatinine less than (&lt;) 1.5 milligram/deciliter (mg/dL) (&lt;133 micromoles/Liter [mcmol/L]), (3) platelets greater than or equal to (&gt;=)140,000/microLiter (mcL), independent of transfusion and/or growth factors within 3 months prior to randomization, (4) Hemoglobin &gt;= 12.0 gram/deciliter (g/dL) (7.4 millimloes [mmol], independent of transfusion and/or growth factors within 3 months prior to randomization Participants who are sexually active (even men with vasectomies) and willing to use a condom and agree not to donate sperm during the trial Signed, written, informed consent Be able to swallow whole study drug tablets Presence of distant metastasis, (clinical stage M1). Isolated pelvic nodal disease below the iliac bifurcation (clinical stage N1) is not an exclusion. Diagnosis of distant metastasis (clinical M stage; M0 versus M1a, M1b, M1c) and pelvic nodal disease (clinical N stage; N1 versus N0) will be assessed by central radiological review. Patients are considered eligible only if the central radiological review confirms clinical stage M0. Prior treatment with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue or antiandrogen or both for &gt;3 months prior to randomization Bilateral orchiectomy History of pelvic radiation Prior systemic (example [e.g.], chemotherapy) or local (e.g. radical prostatectomy, cryotherapy) treatment for prostate cancer History of seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure (including, but not limited to prior stroke, transient ischemic attack or loss of consciousness &lt;= 1 year prior to randomization; brain arteriovenous malformation; or intracranial masses such as schwannomas and meningiomas that are causing edema or mass effect) Prior treatment with enzalutamide, abiraterone acetate, orteronel, galeterone, ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide, estrogens, megestrol acetate, and progestational agents (including cyproterone acetate) for prostate cancer Prior treatment with radiopharmaceutical agents (e.g., strontium89) or immunotherapy (e.g., sipuleucelT) for prostate cancer Prior treatment with systemic glucocorticoids â‰¤4 weeks prior to randomization or is expected to require longterm use of corticosteroids during the study Use of 5alpha reductase inhibitors (e.g., dutasteride, finasteride) &lt;=4 weeks prior to randomization Use of any investigational agent &lt;=4 weeks prior to randomization Current chronic use of opioid analgesics for &gt;=3 weeks for oral or &gt;7 days for nonoral formulations Major surgery &lt;=4 weeks prior to randomization Current or prior treatment with antiepileptic medications for the treatment of seizures Gastrointestinal conditions affecting absorption Known or suspected contraindications or hypersensitivity to apalutamide, bicalutamide or GnRH agonists or any of the components of the formulations Any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the subject</criteria>
