	<brief_summary>Paradoxical fetal and maternal results of studies have led to inconsistent use of antihypertensive drugs or no treatment at all in mild to moderate gestational hypertension in the Netherlands. However, none of the studies have taken the individual maternal circulatory state or the contemplated blood pressure response into account. Hypertension may be accompanied by high (hyperdynamic vasodilated profile), normal (normodynamic profile) of low (hypodynamic vasoconstrictive profile) cardiac output, and preeclampsia is not restricted to one circulatory profile. Therefore antihypertensive drugs should be viewed upon as correctors of the hemodynamic state rather than solely reducers of blood pressure. Without taking the maternal hemodynamic profile and condition into account, generic antihypertensive treatment can be expected to result in disappointing, inadequate and paradoxical results. The investigators hypothesize that in mild to moderate hypertension, personalized hemodynamically guided antihypertensive therapy (with target systolic and diastolic blood pressure &lt;130/80mmHg), prevents the progression to severe hypertension and/or preeclampsia compared to no treatment, without the alleged side-effects.</brief_summary>
