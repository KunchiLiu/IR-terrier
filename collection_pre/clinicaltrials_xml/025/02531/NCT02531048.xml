	<brief_summary>Different neurological damage may alter the pain conduction systems centrally (spinothalamic pathway) or peripherally (small caliber sensory fibers A delta and C). The laser thermal stimulation selectively stimulates the pain pathways and generates nociceptive signals conveyed to the cortex. Registering these cortical responses constitute the technical laser nociceptive evoked potentials. If these tests are routinely used, their interpretation must remain cautious especially in the elderly.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Different neurological damage may alter the pain conduction systems centrally (spinothalamic pathway) or peripherally (small caliber sensory fibers A delta and C). The laser thermal stimulation selectively stimulates the pain pathways and generates nociceptive signals conveyed to the cortex. Registering these cortical responses constitute the technical laser nociceptive evoked potentials. If these tests are routinely used, their interpretation must remain cautious especially in the elderly. Normal values that are available have been obtained in young subjects. However, various studies have shown that the integration of nociceptive messages depended on age. The aim of this study was to establish normal values of nociceptive evoked potentials for each age group of 18 to 75 years.</detailed_description>
