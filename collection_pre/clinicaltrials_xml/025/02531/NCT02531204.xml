	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the bioequivalence between ASP1585 granules and ASP1585 capsules after repeated oral administration of ASP1585 granules or ASP1585 capsules under open-label conditions in non-elderly healthy male subjects. In addition, the safety of these products is assessed.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Body weight (at screening) ≥ 50.0 kg and &lt; 80.0 kg Body mass index (BMI) (at screening) ≥ 17.6 kg/m2 and &lt; 26.4 kg/m2 Healthy, as judged by the investigator/subinvestigator based on medical history and the results of physical examination (subjective symptoms and objective findings) and all tests obtained at screening and during the period from hospital admission to immediately before study medication in 1st period. Received or scheduled to receive any investigational drugs in other clinical trials, postmarketing studies, or clinical studies within 120 days before the screening or during the period from the screening to 1st hospitalization. Donated or scheduled to donate 400 mL of whole blood within 90 days before the screening or during the period from the screening to 1st hospitalization, 200 mL of whole blood within 30 days before the screening or during the period from the screening to 1st hospitalization, or blood components within 14 days before the screening or during the period from the screening to 1st hospitalization. Any deviation of the laboratory tests at screening or 1st hospitalization. A deviation from the normal range of blood pressure, pulse rate, or body temperature at screening or 1st hospitalization Sitting blood pressure: Systolic blood pressure: ≥90 mmHg, ≤140 mmHg; Diastolic blood pressure: ≥40 mmHg, ≤90 mmHg Sitting pulse rate; ≥40 bpm, ≤99 bpm Axillary body temperature; ≥35.0°C, ≤37.0°C History of drug allergies Upper gastrointestinal disease (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and stomachache) within 7 days before 1st hospitalization Concurrent or previous hepatic disease (e.g., viral hepatitis, druginduced liver injury, and hepatic impairment) Concurrent or previous heart disease (e.g., congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, and arrhythmia requiring treatment) Concurrent or previous GI disease (e.g., ileus paralytic, gastric atony, intestinal atony, colitis ulcerative, peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux esophagitis; except for a history of appendicitis). Concurrent or previous renal disease (e.g., acute renal failure, glomerulonephritis, and interstitial nephritis) Concurrent or previous renal disease (e.g., acute renal failure, glomerulonephritis, and interstitial nephritis) Concurrent or previous cerebrovascular disorder (e.g., cerebral infarction) Previous use of bixalomer Excessive smoking or drinking habit</criteria>
