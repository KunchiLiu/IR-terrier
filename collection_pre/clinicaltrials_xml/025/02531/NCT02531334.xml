	<brief_title>Effects of TA-65, a Telomerase Activator on Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Short telomeres are strongly linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, indications where tissue aging and senescence play significant roles. Shorter leukocyte telomere length has been linked to impaired glucose tolerance, Type 2 Diabetes, and coronary heart disease. Telomere length and telomerase activity have been shown to be significantly lower in CAD patients. Telomere length may play an important role in predicting cardiovascular disease and diabetes. TA-65 may not only ameliorate the symptoms associated with these disease states, but be a preventive measure as well. In this study, the researchers will investigate whether telomerase activator (TA)-65 can also improve the metabolic dysregulations associated with metabolic syndrome including oxidative stress, inflammation, high blood pressure and dyslipidemias.</detailed_description>
