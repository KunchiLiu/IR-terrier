	<brief_summary>In this study, healthy human subjects (18-35 yrs) are be randomised to consume 1200 mg ibuprofen or 75 mg acetylsalicylic acid daily during a training period of 8 weeks. During these weeks, subjects perform 2-3 supervised strength training sessions (knee extensions). Before and after training, muscle volume is measured by MRI, and muscle strength is assessed by isokinetic and isoinertial ergometers. Muscle biopsies are obtained from m. vastus lateralis to study gene and protein expression of markers regulating muscle protein turnover and prostaglandin synthesis.</brief_summary>
