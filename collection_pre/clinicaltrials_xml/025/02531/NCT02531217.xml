	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, PK, and Activity of ATYR1940 in Patients With Muscular Dystrophy - Study Extension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability profile of ATYR1940 in the treatment of adult patients with molecularly defined genetic muscular dystrophies, and to additionally explore the pharmacokinetics and biologic activity of ATYR1940 in adult patients with molecularly defined genetic muscular dystrophies. Patients who successfully complete a parent study (NCT02239224) are eligible for enrollment into this long-term extension study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient has an established, geneticallyconfirmed, diagnosis of facioscapulohumeral dystrophy with clinical findings meeting existing criteria Patient is a male or female aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive. Patients who previously participated in Study ATYR1940C002 and who meet the entry criteria above for the current study will be eligible for enrollment. Patient is currently receiving treatment with an immunomodulatory agent or has a history of such treatment, including targeted biological therapies (e.g., etanercept, omalizumab) within the 3 months before Baseline; corticosteroids within 4 weeks before Baseline; or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs) within 2 weeks before Baseline. Patient has a severe retinopathy. Patient has a history of obstructive or restrictive lung disease (including interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, or asthma), or evidence for interstitial lung disease on Screening chest radiograph. Patient has evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematological, metabolic, dermatological, or gastrointestinal disease, or has a condition that requires immediate surgical intervention or other treatment or may not allow safe participation. Patient has used any investigational product or device (other than a mobility assistance device) within 30 days before Baseline. If female and of childbearing potential (premenopausal and not surgically sterile), patient has a positive pregnancy test at Screening or is unwilling to use contraception from the time of Screening through the 1month Followup visit. Acceptable methods of birth control include abstinence, barrier methods, hormones, or intrauterine device. If male, patient is unwilling to use a condom plus spermicide during sexual intercourse from the time of Screening through the 1 month Followup visit.</criteria>
