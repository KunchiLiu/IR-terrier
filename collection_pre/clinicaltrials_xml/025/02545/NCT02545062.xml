	<brief_summary>T2D and cognitive impairment are two of the most common chronic condition found in persons 60 years and older. Diabetes type 2 increases with age and studies suggest that the diabetes is one of the risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. Although there is much recent research showing that diabetics at every age have more cognitive impairment and dementia than non-diabetics, relatively little attention has been paid to the implications of this complication in the management of T2D in terms of screening, prevention, education and treatment adherence. There are now guidelines for periodic evaluation of patients with diabetes as early detection of complications of the disease, but so far there are no similar assessment and monitoring of cognitive function. In this study the investigators examine cognitive function in young diabetic patients (from 20 to 55) using the MoCa test, that allows detection of mild cognitive impairment, and may be carried out during a visit, an annual advisory diabetes clinic.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Patients on a routine visit to the diabetes clinic, who meet the inclusion criteria, will be recruited for the test. They will be given an explanation of the study and the questionnaire by the principal investigator. 2. Sign a consent form. 3. Performance and execution of MOCA test: - Fingerstick blood glucose for pre-cognitive testing performed (to avoid testing any participant with a serum glucose &lt; 70 mg/dl); - In the presence of hypoglycemia, the participant should be given a snack and begin the test only after the glucose level rises. Alternatively delay executing the Test 4. Details from the patient's file are registered, such as: duration of the disease, family history, presence of macro and micro vascular complications, lifestyle, years of education, and the results of relevant laboratory accuracy. 5. For each patient a medical file is opened containing the initials and serial number of his research. All results are then encoded and analyzed anonymously</detailed_description>
