	<brief_title>Once-a-day Tacrolimus Conversion Study: The OneTAC Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tacrolimus has been extensively studied in solid organ transplantation. It is FDA approved for heart transplant recipients as a twice a day formulation (Prograf brand name, as well as generic formulations). A modified release formulation is available and FDA approved for kidney transplant recipients (Astagraf, Astellas Pharmaceutical), but is not approved for heart transplant patients. In this study the investigators will study 100 patients who are stable on twice a day Tacrolimus and convert these subjects to once a day modified release Tacrolimus. The investigators will observe these patients for 1 year following the switch and assess safety and efficacy in a heart transplant population.</detailed_description>
