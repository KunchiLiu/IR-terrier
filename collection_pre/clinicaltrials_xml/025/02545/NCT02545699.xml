	<brief_title>Prospective Trial to Compare ADR of G-EYE™ Colonoscopy With Standard Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, two-arm , randomized, open-label study intended to compare the detection rate obtained by performing G-EYE™ colonoscopy vs. the detection rate obtained by performing standard colonoscopy. The study will enroll 350 subjects. Consecutive adult subjects who were referred for elective colonoscopy will be asked to enroll in this randomized clinical study if the candidate meets the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will sign an informed consent form and undergo randomization.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients over 50 years old 2. Referred to colonoscopy for screening, following positive FOBT testing, change of bowel habits, for diagnostic evaluation or for surveillance colonoscopy (history of adenoma resection). 3. The patient must understand and provide written consent for the procedure. 1. Subjects with inflammatory bowel disease; 2. Subjects with a personal history of polyposis syndrome; 3. Subjects with suspected chronic stricture potentially precluding complete colonoscopy; 4. Subjects with diverticulitis or toxic megacolon; 5. Subjects with a history of radiation therapy to abdomen or pelvis; 6. Pregnant or lactating female subjects; 7. Subjects who are currently enrolled in another clinical investigation. 8. Subjects with current oral or parenteral use of anticoagulants that have not stopped using anticoagulants as required by the guidelines of the medical center; 9. Subjects with recent (within the last 3 mounts) coronary ischemia or CVA (stroke) 10. Any patient condition deemed too risky for the study by the investigator 11. Previous colonic surgery (except for appendectomy)</criteria>
