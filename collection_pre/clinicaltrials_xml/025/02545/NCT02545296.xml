	<brief_title>HIV Point-of-Care Test Evaluation in Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) study in infants born to HIV infected mothers evaluates the reliability and operational feasibility of an HIV Point-of-Care (PoC) test for HIV early infant diagnosis (EID) in a public health setting at obstetric clinics in Mbeya, Tanzania. Recruitment is planned to take place at 4 obstetric/maternity study sites in and around Mbeya over a time period of 12 months. The HIV PoC test will be validated against the Standard-of-Care diagnostic test, i.e. Dried Blood Spot (DBS) analyses. The PoC test under investigation is the Xpert HIV-1 Qual produced by Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA.</detailed_description>
