	<brief_summary>This phase I/II research trial studies supportive care questionnaires in gathering data on unmet needs and health-related quality of life in Latina breast cancer survivors after surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Questionnaires that address unmet supportive care needs and health-related quality of life of breast cancer survivors may help doctors learn about barriers to cancer care that are linked to language, acculturation, knowledge about diagnosis and care, and financial concerns. Learning about unmet needs of breast cancer patients may help increase quality of life and decrease healthcare utilization and costs.</brief_summary>
