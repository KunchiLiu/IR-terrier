	<brief_summary>The majority of chronic hemodialysis patients need a combination of several antihypertensive drugs for adequate BP control. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether transdermal clonidine can improve blood pressure control or decrease oral antihypertensive agents type or dosage and the secondary objective is to observe incidence of adverse reactions of transdermal clonidine in chronic hemodialysis patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transdermal Clonidine in Chronic Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It's a randomised crossover clinical trial. Subjects: chronic hemodialysis patients. All subjects will be randomised to 2 groups. Subjects in first group will receive 4 weeks transdermal clonidine plus regular antihypertensive agents treatments first, 2weeks wash-out then and 4 weeks antihypertensive agents without transdermal clonidine. The other group will receive 4 weeks antihypertensive agents without transdermal clonidine first, 2weeks wash-out then and 4 weeks transdermal clonidine plus regular antihypertensive agents treatments. Ambulatory blood pressure, echocardiography, and biochemistry will be detected.</detailed_description>
