	<brief_title>Antiproteinuric Effects of Liraglutide Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initial findings point to a clinically significant antiproteinuric effect of liraglutide treatment, possibly independent from blood pressure reduction. The mechanism behind is unclear and the magnitude of albuminuria reduction needs to be verified. Antiproteinuric effects are usually renoprotective and potentially also cardioprotective and may suggest an additional benefit from liraglutide treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the magnitude of the antiproteinuric effect of short-term liraglutide treatment (12 weeks) in patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria. In addition, possible mechanisms causing the antiproteinuric effect will be explored.</detailed_description>
