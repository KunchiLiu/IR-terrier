	<brief_summary>This study is designed to compare Overall Survival (OS) in participants with relapsed or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) treated with idasanutlin in combination with cytarabine versus participants treated with placebo and cytarabine. Participants will receive induction treatment with idasanutlin/placebo and cytarabine (Cycle 1). Responding patients may continue to receive a maximum of further two cycles of consolidation (Cycle 2 and Cycle 3). Complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete platelet count recovery (CRp), overall remission rate (ORR), event-free survival (EFS), leukemia-free survival (LFS) and percentage of participants with an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) will also be compared between treatment arms. This study will include participants without (TP53 wild-type) and with TP53 mutations.</brief_summary>
