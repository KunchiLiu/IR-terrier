	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized crossover study for evaluation of the efficacy and safety of long-term nocturnal high-flow nasal cannula therapy with the myAIRVO2® in stable COPD patients with stage 2-4 of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and hypercapnia who require home oxygen therapy (HOT). The total duration of subject participation will be 52 weeks, consisting of 12-week treatment period and 40-week continuation period. Subjects who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms, Arm A (week 1-6: the myAIRVO2® therapy plus HOT, week 7-12: HOT only) or Arm B (week 1-6: HOT only, week 7-12: the myAIRVO2® therapy plus HOT). All subjects will receive nocturnal high-flow nasal cannula therapy with the myAIRVO2®, in addition to their current HOT. After treatment period, the willing subjects can continue the myAIRVO2® therapy plus HOT for week 13-52 regardless of treatment arm assignment. The end of the study is defined as the treatment period or continuation period end date of the last participant, whichever is later. Subjects will primarily be assessed by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD Patients (SGRQ-C) at week 0, 6, 12, 24 and 52.</brief_summary>
