	<brief_title>VITARIA Registry Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observational prospective clinical registry in patients with symptomatic heart failure and implanted with the VITARIA System. Assessments will be made during 12 months of post-titration chronic stimulation. The registry will collect patient- and device follow-up data in clinical routine practice at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Clinical routine safety of the therapy will be assessed by the incidence of procedure and device-related events. Clinical routine efficacy will be assessed by changes in cardiac function and heart failure symptoms.</detailed_description>
