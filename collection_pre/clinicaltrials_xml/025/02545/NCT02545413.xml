	<brief_summary>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional GI disorder in which abdominal pain and/or discomfort is associated with changes in bowel habit, and with features of disordered defecation. IBS affects 10-20% of the population and causes a marked reduction of quality of life in affected individuals.The high prevalence of IBS is accompanied by large societal economic burdens and negative effects on the quality of life in affected patients. It is divided into 3 types IBS-D diarrhea predominant, IBS-C constipation predominant, IBS-M mixed sub type.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional GI disorder affecting 10-20% of the population and causing a marked reduction of quality of life in affected individuals. An altered brain-gut axis has been accepted as a main pathogenetic mechanism of IBS, which is associated with a dysfunction of the GI autonomic nervous system. These alterations may lead to abnormal visceral hypersensitivity and aberrations of gut motility. Recently, additional potential mechanisms of IBS have emerged including alteration of gut microbiota and low-grade inflammation/immune activation. These factors might lead to abnormal motility and visceral hypersensitivity and contribute to the symptoms. Na√Øve gut microbiota plays important roles in the maintenance of gut homeostasis by direct bactericidal effects and the evolution of both innate and adaptive immune systems. Gut microbiota is thought to play important roles in the pathogenesis of IBS. This is evident from the fact that IBS occurs more frequently after intestinal infection or antibiotics treatment. Studies have shown that the alterations of the intestinal microbiota are observed in IBS patients.Considering the relationship between alteration of gut microbiota and inflammation of gut, manipulation of gut microbiota by probiotics appears to be an ideal treatment modality for IBS. However, the beneficial effects and efficacy of altering gut microbiota by probiotics to improve the symptoms of IBS have not been consistent in clinical trials and therefore it remains uncertain as an effective treatment.</detailed_description>
