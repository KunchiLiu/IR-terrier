	<brief_summary>To compare low dose (1mg) pitavastatin and high dose (4mg) pitavastatin on neointimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis progression by using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) at 12 months follow-up and on clinical adverse cardiovascular events during 3-year follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Low-dose vs. High-dose Pitavastatin on In-stent Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients with non-ST elevation ACS will be randomized into pitavastatin 1mg or 4mg after everolimus-eluting stent implantation with OCT and NIRS study. - 12 months follow-up coronary angiography with OCT and NIRS will be performed to compare neointimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis progression. - 36 months clinical follow-up for major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiac death, all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, target lesion revascularization) will be compared. - Safety issues such as bleeding rates, abnormal liver function will be compared</detailed_description>
