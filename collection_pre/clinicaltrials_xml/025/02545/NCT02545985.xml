	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to assess the safety and the efficacy of the novel sirolimus-eluting Prolim® stent with a biodegradable polymer in the all-comers population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First-in-man Sirolimus-eluting Prolim® Stent Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators prospectively enrolled all patients with stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndrome, treated with Prolim® stent between January and December 2013 in two interventional cardiology centers in Poland. Angiographic control was planned at 12 months, in which 15% of patients (randomly chosen) underwent optical coherence tomography analysis. The primary end-point was the cumulative rate of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization after 12 months.</detailed_description>
