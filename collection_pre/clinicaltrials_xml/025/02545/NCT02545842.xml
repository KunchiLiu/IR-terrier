	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To identify a best fasting plasma glucose (FPG) target for Chinese type 2 diabetes patients using insulin glargine which can provide the highest control rate of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt; 7%. Secondary Objectives: The control rate of HbA1c ≤6.5% achievement. The control rate of HbA1c &lt;7.0% in patients achieving their FPG target. The percentage of HbA1c &lt;7% without hypoglycemia. The percentage of patients achieving the FPG target without hypoglycemia. The percentage of patients achieving the FPG target and post prandial glucose (PPG) target (2-hour post breakfast &lt;10 mmol/L).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : 18 to 65 years old. Type 2 diabetes patients insufficient controlled by 13 oral antihyperglycemic drugs (OADs) with stable dose at least 3 months: If on 1 OAD, provided with the following doses (including but not limited to): αglucosidase inhibitor: 100mg, three times a day (tid); metformin: 1.52.0 g/day; sulphonylureas: submaximum (half dose above) to maximum tolerated dose; thiazolidinediones: eg. pioglitazone, 3040 mg/day. Besides the medications listed above, if on 1 OAD, others should be maximum tolerated dose allowed in package insert. If on 23 OADs, any range of dose is acceptable. HbA1c &gt;7%, and ≤10.5%. FPG &gt;7 mmol/L. Body mass index (BMI) ≥20 kg/m^2, and ≤40 kg/m^2. Diabetes duration ≥1 year. Physician decides to and the patient is willing to start basal insulin (BI) treatment. Willing to join the study and sign the informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Type 1 diabetes patients. Patients with acute diabetic complications (including unexplained severe hypoglycemia in the last 6 months). Previous treatment with insulin for more than 1 month cumulatively in last 1 year, or treatment with insulin in the last 3 months before the screening. Known hypoglycemia unawareness or recurrent hypoglycemia. Hypersensitivity to study drug or its excipients. Any clinically significant acute major organ or systemic disease, or any other situation judged by the Investigator, that is difficult for the 24 weeks followup. Pregnancy or breastfeeding women. Have any mental disorders, lack selfcontrol or not able to express accurately. Involved in another clinical trial simultaneously or within a 1 month before start of trial. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
