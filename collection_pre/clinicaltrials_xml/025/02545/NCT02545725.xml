	<brief_summary>This study is collecting data on quality of life, (care)needs and socio-economic factors in colorectal (ex-)cancer patients via a written questionnaire completed by the patient him/herself. The collected data will be linked with the patient- and tumour characteristics available in the database of the Belgian Cancer Registry and with the facturation data supplying information about diagnostic techniques and performed treatments (available via the insurance companies). Based on the selection criteria, 1220 patients were finally selected from the database of the Belgian Cancer Registry. These patients received an invitation letter by regular mail, a detailed questionnaire and an informed consent. The questionnaire contains topics as sociodemographic, life style, comorbidity, satisfaction with the provided information, care needs, quality of life, anxiety and depression, financial situation etc. The patients were asked to complete the questionnaire and send it back, together with the signed informed consent, to the study-collaborators. After 2-4 weeks, a reminder was sent. At that time, a reply card was added. If a patient doesn't want to participate in this study, a reason can be mentioned on the reply card. The collected data are linked with the clinical data. The dataset will be coded before analyses will start.</brief_summary>
