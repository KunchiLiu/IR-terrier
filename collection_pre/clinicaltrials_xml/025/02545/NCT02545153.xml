	<brief_title>Fibrin Sealant for Cholangiotomy Closure Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration is a way of dealing with common bile duct stones that has gained increasing acceptance. Following a cholangiotomy there is, however, the risk of bile leakage from the incision. A way of avoiding leakage following cholangiotomy may be to apply fibrin sealant on the cholangiotomy. The present study is based on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy at the department of surgery, Enk√∂ping hospital, Sweden. The patients are informed about the study prior to the procedure. Cholangiography is performed routinely. In case common bile duct stones are encountered on the cholangiography, an incision is made in the common bile duct and the stones are extracted. After the stone extraction, a t tube is introduced into the cholangiotomy and the incision is closed with running Vicryl sutures. When the cholangiotomy has been closed, the randomisation is performed with a sealed envelope system. If the patient is randomised to fibrin sealant, this is applied on the cholangiotomy. A passive drain is introduced before the abdomen is closed. Postoperatively, the amount of bile in the passive drain is measured by an observer randomised to the allocation. If the amount of bile in the drain does not exceed 100 ml three days postoperatively, a secondary cholangiography is performed through the t tube. If the contrast passes to the duodenum and no contrast leakage is seen, the t tube is withdrawn. All postoperative complications are registered according to the Clavien-Dindo system.</detailed_description>
