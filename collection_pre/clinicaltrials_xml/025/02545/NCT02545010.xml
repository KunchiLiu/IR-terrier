	<brief_summary>Background: Epithelial Ovarian Cancer is the most lethal amongst the gynecologic malignancies and is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States.1 Despite initial high response rates, 50% to 75% of women who present with advanced disease suffer relapse and require re treatment2.The optimal treatment for platinum resistant ovarian cancer remains hotly debated. Combination chemotherapy is not favored due to its increased toxicity and lack of convincing benefit when compared to single agent chemotherapy.3,4 Recently, the addition of bevacizumab to single agent chemotherapy in the AURELIA study improved progression free survival (PFS) from 3.4 months to 6.7 months. Response rates were also improved from 11.8% versus 27.3% (p= 0 .001).9 Aim: To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of weekly paclitaxel in combination with LDWART. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) will be based on the MTD in this Phase I study. Method: This study is designed as a prospective, single arm phase I study with 3+3 with dose de-escalation and cohort expansion. All patients will receive weekly paclitaxel at a pre specified dose of 80 mg/m2, 70 mg/m2, 60mg/m2 or 50 mg/m2 via intravenous infusion according to institution specific standard practices. Cycles of chemotherapy will be administered weekly without interruption on Days 1,8,15,22,29,36 for a total of 6 weekly cycles in combination with LDWART(Fig.1). LDWART will be given at 60 cGy fractions, twice daily for two days, with a minimum of 4 hours inter fraction interval, starting on day 1 of each cycle of weekly paclitaxel for 6 weeks.(Fig.1). Importance of proposed research: The combination of a LDWART with weekly paclitaxel may improve the efficacy of the current standard weekly paclitaxel in platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients. Potential benefits and risks: The combination may improve treatment response. Adding LDWART may increase treatment risks, but these will be monitored closely.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Is capable of understanding the written informed consent, provides signed and witnessed written informed consent, and agrees to comply with protocol requirements. Age ≥ 21 years. Histologically confirmed and documented epithelial ovarian carcinomas, primary peritoneal carcinomas, or fallopian tube carcinomas. Patients must have platinumresistant disease, (defined as progression within &lt;6 months from completion of a minimum of 4 platinum therapy cycles. The date should be calculated from the last administered dose of platinum therapy). Patients must have evidence of measurable intra abdominal disease at point of screening. Patients must have disease that is measurable according to RECIST version 1.1 and assessable according to the GCIG CA125 criteria and require treatment with chemotherapy within 14 days of screening. Target lesions should not be selected in previously irradiated fields unless there is clear evidence of progression Performance status of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 to 2. Life expectancy of ≥12 weeks with standard treatment. Has adequate organ function at Baseline, including the following (noting that repeated tests at baseline should not be performed unless there are sufficient reasons to assume the patient would meet the inclusion criteria with retesting): 1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.0 × 109/L 2. Platelet count ≥100 × 109/L (without transfusions within 21 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1) 3. Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL 4. Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time within ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) 5. International normalized ratio ≤1.5 × ULN 6. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN 7. Transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase ≤2.5 × ULN (&lt;5 × ULN if liver metastases) Has a negative serum pregnancy test 14 days prior to starting study drug plus a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1, Cycle 1 prior to treatment (applies to females of childbearing potential only). 1. General Criteria Is a female patient of childbearing potential, defined as a female physiologically capable of becoming pregnant (including a female whose career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation precludes intercourse with a male partner, and females whose partners have been sterilized by vasectomy or other means), unless they are using a highly effective method for birth control throughout the study and for 12 weeks after the end of treatment. Highly effective methods for birth control include the following: 1. Total abstinence: This is an acceptable method when this is consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 2. Female sterilization: The patient has had a surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks prior to taking study drug. In case of an oophorectomy alone, the reproductive status of the patient must have been confirmed by followup hormone level assessment. 3. Male partner sterilization: The patient has the appropriate postvasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. (For female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.) These patients must also agree to the following: Use of a combination of the following (1+2): 1. Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system 2. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam, gel, film, or cream, or vaginal suppository Reliable contraception maintained throughout the study and for 12 weeks after study drug discontinuation 4. Females considered postmenopausal and not of childbearing potential: The definition applies to females who have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum folliclestimulating hormone levels &gt;40 mIU/mL (for US only: and estradiol &lt;20 pg/mL) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least 6 weeks prior to starting treatment. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the patient has been confirmed by followup hormone level assessment is she considered not of childbearing potential. Is a pregnant or nursing (lactating) female, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive human chorionic gonadotropin laboratory test (&gt;5 mIU/mL). Serum pregnancy test to be assessed within 7 days prior to study treatment start, or within 14 days (with a confirmatory urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study treatment start).
