	<brief_summary>Forty healthy patients with including criteria who failed to infra alveolar nerve block injection (without lip numbness) have been randomly divided into two groups on a random basis and have received Gow-Gates or another inferior alveolar nerve block injection. Endodontic access cavity preparation has been initiated after complete anesthesia. If patients felt any pain during the steps of caries or dentin removal, Endodontic access cavity preparation or canal working length determination, treatment has been stopped and their pain has been measured by Heft Parker 170 mm Visual Analog Scale (Zero as no pain and 170 as maximum pain ).The data has been analyzed by Mann-U-Whitney and CHI- SQUARE tests.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Two Injection Techniques on Success Rate of Inferior Alveolar Nerve Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of Gow-Gates and inferior alveolar nerve block on success rate of anesthesia in patients with irreversible pulpitis. In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study , forty healthy patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis and including criteria who failed to infra alveolar nerve block injection (without lip numbness) have been randomly divided into two groups on a random basis and have received Gow-Gates or another inferior alveolar nerve block injection. Their pain has been evaluated by electric pulp tester every 5 minutes for two times. Endodontic access cavity preparation has been initiated after complete anesthesia. If patients felt any pain during the steps of caries or dentin removal, Endodontic access cavity preparation or canal working length determination, treatment has been stopped and their pain has been measured by Heft Parker 170 mm Visual Analog Scale (Zero as no pain and 170 as maximum pain ). The patients have been instructed to rate any pain during each of the mentioned steps. The data have been analyzed by Mann-U-Whitney and CHI- SQUARE tests.</detailed_description>
