	<brief_summary>This is a Long-term Access Programme (LAP) which aims to support provision of mepolizumab, until it is commercially available, to eligible subjects with severe asthma who participated in a GSK-sponsored mepolizumab clinical study 200862 and 200363. Eligible subjects will initiate mepolizumab within a 6-month period following the individual subject's last scheduled visit in their preceding clinical study. For each subject benefit versus risk will be assessed throughout the study to support continued treatment with mepolizumab.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject participated in GSKsponsored asthma clinical study with mepolizumab as specified in Study 200862 and 200363 Subject has either: completed the treatment period in the mepolizumab asthma clinical study to which they were originally enrolled or if the subject was withdrawn from study treatment prematurely during the mepolizumab asthma clinical study to which they were originally enrolled but the subject has completed the study assessments at the study visit that would have been the end of the respective treatment period. The treating physician requesting mepolizumab under this Longterm Access Programme considers the benefits of treatment with mepolizumab outweigh the risks for the individual subject. To be eligible for mepolizumab treatment under this Longterm Access Programme, females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must commit to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control, beginning with consent, for the duration of the treatment with mepolizumab and for 4 months after the last mepolizumab administration. The subject consents to receiving treatment with mepolizumab under this Longterm Access Programme. In the case of a paediatric subject being eligible a parent(s)/guardian will give written informed consent prior to the child's participation in the study. If applicable, the subject must be able and willing to give assent to take part in the study according to the local requirement. A current malignancy or history of cancer in remission for less than 12 months (Subjects who had localized carcinoma (i.e., basal or squamous cell) of the skin which was resected for cure will not be excluded). Subject has other clinically significant medical conditions uncontrolled with standardofcare therapy not associated with asthma, e.g., unstable liver disease, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, ongoing active infectious disease requiring systemic treatment. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. Subjects should not be considered for continued treatment if they plan to become pregnant during the course of treatment with mepolizumab. Subject has a known allergy or intolerance to a monoclonal antibody or biologic therapy including mepolizumab. Subject had an adverse event (serious or nonserious) considered related to study treatment whilst participating in a clinical study with mepolizumab which resulted in permanent withdrawal of study treatment. Subject is receiving treatment with another biological therapy such as a monoclonal antibody therapy or intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy. Subjects who have received treatment with an investigational drug within the past 30 days or 5 terminal phase halflives of the drug whichever is longer, prior to initiation of mepolizumab treatment under this Longterm Access Programme (this also includes investigational formulations of marketed products). Subject is currently participating in any other interventional clinical study.</criteria>
