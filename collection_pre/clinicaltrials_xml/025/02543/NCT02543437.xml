	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the benefit of X3 polyethlene inserts with larger diameter heads used in the Japanese population. Range of Motion (ROM) and lift-off distance for both 28mm, 32mm and 36mm in patients will be examined intraoperatively by using the Stryker computerized tomography (CT) based Navigation system. Another aspect of this study is to observe wear resistance performance of X3 over historical liner existing highly crosslinked polyethylene.</brief_summary>
