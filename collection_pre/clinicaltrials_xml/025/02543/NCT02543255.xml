	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the use of chemotherapy with cabazitaxel in addition to abiraterone acetate, prednisone, and leuprolide in neoadjuvant setting prior to radical prostatectomy in patients with high-risk prostate carcinoma. Half of the participants will receive treatment with abiraterone acetate, prednisone, leuprolide, and cabazitaxel, while the other half will receive only abiraterone acetate, prednisone, and leuprolide.</brief_summary>
