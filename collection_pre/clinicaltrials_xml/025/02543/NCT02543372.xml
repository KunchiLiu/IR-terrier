	<brief_summary>Background: Problem gambling is a public health concern with prevalence rates at 2 %. Problem gambling also severely affects concerned significant others (CSOs). Several studies have investigated the effects of individual treatments based on cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), but there is a shortage in studies on the effect of involving CSOs in treatment. This study aims to compare an intervention based on behavioral couples therapy (BCT) involving a CSO with an individual CBT treatment to determine their relative efficacy. BCT has shown promising results in working with substance abuse, but this is the first time it is used as an intervention for problem gambling. Both interventions will be Internet-delivered and participants will receive e-mail and telephone support. Method/Design: A sample of at least 100 couples will be randomized to either the BCT condition or the CBT condition. The participants will work through 10 modules over 12 weeks in a secure online environment, and receive support via email and over telephone. Repeated measures will be conducted weekly and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome measure is gambling behavior, defined as time spent and money lost on gambling, as measured by timeline follow-back. Secondary outcomes include gambling related harm, alcohol consumption, relationship satisfaction and mental health for the gambler as well as for the CSO. Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that a) BCT will yield greater reductions on gambling measures than CBT, b) BCT will yield a lower drop-out rate compared to CBT, c) BCT will be superior to CBT on increasing relationship satisfaction, d) relationship functioning will mediate change in gambling behavior in the BCT group and e) reduction in gambling behavior will mediate change in relationship functioning in the CBT group.</brief_summary>
