	<detailed_description>A prospective observational clinical study to be conducted in Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, a large open-access, private tertiary referral center. Consecutive eligible patients with suspected post OLT biliary complications referred to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) will be considered to SpyGlass as follows. In those patients with confirmed biliary stricture, SpyGlass direct choledochoscopy will be performed prior to endoscopic treatment with stents. After final stent removal, choledochoscopy will be repeated to evaluate biliary ductal mucosa.</detailed_description>
