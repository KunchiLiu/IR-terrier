	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective, randomized, double-masked, bilateral, dispensing, parallel-group clinical trial design. All subjects will participate in a 2-week daily disposable contact lens adaptation period prior to being randomized into one of the four extended wear lenses. The study has a total of 9 scheduled study visits and a total duration of ~197 days. The lenses will be replaced with a fresh pair after 6 nights / 7 days of wear.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject must read and understand English and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and receive a fully executed copy of the form. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical protocol. The subject must be at least 18 and no more than 39 years of age. The subject's spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in the range of 1.00 to 5.50 diopters in each eye. The subject's refractive cylinder must be less than 1.00 diopters in each eye. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 or better in each eye. The subject must be without history of contact lens use in the past 12 months. The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any type). Any previous experience wearing contact lenses on an overnight or extended wear basis (at least 1 night per month) Currently pregnant or lactating (self reported) (subjects who become pregnant during the study will be discontinued). Currently a regular smoker (1 or more times per month). Current routine swimmer (1 or more times per month). Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens wear. Any systemic disease (ex. Sj√∂gren's Syndrome), autoimmune disease (ex. rheumatoid arthritis), or use of medication (ex. chronic steroid use), which may interfere with contact lens wear. Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, or moderate or above corneal distortion by keratometry. Any previous or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), etc.). Any grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lensrelated corneal inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear. Any ocular infection. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact lens wear. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 7 days prior to study enrollment. History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus. Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or a contagious immunosuppressive disease (e.g., HIV) by self report).
