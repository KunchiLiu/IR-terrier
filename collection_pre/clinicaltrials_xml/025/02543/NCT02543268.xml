	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the humoral immune response induced by 3 different batches of Ad26.ZEBOV as measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against the Ebola virus (EBOV) GP (Glycoprotein) at 56 days post prime.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Immunogenicity, Safety and Tolerability of Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA‐BN‐Filo in Healthy Adult Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double - blind, placebo - controlled, parallel - group, multicenter, Phase 3 study to evaluate the immunogenic equivalence of a heterologous prime - boost regimen using 3 different batches of Ad26.ZEBOV in healthy adult participants. The study consists of a screening period of up to 6 weeks, a vaccination period in which participants will be vaccinated at baseline (Day 1), followed by a boost vaccination on Day 57, and a post-vaccination phase until 6 months post‐boost visit (Day 237). The participants will be randomized at baseline (on Day 1) in a 2:2:2:1 ratio to Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
