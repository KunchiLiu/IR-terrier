	<brief_summary>This is a study to determine the clinical benefit (how well the drug works), safety and tolerability of combining varlilumab and atezolizumab. Phase l of the study will enroll patients with a number of tumor types; Phase ll will enroll only patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Varlilumab and Atezolizumab in Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Varlilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called CD27 found on certain immune cells and may act to promote anti-tumor effects. Atezolizumab is an engineered anti-PD-L1 antibody. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the anti-CD27 antibody varlilumab in combination with atezolizumab. Eligible patients that enroll in the dose escalation portion of the study will be assigned to one of three dose levels of varlilumab in combination with 1200 mg of atezolizumab. The first phase of the study will enroll up to 18 patients and test the safety profile of the combination of varlilumab and atezolizumab in patients with various tumor types and determine which dose of varlilumab will be studied in Phase ll of the study which will enroll only patients with RCC. During Phase ll, up to 37 patients will be enrolled and receive the recommended Phase ll dose of varlilumab in combination with atezolizumab 1200 mg. All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is a response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.</detailed_description>
