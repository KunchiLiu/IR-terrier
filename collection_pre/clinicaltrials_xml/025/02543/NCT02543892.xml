	<brief_summary>This study will determine if PATH-wSP, a vaccine against a germ that causes pneumonia, is safe and induces immune responses in adults and toddlers. The study vaccine will be compared to placebo. First adults will receive a 2 injections of a lower dose of the vaccine or placebo, 28 days apart. If the lower dose is safe, then a higher dose will be tested. Once the safety is established in adults the lower and higher dose will be tested in toddlers, starting with the lower dose.</brief_summary>

Toddlers must have completed their Kenyan infant EPI schedule through 9 months including 1 birth dose of BCG, 3 doses of DTwPHibHep, 3 doses of OPV (birth dose is not required), 3 doses of PCV, and 1 dose of measles vaccine Use of any investigational or nonregistered drug within 90 days of enrollment Use of any potentially hepatotoxic drug Receipt of any licensed vaccine within 14 days of administration of study vaccine. Chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatobiliary, gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, or hematological functional abnormality or major congenital defects or illness that requires medical therapy, based on medical history or clinical assessment History of anaphylactic shock History of a serious reaction to any prior vaccination or known hypersensitivity to any component of the study vaccines History of immunosuppression or immunodeficiency, inclusive of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by medical history (including that of an enrolled toddler's mother) or by HIV testing at screening Evidence of active hepatitis infection (B or C) by serologic testing at screening. Any screening laboratory test (chemistry or hematology) or vital sign measurement with toxicity grade ≥ 1 Acute illness (moderate or severe) and/or fever (axillary temperature ≥ 37.5°C) Positive test for malaria (blood film) at screening that remains positive post treatment when retested prior to vaccination Disorders that require chronic administration (defined as more than 14 consecutive days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within the past 6 months prior to the administration of the study vaccine. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 6 months preceding enrollment in the study Known disturbance of coagulation or other blood disorder (e.g., thalassemia, sickle cell disease, thrombocytopenia, disorders of the lymphocytes, severe anemia at birth) in adult subject or in self/firstdegree relative of toddler subject; or receipt of anticoagulants in the past three weeks (aspirin as needed and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are acceptable) History of meningitis, seizures or any neurological disorder (all participants) or major psychiatric disorder (adults) Any medical or social condition that in the opinion of the investigator will interfere with the study objectives or pose a risk to the study subject An employee (or firstdegree relative of employee) of the Sponsor, the CRO, or any investigator or site personnel Female adult subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding Adults with a recent history (within the past year) of alcohol or substance abuse. Toddlers who have already received a pentavalent booster (following the primary series). Toddlers with a family history of suspected primary immunodeficiency in firstdegree relative. Toddlers who had a sibling die of likely sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or die suddenly and without apparent other cause or preceding illness in the first year of life. Toddlers with evidence of a clinically significant congenital abnormality as judged by the PI. Toddlers with evidence of fetal alcohol syndrome or maternal history of alcohol abuse during pregnancy</criteria>
