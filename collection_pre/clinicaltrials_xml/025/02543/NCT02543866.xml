	<brief_summary>This protocol will evaluate fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as a strategy to eradicate intestinal colonization of extended-spectrum resistant (ESC-R) Enterobacteriaceae in pediatric patients. FMT will be performed on subjects with a history of at least one infection due to ESC-R Enterobacteriaceae. This protocol aims to determine the feasibility, safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of FMT in pediatric patients with a history of ESC-R Enterobacteriaceae.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fecal Microbiota Transplantation as a Strategy to Eradicate Resistant Organisms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective pilot study of fecal microbiota transplantation in pediatric patients with a history of ESC-R Enterobacteriaceae. Subjects who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and provide written, informed consent will undergo screening studies and provide a pre-FMT stool sample to confirm intestinal carriage of ESC-R Enterobacteriaceae. The FMT will be administered by nasogastric tube in the outpatient setting by trained personnel. The subjects will be monitored for potential adverse events, recurrence of MDRO infections, infections that may be related to FMT, and worsening of existing comorbidities or development of new comorbidities for the 12 months post-FMT with the option of participating in long-term follow-up for up to 5 years post-FMT. Patients will provide stool samples 2 days, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post-FMT. These samples will be testing for ESC-R Enterobacteriaceae.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Children and adolescents between 7 and 21 years of age. 2. A history at least one infection due to ESCR Enterobacteriaceae. ESCR isolates will be defined as those nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ceftazidime. 3. Parent/guardian and participant must be able to attend baseline and followup study visits. 4. Subject must be willing and able to provide written informed consent or assent (as appropriate by age). 1. Patients with any history of malignancy or any immunocompromised state (e.g. absolute neutrophil count outside the normal range) induced by disease or therapy will be excluded. 2. Patients with past or current use of systemic immunosuppressive agents will be excluded. Receipt of nonsystemic agents such as inhaled, nasal, or topical steroids or immunemodulating agents are allowed. 3. Lack of intestinal carriage of ESCR Enterobacteriaceae (negative selective stool culture for ESCR Enterobacteriaceae). 4. Allergy or hypersensitivity to omeprazole and polyethylene glycol. 5. Pregnancy. 6. Current history of frequent (&gt;1 per week) vomiting. 7. Active inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease 8. Active mucositis or acute graft versus host disease of the gastrointestinal tract 9. Concurrent abdominal radiation therapy. 10. Inability to tolerate nasogastric tube placement or contraindication to having an NG tube placed. 11. Presence of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt or other intrabdominal device, receipt of renal dialysis, presence of ascites, or other conditions/devices that would increase the risk of peritonitis. 12. Bleeding diatheses 13. Patients with current active ESCR Enterobacteriaceae infection who have not yet completed antibiotic treatment will be excluded until their treatment is completed</criteria>
