	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation Phase 1 study in patients with acute leukemia/high-risk MDS or non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, intended to investigate safety, pharmacokinetics, and the pharmacodynamic effects of FT-1101 administered via one or more intermittent dosing schedules. Once the MTD has been established, up to 56 additional patients may be enrolled in 4 expansion cohorts in selected patient populations at the recommended dose for future studies to confirm safety.</brief_summary>
