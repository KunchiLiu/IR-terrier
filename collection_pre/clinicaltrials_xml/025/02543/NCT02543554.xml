	<brief_summary>Early mechanical ventilation, if delivered with injurious settings, can lead to pulmonary complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanical ventilation in the emergency department (ED) has been studied infrequently when compared to the intensive care unit; however, data suggests that ED-based mechanical ventilation has significant room for improvement and may also be a causative factor in ARDS incidence.</brief_summary>
