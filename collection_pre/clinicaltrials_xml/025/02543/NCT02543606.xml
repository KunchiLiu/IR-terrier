	<detailed_description>A randomized, two-way crossover, single-dose pharmacokinetic study to evaluate the bioequivalence of a test formulation of Esomelone powder for solution for injection/infusion 40mg (Esomeprazole 40mg), compared to an equivalent dose of a reference drug product (Nexium powder for injection and infusion 40mg) in healthy adult subjects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Healthy adult, aged between 20 to 40 years old. 2. Physically and mentally healthy subjects as confirmed by an interview, medical history, clinical examination, laboratory tests, chest xray and electrocardiogram. no particular clinical significance in clinical examination and laboratory tests within two months (60 days) prior to Period I dosing. normal or considered not clinically significant by the investigator chest Xray and ECG results within six months (180 days ) prior to Period I dosing. 3. The normal range of the body mass index should be between 18.5 and 25; body mass index equals [weight (kg)]/[height (m)]2. 4. Normal laboratory determinations result (within normal range or considered not clinically significant by the investigator) including: SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), albumin, glucose, creatinine, uric acid, cholesterol, TG, rGT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, BUN, HBsAg, AntiHCV and AntiHIV test. 5. Normal hematology results (within normal range or considered not clinically significant by the investigator) including: hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC count with differential, RBC count and platelet count. 6. Normal urinalysis results (within normal range or considered not clinically significant by the investigator) including: glucose, protein, RBC, WBC, epith, casts and bacteria. 7. Female subject who is using adequate contraception since last menstruation and no plan for conception during the study, nonlactating. has negative pregnancy test (urine) within 14 days prior to the study. 8. Informed consent form signed. 1. A history of drug or alcohol abuse during the past 24 weeks. 2. Sensitivity to analogous drug. 3. A clinically significant illness (such as significant unintentional weight loss, recurrent vomiting, dysphagia, haematemesis, melaena or gastric ulcer) within the past 4 weeks. 4. Evidence of any clinical significant renal, cardiovascular, hepatic, hematopoietic, neurological, pulmonary or gastrointestinal pathology within the past 4 weeks. 5.
