	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to better understand how adaptive cardiac resynchronization therapy (aCRT) might benefit patients. aCRT works by sometimes giving stimulation to only the left side of the heart, rather than to both sides, depending on how it senses the heart is functioning. CRT without the adaptive algorithm works by giving stimulation to both sides of the heart. aCRT has already been approved by the FDA and is being used in patients now, but it is not clear which patients it should be used in compared to normal CRT. This study will include patients who are already scheduled to get a CRT device. The investigators will then randomize patients to the aCRT study arm or to the CRT study arm. After 6 months, the investigators will assess the electrical activity of the patients' hearts. After this time, the patient and their doctors will be able to decide if they would like to change the type CRT they have been designated.</brief_summary>
