	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the non‐inferiority of a heterologous prime‐boost regimen using Ad26.ZEBOV as prime and MVA‐BN‐Filo as boost administered at different doses at a 56‐day interval versus the same regimen with the recently released batches of Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA‐BN‐Filo in terms of humoral immune response against the Ebola virus (EBOV) GP (glycoprotein) as measured by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at 21 days post boost.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate A Range of Dose Levels of Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA‐BN‐Filo in Healthy Adult Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, multicenter study to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA‐BN‐Filo at different dose levels, administered to healthy adults participants. The study consists of a Screening period of up to 6 weeks, vaccinations on Day 1 and Day 57, and a post‐vaccination phase until the 6 months post‐boost visit (Day 237). The participants will be randomized at baseline (on Day 1) in a 2:2:2:1 ratio to Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
