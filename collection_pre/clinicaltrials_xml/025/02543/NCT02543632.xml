	<detailed_description>Prospective, multi-center, post-market, non-randomized, nested-control, observational study of the European Conformity Approved (CE marked) CardioKinetix Parachute Implant System. The primary objective is to establish quality-of-life and cardiac output benefit of the Parachute Implant of patients presenting with symptoms of heart failure due to ischemic heart disease. A maximum of 105 treated patients and approximately 25 control patients may be enrolled, with a maximum of 25 treated patients enrolled from any one center. The Primary Endpoint is an improvement of Quality of Life of patients treated with the Parachute Implant at 6 months compared to baseline using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLWHF) Questionnaire. The Secondary Endpoint is an improvement in Stroke Volume Index (mL/m2) of patients treated with the Parachute Implant at post-procedure compared to pre-procedure.</detailed_description>

(Characteristics include inappropriate size and shape of the left ventricle, pseudo chordae or trabeculations interfering with device placement.)</criteria>
