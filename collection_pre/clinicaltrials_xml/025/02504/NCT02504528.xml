	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the methodology of bronchial provocation tests with house dust mites in China, and to evaluate its safety and effects on upper and lower airways inflammation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bronchial Allergen Provocation Tests in Asthmatics in Guangzhou</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After screening,each participant undergo baseline lung function test,airway inflammation evaluation (blood and sputum eosinophils count,interleukin-13 (IL-13),FeNO)and airway responsiveness tests(methacholine bronchial provocation,nasal histamine provocation). On the second day,the participant undergo bronchial house dust mites challenge tests. On the third day,the participant undergo the lung function test,airway inflammation evaluation (blood and sputum eosinophils count,IL-13,FeNO)and airway responsiveness tests(methacholine bronchial provocation,nasal histamine provocation).</detailed_description>
