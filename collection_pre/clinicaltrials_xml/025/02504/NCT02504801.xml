	<brief_summary>To test the hypothesis that nebulized Pulmicort Respules could reduce post operation pulmonary complication incidence in primary lung cancer patients with COPD. Compare post-operation pulmonary complication incidence in two treatment arms among primary lung cancer patients with COPD required single lobectomy from 3days before operation to 7 days after operation.</brief_summary>
