	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r), with or without dasabuvir (DSV) coadministered with or without ribavirin (RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks in adult patients with genotype 1 or genotype 4 chronic HCV infection and treated early stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma with compensated cirrhosis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Male or female, at least 18 years of age at time of screening. 2. Chronic HCV infection prior to study enrollment with screening laboratory results indicating HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection. 3. Early stage HCC diagnosed based on the typical hallmark of HCC (hypervascular in the arterial phase with washout in the portal venous or delayed phases) 4. Compensated cirrhosis defined as a ChildPugh score of 5 or 6 at Screening. â€¢ A minimal rim of ascites if detected at imaging is acceptable. Exclude ascites that requires the need to apply diuretic treatment to control ascites 5. Documented complete response to HCC treatment. 6. Females must be postmenopausal for more than 2 years or surgically sterile or practicing acceptable forms of birth control 1. Use of known strong or moderate inducers of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) in subjects receiving OBV/PTV/r with and without DSV, strong inducers and inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) of cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8) in subjects receiving OBV/PTV/r with DSV, medications contraindicated for ritonavir or RBV (for those that receive RBV) within 2 weeks or 10 halflives (if known), whichever is longer, prior to study drug . For medications contraindicated with AbbVie's 2DAA and 3DAA regimen, refer to the recommended prescribing information section of the approved local product labels. 2. Positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antihuman immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab). 3. Patients regardless of eligibility to liver transplant, who have a comorbid disease that might preclude completion of study followup. 4. Clinically significant abnormalities, other than HCV infection, in a subject with HCC based upon the medical history, physical examination, vital signs, laboratory profile and a 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that make the subject an unsuitable candidate for this study in the opinion of the investigator.</criteria>
