	<brief_summary>Crohn disease (CD) usually evolves by surges interspersed by periods of unpredictable remission. the probability of recurrence of CD in a patient in remission is even stronger if it pre-exists endoscopic lesions of the intestinal mucosa. The mucosal healing exploration needs the realization of an ileo-colonoscopy under general anesthesia which is an invasive procedure, restrictive and expensive, thus prohibiting its too frequent repetition. we do not currently have noninvasive and reliable markers able to predict the occurrence of thrust of CD and allow the introduction of a more suitable treatment. Indeed, relapse prevention is the best way to avoid complications and formation of lesions that lead to the irreversible medical treatment failure and surgery. Since during the CD, it is the immunological changes that lead to inflammation and lesions, we make the assumption that the ability of certain markers immunological to predict a relapse of CD is higher than that of other in particular inflammatory markers. This work should help to identify the profile of patients with CD in remission but at high risk of recurrence. It will specify i) the potential new markers immunological, from the pre-clinical research, predict the onset of a recurrence of CD ; ii) the predictive interest of different inflammatory markers used in routine or during the CD evaluation ; iii) Finally, the stress and the management of stressful events in the occurrence of a relapse. This work also will specify the evolution of different markers at the moment of thrust</brief_summary>
