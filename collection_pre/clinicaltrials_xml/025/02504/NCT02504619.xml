	<detailed_description>CordIn™ is a cryopreserved stem/progenitor cell-based product of purified CD133+ cells composed of ex vivo expanded allogeneic UCB cells. The trial ends when the last patient completes their last visit. The overall study objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CordIn™: single ex-vivo expanded cord blood unit transplantation in patients with hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell disease or thalassemia major) following a preparative therapy.</detailed_description>
