	<brief_title>Clinical Reasoning Process of Physiotherapists When Observing Hemiplegic Gait</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physiotherapists don't usually use any assessments to evaluate gait but observe it without an instrument. The questions in this study are: - what abnormalities can physiotherapists detect when observing a patient walking? - what do they consider the main problem that has a negative effect on the patient's walking? - what hypothesis do they generate? - how is the inter-rater reliability for the "main problem" and the hypothesis?</detailed_description>
