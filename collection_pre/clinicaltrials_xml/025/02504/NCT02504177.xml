	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluated the interruption schedule of NOAC in patients who undergo atrial fibrillation ablation. The investigators will compare the bleeding complications were classified as major and minor bleeding, thromboembolic, vascular complications, Re-admission and increased in the length of hospital stay during the 30-day post-radiofrequency catheter ablation(RFCA) period among patients who interrupt NOAc 24hours before ablation and patients who stop NOAC in the morning of the procedure.</brief_summary>
