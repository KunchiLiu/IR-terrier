	<brief_title>The Effect of Virtual Reality on Motor Functioning and Participation Abilities Among Children With DCD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy of using VR (Virtual Reality) as a therapeutic tool as an integral part of Occupational Therapy intervention will be examined in this study. The study will be conducted in two stages: the first will be conducted at the Child Development Center of the Clalit HMO (Health Maintenance Organization), and the second will take place in the child's home. The first intervention will take approximately 8 to 10 weeks, during which eight data collection sessions will be conducted, each of 45 minutes duration. The study group will integrate the use of Timocco in occupational therapy sessions while the control group will be given conventional occupational therapy without using Timocco. In the second intervention, the study group will be given access to the virtual-reality environment of Timocco to be used at home, and will not include therapy sessions at the Child Development Center. An assessment before and after intervention will be held for both groups for comparison.</detailed_description>
