	<brief_title>Outcomes of Antipsychotic Medication Used in the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A retrospective chart review will be performed for all patients presenting to the ED with agitation and subsequently given antipsychotic therapy for treatment. Identification of patients will be through chart review of patients presenting with agitation. Data to be recorded include patient age, gender, medical history, time of presentation, time of treatment, co morbidities, use of restraint, time to disposition and patient outcome. Inclusion criteria include all patients over age 18 presenting to the ED with agitation and treated with antipsychotics. No patients will be knowingly excluded from analysis. We will compare resulting outcomes of patients treated for agitation to see if Adasuve is superior to other commonly prescribed antipsychotics through its rate of discharge home and overall time in the emergency department.</detailed_description>
