	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to implement a new mobile interface that automatically reads and troubleshoots malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) cassettes. This device, called a Deki reader (DR), will allow the investigators to establish an extensive quality assurance program of malaria diagnosis performed by trained community health volunteers (CHVs). The study will lease 10 DRs and rotate them amongst 200 CHVs performing community-based malaria diagnosis through rapid diagnostic testing. The study setting is Bungoma East subcounty and Kiminini subcounty in Kenya. The overall goal is to measure and improve the quality of malaria diagnosis by CHVs using malaria RDTs. The investigators aim for every CHW to exceed 90% sensitivity and specificity and zero operator errors within six months. There are no appreciable risks to the CHV associated with evaluation by the DR device. The investigators' analysis will focus on descriptive statistics of RDT use and accuracy amongst all participating CHVs.</brief_summary>
