	<brief_title>Can Earlier BCG Vaccination Reduce Early Infant Mortality? A Randomised Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: BCG and oral polio vaccines (OPV) at birth are associated with beneficial non-specific effects, reducing neonatal mortality by more than what can be explained by prevention of the target diseases. BCG is recommended at birth, but is often given much later, especially in rural areas. In two RCTs in Guinea-Bissau, BCG-at-birth reduced neonatal mortality in low birthweight (&lt;2500g; LBW) children by 48% (95%CI: 18-67%) and in children with a birthweight &gt;2500g (NBW), OPV+BCG vs BCG was associated with a 32% (95%CI: 0-55%) lower mortality. WHO recommends home visits shortly after birth to reduce mortality, but vaccinations are not normally provided. If the vaccines indeed have profound effects on innate immunity and neonatal mortality in both LBW and NBW children many lives could be saved if BCG and OPV was provided earlier. We will cluster randomise villages to home visits with and without vaccinations. All children participating in the study will be offered routine vaccines at village visits by the BHP team. Thereby the study will provide earlier vaccination for all children. Hypothesis: BCG+OPV at birth provided at village visits shortly after birth will reduce early infant mortality by 40%. Methods: The study will be conducted in Biombo, Oio and Cacheu in Guinea-Bissau, where home visits are not yet implemented. At two-monthly visits by the BHP team all registered pregnant women will be offered to participate in the study. Community key informants will communicate information on births in the village to the BHP study team, and the study nurse will visit every new-born child shortly after a CKI calls, if possible on the same day. Villages will be randomised to receive immediate vaccination of their children shortly after birth or at the first visit by the BHP team. Statistical analyses: All children registered during pregnancy will enter the study when they are visited at home or at 24 hours after birth whichever comes last, thereby excluding deaths on the day of birth. In the main analysis, survival of vaccinated children and unvaccinated children will be compared in Cox proportional hazards models with age as underlying time and censoring of follow-up on the date of the first visit by the BHP team when children in the control group will also be vaccinated. Similar to mortality, the incidence of consultations and hospital admissions will be compared in survival analysis with age as underlying time scale. All analyses will investigate whether the effect of BCG differs by sex. We will investigate whether the effect differs by scar status of the mother. In addition stratified analysis by age and weight at enrolment will be conducted. Guinea-Bissau has two distinct seasons, a dry season from December to May and a rainy season from June to November. We will assess whether the effect in the dry season (December-May) is stronger than the effect during the rest of the year. Nutritional status will be assessed by weight at the first home visit shortly after birth and the first visit after 6 weeks. We will compare the obtained weight at the different ages to the WHO growth reference to derive a z-score for weight-for-age[18] and evaluate the effect on early BCG on the weight-for-age during the first 6 weeks of life in linear regression models. The effect of BCG-at-birth on BCG scar formation and scar size will be assessed in logistic and linear regression models. All analysis will be adjusted for clustering. Sample size: In the rural areas in which the current study will be conducted, mortality between day 1 and day 42 is 2.9%. A recent trial in Ghana indicated that three home visits during the first week of life to promote essential new-born care practices and to weigh and assess children for danger signs was associated with an 8% (-12 to 25%) reduction in neonatal mortality. Assuming that our single home visit reduces the neonatal mortality by a maximum of 10%, and the effect of BCG+OPV is at least a 40% reduction in mortality we need to follow 4926 new-borns (power 80%; significance level 5%; one-sided; cluster design effect 1.1). We expect a 3% censoring due to migration, and we therefore need to enrol 5079 new-borns. In the study villages, the annual number of births is 2300 and 65% are vaccinated by BHP nurses.</detailed_description>
