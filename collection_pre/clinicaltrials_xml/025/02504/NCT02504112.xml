	<brief_summary>The objective of the observational study is to assess the positioning of customized guides designed from patients X-Rays (Zimmer® X-Ray PSI Knee) using optical navigation in primary total knee arthroplasty.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zimmer CAS PSI X-Ray Knee in TKA (Total Knee Arthroplasty)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed research is a single center, prospective, case series, and non-controlled study. One orthopedic surgeon will perform 30 primary TKAs using X-Ray PSI Knee guides, generated from X-ray. Patients who have been appropriately indicated as candidates for TKA and who meet the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be informed about Zimmer® X-Ray PSI Knee technology and offered entry into the study. Informed consent, in accordance with current ethical board regulatory requirements and best practice, will be obtained from all patients.</detailed_description>

Has hip or knee ankylosis. Have indications of intra and/or extraarticular deformations that would eliminate or tend to eliminate adequate implant support or prevent the use of an appropriately sized implant, such as polio, history of tibial plateau fracture, etc. Has any metal within 150 mm of the joint line for the operativeside knee. Has knee deformities greater than 15 degrees of fixed varus, valgus, or flexion contracture on initial physical examination. Is a female who is pregnant or lactating Is currently involvement in any personal injury litigation, medicallegal or worker's compensation claims Has arterial disease or stents that would exclude the use of a tourniquet.

Has a condition that would place excessive demands on the implant (e.g., Charcot's joints, muscle deficiencies, multiple joint disabilities, skeletal immaturity, etc.). Has collateral ligament insufficiency.
