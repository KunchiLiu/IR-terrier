	<brief_summary>Renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced injury is known to be associated with immediate and long-term hepatic dysfunction after liver transplantation. Protecting the liver against I/R injury and maintaining hepatic function during transplant surgery is therefore very important in order to improve post-operative outcome. This purpose of this study is to investigate whether propofol anesthesia done in both liver donors and recipients during living-donor liver transplantation is effective in reducing liver I/R injury via its antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties and improve post-transplant outcome compared to desflurane anesthesia.</brief_summary>
