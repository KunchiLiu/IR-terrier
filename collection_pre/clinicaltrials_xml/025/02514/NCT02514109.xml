	<brief_summary>The diagnosis of sensory neuronopathy is difficult to establish because the only certainty criterion is based on the detection of specific lesions in the posterior spinal ganglion which is usually not possible. There is to date no clinical and electrophysiological criteria or validated biomarker for the diagnosis of this type of neuropathy. In a retrospective study, we analyzed the files of patients with peripheral sensory neuronopathy certain and established clinical and electrophysiological diagnostic criteria for sensitive neuronopathy. We therefore wish now validate these criteria and investigate possible associated antibodies on a prospective cohort of patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All the patients (patient group and control) will be included in the study after giving their consent. The clinical, biological and electrophysiological data concerning the neuropathy will be collected. There is no specific follow-up for the study. Blood samples will be retrospectively analyzed for antibody screening.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>A :Patients Male or female patient aged 18 years or more with a clinically pure sensory neuropathy, abnormal ENMG in sensory nerves in more than one limb and complete etiological assessment allowing a diagnosis of sensory neuronopathy. B :Controls Male or female patient aged 18 years or more with a clinically pure sensory neuropathy, abnormal ENMG in sensory nerves in more than one limb and complete etiological assessment allowing a diagnosis of sensory neuropathy excluding a neuronopathy. Patient with a sensorymotor neuropathy or incomplete clinical evaluation</criteria>
