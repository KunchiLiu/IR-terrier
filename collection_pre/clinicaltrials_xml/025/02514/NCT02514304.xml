	<brief_title>Study of the Risk Factors and Outcomes After Gastrointestinal Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antithrombotic therapies are effective for prevention of cardiovascular (CV) events but cause bleeding. Emerging evidence indicates that extra-cranial bleeding is just as important as myocardial infarction as a marker of risk for subsequent non-fatal and fatal CV events, but this issue has not been prospectively studied. If the association between bleeding and CV events is causal, prevention of bleeding, by targeting the risk factors, and prevention of the complications of bleeding, by targeting the causal pathways, could substantially reduce the burden of bleeding-related CV events. Progress in developing these approaches has been limited by a knowledge gap. Known risk factors do not fully explain bleeding risk and the investigators do not understand the mechanisms linking bleeding with adverse outcome and whether the association is causal. One-half of bleeds that lead to CV events in patients receiving antithrombotic therapy arise in the GI tract. INTERBLEED- Pilot Hamilton Ontario plans to explore risk factors for GI bleeding, and outcomes after GI bleeding, in this well-circumscribed and important group using a case-control design with prospective 3 month and 12 month follow-up. Specific objectives are to: (1) identify risk factors for GI bleeding and estimate their population attributable risk; (2) determine the risk of non-fatal and fatal CV events and functional outcomes after GI bleeding; and (3) explore the possible mechanisms linking GI bleeding with CV outcome 300 case-control pairs from 4 centres in Hamilton, Ontario in Canada will be recruited over a 24-month period. Data will be collected on patient characteristics, medical history and, in cases, the work-up, management and outcomes after bleeding. Data from the INTERBLEED-Pilot Hamilton Ontario will inform the design of the larger study that ultimately will help to develop new approaches to reducing the burden of bleeding-related CV events.</detailed_description>
