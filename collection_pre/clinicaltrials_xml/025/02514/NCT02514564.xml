	<brief_title>The Effects of Aerobic Exercise in Microvascular Endothelium Function in Patients With Cardiovascular Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aerobic exercise training is well known to improve endothelium dependent vasodilatation in the microcirculation. However, the impact of exercise frequency on this response in patients with coronary artery disease remains unclear.</detailed_description>
