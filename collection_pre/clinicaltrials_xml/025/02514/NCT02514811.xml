	<brief_summary>The Northwest Coalition for Adolescent Health (NWCAH) replicated the Teen Outreach Program (TOP) in five states across the pacific northwest including Idaho, Alaska, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. The purpose of this study is to measure: at the end of the program year, were TOP students less likely than control group students to report ever being pregnant or causing someone to be pregnant?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Replication of the Teen Outreach Program in the Pacific Northwest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TOP is a youth development and service learning program for youth ages 12 to 17 designed to reduce teenage pregnancy and increase school success by helping youth develop a positive self-image, life management skills, and realistic goals. The TOP program model consists of three components implemented in school, after school, or in community settings over nine months: (1) weekly curriculum sessions, (2) community service learning, and (3) positive adult guidance and support. The TOP Changing Scenes Curriculum is separated into four age-/stage-appropriate levels, Level 1 is typically for youth ages 12 or 13 and Level 4 is typically for youth age 17. The curriculum focuses on the presence of a consistent, caring adult; a supportive peer group; skill development; sexual health; and sexual behavior choices. The intended program dosage for each participant is a minimum of 25 weekly sessions (one per week at 40-50 minutes each) and at least 20 hours of community service learning over nine months. One or two facilitators, who plan the order of sessions based on the needs and interest of youth, implemented TOP in a group of 10 to 25 youth. In this cluster randomized controlled trial, middle and high school students were randomly assigned at the class level into either the TOP treatment group or the CV control group. After class eligibility was determined, the TOP facilitator began the consent process. Both active parental consent and student assent were required for students to participate in the study. The consent process was the same regardless of whether TOP and CV programs were delivered in already-formed classes, as a pull-out during the school day, or after school. The parental consent form clearly stated that the student was eligible to participate in one of two programs, which would be determined by chance. In signing the form, the parent consented to participation in both the program and the evaluation. Random assignment of the classes did not technically occur until completion of the baseline administration of the survey, as students could have been either added or subtracted from the class list until the time of survey administration. No one outside of PRA was informed of the outcome of random assignment until after the baseline survey was administered. All students, TOP and CV, were followed for two years. They completed a total of three surveys (baseline, a post-survey at the end of the school year, and a follow-up survey in the spring of the year following the intervention). Data were collected in groups, with questionnaires being read aloud to students. When students were absent or moved, interviews were also completed on the telephone or students were given a link to complete their surveys online.</detailed_description>
