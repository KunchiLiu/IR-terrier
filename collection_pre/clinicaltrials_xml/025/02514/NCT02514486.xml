	<brief_summary>This study will describe patient-reported symptom burden and concerns, quality of life (QOL), and health behaviors of breast cancer(BC) survivors who have completed initial treatments (e.g., surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy), assess the feasibility of using a web-based platform to collect patient-reported outcome (PRO) data, and evaluate provider satisfaction following delivery of an electronic health record (HER)/EPIC summary of these PROs. Secondary aims will estimate differences in referral to available services between those providers exposed to the PRO summary and historical controls. BC survivors who have completed initial treatment and present within the first year following treatment for an end of treatment (EOT)/survivorship focused visit will be the focus of this study.</brief_summary>
