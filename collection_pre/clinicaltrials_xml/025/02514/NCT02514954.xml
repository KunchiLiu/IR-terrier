	<brief_summary>Each subject will be randomly allocated to a sequence of two treatments applied at two separate dosing visits. At each dosing visit subjects will be injected with individualised doses of either BioChaperone速 Combo or Humalog速 Mix 25 immediately before ingesting a standardised mixed meal [(t=0 min) start of the meal]. Insulin doses will be identical at both dosing visits of one individual and will be administered subcutaneously in the abdominal region. Subjects will be asked to consume a standardised meal (e.g. pizza) for dinner at home in the evening before each dosing visit. Subjects will attend the clinical site in a fasted state in the morning of each dosing day and stay at the clinical trial centre until 10-hour after dosing (standardised test-meal procedure has been terminated after 6h). The two dosing visits will be separated by a wash-out period of 5-15 days.</brief_summary>
