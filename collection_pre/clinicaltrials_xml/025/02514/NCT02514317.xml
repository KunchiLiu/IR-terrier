	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to evaluate in patients suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome resistant to medical treatment, clinical course after percutaneous treatment under ultrasound guidance. 40 patients will be included in the study. The following parameters will be evaluated: patient satisfaction, pain, functional disability, quality of life and time to return to work. The medico-economic aspect will be analyzed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Percutaneous Treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome With Scan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound analysis of Carpal tunnel is used for many years, especially for diagnostic purposes. Investigators have shown, first by a study of 104 cadavers that it was possible to reduce the opening by making the gesture under ultrasound guidance and to perform the procedure under local anesthesia. Then investigators performed an open study of 25 patients confirming the absence of iatrogenic lesions with this new technique. The percutaneous treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome under ultrasound guidance is a gesture of interventional radiology. One can envisage making this type of treatment in interventional radiology room which overcomes the operating room and thus reduce costs. The objective of the study is to continue the study of percutaneous treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome under ultrasound guidance by an open study conducted in interventional radiology room.</detailed_description>
