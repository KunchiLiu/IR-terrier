	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the Stimwave Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) System for treatment of chronic pain utilizing high frequency (10,000 Hz) waveforms in comparison to traditional stimulation settings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wireless High Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation for Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized study in which subjects will receive a Freedom SCS System and be randomized 1:1 to receive either HF (10,000 Hz) or LF (5 Hz to 1500 Hz) stimulation parameters. Enrollment will continue until 80 responders at end of trial have been identified. A description of the Freedom SCS System can be found in Appendix A. Subjects will have chronic back or back and leg pain refractory to standard medical treatment associated with Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS). Subjects will be randomized into either the test (high frequency) or control (low frequency) group for a 6-month period after a maximum one-month trial period. At the end of 6 months follow-up, all subjects will assess the outcomes of their appointed therapy and continue with long-term use of the system. Stimulators will be placed at the following sites to target the painful area: - High Frequency (HF) Group: Epidural Space midline covering vertebrae levels T8 through T11 (one stimulator placed at the top of T8 and the second stimulator placed at the middle of T9). - Low Frequency (LF) Group: Epidural Space covering vertebrae level determined by paresthesia mapping for painful area.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject is â‰¥ 18 years of age at time of informed consent; Subjects have been diagnosed with chronic back or back and leg pain with an average VAS &gt; 5 (on a 10 scale) over the course of the last month for back pain based on baseline pain diary; Subject diagnosis with chronic back or back and leg pain associated with FBSS refractory to conventional medical management for at least 12 months prior to enrollment; Based on the medical opinion of the Principal Investigator, subject has a stable pain medication regiment; Based on the medical opinion of the Principal Investigator, there is no evidence of anatomic abnormalities that could jeopardize the placement of the device or pose a hazard to the subject; Based on the opinion of the Principal Investigator, subject is willing and able to operate the patient programmer, recharging equipment, diary and has the ability to undergo study assessments and provide accurate responses; Based on the opinion of the implanter, subject is a good surgical subject for the implant procedure; Subject is willing to undergo surgical implant procedure, attend visits as scheduled, and comply with the study requirements; Subject is male or nonpregnant female; Subject is deemed to be neuropsychosocially appropriate for implantation therapies based of the assessment of a Clinical Psychologist, using facetoface encounters and the psychological testing described in the measures; Subject is capable of giving informed consent; Subject lives within reasonable distance from the study site (circumference of 50 miles). Obvious mechanical instability related to pain (diagnosed by imaging taken within the past 6 months); Unresolved Malignancies in last six months; Subject has postherpetic neuralgia (shingles); Subject has an active systemic infection or is immunecompromised; Based on the medical opinion of the Principal Investigator, Psychologist and/or Psychiatrist, the subject has other psychological conditions (e.g., psychosis, suicidal ideation, borderline personality disorder, somatization, narcissism), other health conditions (e.g., substance abuse, another chronic condition requiring the regular use of opioid medication), or other legal concerns that would preclude his/her enrollment in the study or potentially confound the results of the study; Subject is currently enrolled in or plans to enroll in any concurrent drug and/or device study while participating in this study; Insulindependent diabetic who is not controlled through diet and/or medication (determined by the physician) or noninsulin dependent diabetic who is not well controlled through diet and/or medication; Bleeding complications or coagulopathy issues; Pregnant/lactating or not using adequate birth control; A life expectancy of less than one year; Any active implanted device whether turned off or on; A previous SCS experience; Conditions requiring Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) evaluation or diathermy procedures.</criteria>
