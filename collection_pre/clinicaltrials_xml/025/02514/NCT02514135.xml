	<brief_summary>The aim of the proposed study is to determine the incidence and prevalence of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome in consecutive intensive care admissions using broad inclusion criteria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra-abdominal Hypertension in Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increased pressure within the abdominal cavity is particularly common in intensive care patients and has been shown to be an independent risk-factor for mortality in this patient population. The quoted rates of intra-abdominal hypertension of range anywhere from 20-60% are dependent on the population of patient studied. The prospective observational studies performed to date have been underpowered, used strict inclusion/exclusion criteria or were performed prior to consensus guidelines on the definition and measurement of intra-abdominal pressure and hypertension.</detailed_description>
