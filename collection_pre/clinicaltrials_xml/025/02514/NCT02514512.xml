	<brief_summary>A research study into a new technology for adjustment of the radiotherapy beam to account for movement of lung tumours as the patient breathes during radiotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lung Cancer Radiotherapy Using Realtime Dynamic Multileaf Collimator (MLC) Adaptation And Radiofrequency Tracking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty patients 18 years of age or more and undergoing Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) at Northern Sydney Cancer Centre for lung cancer will receive the new treatment. Participants will be physically able to undergo all aspects of treatment and intellectually able to provide written informed consent and complete questionnaires. Beacons will be implanted in the patients' lung to allow the Multi Leaf Collimator (MLC) tracking equipment to follow precisely the movement of the lung. The difference in ability to track tumour movement between MLC and the current standard method will be compared to identify changes in study outcomes. Audiovisual (AV) Biofeedback will also be used to regulate patients' breathing during radiotherapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged 18 or older Has provided written Informed Consent for participation in this trial and is willing to comply with the study Patients undergoing external beam radiotherapy at Northern Sydney Cancer Centre Histologically proven Stage I Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) oligometastatic lung metastases (3 or less). Histological diagnosis will be obtained if clinically indicated. MRI/4DCT prior to insertion of Calypso beacons Patient must be able to have Varian Calypso beacons placed in the lung (if on anticoagulants, must be cleared by Local Medical Officer (LMO) or cardiologist). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02 Body habitus enabling Calypso tracking (as per Calypso Determining a Patient's Localisation Designation &amp; Orientation before implantation) A maximum of three metastases to the lung from any nonhaematological malignancy. Multiple metastases will be treated separately. Tumour diameter â‰¤ = 5cm Previous highdose thoracic radiotherapy. Less than two Calypso beacons implanted in the lung. Calypso beacons are spaced by greater than 9cm or less than 1cm. Calypso beacons are less than 19cm from outer chest wall Cytotoxic chemotherapy within 3 weeks of commencement of treatment, or concurrently with treatment. Hormonal manipulation agents are allowable (e.g. aromatase inhibitors, selective oestrogen receptor modulators, and gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor modulators) Targeted agents (such as sunitinib, bevacizumab and tarceva) within 7 days of commencement of treatment, or concurrently with treatment Women who are pregnant or lactating.
