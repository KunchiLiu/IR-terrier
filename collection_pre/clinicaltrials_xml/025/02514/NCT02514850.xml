	<brief_summary>This is a single centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, 3-treatment, 3-period cross-over, euglycaemic clamp study in subjects with type 2 diabetes on stable insulin treatment. Each subject will be randomly allocated to a treatment sequence and will be administered single subcutaneous doses of 0.8 U/kg Biochaperone® Combo, 0.8 U/kg Humalog® Mix25 or simultaneous subcutaneous injections of 0.2 U/kg Humalog® and 0.6 U/kg Lantus® during three separate dosing visits.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (as diagnosed clinically) for ≥ 12 months HbA1c levels ≤ 9.0% Total insulin dose of &lt; 1.2 U/kg/day Body mass index between 20.0 and 35.0 kg/m2 (both inclusive) Body weight ≤ 125.0 kg Fasting serum Cpeptide ≤ 1 nmol/L Treated with a stable insulin regimen for ≥ 3 months prior to screening Type 1 diabetes mellitus Known or suspected allergy to the trial products or related products Previous participation in this trial. Participation is defined as randomised Participation in any clinical trial within 3 months prior to this trial Clinically significant abnormal haematology, biochemistry, lipids, or urinalysis screening tests, as judged by the Investigator considering the underlying disease Supine blood pressure at screening outside the range of 90160 mmHg for systolic or 5095 mmHg for diastolic and/or resting supine heart rate outside the range 50 90 beats per minute. This exclusion criterion also pertains to subjects being on antihypertensives Use of GLP1 receptor agonists or oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) other than stable intake of metformin within 4 weeks prior to screening Women of child bearing potential, not willing to use contraceptive methods</criteria>
