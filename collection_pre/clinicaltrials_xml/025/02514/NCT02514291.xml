	<brief_title>Sleep Intervention for Pediatric Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep problems are more prevalent and serious in children with epilepsy whose sleep can be disrupted by seizures occurring during the night and/or during the day. Inadequate sleep has long been recognized as a trigger for seizure and poor sleep habits have been associated with unfavorable outcomes in children with epilepsy. Attention to sleep in children with epilepsy as a result is critically important for seizure control and health-related quality of life.</detailed_description>
