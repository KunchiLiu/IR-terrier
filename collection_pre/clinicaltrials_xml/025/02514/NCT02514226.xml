	<brief_summary>Background: Association between periodontal disease (PD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been widely studied and the aspiration of periodontal pathogens is one of the most accepted causal mechanisms for pulmonary exacerbation. Bronchiectasis is clinically quite similar with COPD, including chronic administration of antibiotics, increased systemic inflammation and relatively similar clinical symptoms, but for the time being; there are no studies that have correlated this condition to PD. This study will evaluate if the scaling and root planning (SRP) associated with photodynamic therapy improves periodontal clinical parameters, halitosis, and the quantity of microorganisms associated with exacerbation of bronchiectasis in saliva, subgingival periodontal microenvironment, sputum and nasal lavage at baseline, after 3 months and one year of SRP. Methods/Design: Ninety patients with chronic periodontal disease and bronchiectasis will be enrolled in the study and they will be treated as follow:G1 control (n = 30) - supragingival scaling (SS) and dental hygiene orientation (DHO); G2 experimental (n = 30) - SRP + DHO; G3- experimental (n = 30) - SRP + PDT + DHO. The quantification of bacterial groups commonly associated with exacerbation of bronchiectasis (P aeruginosa, S. aureus) and periodontal diseases (P. gingivalis), will be evaluated in periodontal pockets, saliva, nasal lavage and sputum by quantitative PCR at baseline 3 months and one year after the SRP. G1 patients will receive SRP upon completion of the investigation. If the mean depth of probing of this group worsen (&gt; 1mm) at 3 months they will be excluded from the study, treated (SRP) and the data will be described. Discussion: The results of this protocol will determine the efficacy of periodontal treatment in decreasing the total amount microorganisms in saliva periodontal pocket, sputum and nasal lavage, the most probable niches of bronchiectasis exacerbation, and reducing local inflammation and halitosis after 3 months and one year. It is expected an higher improvement in all parameters measured over 3 months and 1 year for G3</brief_summary>
