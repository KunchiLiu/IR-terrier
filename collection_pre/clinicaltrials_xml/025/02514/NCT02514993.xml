	<brief_summary>- Analysis of patient data and computed tomography scan of polytraumatized patients thoracic spine fractures - A concomitant sternal fracture was identified an indicator for an unstable thoracic spine fracture</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Unstable Thoracic Cage Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies stated, that sternal fractures can be regarded as an indicator for thoracic spine fractures and described the combined injury pattern of thoracic spine fracture and sternal fracture as "upper thoracic cage injury". But literature research is lacking data that in patients with a thoracic cage injury a highly unstable thoracic spine fracture can be expected. In a large cohort of 130 patients with a thoracic spine fracture and concomitant sternal fracture the investigators analyzed the injury pattern and evaluated associated injuries, trauma mechanism, and clinical outcome. The investigators could prove that in patients with a thoracic cage injury the concomitant sternal fracture may be regarded as an indicator for an unstable thoracic spine fracture, which requires surgical stabilization. Furthermore the analysis revealed that even a highly rotationally unstable type C fracture has to be expected, if sternal and thoracic spine fractures are located in the same segment.</detailed_description>
