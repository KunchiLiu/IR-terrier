	<brief_summary>Electrical velocimetry (EV) is one of the latest adaptions of impedance cardiography showing diverging results. With electrode position being a suspected factor influencing measurement accuracy or reproducibility for impedance cardiography in general, no data is currently available on altering the gap of the two lower electrodes in EV. Reference values were determined using the non-invasive gold-standard cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR).</brief_summary>
