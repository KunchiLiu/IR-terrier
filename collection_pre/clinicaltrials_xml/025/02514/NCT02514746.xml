	<brief_summary>This study aims to understand the persistence of the Japanese encephalitis (JE) antibody response in previously vaccinated children. The proposed study is a phase 4 open-label trial enrolling up to 818 Bangladeshi children who had previously participated in a lot to lot consistency study (JEV05) of JE live attenuated SA 14-14-2 vaccine (CD-JEV).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Immunogenicity After Receipt of JE Vaccine and Antibody Response and Safety to a Booster Dose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participants previously immunized with CD-JEV (Clinical Trials identifier: NCT01567865, JEV05) will have serum collected three and four years after initial vaccination to assess long-term immunogenicity. Four years after receiving the initial dose of CD-JEV, eligible participants will be vaccinated with a second subcutaneous dose of CD-JEV to assess the antibody response. Participants will be monitored for safety for 28 days following receipt of the booster dose.</detailed_description>
