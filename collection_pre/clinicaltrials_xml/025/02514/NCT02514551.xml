	<criteria>The participant has a diagnosis of gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. The participant has disease progression during or within 4 months after last dose of firstline chemotherapy or during or within 6 months after the last dose of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. The participant received combination chemotherapy, which must include a platinum and/or a fluoropyrimidine and must not include a taxane or antiangiogenic agent. The disease is evaluable by imaging per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1. The participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. The participant has adequate organ function: Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤3 × ULN. If the liver has tumor involvement, AST and ALT &lt;5 × ULN. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 × ULN or calculated creatinine clearance ≥50 milliliters/minute. Urinary protein is &lt;2+. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 10^9/liter (L), platelets ≥100 × 10^9/L, and hemoglobin ≥9 grams/deciliter (5.58 millimoles/L). International normalized ratio ≤1.5 × ULN and partial thromboplastin time ≤5 seconds above ULN. The participant has an estimated life expectancy of minimum 12 weeks. The participant has resolution to Grade 1 or less by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0, of all clinically significant toxic effects of previous therapy. The participant, if male, is sterile or agrees to use a reliable method of birth control. The participant, if female, is surgically sterile, is postmenopausal, or agrees to use a highly effective method of birth control. The participant, if female and of childbearing potential, must have a negative pregnancy test. The participant is receiving therapy with any of the following: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Other antiplatelet agents; Aspirin use at doses up to 325 milligrams (mg)/day is permitted. The participant received radiotherapy within 14 days prior to randomization. The participant received previous chemotherapy with a cumulative dose of &gt;900 mg per meter squared (mg/m^2) of epirubicin or &gt;400 mg/m^2 of doxorubicin. The participant has documented brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease. The participant has a significant bleeding disorder or vasculitis. The participant experienced any arterial thromboembolic event within 6 months. The participant has symptomatic congestive heart failure or symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia. The participant has uncontrolled hypertension, despite antihypertensive intervention. The participant underwent major surgery within 28 days. The participant has a history of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula within 6 months. The participant has a history of inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn's disease requiring medical intervention within 12 months. The participant has bowel obstruction or history of chronic diarrhea that is considered clinically significant. The participant has either of the following: Childpugh B or C cirrhosis. The participant has a serious illness or medical condition including: Human immunodeficiency virus infection. The participant has a concurrent active malignancy other than the following: Nonmelanomatous skin cancer. In situ carcinoma of the cervix or other noninvasive carcinoma or in situ neoplasm. The participant has a serious nonhealing: (a) wound, (b) peptic ulcer, or (c) bone fracture. The participant experienced any Grade 3 or 4 venous thromboembolic event that is not adequately treated.</criteria>
