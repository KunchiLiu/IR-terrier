	<brief_summary>Cold snare polypectomy (CSP) is now common practice and has proven to be a safe and effective technique for removal of diminutive polyps. Both thick and thin wire snares are now commonly used for CSP. However, because of their physical characteristics, thick wire snares might leave a higher percentage of residual adenoma at the resection site. Since this may result in a higher risk of recurrence, the technique needs to be optimized. Experts have suggested that a thin wire snare might be more efficient, with a lower risk of residual adenoma at the resection site and consequently a lower risk of recurrence and interval cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thin Wire Versus Thick Wire Snare for Cold Snare Polypectomy of Diminutive Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 90% of polyps are smaller than 10 mm. Given the risk of transformation of adenomas into invasive cancer over years, it is important that these adenomas are completely resected. This will be a double-blind, prospective, randomized controlled trial. All eligible patients referred for a colonoscopy will be able to participate. There will be 2 treatment arms, one arm will be treated with a thin wire snare and the other with a thick wire snare. Patients will be randomised through a computer generated programme and blinded for the type of snare used. The treatment arm will be disclosed to the proceduralist after introduction of the colonoscope into the rectum. After resection of the polyp the defect will be carefully examined by the proceduralist. In case of suspicion of residual adenomatous tissue, a re-excision will be performed. If there's a protrusion noticeable at the resection site, this will be biopsied. Ultimately, the margins of the defect will be biopsied on either side for histological confirmation of complete removal.</detailed_description>
