Prolonged pregnancy is diagnosed if 41 gestational weeks are completed according to accurate date of last menstrual period and first trimester ultrasound. All patients who accepted to join the study gave informed consent. All patients had a complete physical and obstetrical examination. Vital signs were recorded at regular intervals. The primary outcome measure was defined as cesarean section rates in pregnancies complicated with isolated oligohydramnios managed by induction of labor.</detailed_description>
