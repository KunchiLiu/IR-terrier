	<brief_title>Use of the Scolioscan for Quantitative Evaluation of Spinal Deformity - A Validity Study on Patients With Scoliosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scoliosis is a three dimensional spinal deformity, in both the coronal plane, sagittal and transverse planes. Quantitative assessment of curve severity in scoliosis is important for patient management. At present, Cobb angle measurement in the frontal plane using standing postero-anterior X-ray radiograph is the gold standard for scoliosis evaluation. Taking x-ray involves irradiation and is not without risk especially over repeated exposures for follow-up visits. With advancement of ultrasound technology which is radiation-free and noted to be useful as a tool for musculoskeletal imaging, an ultrasound system designed for evaluation of spinal deformity called Scolioscan has been developed. It comprises of a freehand 3D ultrasound imaging system with an enhanced frame structure for supporting the patient to maintain the posture during scanning and a software for measuring curve deformity in terms of Cobb angles. Previous studies on validity of ultrasound assessment for back deformity involved a pilot group of subjects. Based on these promising pilot results, we plan to carry out a formal study to investigate the validity of Scolioscan for quantitative assessment of curve severity in scoliosis using x-ray radiograph as the gold standard for comparison.</detailed_description>
