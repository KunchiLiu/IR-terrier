	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib works in treating patients with stage IV melanoma of the skin that has not responded to previous treatment. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib in Treating Patients With Refractory Stage IV Cutaneous Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate rate of objective response (OR: complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) to ibrutinib administered as single agent in patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-refractory and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor-refractory (if B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase [BRAF]V600-mutant) distant metastatic cutaneous melanoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate progression-free survival (PFS) after initiation of ibrutinib in patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-refractory and MAPK inhibitor-refractory (if BRAFV600-mutant) distant metastatic cutaneous melanoma. II. Estimate overall survival (OS) after initiation of ibrutinib in patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-refractory and MAPK inhibitor-refractory (if BRAFV600-mutant) distant metastatic cutaneous melanoma. III. Explore the association of ITK protein expression with OR and PFS. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Explore association between other putative targets of ibrutinib (e.g. Tec, ErbB4, Hck, Yes, BTK) in melanoma cells, as assessed by 2-color IF in representative tissue sections obtained from pretreatment archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks or FFPE blocks obtained from fresh tissue biopsy from enrolled patients, with OR and PFS. II. Explore ibrutinib-mediated effect(s) on immune cell subsets associated with immunomodulation by performing multiparameter flow cytometric analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) obtained prior to treatment, on day 29 (i.e., predose day 1 of cycle 2) following initiation of treatment with ibrutinib, and at the time of disease progression (3 time points). OUTLINE: Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 1 year.</detailed_description>
