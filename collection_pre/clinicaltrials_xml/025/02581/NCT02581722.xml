	<brief_summary>A new Male Circumcision (MC) device, PrePex, has shown great promise as a way to radically shift the MC landscape. PrePex is an innovative circumcision device requiring no injected anesthesia, sutures, or sterile settings. Moreover, it is designed for use by minimally skilled healthcare professionals rather than surgeons. Two initial studies conducted in Rwanda in 2010 and 2011 demonstrated an excellent safety profile when the procedure was performed by skilled physicians</brief_summary>
