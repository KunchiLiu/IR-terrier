	<brief_summary>To establish a recommended dose of BAY1862864 Injection and to investigate how the study drug acts in the body, on the cancer cells and how safe it is in patients with advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Tolerability of BAY1862864 Injection in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory CD22-positive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be divided into two parts: a "dose-escalation part" to evaluate safety profile and to explore the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and an "expansion part" to evaluate further the safety and tumor response profile of BAY1862864 Injection at the selected dose.</detailed_description>
