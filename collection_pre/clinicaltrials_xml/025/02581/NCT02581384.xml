	<brief_summary>This research study is studying stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as a possible treatment for lung relapse of Ewing Sarcoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma, or Wilms Tumor. SBRT is a form of targeted radiotherapy that can treat very small tumors using a few large doses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) for Pulmonary Metastases in Ewing Sarcoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma, and Wilms Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is a Pilot Study, also known as a Phase I-II study, which means it is the first time investigators are examining this study intervention for patients with lung recurrence of Ewing Sarcoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma, or Wilms Tumor. This study tests the most appropriate dose, safety and efficacy of SBRT for the treatment of lung recurrence of Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, or Ewing sarcoma in children. Standard radiotherapy is typically used to treat Ewing sarcoma and is used to treat lung recurrence. SBRT is being used to treat adults with small inoperable lung cancers; in such cases, SBRT has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated. SBRT is also used to treat bone metastases in adults and children.</detailed_description>
