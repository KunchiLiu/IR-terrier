	<brief_summary>This study is to provide evidence of the effectiveness as well as the influence of adherence on treatment outcome of Paritaprevir/ritonavir, Ombitasvir, +/- Dasabuvir, (the ABBVIE REGIMEN) ± Ribavirin (RBV) in a real world setting of hepatitis C virus infected clinical practice populations across Belgium. The study may also help identify predictive factors of response that are important in real world treatment settings. In addition, it will provide data on the impact of adherence on treatment outcomes in everyday settings, which may help treating physicians to improve the management of participants under their care.</brief_summary>
