	<brief_summary>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the device which increases the supply of oxygen to the body tissues in vitro and to assist in heart and lung function. Venoarterial (VA) ECMO is used in patients with cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmia and is able to secure a time to self-recovery by reducing the excessive stimulation applied to the heart. However, in ECMO patients, pharmacokinetics of drugs are changing such as increased volume of distribution (Vd) or decreased clearance (CL). For this reason, it is hard to provide the best treatment in ECMO patients. The study is to evaluate whether the PK of drugs is influenced by VA ECMO and to recommend the optimal dosing strategies for proposed drugs in adult patients receiving VA ECMO.</brief_summary>
