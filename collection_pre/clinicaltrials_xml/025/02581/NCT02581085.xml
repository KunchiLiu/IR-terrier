	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase IIA trial is to validate the outcome observed in the Phase I trial that oral TCT attenuates the rise in MELD over time in patients diagnosed with NAFLD, NASH or chronically infected hepatitis C. Subjects will participate for 3 years. They will be asked to come to 8 total study visits and will receive 6 follow-up phone calls within the 3 years of participation. Subjects will be asked to take 2 study capsules of vitamin E Tocotrienol (200mg) twice a day or 2 placebo capsules twice a day. The study is randomized and study staff will be blinded to randomization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liver Trial on Oral Tocotrienol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As a safe and natural vitamin, tocotrienol (TCT) stands uniquely poised to treat ~500 million worldwide who suffer from viral hepatitis. Furthermore, for those awaiting liver transplantation, TCT may buy more time until a liver becomes available. The primary purpose of this Phase IIA trial is to validate the outcome observed in the limited sample size Phase I trial (n=6) that oral TCT attenuates the rise in MELD over time in patients with NAFLD, NASH, or Hepatitis C. Outcomes will direct the design of a multi-center Phase IIB trial. Study participation will last 3 years. Subjects will be seen for an initial visit, at which consent will be obtained and baseline labs drawn, followed by a Randomization visit 2-14 days later after MELD criteria have been confirmed. If the acceptable labs have not been drawn per standard of care to calculate a MELD score within 90 days before the initial visit, the subject will complete the initial visit as planned, but will then return for a repeat lab draw 60 days later to confirm MELD criteria for eligibility before continuing to the randomization visit. Enrollment occurs when a subject meets all criteria and is randomized into one of the treatment groups. Subjects will then be seen in the research office by research personnel at 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 18 months, 2 years, and 3 years. Subjects will receive follow-up phone calls at 9 months, 15 months, 21 months, 27 months, 30 months, and 33 months. Subject compliance with supplements will be closely followed, as compliance is critical for accurate data. Given the small sample size, subjects who are less than 75% compliant at two consecutive study visits will be discontinued from the study. Subjects will be discontinued if their MELD score increases by more than 25% between 2 consecutive visits or if they receive an organ transplant. Subjects will be declared lost to follow-up (LTFU) if a study visit is unable to be scheduled and completed after 4 documented attempts to contact a subject with no response. In this circumstance, a certified letter will be mailed to the subject's last known address; if no response is received, the subject is LTFU. All subjects discontinued or LTFU before the end of 1 year of study participation will be replaced (see protocol to review study visit activities that will occur). At the Randomization Visit, enrolled subjects will be randomized into one of two treatment groups in a 1:1 manner. Group 1: Placebo vehicle; (2) placebo capsules following AM meal, (2) placebo capsules following PM meal Group 2: 800mg TCT; (2) 200mg TCT capsules following AM meal, (2) 200mg TCT capsules following PM meal</detailed_description>
