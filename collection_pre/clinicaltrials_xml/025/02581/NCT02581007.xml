	<brief_summary>This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a reduced intensity allogeneic HSCT from partially HLA-mismatched first-degree relatives utilizing PBSC as the stem cell source. The primary objective of the study is to estimate the incidence of graft rejection and acute GVHD. A secondary objective will be to estimate the incidence of the relapse, NRM, OS, chronic GVHD and EFS.</brief_summary>
