	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the application of a negative pressure dressing intraoperatively (Prevena; KCI, Inc) to vascular groin incisions decreases the wound complication rate in high risk patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevena Vascular Groin Wound Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study randomizes patients (1:1) considered high risk, according to a specific set of risk factors, for wound complications into standard post-op dressings vs. Prevena vacuum dressing. The wounds will then be assessed for wound complications in the 30 days postoperatively. Wound complications include breakdown, infection and lymph leak. Patients not considered high risk will have standard post-op dressings and followed similarly to controls. The investigators will also assess economic impact of negative pressure dressing on length of stay and overall inpatient costs.</detailed_description>
