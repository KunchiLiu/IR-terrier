	<brief_summary>Evaluation of the rate of sustained virological response among HBeAg-negativechronic hepatitis B patients who discontinue long-term NA therapy. During this study participants will cease their prescribed medications, this will occur with immediate effect once enrolled into the study. The duration of cessation will be indefinite, unless clinically indicated for NA therapy re-start. Participants will be monitored as per protocol following cessation, monitoring will be by clinic visit and through blood test to monitor virological response. Clinical visits will be at the intervals of week 2, week, 4, week 8, week 12, week 18, following this they will be every 3 months out to 2 years when the participant will have completed the trial. Once the participant has completed the trial they will not commence again, the aim is for an indefinite cessation of NA therapy.</brief_summary>
