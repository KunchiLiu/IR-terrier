	<brief_summary>This research trial studies metabolic changes in blood samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Studying samples of blood from patients with acute myeloid leukemia in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about cancer and the development of drug resistance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Changes in Blood Samples From Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the metabolic adaptations that occur following exposure to standard chemotherapeutic agents using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples for analysis via cell isolation, glycolytic flux and oxygen consumption assays, viability assays, and western blot at baseline, 24, 48, and 72 hours after starting chemotherapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients scheduled to initiate chemotherapy for either an initial diagnosis of AML or relapsed AML Total white blood cell count &gt; 1000/mcl AND &gt;= 50% leukemic cells in the peripheral blood, as determined by automated differential Only patients starting the initial induction phase of therapy are eligible Patients who have already received 1 or more doses of chemotherapy for their present diagnosis will be excluded Prior exposure to hydroxyurea is acceptable but must be noted at the time of sample collection Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign an institutional review board (IRB)approved informed consent document in order to participate in this study</criteria>
