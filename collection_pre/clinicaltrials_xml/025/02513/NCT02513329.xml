	<brief_summary>Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) affect up to 65% of breast cancer survivors and negatively impact their quality of life. The investigators aim to evaluate the benefit of SGB in symptomatic women with breast cancer who are on anti-estrogens and are seeking relief from moderate to very severe VMS that are adversely affecting health and wellbeing. Women with breast cancer on Tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) or Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMS) with moderate to very severe VMS will be enrolled as participants in this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB) For Women for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses: The frequency and intensity of subjective and objective VMS will be significantly lower in women randomized to active SGB as compared to sham controls. Mood, memory, cognition, sleep, and quality of life will all be improved in the treatment group as compared to the sham-control group. Specific Goals and Objectives: Goal 1: To determine the effect of stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) for reducing subjective and objective VMS in women with breast cancer on tamoxifen, AIs, or SERMs Goal 2: To evaluate the effect of SGB on mood, memory, cognition, sleep and quality of life in women with breast cancer on tamoxifen, AIs, or SERMs. We aim to conduct a randomized, single-site, sham-control clinical trial of SGB on VMS in 30 women with breast cancer on anti-estrogen therapy (15 per group). The primary entry criterion will be 28 or more moderate to very severe hot flashes per week. VMS will be measured by self-report on a written daily dairy over a 6-month period. Secondary outcomes include changes in mood, sleep, quality of life, and objective hot flashes measured by ambulatory monitoring (skin-conductance temperature monitoring) for 24 hours at baseline, three months and six months. Memory performance with neurocognitive testing will be done at baseline and 3 months.</detailed_description>
