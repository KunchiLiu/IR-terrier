	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized (2:1) controlled study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the LARIAT System to percutaneously isolate and ligate the Left Atrial Appendage from the left atrium as an adjunct to planned pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) catheter ablation in the treatment of subjects with symptomatic persistent or longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation. This study will be conducted in two stages: - Limited Early Stage (Stage 1): up to 175 subjects at up to 50 sites - Pivotal Stage (Stage 2): up to 600 subjects at up to 50 sites All patients from both stages will be included in the primary analysis.</brief_summary>

Left atrial appendage LARIATapproach width ≥ 40 mm; or 2. Left atrial appendage distal apex extending posterior to the ostium of the appendage. Left atrial appendage positioned behind the pulmonary artery; or All other left atrial morphology: Left atrial appendage LARIAT approach width &gt; 45 mm. Based on a periprocedural imaging (transesophageal echocardiography) at time of LARIAT or catheter ablation) and confirmed by institution's designated LARIAT echocardiographer: Intracardiac thrombus; or Significant mitral valve stenosis (i.e., mitral valve stenosis &lt; 1.5cm2)</criteria>
