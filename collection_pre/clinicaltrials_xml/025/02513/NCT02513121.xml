	<brief_summary>This is an investigator initiated study being conducted in equal numbers at two sites, UC San Diego and Emory University. The purpose of this study is to understand the potential of a low sugar diet for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children. Forty boys with NAFLD will be randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a habitual diet control group. The intervention will be a low sugar diet for a period of 8 weeks. The effect of this dietary change will be assessed using advanced MRI testing to measure liver fat.</brief_summary>
