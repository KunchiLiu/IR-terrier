	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot research trial studies how well Eat, Move, Live (EML) works in reducing chronic disease risk in medically vulnerable communities. Obesity, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity are linked to increased cancer risk, especially hormone-related cancer (example, breast cancer). Improving healthy lifestyle practices, namely increasing physical activity and encouraging healthy eating behaviors may reduce the risk of getting cancer and chronic disease.</brief_summary>
