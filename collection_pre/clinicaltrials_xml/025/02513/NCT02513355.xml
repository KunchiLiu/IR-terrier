	<detailed_description>1.Research purpose: Degree of continuous intravenous pumping Endostar (human recombinant endostatin) combination chemotherapy regimens including cisplatin two medicine first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (with the exception of EGFR/ALK mutations) efficacy and safety. 2.1 main objectives: PFS 2.2 the secondary goal: 2.2. 1 ORR, DCR and OS 2.2. 2 the quality of life 3. The study design 3.1 research nature This is a single arm, multicenter clinical study, is expected to total 100 patients into the group. Hierarchical factors include: the tumor staging (Ⅲ B vs Ⅳ), ECOG score (0 v 1), gender (male vs female). 3.2 research center and research Proposed by taizhou people's hospital and medical association of jiangsu province tumor chemotherapy and biological branch of the lung cancer group led by several large and medium-sized hospitals in the province of the malignant tumor treatment related department to participate, in accordance with the unified test plan of this research.</detailed_description>

If the pregnancy test from the first time for more than 7 days, is the need for urine pregnancy test validation (within 7 days before the first delivery). prior to biological agents, especially e. coli genetically engineered products without severe allergic reactions; signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria pregnancy, nursing mothers, or fertility but not women using contraception; the existing serious acute infection, and not be controlled; Or fester sex and chronic infection, wound in delay no more; the original serious heart disease, including: higher risk of congestive heart failure, unable to control arrhythmia, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, severe valvular heart disease, and resistant hypertension; is not easy to control nerve, mental illness or mental disorders, compliance is poor, can't cooperate with accounts and response to treatment; Primary brain tumors or CNS metastases illness did not get a control, has obvious symptoms in cranial hypertension or nerve spirit; with bleeding tendency; other researchers believe that patients should not participate in this test.</criteria>
