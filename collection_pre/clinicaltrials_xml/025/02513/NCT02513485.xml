	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn more about the changes that happen in the brain and the body when a person is depressed. This study will determine if the level of inflammation in the body is related to symptoms of depression, how well the person thinks, and how certain brain regions communicate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inflammation-related Alterations in Neurocircuitry: Reversal With Levodopa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytokines released by an activated immune system have been associated with decreased brain dopamine and the development of depression. Biomarkers of inflammation, such as inflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins like C-reactive protein (CRP), are elevated in a significant proportion of patients with mood and psychiatric disorders. The investigators will study if administration of Levodopa (L- 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine [DOPA]-carbidopa, 250/25mg) to depressed patients with high inflammation will 1) increase corticostriatal functional connectivity, and 2) improve objective measures of motivation compared to placebo.</detailed_description>
