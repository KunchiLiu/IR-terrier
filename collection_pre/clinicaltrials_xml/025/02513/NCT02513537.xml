	<brief_summary>The ESA is currently preparing a guideline on the management of postoperative delirium (POD), which attempts to reduce the impact of postoperative delirium and provide recommendations for prevention, diagnostics and treatment of delirium outside the intensive care unit. The guidelines are going to be published during 2015. While the guideline provides recommendations for daily practice, assessment of current practice and knowledge is of utmost importance, because the implementation and the measurement of a change in clinical practice will be dependent on these measurements. This Survey has been approved by the Scientific and Research Committees of the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA), the Media Committee of the ESA, as well as the institutional ethical committee of Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</brief_summary>
