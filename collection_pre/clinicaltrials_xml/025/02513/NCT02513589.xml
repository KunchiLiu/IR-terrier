	<brief_summary>Evaluating an innovative molecular imaging technique to visualize inflammation of the atherosclerotic plaque in patients with a recent ischemic stroke (&lt;15 days) with carotid stenosis&gt; 50%, by performing a Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) with PBR06 18F, a tracer for Translocator protein (TPSO).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>More than one third of cerebral ischemic events are related to an atheromatous plaque. Inflammation, through a key player, the macrophage, is associated with increased metabolic activity of atherosclerotic plaque and its possible rupture. Inflammation within the plate is thus a marker of instability. These data underscore the importance of a prospective evaluation of inflammation with specific imaging with PET tracers inflammation.</detailed_description>
