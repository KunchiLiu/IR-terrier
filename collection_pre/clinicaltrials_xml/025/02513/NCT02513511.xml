	<brief_summary>Awake intubation is a recommended safety procedure in specific cases where the intubation or ventilation before general anesthesia is at risk. Numerous techniques to allow awake intubation have been described, such as pure awake technique, local anesthetics or intravenous sedation for example. Hypnosis is used for various operating room techniques and surgeries. The investigators aim to analyze the feasibility of awake laryngoscopy and intubations on patients placed under hypnosis alone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Awake intubation is a recommended safety procedure in specific cases where the intubation or ventilation before general anesthesia is at risk. Numerous techniques to allow awake intubation have been described, such as pure awake technique, local anesthetics or intravenous sedation for example. Hypnosis is used for various operating room techniques and surgeries. The investigators aim to analyze the feasibility of awake laryngoscopy and intubations on patients placed under hypnosis alone. Once patient will consent to be enrolled in the study, the same physician, trained in hypnosis, will accompany the patient in the operating room and place him into a hypnotic state. Once this hypnotic state is achieved, an oro-tracheal laryngoscopy will be performed with an Airtraq videolaryngoscope by an experienced anesthetist, specialised in the management of the difficult airway. If conditions allow it, the laryngoscopy will be followed by an oro-tracheal intubation. A questionnaire assessing objective and subjective criteria from the patient and from the airway specialist will be collected.</detailed_description>
