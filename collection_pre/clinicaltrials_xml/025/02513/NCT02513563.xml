	<criteria>Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures Histologic or cytological diagnosis of Squamous Cell Lung Cancer (SQCLC) with advanced/metastatic stage, with no known curative treatment options. Prior platinumcontaining adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or definitive chemoradiation therapy given for locally advanced disease is considered first line therapy only if recurrent (local or metastatic) disease developed within 6 months of completing therapy. Potential participants with recurrent disease &gt; 6 months will be eligible. Female or male aged &gt;/= 18 years Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0/1 Prior chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting is allowed Prior radiotherapy is allowed Prior Immunotherapy with PD1i, PDL1i, antiCTLA 4 or vaccines is allowed Must have normal organ and marrow function Have archival tissue available or undergo a fresh biopsy where clinically feasible after discussion with the sponsor Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and women who are breast feeding are excluded from the study. Both women and men should be fully informed of the lack of reproductive toxicity testing, and women must have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrolment. Progressive, symptomatic untreated brain metastases Pregnancy or breast feeding A serious uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection that in the investigator's opinion would impair the participant's ability to receive study treatment Prior use of platinum or paclitaxel for stage IV Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) or concurrent use of other anticancer approved or investigational agents Known Hepatitis B or C or HIV infection Second primary malignancy, other than in situ malignancies or adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin or other malignancy treated at least 2 years previously with no evidence of recurrence Have had prescription or nonprescription drugs or other products (i.e., grapefruit juice) known to be sensitive to CYP3A4 substrates or CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, or to be moderate to strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, which cannot be discontinued 2 weeks before Day 1 of dosing and withheld throughout the study until 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug Coadministration of aprepitant and fosaprepitant during this study is prohibited AZD1775 is an inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). The use of statins including Atorvastatin which are substrates for BCRP are therefore prohibited and patients should be moved on to nonBCRP alternatives. Herbal preparations are not allowed throughout the study. These herbal medications include, but are not limited to: St. John's wort, kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, and ginseng.</criteria>
