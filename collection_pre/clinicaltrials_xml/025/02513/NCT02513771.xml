	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether sitagliptin (Januvia is the brand name for sitagliptin) reduces inflammation and immune activation markers in HIV-infected men and women when compared to a placebo (inactive medication like a dummy pill). The study will evaluate whether taking 100 mg of sitagliptin by mouth daily for 16 weeks is safe and effective for HIV-infected persons on antiretroviral therapy (ART) who do not have diabetes. Sitagliptin is a medication that is used to treat people with diabetes (high blood sugar) but also may reduce inflammation in the body.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Documented HIV1 infection. Currently on an antiretroviral regimen consisting of at least 2 NRTIs and either a protease inhibitor boosted with low dose ritonavir, an integrase inhibitor, or an NNRTI. (Other ART regimens may be acceptable. Sites must consult the protocol team for approval) Currently on continuous ART for ≥48 weeks prior to study entry with no interruption longer than 7 consecutive days during that period. Plasma HIV1 RNA levels below 75 copies/mL for at least 48 weeks prior to study entry. The participant must have a minimum of two values in the last 48 weeks obtained &gt;30 days apart, with the most recent value obtained within 90 days prior to entry. (Single determinations that are between the assay quantification limit and 500 copies/mL (i.e., "blips") are allowed as long as the preceding and subsequent determinations are below the level of quantification). CD4+ cell count ≥100 cells/mm3 obtained within 90 days prior to study entry. The following laboratory values obtained within 90 days prior to entry. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥750/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL Platelet count ≥50,000/mm3 Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥60 mL/min as estimated by the CockroftGault formula NOTE: Calculation for the CockcroftGault equation is available at https://www.fstrf.org/apps/cfmx/apps/common/Portal/index.cfm Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT) ≤5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) ≤5 x ULN. alkaline phosphatase ≤5 x ULN. Total bilirubin ≤2.5 x ULN (if the participant is receiving atazanavir, a total bilirubin of ≤5 x ULN is acceptable). Hemoglobin A1C ≤6.5% For females of reproductive potential, adequate contraception. Karnofsky performance score &gt;/=70 within 90 days prior to entry. Ability and willingness of participant or legal guardian/representative to provide informed consent. Participants on statin therapy must be stable on the same dose for at least the prior 12 weeks with no anticipated change in statin or dose during the intervention. Change in the ART regimen within the 12 weeks prior to study entry, or anticipated/intended modification of ART during the study period. Two or more HIV1 RNA determinations &gt;200 copies/mL within the 48 week period prior to study entry. History of clinical pancreatitis or diabetes mellitus diagnosed by a medical provider. Acute or chronic liver disease with evidence of cirrhosis or portal hypertension. Chronic hepatitis C (defined as HCV antibody positive and HCV RNA detectable). History of chronic hepatitis B (defined as surface antibody negative, surface antigen positive, and/or HBV DNA detectable). Use of any immunomodulator, HIV vaccine, investigational therapy, or antiTNF therapies within 90 days prior to study entry. Active malignancy with expected need for systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy during the study period. Use of human growth hormone, tesamorelin, testosterone or anabolic steroids within 90 days prior to study entry (except chronic, stable, replacement dosages in men with diagnosed hypogonadism is allowed). Pregnant or breastfeeding. Use of any antidiabetic medication or GLP1 analogues within the 12 weeks prior to study entry. Current diagnosis of congestive heart failure. Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of the study drug or its formulation. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements. Acute or serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 90 days prior to entry.</criteria>
