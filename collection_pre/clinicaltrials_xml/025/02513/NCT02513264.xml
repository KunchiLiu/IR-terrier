	<brief_summary>There is a need for people to take part in research studies to learn more about diseases and how to treat them. The Registry for Asthma Characterization and Recruitment 2 (RACR2) will create a database of participants with asthma and nasal allergies, or risk factors for these conditions, who are potentially eligible for future Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC) trials. The registry database will include assessments of various asthma and allergy characteristics to achieve a more efficient, selective recruitment of these participants for other protocols.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eligibility criteria vary depending on recruitment needs for future ICAC protocols. Participants with asthma and participants without asthma, atopy, and rhinitis may be recruited at the same time or different times, depending on recruitment needs. Certain characteristics or groups of characteristics within each criterion may be selected for periods of time across clinical sites or at each individually participating clinical site. For example, over a 6month period, the Consortium could decide to recruit children aged 6 through 12 years with diagnosed asthma who have asthma symptoms, have a history of an asthma exacerbation, and reside in prespecified census tracts within the metropolitan statistical area. During selective recruitment periods, individuals who meet broader criteria may or may not be enrolled at the discretion of the Consortium. 1. All participants must resides within the metropolitan statistical area that includes the clinical site. 2. Participants with asthma are defined by having evidence of asthma. Evidence of asthma is defined by meeting at least one of the following criteria: Cliniciandiagnosed asthma Asthma symptoms, history of an asthma exacerbation, or current use of asthma medication(s) Recurrent wheezing Wheezing apart from a cold At times of selective recruitment, participants with asthma may be required to meet more selective criteria above and may be required to meet one or more of the criteria in risk factors for asthma. Evidence of risk factors for asthma is defined by meeting at least one of the following criteria: Parental history of asthma Eczema or atopic dermatitis Reported allergies to pets, food, indoor allergens, or outdoor allergens Allergic sensitization by results of allergy skin testing or results of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing Rhinitis 3. Participants without asthma, atopy, and rhinitis must meet all of the following: Negative history of an asthma diagnosis by a clinician Negative history of a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis or eczema by a clinician Negative history of a rhinitis diagnosis by a clinician A forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) &gt;= 5% predicted Negative prick skintests to any of a panel of indoor and outdoor allergens No current asthma as determined by the appropriate case report form No current chronic rhinitis/sinusitis as determined by the appropriate case report form An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from enrollment: 1. Has any of the following chronic medical conditions: cardiac condition requiring daily medication, seizure disorder requiring daily medication, obvious severe mental retardation that prevents the participant from answering questions or following instructions, cystic fibrosis, immune deficiency, type 1 diabetes, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or any other chronic medical condition at the discretion of the registry clinician 2. Does not primarily speak English (or Spanish at clinical sites with Spanishspeaking staff) 3. Has a primary caretaker who does not speak English (or Spanish at clinical sites with Spanishspeaking staff; not applicable if participant is able to provide consent) 4. Is a foster child (not applicable if participant is able to provide consent) 5. Is unwilling to sign the written informed consent form if of age, or parent/legal guardian is unwilling to sign the written informed consent if participant is not of age 6. Is unwilling to sign the assent form, if age appropriate Participants who are pregnant will not be excluded or discontinued from RACR2 but will not undergo any procedures that are prohibited during pregnancy.</criteria>
