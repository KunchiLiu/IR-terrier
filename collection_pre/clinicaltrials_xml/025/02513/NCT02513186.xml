	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of isatuximab when administered in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone based on the dose-limiting toxicity(ies) (DLTs) observed in patients with newly diagnosed MM non-eligible for transplantation. Secondary Objectives: - To characterize the overall safety profile of isatuximab in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone, including cumulative toxicities. - To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of isatuximab and combination components. - To evaluate the immunogenicity of isatuximab in combination treatment. - To evaluate the preliminary antitumoral activity of the combination.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The duration of the study for an individual patient will include a period to assess eligibility (screening or baseline period) of up to 3 weeks, a treatment period including up to 12 induction treatment cycles (50-week duration), followed by a maintenance period of 4-week cycles and an end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the last administration of treatment (or until the patient receives another anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier). Study treatment may continue until precluded by toxicity, disease progression, death, or upon the Investigator/patient's request.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Newly diagnosed patients with measurable MM defined as at least one of the following: Serum M protein ≥1 g/dL (≥10 g/L). Urine M protein ≥200 mg/24 hours. Serum free light chain (sFLC) assay: involved FLC assay ≥10 mg/dL (≥100 mg/L) and an abnormal sFLC ratio (&lt;0.26 or &gt;1.65). Patients with smoldering MM fulfilling the International Myeloma Working Group criteria are eligible. Patients not eligible for transplant (age and comorbidities at the Investigator's discretion). Exclusion criteria: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status &gt;2. Poor bone marrow reserve. Poor organ function.
