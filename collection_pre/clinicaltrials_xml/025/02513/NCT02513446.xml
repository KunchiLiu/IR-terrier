	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the effect of multiple doses of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of BI 1026706 given as single dose. The assessment of safety and tolerability of BI 1026706 is an additional objective of this trial. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of the metabolite BI 1072668 will be explored.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Healthy male subjects according to the investigators assessment, based on a complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR), 12lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests Age of 18 to 55 years (incl.) BMI of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.) Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with GCP and local legislation Exclusion criteria: Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant by the investigator Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the range of 50 to 90 bpm Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be of clinical relevance Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the investigator Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy and simple hernia repair) Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy), other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts Chronic or relevant acute infections History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial medication or its excipients) Intake of drugs with a long halflife (more than 24 h) within 30 days or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to administration of trial medication Within 10 days prior to administration of trial medication, use of drugs that might reasonably influence the results of the trial or that might prolong the QT/QTc interval Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day) Inability to refrain from smoking during inhouse confinement at trial site Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 30 g per day) Drug abuse or positive drug screening Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial medication or intended donation during the trial Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to administration of trial medication or during the trial Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are repeatedly greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant ECG finding at screening A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome) Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance, because the subject is considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or because he has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study In addition, the following trialspecific exclusion criteria apply: Liver enzyme (ALT, AST, GGT) values above upper limit of normal at the screening examination Galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, or glucose/galactose malabsorption</criteria>
