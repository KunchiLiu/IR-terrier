	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if 2-weeks of nightly exposure (7-12 hours) to moderate hypoxia (~2,400 meters or 7,500 feet) improves glucose metabolism in people with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of 2-Week Nightly Moderate Hypoxia on Glucose Tolerance in Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exposure to hypoxia has been advocated as a possible therapeutic aid against obesity. Indeed, our laboratory has provided the first evidence that intermittent, nightly exposure to moderate hypoxia is beneficial in improving insulin sensitivity in healthy obese patients and, therefore, lowers the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Benefits included reduced fasting glucose levels and improved whole-body (skeletal muscle) and hepatic insulin sensitivity. Whether such intermittent hypoxia improves glucose metabolism in people with type 2 diabetes is unknown.</detailed_description>
