	<brief_summary>Aim of the study is to assess the therapeutic effects of topical hyaluronic-acid use on secondary wound healing of the free gingival graft donor site. The hypothesis of this study is that topical hyaluronic-acid gel has positive effects on secondary wound healing of free gingival graft donor site by reducing pain, burning sensation, and accelerating the healing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Topically-Applied Hyaluronic-Acid on Palatal Epithelial Wound Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of the randomized, single blind, controlled and parallel clinical trial was to assess therapeutic effects of topical hyaluronic-acid on secondary wound healing of free gingival graft donor site. Primary outcome variables that pain and burning sensation changes were assessed at 3, 7, 14, 21 days after surgery by the examiner. Pain and burning sensation were assessed by patients using the VAS, score 0 indicate no pain or burning sensation, score 10 indicate severe pain or burning sensation. Secondary outcome variables included color match, consistency and epithelization of the wound area. These parameters were assessed by the same examiner at 3, 7, 14, 21 and 42 days after surgery. Color of the palatal mucosa was assessed by comparing it to that of the adjacent and opposite site using the VAS. Score 0 indicate no color match and score 10 indicate very good color match. Consistency of the palatal mucosa was assessed with a blunt instrumentation and scored as soft or firm. Epithelialization was scored clinically as none, partial or complete. Sample size has been estimated in 12 subjects per treatment groups. Random allocation of the treatment sites to test and control groups will be performed using a computerized selection of random numbers for allocation of the study groups. Clinical images obtained at baseline, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 42 days after surgery from each treatment site.</detailed_description>
