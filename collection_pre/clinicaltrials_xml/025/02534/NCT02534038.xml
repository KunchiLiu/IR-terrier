	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of AVP-786 for the Treatment of Disinhibition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible participants for this study must have a diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Disorder and must exhibit disinhibition syndrome of sufficient severity to warrant treatment. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study consisting of two 6-week treatment periods. Approximately 12 participants will be enrolled at approximately 2 centers in the United States. Following screening procedures for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible participants will be randomized into the study.</detailed_description>
