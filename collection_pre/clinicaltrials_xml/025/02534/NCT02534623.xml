	<brief_summary>Transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) is often performed as an outpatient procedure so high-quality postoperative recovery is particularly important. The aim of this study is to compare postoperative quality of recovery after spinal anesthesia (SA) and general anesthesia (GA) for transurethral resection of the bladder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Quality of Recovery After Transurethral Resection of the Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After written informed consent is obtained seventy patients aged 18-80 years, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status class I-III scheduled for TURB will be randomly assigned to either spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia will be performed with 12.5 mg of bupivacaine mixed with 25 mcg of fentanyl. General anesthesia will be performed with propofol and fentanyl and maintained with sevoflurane, without use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Quality of Recovery 40 questionnaire (QoR-40) administered before and 24 hours after surgery will be used for assessment of postoperative recovery.</detailed_description>
