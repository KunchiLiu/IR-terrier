	<criteria>Male or female subject aged 12 to &lt;15 months or 18 to &lt;24 months during sentinelcohort enrollment, Or,12 to &lt;24 months during expandedcohort enrollment. Subjects must have received all vaccinations in the relevant National Immunization Program (NIP) for their age group. Subject is determined to be in good health by medical history, physical examination, and judgment of the investigator. Previous vaccination with any meningococcal serogroup B vaccine. Previous vaccination with HAV vaccine, or requirement to receive nonstudy HAV vaccine during Stage 1 of the study. Contraindication to vaccination with any HAV vaccine or known latex allergy. A previous anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine or vaccinerelated component. Bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding time that would contraindicate intramuscular injection. A known or suspected disorder of the immune system that would prevent an immune response to the vaccine, such as subjects with congenital or acquired defects in Bcell function or those receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Subjects with terminal complement deficiency may be included. History of microbiologically proven disease caused by N meningitidis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Significant neurologic disorder or history of seizure (excluding simple febrile seizure). Receipt of any blood products, including immunoglobulin, within 6 months before the first study vaccination until the end of Stage 1. Current chronic use of systemic antibiotics. Received any investigational drugs, vaccines or devices within 28 days before administration of the first study vaccination and/or during study participation. Any neuroinflammatory or autoimmune condition, including but not limited to transverse myelitis, uveitis, optic neuritis, and multiple sclerosis.</criteria>
