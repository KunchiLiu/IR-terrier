	<brief_summary>Cryoablation (cryotherapy) is an established type of mucosal ablation for treatment of various conditions in the GI tract, including Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, feasibility and performance of cryoablation system (the C2 Focal Cryoablation Device in patients with BE and esophageal squamous dysplasia who need ablation therapy for clinical standard care. The new cryoablation treatment will be offered as an alternative to standard ablation therapies already in place (radiofrequency ablation, carbon dioxide cryotherapy).</brief_summary>
