	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study will be to determine whether remote limb ischemic conditioning (RLIC) compared with sham RLIC (placebo) treatment reduces the 12-month risk of recurrent IS in patients with a recent TIA or IS caused by stenosis of a major intracranial artery. After screening period, eligible patients will be randomly allocated into 2 groups. In addition, all participants receive an usual clinical therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Remote Ischemic Conditioning for Avoiding Recurrence of Symptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis (sICAS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, Patients in the RLIC group will be treated with Renqiao Remote Ischemic Conditioning Device (Doctormate®) (200mmHg) once daily for 12 months; patients in the sham RLIC group will be treated with the Renqiao Remote Ischemic Conditioning Device (Doctormate®) (60mmHg) once daily for 12 months. In the study, the RLIC treatment will be comprised of 5 cycles of bilateral upper limb ischemia and reperfusion, which will be induced by 2 cuffs placed around the upper arms respectively and inflated to 200mmHg for 5 minutes followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion by cuff deflation. Sham RLIC treatment will be conducted using the same procedure but with a minimal inflation pressure of 60mmHg, which does not result in upper limb ischemia. In addition, all participants will have received their usual drug therapy according to local medical practice.</detailed_description>

Major surgery (including open femoral, aortic, or carotid surgery, cardiac) within previous 30 days or scheduled in the 12 months after enrollment. 16. Contraindication for remote ischemic conditioning: severe soft tissue injury, fracture, or peripheral vascular disease in the upper limbs. 17. Life expectancy&lt;3 years. 18.
