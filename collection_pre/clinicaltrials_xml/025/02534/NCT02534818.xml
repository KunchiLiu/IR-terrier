	<brief_title>Different Fluorescein Sodium Dosage for the Detection of Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric intestinal metaplasia is regarded as an important premalignant lesion for intestinal type gastric cancer. Currently, the histological assessment of gastric intestinal metaplasia still relies on the biopsies took from five sites that the updated Sydney System recommended. This study aims to compare the diagnostic yield of gastric intestinal metaplasia from two different fluorescein sodium dosage and assess whether lower fluorescein sodium dosage can perceive the same detection rate per patient and per lesion for the detection of gastric intestinal metaplasia.</detailed_description>
