	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of daily consumption of one or two CALIN+ pot(s) versus no intake of product, after 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks, on the evolution of the serum concentration of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) (D2 + D3) in postmenopausal women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Consumption of Yogurt Fortified in Calcium and Vit. D on Circulating Levels of 25OHD in Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The active form of vitamin D is produced by skin when it is exposed to ultraviolet-B (UVB) rays. However, because of our sedentary lifestyle and to the low sun exposure during winter, the vitamin D status is most frequently deficient. Hence the consumption of enriched food could be an efficient strategy to improve vitamin D status. The current recommendation for vitamin D intake is 20 µg per day for adults (19-50 yo) and between 25 and 37.5 µg per day for people over 50 years old according to the French National Medicine Academy. However, the recommended daily allowance (RDA) in France for vitamin D is limited to 5 µg corresponding to the maximum enrichment allowed in a food product. The current study is designed to evaluate if a daily consumption of two CALIN+ yogurts enriched with 5µg of vitamin D is sufficient to improve the vitamin D status in postmenopausal women.</detailed_description>
