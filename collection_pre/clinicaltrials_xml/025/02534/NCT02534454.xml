	<brief_summary>The purpose of the phase 1 translational pilot study proposed here is to gather preliminary data investigating the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) and cognitive retraining to enhance nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation. The recent use of TDCS over task relevant regions to alter behavior holds incredible promise for use in cognitive retraining intervention protocols. Previous studies of cognitive retraining have focused on implicit training techniques. This proposed study will attempt to enhance these implicit training techniques through the use of TDCS during implicit retraining in order to increase learning of avoidance-related action tendencies towards tobacco. The objective of this pilot study is to establish the feasibility and obtain preliminary data on the effectiveness of using brain stimulation with cognitive retraining to reduce cigarette smoking in individuals with nicotine addiction.</brief_summary>
