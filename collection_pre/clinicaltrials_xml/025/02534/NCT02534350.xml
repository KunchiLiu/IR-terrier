	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Key Received a LT (single or double) or heart/lung transplant &gt; 90 days prior to screening Confirmed to be RSVpositive by local polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing (starting from when the upper or lower respiratory tract sample is obtained) ≤ 7 days prior to study drug administration on Day 1/baseline New onset or acute worsening of at least 1 of the following respiratory symptoms ≤ 7 days prior to study drug administration: nasal congestion, earache, runny nose, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, or wheezing An informed consent document signed and dated by the individual A negative urine or serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential Agreement from males and females of childbearing potential to use contraception Ability and willingness to complete necessary study procedures Key Related to concomitant or previous medication use: Use of the following lympholytic treatment: antithymocyte globulin (ATG), &lt; 3 months; antilymphoblast globulin (ALG), &lt; 3 months; muromonabCD3 (OKT3), &lt; 3 months; rituximab &lt; 6 months; alemtuzumab &lt; 9 months Related to transplant history: Recipient of any other organ transplant prior to screening, with the exception of a LT (single or double) or heart/lung transplant Recipient of a hematopoietic cell transplant at any time Presence of BOS Stage 3 at screening defined as a FEV1 of 50% or less of baseline Related to medical condition at screening: Respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation Evidence of shock requiring vasopressors Known viral coinfection (including but not limited to influenza, metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, parainfluenza, cytomegalovirus, or coronavirus) in the upper or lower respiratory tract ≤ 14 days prior to screening unless discussed with the medical monitor and deemed acceptable Active systemic infection or infectious pneumonia of any etiology (ie, bacterial, viral [other than RSV] or fungal), including aspiration pneumonia, that is considered clinically significant by the investigator unless discussed with the medical monitor and deemed acceptable Pregnant or lactating females Evidence of recent and rapidly deteriorating lung function, occurring before the onset of the current viral respiratory infection Related to allergies: Known hypersensitivity or allergy to the study drug, its metabolites, or formulation excipients (microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol and talc) History of hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, StevensJohnson Syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis response to sulfa drugs Related to laboratory values: Clinically significant kidney dysfunction Clinically significant liver function test abnormalities Clinically significant elevations in total bilirubin (TB), as determined by the investigator NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/ Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
