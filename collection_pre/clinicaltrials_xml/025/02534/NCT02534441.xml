	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are to identify positivity rates to three novel surfactants (ingredients used in soaps, detergents, and other cleansers that serve to lower the surface tension of the skin and remove debris) and co-reactivity with other surfactants in patients with known surfactant sensitivity on skin patch testing. The investigators hypothesize that subjects who previously tested positive to known allergenic surfactants (cocamidopropyl betaine, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine, dimethylaminopropylamine, coconut diethanolamide, oleamidopropyl dimethylamine, and decyl glucoside) may demonstrate co-reactivity to the three novel surfactant sensitizers (sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, isostearmidopropyl morpholine lactate, and disodium lauroamphodiacetate) on skin patch testing.</brief_summary>
