	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the relationship between basmisanil plasma concentrations and the occupancy of Gamma-Amino Butyric Acid A (GABAA) receptor subtypes containing an alpha5 (Î±5) subunit in healthy Japanese volunteers. Each participant will have two post-screening imaging sessions. In the first imaging session, participants will have a baseline Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan. In the second imaging session, participants will receive a single oral dose of basmisanil, followed by two on-treatment PET scans at about 4 and 10 hours post-dose.</brief_summary>
