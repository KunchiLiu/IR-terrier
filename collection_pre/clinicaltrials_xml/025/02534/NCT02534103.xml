	<brief_summary>As considering the close relationship between systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction, the EAS index e'/(a' x s') including systolic and diastolic function could be expected to predict hemodynamic changes during off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery(OPCAB). Exposure of the grafting site during OPCAB needs displacement of the heart, resulting in hemodynamic instability. Therefore the investigators are going to evaluate EAS index with preoperative Transthoracic echocardiography(TTE) and want to know the relationship between preoperative EAS index and intraoperative hemodynamic changes in patients undergoing OPCAB, in a prospective observational study.</brief_summary>
