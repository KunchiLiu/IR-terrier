	<brief_summary>The team integrates experimental analyses of clinical and basic medicine and transgenic mice models. miR-29a acts a potent protective factor against excessive fibrosis in myofibroblasts of subacromial bursa tissue. Gain of miR-29a stabilizes tendon and synovial tissue homeostasis that alleviates tissue stiffness and maintains function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pathomechanism of MicroRNA-29 in Shoulder Stiffness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims of first: The team will evaluate the associations among the mR-29a, miR-29b, miR-29c expression in subacromial bursa and subacromial fluid, incidence of shoulder stiffness, Constant scores, and VAS. Aims of second: The team will isolate primary myofibroblast from subacromial bursa tissue as in vitro models and investigate the molecular events in the IL-1Î² modulation of miR-29a expression and the molecular mechanism underlying miR-29a inhibition of fibrotic matrix accumulation and apoptotic reactions in myofibroblast cultures.</detailed_description>
