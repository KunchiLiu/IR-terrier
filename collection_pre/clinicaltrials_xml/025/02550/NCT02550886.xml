	<brief_summary>In 2011, 38.6 million hospital stays occurred in the United States at a cost of $387.2 billion. 47.9 percent involved hospitalizations during which surgical procedures were performed. Orthopedic procedures constituted the most frequently performed and most costly of operating room procedures. As the healthcare climate in the United States continues to change, there is a trend towards providing effective care in a fiscally conservative manner. Central to this strategy is the shift towards increasing ambulatory surgical procedures from surgeries requiring post-operative admission for patients. While savings to hospitals and third-party payers are implied, there may be an unrecognized increase in financial, physical, and psychosocial post-operative costs to patients undergoing ambulatory surgery and to their caregivers. Rawal et al., and McGarth and colleagues have found that patients undergoing orthopedic procedures had moderate to severe post-operative pain. We propose to present a survey to patients and their caregivers before surgery and at multiple timepoints post-operatively to acquire information on the impacts of ambulatory orthopedic surgery. In addition to assessing post-operative pain, this study serves to examine various other possible burdens to patients that have not been previously evaluated in this patient population.
