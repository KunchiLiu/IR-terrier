	<brief_summary>Huntington's disease is a rare genetic neurodegenerative disease. It is accompanied by movement disorders, cognitive and behavioral. The social behavior of patients are changed, affecting interpersonal relationships. Patients with Huntington's disease are described as self-centered, lacking sympathy and empathy and mentally inflexible. These behavioral problems can be a major source of anxiety for patients and their families. These disorders also have a negative impact cognitive and motor symptoms as well as the functional abilities and the quality of life of patients and their entourage. Authors have suggested that these problems could be related inter alia to social cognition disorders. This concept refers to a set of skills and emotional and social experiences that regulate relations between individuals and can explain the behavior of individuals and groups. The objective is to evaluate disorders of social cognition, which may account for behavioral changes in Huntington's disease.</brief_summary>
