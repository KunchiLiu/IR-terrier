Patients in whom surgery can be safely delayed for a minimum period of 2 weeks following the administration of the first dose of nivolumab, in the opinion of the investigator. Eastern Cancer Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 01. Patients with ECOG&gt;1 due to neurological symptoms considered to be reversible following surgery, according to investigator´s criteria will be eligible Life expectancy &gt;12 weeks. Adequate organ function defined by: 1. Bone Marrow Reserve: white blood cells (WBC): ≥2000/ mm3 absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500x 109/L; platelet count ≥100000/ mm3 100 x 109/L; hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL). 2.

Renal: creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN or estimated creatinine clearance &gt; 40 ml/min, using the CockcroftGault formula. Presence of extracranial disease. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive the planned therapy (including brain surgery), or interfere with the interpretation of study results. Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.

A shorter interval can be approved by the principal investigator, if deemed appropriate. Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents), with the exception of control of cerebral edema, or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Pregnant or breastfeeding patients.

Concomitant or prior malignancy that, in the opinion of the investigator contraindicates GBM surgery or can interfere with the results of the study, in the opinion of the investigator.
