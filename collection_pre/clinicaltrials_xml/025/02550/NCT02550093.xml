	<brief_summary>Oxytocin is neurohypophysial peptide that acts mainly as a neuromodulator in the brain.The vast majority of basic science studies suggested a large effect of oxytocin in minimizing acute pain.Few studies have demonstrated an association between plasma levels of oxytocin and pain in humans. Since addictive properties of oxytocin have not been described, the drug may have important application in the management of acute and chronic pain. No studies have examined the effect of intranasal oxytocin on pain sensitivity and threshold.</brief_summary>
