	<brief_summary>Muscle alterations and modifications passive biomechanical properties that occur on a spastic muscle contribute to functional disorders involved in spasticity. Botulinum toxin (TB) A is the reference treatment of the focused spasticity, and muscle source structural and biomechanical changes, very little studied in humans, especially since it is not one possibility of easily and reliably paraclinical assessment injections consequences.</brief_summary>
