	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators will enroll women with palpable cancers to assess the accuracy of the Breast Cancer Locator (BCL) and concomitant procedure as a vehicle to optimize and validate the approach in surgical cases where the new device will not substantially alter or modify the standard-of-care procedure before initiating an evaluative trial of the BCL in non palpable breast cancer cases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Accuracy of a Breast Cancer Locator (BCL) in Patients With Palpable Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to test whether the Breast Cancer Locator (BCL) accurately defines the edges of the cancer. Twenty patients with palpable invasive breast cancer will undergo preoperative supine MRI, creation of a BCL, and breast conserving surgery using the BCL as an adjunct to palpation-guided tumor resection. Participants will also have the tumor position on their skin localized with the supine MR/optical scan/tracker method. The primary objective is to measure the distance from the center of the spots made by the BCL to the cancer edges.</detailed_description>
