	<brief_summary>Hypothesis is that the presence of a-synucleinopathy related non motor symptoms could be predictive factor for post-operative delirium. During 72hrs after spine surgery, investigator will observe occurrence of post-operative delirium, and analysis difference of a-synucleinopathy related non motor symptoms between 2 groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploring the Relationship Between Alpha-synucleinopathy Related Non-motor Symptom and Post-op. Delirium in Elderly Patients With Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative delirium appear approximately 10-70% of patients older than 65 yrs undergoing surgery and it is strongly associated with poor surgical outcome. The clinical characteristics of postoperative delirium are fluctuating attention, visual hallucination, disorganized thought and alter sleep-wake cycles. This is quite similar to core features of Î±-synuclein-related cognitive disorders such as parkinson`s disease dementia and dementia with lewy body. At that point, investigator thought that postoperative delirium is preclinical stage of a-synucleinopathy. In other words, a-synuclein related disorders and postoperative delirium may share an underlying neurochemical change in their pathogenesis. investigator will recruit age 65 and older patients scheduled to perform spine surgery. The pre-operative evaluation include neurologic exam, baseline cognitive function and a-synucleinopathy related non motor symptoms through Questionnaires.</detailed_description>
