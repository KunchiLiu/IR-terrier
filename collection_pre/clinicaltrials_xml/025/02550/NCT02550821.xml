	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare physical activity levels between patients with bronchiectasis and healthy subjects. We hypothesize that patients with bronchiectasis will have lower levels of physical activity, since physical activity levels is affected by reduced exercise tolerance, severity of disease and other disease related symptoms and conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Physical Activity Level Between Patients With Bronchiectasis and Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical activity limitation in chronic respiratory diseases is caused by many factors including respiratory, hemodynamic, and peripheral muscle weakness. Bronchiectasis is characterized by irreversible widening of the medium-sized airways, with inflammation, chronic bacterial infection and destruction of the bronchial walls. In addition to pulmonary function worsening, extra pulmonary features such as reduced peripheral muscle endurance can be a significant physical problem which causing a decrease in physical activity levels. Despite physical activity is considered to be essential for the management of chronic respiratory diseases, there is a lack of scientific study, which compares physical activity levels between patients with bronchiectasis and healthy subjects. This study will assess physical activity level, exercise capacity, quality of life and peripheral muscle strength in patients with bronchiectasis compared to healthy subjects.</detailed_description>
