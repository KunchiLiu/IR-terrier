	<brief_title>Primer Aligner Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Invisalign® System consists of a series of clear plastic aligners that are intended to replace conventional wire and bracket technology for many orthodontic cases. Each custom manufactured aligner exerts gentle, continuous forces to move teeth incrementally from their original state to a final, treated state. Each aligner is worn for about two weeks, then replaced by the next in the series until the final position is achieved. For years, orthodontists and dentists have used removable appliances for orthodontic treatment. Today, with the application of computer technology and custom manufacturing, Invisalign treats a broader range of cases with greater precision.</detailed_description>
