	<brief_summary>The study (n = 36) will be a parallel design and will be 6 weeks in duration. Participants will start with a 2-week free-living wash-in period where they will be asked to avoid certain carotenoid-rich foods, followed by 4 weeks of a completely controlled diet. In addition to the controlled diet, participants will consume one of three beverages (300 mL/day; n = 12/group): placebo beverage (control), high beta-carotene tomato juice, and high-lycopene tomato juice. Blood, urine and feces will be collected throughout the study.</brief_summary>
