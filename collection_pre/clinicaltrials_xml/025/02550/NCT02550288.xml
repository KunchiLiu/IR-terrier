	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MK-0653C (Ezetimibe [EZ] 10 mg/Atorvastatin [Atora] 10mg or 20 mg) compared to EZ 10 mg, Atora 10 mg, or Atora 20 mg alone when administered to Japanese participants with hypercholesterolemia. The primary hypothesis is that MK-0653C (EZ 10 mg/Atorva 10 mg) is superior to EZ 10 mg and is superior to Atorva 10 mg and that MK-0653C (EZ 10 mg/Atorva 20 mg) is superior to EZ 10 mg and is superior to Atorva 20 mg in percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after 12 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
