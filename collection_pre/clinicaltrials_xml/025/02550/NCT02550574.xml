	<brief_title>Use of 2-octylcyanoacrylate With Full-thickness Skin Grafts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of 2-octylcyanoacrylate during repair of cutaneous surgery wounds with full-thickness skin grafts improves scar cosmesis compared to wound closure with sutures. Our aims are to compare outcomes using a split wound model, where half of the wound is treated with 2-octylcyanoacrylate and the other half is repaired with sutures, per the standard of care. Three-months post-surgery, the scar will be measured via the physician observer scar assessment scale, a validated scar instrument. Our hypothesis is that 2-octylcyanoacrylate will result in cosmetically superior wound outcomes.</detailed_description>
