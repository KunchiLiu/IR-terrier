	<brief_summary>Visceral hypersensitivity, low grade inflammation and increased intestinal permeability are three main pathophysiological mechanisms involved in irritable bowel syndrome. The connexion between these abnormalities is not known. We hypothesis there is a link between them in IBS with diarrhoea.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Association Between High Faecal Calprotectin, Increased Intestinal Permeability and Visceral Hypersensitivity in IBS-D Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional disorder which affect around 10% of the general population. Abdominal pain and discomfort are associated with transit disorders (diarrhea, constipation, alternating). IBS is defined by Rome III criteria. For clinicians, IBS remains difficult to treat while its pathophysiology remains not completely understood. Visceral hypersensitivity, low grade inflammation and increased intestinal permeability are three abnormalities found in IBS patients. Visceral hypersensitivity is present in 60% of the patients, while intestinal permeability is increased in a subgroup of IBS with diarrhea. Low grade inflammation could be identify with faecal calprotectin dosage. The link between this three abnormalities is not clear. The goal of our study is to describe the prevalence of these three abnormalities in IBS-Diarrhea population and to look for a correlation between low grade inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, increased intestinal permeability and clinical phenotypes.</detailed_description>
