	<brief_title>Role of GLP-1 in Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia Post-bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The physiologic mechanisms mediating the glucose-lowering effect of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) or post-Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG) are unknown. The reduction in glucose excursions prior to weight loss has lead to postulates that the incretin hormone, GLP-1, may play an important role. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of GLP-1 in causing extreme postprandial glucose reductions in a subset of post-bariatric patients through the pharmacologic blockade of the GLP-1 receptor in post-RYGB or post-VSG patients with severe symptomatic hypoglycemia.</detailed_description>
