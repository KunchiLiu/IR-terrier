	<brief_title>Utility of MR Lymphangiography in Postoperative Follow-up of Lymphedema: Comparison With Lymphoscintigraphy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical methods include " surgical procedure to make a good lymphatic drain 'and' surgical resection with lymph tissue swelling , significant that two of lymphedema .In recent years, began receiving the spotlight this former method using micro-surgery , inde essential that in order to increase the success rate of these micro-surgery accurately assess the structural abnormalities of preoperative lymphatic and establishing the surgical plan , the primary diagnostic imaging examination of existing lymphedema Since the nuclear medicine examination as to obtain an accurate anatomical information it is also ideal for imaging in the preoperative assessment of lymphedema is precisely that you can not . In contrast magnetic resonance lymphangiography recently developed a new magnetic resonance imaging techniques that many advantages in precision assessment of lymphedema patients. First, there are high spatial resolution magnetic resonance lymphangiography through the lymphatic vessels to obtain the correct anatomical information . Second, magnetic resonance lymphangiography is provide not only information about the functional status of the lymphatic anatomical information . Third, the magnetic resonance lymphangiography minimally invasive techniques , without exposure to radiation , is relatively easy and safe , that there is a great advantage of being able to diagnose the structural and functional at the same time or later in lymphatic vessels. The magnetic resonance lymphangiography via the lymphatic advantage given also helps to establish a specific treatment plan , as well as accurate preoperative diagnosis of lymphedema that may contribute to enhance the success of micro-surgery.</detailed_description>
