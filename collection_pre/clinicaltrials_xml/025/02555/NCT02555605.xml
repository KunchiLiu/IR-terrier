	<brief_title>Dexmedetomidine Sedation in Children With Respiratory Morbidities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Electronic medical records of children with at least 3 characteristics of respiratory morbidities were retrospectively reviewed. All study patients received dexmedetomidine bolus over 10 min followed by a continuous infusion to achieve a minimum Ramsay Sedation Score of 5. Patients were monitored for hemodynamics, total dose of dexmedetomidine received, adverse events experienced and sedation characteristics.</detailed_description>
