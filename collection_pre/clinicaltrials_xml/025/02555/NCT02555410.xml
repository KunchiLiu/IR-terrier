	<brief_summary>This is a phase III, pilot, prospective study of an Electromyography (EMG) based seizure detection system for detecting Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (GTCS) in the home.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Seizure Detection and Warning System in Epilepsy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Brain Sentinelâ„¢ Seizure Detection and Warning System is intended for monitoring children and adults with a history or significant risk of generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the home or healthcare facilities, during the titration or withdrawal of anti-epileptic drugs, and for continuous monitoring (night time or any other time of day) of individuals due to their history or risk of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The device will withstand activities of daily living including showers and sleep.</detailed_description>
