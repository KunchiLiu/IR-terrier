	<detailed_description>A total of 7,729 women with singleton pregnancies who were receiving antenatal care at Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine between December 2012 and March 2014 were included in the study. All these women underwent screening for thyroid function (TSH,FT4 and TPOAb) at the first antenatal visit and a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks of gestation. The correlation between a combination of TSH level and TPOAb status and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus was analyzed.</detailed_description>
