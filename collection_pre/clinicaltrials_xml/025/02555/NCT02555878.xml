	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that rivaroxaban is superior to placebo for reducing the risk of the primary composite outcome as defined by objectively confirmed symptomatic lower extremity proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), asymptomatic lower extremity proximal DVT, symptomatic upper extremity DVT, symptomatic non-fatal pulmonary embolism (PE), incidental PE, and venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related death in ambulatory adult participants with various cancer types receiving systemic cancer therapy who are at high risk of developing a VTE.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Rivaroxaban Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prophylaxis in Ambulatory Cancer Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, superiority study comparing the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban with placebo for primary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in ambulatory adult participants, with various cancer types who are scheduled to initiate systemic cancer therapy. The study consists of 3 Phases: Screening Phase (14 Days), double-blind treatment Phase (180 Days) and follow up Phase (30 Days). The duration of participation in the study for each participant is approximately 32 weeks.</detailed_description>
