	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending intravenous (IV) doses and a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of BIIB063 in healthy volunteers. The secondary objectives of the study are to estimate the PK parameters of single ascending IV doses of BIIB063; to estimate the PK parameters and absolute bioavailability (F) of a single SC dose of BIIB063; and to evaluate the immunogenicity of single ascending doses of BIIB063.</brief_summary>
