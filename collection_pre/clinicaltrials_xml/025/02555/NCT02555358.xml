	<detailed_description>Eligible patients will be randomly assigned by a randomisation system in a 1:1:1 ratio to three group. The group A wil receive four cycles of DOX (docetaxel 60mg/m2 on day 1,oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 on day 1 and capecitabine 1,000 mg/m2 per day on days 1 to 14, repeated every 3 weeks) as neoadjuvant therapy and four cycles of Xelox (capecitabine 1,000 mg/m2 per day on days 1 to 14 and oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 on day 1, repeated every 3 weeks) as adjuvant therapy.The group B wil receive four cycles of Xelox (capecitabine 1,000 mg/m2 per day on days 1 to 14 and oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 on day 1, repeated every 3 weeks) as neoadjuvant therapy and four cycles of Xelox as adjuvant therapy.The group C wil receive eight cycles of Xelox (capecitabine 1,000 mg/m2 per day on days 1 to 14 and oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 on day 1, repeated every 3 weeks) as adjuvant therapy.</detailed_description>
