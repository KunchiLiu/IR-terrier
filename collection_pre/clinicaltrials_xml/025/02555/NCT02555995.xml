	<brief_summary>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an established non-invasive medical imaging technique ophthalmologists use to diagnose and monitor retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This study assesses the scanning performance of a newly developed sparse OCT retina scanner that is smaller and more compact than most commercially available medical OCT systems. The prototype device was developed at Artorg Center Bern and Berner Fachhochschule Biel. In this study the device is first tested on human eyes. The scanning performance is compared to a reference device. Additionally patient feedback during the examination is acquired. The findings of this study are used to improve the software and the ergonomics of the investigational device.</brief_summary>

Objective - Comparing scan quality of investigational device to scan quality of reference device. - Obtaining patient feedback on the examination with investigational device. Methods Comparison of OCT scans made with standard device and investigational device.</detailed_description>
