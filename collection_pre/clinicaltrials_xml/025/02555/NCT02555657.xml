	<brief_summary>In this study, participants with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC) will be randomly assigned to receive either single agent pembrolizumab or single agent chemotherapy chosen by the treating physician (TPC) in accordance with local regulations and guidelines, consisting of either capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab extends progression free and/or overall survival compared to TPC</brief_summary>
