	<brief_summary>This study is a masked, multi-center, daily wear, monthly replacement, bilateral, randomized, lens blocked (subjects remain in the same lens brand throughout the study) concurrent control study enrolling up to 90 subjects with a study duration of approximately three months. Subjects will be randomized into the study contact lenses in a two to one (2:1) ratio of fanfilcon A lens (test) to enfilcon A lens (control).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the CooperVision, Inc. Fanfilcon A and Enfilcon A Daily Wear Contact Lenses When Used for Frequent Replacement for up to One (1) Month of Daily Wear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized into the study contact lenses in a two to one (2:1) ratio of fanfilcon A lens (test) to enfilcon A lens (control). This should result in a study population of approximately 60 test subjects and 30 control subjects.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Be at least 18 years of age as of the date of evaluation for the study. Have: Read the Informed Consent Been given an explanation of the Informed Consent Indicated understanding of the Informed Consent Signed the Informed Consent document. Be willing and able to adhere to the instructions set forth in this protocol and able to keep all specified appointments. Be an adapted, current fulltime silicone hydrogel or soft contact lens wearer. An adapted fulltime wearer is defined as wearing contact lenses at least 5 days per week for at least 8 hours per day for at least one month prior to participation in the study. Possess or obtain prior to dispensing, wearable and visually functional (20/40 or better) eyeglasses. Be in good general health, based on his/her knowledge. Require spectacle lens powers between 0.50 and 8.00 diopters sphere with no more than 1.50 diopter of refractive astigmatism and be willing to wear contact lenses in both eyes. Have manifest refraction Snellen visual acuities (VA) equal to or better than20/25 in each eye. To be eligible for lens dispensing, the subject must achieve 20/30 VA or better in each eye with the study lens and the investigator must judge the fit as acceptable or optimal. Wearing lenses in a monovision modality and is unwilling to be fit with distance lenses in both eyes for the duration of the study. Note: Subjects may not wear lenses in a monovision modality at any time during the study as it will interfere with the visual acuity analysis. Poor personal hygiene. Any active participation in another clinical trial during this trial or within 30 days prior to this study. To the best of the subject's knowledge, she is currently pregnant, is lactating or is planning a pregnancy within the next 3 months. A member, relative or household member of the investigator or of the investigational office staff. Has a known sensitivity to the ingredients used in the MultiPurpose Disinfection Lens Care System (MPS) approved for use in the study and is unable or unwilling to use the alternate care system. Previous refractive surgery; or current or previous orthokeratology treatment. Is aphakic or pseudophakic. Ocular or systemic disease such as, but not limited to: anterior uveitis or iritis (past or present), glaucoma, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, keratoconus or uncontrolled diabetes. The need for topical ocular medications or any systemic medication which might interfere with contact lens wear or require the lenses to be removed during the day. The presence of clinically significant (grade 2, 3 or 4) anterior segment abnormalities; or the presence of any inflammations such as iritis; or any infection of the eye, lids, or associated structures. A known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity), corneal ulcer, corneal infiltrates, iritis, bacterial or fungal infections. A history of papillary conjunctivitis that has interfered with contact lens wear. Slit lamp findings that would contraindicate contact lens wear, including but not limited to: Pathological dry eye or associated dry eye symptoms with decreased tear levels and punctuate staining &gt; Grade 2 Pterygium Corneal scars within the visual axis Neovascularization or ghost vessels &gt; 1.0 mm in from the limbus Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) of &gt; Grade 2 Anterior uveitis or iritis Seborrheic eczema, seborrheic conjunctivitis or blepharitis</criteria>
