	<brief_title>Comparing the Antibacterial Effect of 810 nm Diode Laser and Photodynamic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional techniques of root canal treatments such as mechanical instrumentation and chemical debridement with antimicrobial irrigants, such as Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine and use of calcium hydroxide do not always suffice to predictably render root canals free of bacteria Using the high-power diode laser is a new approach of disinfection allowing access to the previously unavailable areas, such as the tubular network. This study, therefore, compares two types of diode lasers (low-power and high power) in terms of anti-bacterial effect as well as the conventional endodontic retreatment to determine the ideal method of root canal disinfection.</detailed_description>
