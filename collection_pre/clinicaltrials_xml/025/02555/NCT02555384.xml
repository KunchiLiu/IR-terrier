	<brief_summary>Amblyopia, affects 4% of the population. In the presence of a normal retina and optic nerve, the visual cortex does not develop normally secondary to the amblyopic eye being at a disadvantage in the sensitive period such as in strabismus. Amblyopia is associated with visuospatial disorders, and poor to absent stereopsis. Amblyopia is treated by occlusion of the non- amblyopic eye in childhood. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of perceptual learning (PL), that is a training of visual drawing tasks (12 sessions of 30 Minutes duration) with crowding (c) for children with amblyopia compared to an amblyopic control group with a placebo drawing task. Arm 1: Crowded (PLc)- Training with small spacing Arm 2: Uncrowded (PLu)- Training with large spacing Prior to this, a small group will help optimize parameters such as contrast and distance of visual objects presented</brief_summary>
