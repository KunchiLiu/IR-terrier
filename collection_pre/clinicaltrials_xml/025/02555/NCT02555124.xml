	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of JNJ-42847922 in Healthy Japanese Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect), randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), single-ascending dose study. The study consists of a screening phase, an in-clinic treatment phase, and a follow-up phase. The study duration for each subject will be approximately 5 weeks from screening (Day -28 to Day -3), in-clinic period (Day -2 to Day 4) to follow up visit (Day 8). Participants will receive a single oral dose of JNJ-42847922 or placebo in 3 cohorts. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
