	<brief_title>A Feasibility Study to Evaluate the Safety and Short-term Effectiveness of Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve (TPV)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diverse congenital heart diseases involving the pulmonary artery, such as Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with or without pulmonary atresia, or transposition of the great arteries with pulmonary stenosis, require implantation of an artificial conduit between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery(PA). Because these conduits finally degenerate and result in pulmonary regurgitation and/or stenosis and progressive right ventricle (RV) dilation and eventual failure, patients need repetitive surgery for conduit revision. Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation (TPVI) is a less invasive alternative to surgery in patients with dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). TPV is a large-diameter (up to 28 mm) self-expandable stent with a relatively low profile from a nitinol wire backbone with valve leaflets made from porcine pericardial tissue. The TPV is indicated for use in patients with previous undergone replacement of bioprosthetic valve or conduit due to either pulmonary valve atresia, stenosis, regurgitation or a combination of them and present with dysfunctional RVOT requiring treatment for severe pulmonary regurgitation and/or RVOT conduit obstruction. Consecutive subject data should be collected at discharge, 1, 3, 6 month, and 1-5 years post TPV implantation.</detailed_description>
