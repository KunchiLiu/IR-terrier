	<brief_summary>Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is the second most common muscular dystrophy with approximately 500 patients in Denmark. It is characterized by weakness and wasting of the facial muscles, the muscles in the shoulder region and of the legs. The primary aim of this study is to investigate possible links and order between inflammation and fat infiltration in the muscles in patients with FSHD. Approximately 15 patients with FSHD will be recruited for repeated MRI-scans during a year where the inflammation and fat infiltration in the muscles can be quantified.</brief_summary>
