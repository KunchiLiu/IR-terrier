	<brief_summary>Nutritional status including changes of body composition is one of the most important clinical determinants of outcome after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The laparoscopic gastrectomy is considered to be minimally invasive and to have favorable outcome that is widely used in South Korea. It was reported that several advantages of laparoscopic gastrectomy are the prevention of overt weight loss and enhanced recovery of muscle mass at 6 months after surgery. But there have been no longitudinal studies evaluating changes in the body composition according to the different type of anastomosis of laparoscopic gastrectomy. This study will therefore evaluate which of these two surgical procedures is most effective for postoperative body composition in laparoscopic gastrectomy patients, by comparing whether there are any differences in the amount of weight lost, lean body mass, fat mass, and lipid profile. It will help to better define the influence of anastomosis on changes of body composition after laparoscopic gastrectomy. This information can then be used by physicians to better make a plan to the patient's body make up and medical comorbidities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Body Composition After Laparoscopic Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- All patients will undergo a laparoscopic gastrectomy for their gastric cancer proved to be stage I or II by preoperative screening diagnostic procedure. They will receive laparoscopic gastrectomy with either Billoth 1 or Roux-en-Y anastomosis. - Pre-operative and 6 months post-operative body composition measurement will be performed on each patient. The whole body composition measurement will be assessed by Hologic 4500/A dual energy X-ray absorptiometry system. The software performs calculations of the differential attenuations of the two photon energies and present data of percentage of fat, fat mass (g), lean mass (g), bone mineral content (g), bone mineral density (g/cm2), and total mass (g). - Laboratory analysis - There is a battery of labs that are ordered in both the pre-operative and 6 months post-operative time frame. These labs are ordered independent of the patient's participation in the study. These labs are ordered to evaluate and to assist management of the patient's medical comorbidities as well as to assess for adequate nutritional intake and balance. - Queries on nutritional intake and exercise will be made at each post-operative appointment.</detailed_description>
