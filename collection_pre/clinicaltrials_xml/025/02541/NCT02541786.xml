	<brief_summary>Dexlansoprazole MR is the R-enantiomer of lansoprazole that is delivered by a dual delayed release formulation. It is effective for symptom control of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, its efficacy in the treatment of H.pylori infection remains unclear. This study was conducted to investigate whether the efficacy of single-dose dexlansoprazole MR-based triple therapy was non-inferior to double-dose rabeprazole-based triple therapy in the treatment of H.pylori infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Dexlansoprazole-based Triple and Rabeprazole-based Triple Therapies for Helicobacter Pylori Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) infect more than 50% of humans globally. It is the major cause of chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma). H.pylori eradication has become the standard and most widely adopted therapy to cure peptic ulcer disease. This therapy is also strongly recommended in the treatment of H pylori-related MALToma. In regions with high incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma, eradication of H pylori is advocated as a preventative measure. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is one of the key medicines in anti-H pylori regimens. It possesses anti-H pylori activity, and, by reducing gastric acid secretion, it also increases bioavailability and activity of some antibiotics. This study was conducted to investigate whether the efficacy of single-dose dexlansoprazole MR-based triple therapy was non-inferior to double-dose rabeprazole-based triple therapy in the treatment of H pylori infection.</detailed_description>
