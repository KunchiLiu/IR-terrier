	<brief_summary>This research is aimed at finding out what may influence the decision of patients to participate in trials involving imaging so that the investigators may improve our future studies so they are more patient focused and acceptable in regards to scan schedules.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging in Clinical Trials - a Questionnaire Study to Assess Impact of Imaging Regimes on Patient Participation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a questionnaire study aimed at gaining a greater understanding of the patient perspective on undertaking imaging procedures, MRI and PET/CT, for research purposes. The study is to evaluate the patient opinion and perceptions of the burden of imaging associated with research. We will look at different scanning procedures of varying duration, intensity, frequency and scheduling; this will enable us to have a better understand of the factors that influence participation in research and thus help us develop protocols that are more patient focused and acceptable.</detailed_description>
