	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, single-center, two-arm, placebo-controlled clinical trial that examine the effect of the consumption of a plant sterols-enriched low-fat milk. Half of the participants will consume of 1.5g of plant sterols daily as provided by two servings of the plant sterols-enriched low-fat milk product for 3 consecutive weeks, while the other half will consume placebo low-fat milk.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of a Plant Sterols-Enriched Low-Fat Milk on Lipid Profile in Healthy Southern Chinese (COME-PASS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plant sterols are the naturally occurring functional equivalent of mammalian cholesterol. Plant sterols differ structurally from cholesterol by a methyl or ethyl group in their side chains and are not synthesized by the human body. These structural differences render them minimally absorbable in the intestine. It has been consistently reported that dietary incorporation of plant sterols(1.5-2 g/day) reduces serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels with minimal adverse events. The hypochoelsterolemic effects of plant sterols is explained by an inhibition of cholesterol absorption, which is ascribed to a competition with intestinal cholesterol for incorporation into mixed micelles, although other possible mechanistic explanation have been proposed.</detailed_description>
