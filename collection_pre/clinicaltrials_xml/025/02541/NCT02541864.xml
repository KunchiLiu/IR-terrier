	<brief_summary>According the Maastricht IV consensus report publish in the Gut 2012, bismuth containing quadruple therapy was suggested to be the first choice for eradication therapy of Helicobacter pylori in the area with high clarithromycin resistance. Whether hybrid therapy or 14-day bismuth containing quadruple therapy can replace standard triple therapy as the recommended first-line treatment is unknown. The investigators compared the efficacy of 14-day hybrid therapy and 14-day bismuth containing quadruple therapy in first-line treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For this randomly assigned to receive either a 14-day hybrid therapy (a dual therapy with pantoprazole 40 mg bid, amoxicillin 1 g bid for 7 days, followed by a quadruple therapy with pantoprazole 40 mg bid, amoxicillin 1 g bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid, and metronidazole 500 mg bid for a further 7 days) or a 14-day bismuth containing quadruple therapies (pantoprazole 40 mg bid , bismuth subcitrate 120 mg qid., tetracycline 500 mg qid, and metronidazole 250 mg qid for 14 days).at a 1:1 ratio. Our primary outcomes was the eradication rate by intention-to-treat and per- protocol analyses</detailed_description>
