	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the addition of daratumumab to Bortezomib, Thalidomide and Dexamethasone will increase the stringent complete response rate after consolidation therapy and increase the progression free survival after daratumumab maintenance therapy in transplant eligible participants with previously untreated Multiple Myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Daratumumab in Transplant Eligible Participants With Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, open-label (identity of assigned treatment will be known to participants and study staff), 2-arm (2 treatment groups), multicenter study of daratumumab in participants diagnosed with previously untreated Multiple Myeloma who are eligible for high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (transplantation of own bone marrow). Participants will be randomized (assigned by chance) to one of 2 treatment groups to either receive daratumumab plus bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone or bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone for induction (before transplantation) and consolidation (after transplantation) treatment. All responders will then be re-randomized (assigned by chance) to one of 2 treatment groups to receive maintenance treatment with daratumumab only or observation (no treatment). The study will include a 28-Day Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase of 6 treatment cycles (each cycle is 4 weeks in duration for total period of 30 weeks), and a Follow up Phase of 2 years. The total duration for each participant in the study will be approximately 138 weeks. The end of the study will occur approximately 5 years after the last participant is randomized in the second phase of the study. Disease assessments will be performed every 4 weeks in the first phase of the study and then every 8 weeks in the second phase of the study. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
