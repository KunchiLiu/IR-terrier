	<brief_summary>The acute pain remains unfortunately a major health problem in intensive care patients. Several factors, such as cancer, traumatic injuries, surgery, scars, diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, could contribute to an increase in the incidence or in the intensity of acute pain. The acute pain could impact on the prognosis of intensive care patients and on the patients perception of the quality of care. Moreover, the acute pain could lead to a long-term chronic pain syndrome. The chronic pain after intensive care admission could threaten the physical and psychological recovery after the stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). If many studies have been conducted to improve the management of the acute pain in the ICU, only few data exist on the incidence and the risk factors of the chronic pain after a stay in a surgical intensive care. The aim of the DOLOCHROREA study is to assess the incidence and the risk factors of 6-month chronic pain after a stay in our surgical ICU.</brief_summary>
