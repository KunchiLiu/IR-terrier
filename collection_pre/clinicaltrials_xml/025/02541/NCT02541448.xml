	<brief_title>Pneumoperitoneum Management With SurgiQuest AirSeal at Low vs. Higher Pressure ( PRESSURE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate physician preferences related to use of the SurgiQuest AirSeal Insufflation System (AIS) used at low vs. higher pressures for maintaining pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic/robotic surgical procedures. The study is designed and powered to demonstrate superiority of the AIS used at low insufflation pressure (9±mmHg ±1mmHg) vs higher pressure (15mmHg ±1mmHg) in relation to a single key effectiveness measure: Incidence of shoulder pain. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either AIS with an insufflation pressure target of 9±1mmHg) or to AIS with an insufflation target pressure of 15±1mmHg. Secondary outcome measures include severity of shoulder pain measured using a VAS scale and medication use, procedure time, the number of procedure interruptions, length of hospital stay, aspects of anesthesia management including end tidal CO2 and the frequency of adverse events. These outcomes will be evaluated in a controlled population undergoing laparoscopic/robotic surgery.</detailed_description>
