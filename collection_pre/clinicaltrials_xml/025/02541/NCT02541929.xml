	<brief_summary>Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an essential omega-3 fish oil. DHA is critical to the structure and function of brain cells. DHA fish oil has been shown to be beneficial in cognition in several animal studies; however, this effect in human studies is not clear. It is not known how much dietary fish oil can get into the human brain. Thus, exploring fish oil delivery in human brains is critical for designing appropriate interventions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fish Oil Brain Delivery Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The investigators goal is to study how different people deliver DHA to the brain. - The study will only require two visits six months apart and involve taking DHA during these 6 months. - Participants will receive DHA supplements for the study duration and a compensation for each study visit. - Blood and cerebrospinal fluid levels of DHA will be measured before and after taking DHA. - Brain imaging by MRI will be obtained at baseline and at conclusion of study - This study will help us learn how much of the ingested DHA goes to the brain.</detailed_description>
