	<brief_title>Prediction of Preeclampsia &amp; Other Obstetric Complications by Serum Homocysteine &amp; Doppler</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spontaneous pregnancies with no risk factors will be included. Fasting plasma total homocysteine level samples will be collected between 15th &amp; 19th weeks. Uterine artery doppler between 18th &amp; 22nd weeks. Method 1: Screen positive cases will be considered if homocysteine level above 6.3umol/l Method 2: Screen positive cases will be considered if they had bilateral notches and a mean resistivity index (RI) above 0.55, or unilateral notches and a mean RI above 0.65, or absence of notches and a mean RI above 0.7. Method 3: Screen positive cases will be considered if they had bilateral notches and a mean RI above 0.55, or unilateral notches and a mean RI above 0.65, or absence of notches and a mean RI above 0.7 combined with homocysteine cut off value of 6.3umol / l.</detailed_description>
