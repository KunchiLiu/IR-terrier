	<brief_summary>Aim is to study the effect of a work place intervention during a multicomponent return-to-work rehabilitation program on return-to-work. The intervention is compared with inpatient rehabilitation only, and participants will be recruited from the diagnostic groups dominating the sick-leave statistics, namely musculoskeletal disorders, common mental disorders (e.g. stress, depression and anxiety), and unspecific disorders including chronic fatigue.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Workplace Intervention in Occupational Rehabilitation on Return to Work</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long-term sick-listing from work has considerable impact on social function, on the families of the sick-listed persons, the companies they work for, and society as a whole. Hence, the need for documented effective vocational rehabilitation programs is pressing. Vocational rehabilitation services described in the scientific literature have been specific to one single or a specific group of medical conditions (e.g.low back pain). In contrast, most people on sick leave have several health complaints, and many of the factors influencing sick leave are shared regardless of disorder (e.g. social surroundings, workplace environment), calling for rehabilitation programs that can be employed for both musculoskeletal, unspecific and common mental disorders. Research indicates that interventions on the work place might facilitate return to work. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the effect of a work place intervention during a multicomponent return-to-work rehabilitation program on return-to-work.</detailed_description>
