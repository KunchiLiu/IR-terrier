	<brief_title>Effectiveness of an Exercise Proprioceptive Program in Institutionalized Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study will be to determine the effects of proprioceptive exercise program in improving balance and gait as well as reducing the risk of falls in institutionalized elderly in a healthcare center. To evaluate this effect, a total of 45 subjects will participate in a longitudinal and controlled trial. Inclusion criteria will be over 65 years olds, be institutionalized in the center and have ability to read and write. Thereafter, participants will be separated into two different groups (experimental and control). Randomization was performed using sealed envelopes with different numbers of intervention inside. Both groups will be evaluated both at the start of the first session and in the last working session. The control group performed a geriatric revitalization program as the experimental group. Besides this one, experimental group performed a program of proprioceptive exercises. The intervention rate will 2 weekly sessions for 12 weeks for both groups (24 sessions), lasting 55 minutes. The variables analyzed were: the questionnaire risk of falls in hospital (MORSE), Tinetti scale, the test Timed Up and Go (TUG), the time of one leg, the Cooper test running 12 minutes and scale of Barthel . The study sample will be calculated using the "G-Power 3.1.2" program, with a statistical significance of p &lt;0.05, one study power of 80% (0.8), for two study groups, and an effect size medium f = 0.25. The data analysis will perform using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS statistical software), version 19.0 for Windows, Chicago. To determine the normal distribution of the data the Shapiro-Wilks test and comparison by ANOVA was performed. The values obtained in the pretest and posttest assessment for each variable will be compared by Student t test for related samples or by the Wilcoxon rank test.</detailed_description>
