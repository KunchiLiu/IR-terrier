	<brief_summary>This study aims to prospectively investigate the efficacy, toxicity and quality of life (QOF) of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) using a moderate fractionation of 72 Gy/6 Gy/12 F (BED10 = 115 Gy) in a single arm of elderly ( ≥ 70) patients with stage I (2009 UICC) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) in Elderly Stage I NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to prospectively investigate the local regional control, overall survival, treatment related toxicities and quality of life (QOF) of elderly stage I NSCLC patients receiving stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with a moderate fractionation of 72 Gy/6 Gy/12 F (BED10 = 115 Gy). Patients' general characteristics, treatment modality, dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters, toxicity profiling, quality of life, pattern of failure as well as survival time will be prospective recorded for the analysis.</detailed_description>
