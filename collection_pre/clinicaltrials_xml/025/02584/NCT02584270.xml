	<brief_summary>This study will fill a scientific gap in the current knowledge providing data for evaluation of the palatal augmentation prosthesis as a therapeutic modality in a robust scientific randomized prospective clinical trial. Positive outcomes from this study have the potential to dramatically alter the most common morbidity of oral cancer therapy, namely speech and swallowing function in a population of patients with T1/T2 tumors of the tongue who are not currently routinely recommended for a palatal augmentation prosthesis.</brief_summary>
