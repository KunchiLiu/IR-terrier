	<brief_title>The Effect of GLP-1 on Postprandial Glucagon Secretion Independent of The Gastric Emptying Rate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim: To investigate the glucagonostatic effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) during prolonged and intermittent stimulation of the GLP-1 receptor independent of the gastric emptying rate. Glucagon concentrations will be measured following a liquid meal administered in duodenum at baseline and after exenatide, and liraglutide treatment.</detailed_description>
