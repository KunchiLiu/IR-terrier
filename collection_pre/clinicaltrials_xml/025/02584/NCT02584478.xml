	<brief_title>Phase 1/2a Evaluation of Adding AL3818 to Standard Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in Subjects With Recurrent or Metastatic Endometrial, Ovarian, Fallopian, Primary Peritoneal or Cervical Carcinoma (AL3818-US-002)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial is a Phase 1b/2a trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding oral AL3818 to standard platinum-based chemotherapy such as carboplatin plus paclitaxel, concurrently and continued as a maintenance therapy for up to 12 months, in subjects with recurrent or metastatic endometrial, ovarian, fallopian, primary peritoneal, or cervical carcinoma. AL3818 is a novel small molecule dual receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which shows highly selective inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFr) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). Preclinical studies of this agent in mouse models, including various cancer xenografts, have demonstrated that treatment of tumor-bearing mice with AL3818 induces tumor reductions. This study will be divided into two parts. The objective of Part 1 is the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of adding oral AL3818 to standard carboplatin plus paclitaxel chemotherapy for a cycle of 21 days to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). The objective of Part 2 is evaluation of preliminary efficacy and the safety of adding oral AL3818 at the RP2D determined in Part 1 to carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy for 6 cycles. Continuous maintenance mono therapy with 14 days on and 7 days off regimen at the RP2D will be conducted up to 12 months and is extendable beyond until disease progression.</detailed_description>

Endometrial Cancer: recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma refractory to conventional therapy or established treatments with the following histologic epithelial cell types i. Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified, mucinous adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and transitional cell carcinoma b.

Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified. c. Cervical cancer: squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix refractory to conventional therapy or established treatments with the following histologic epithelial cell types: i. Squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma Measurable disease defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded). Each lesion must be ≥ 20mm when measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain xray, CT, and MRI or ≥ 10mm when measured by spiral CT. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months Able to take orally administered study medication Must sign approved informed consent and authorization permitting release of personal health information. Patient must have adequate: 1. Bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm^3, equivalent to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 1, platelets ≥ 100,000/mm^3 2.

Hepatic function: bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (CTC grade 1) or ≤ 3.0 x ULN for subjects with Gilbert Syndrome; AST and ALT ≤ 3.0 ×ULN. 4. Coagulation profile: PT such that international normalized ratio (INR) is ≤ 1.55 (or an inrange INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin or low molecular weight heparin) and a PTT &lt; 1.2 times control. 5. ECOG performance ≤ 2 Patient of childbearing potential must agree to use contraceptive measures starting 1 week before the administration of the first dose of AL3818 until 4 weeks after discontinuing study drug and have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to study entry and cannot be lactating. Ability and willingness to comply with the study protocol for the duration of the study and with followup procedures. Patients with serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer or bone fracture. Patients with active bleeding or pathologic conditions that carry high risk of bleeding, such as known bleeding disorder, coagulopathy, or tumor involving major vessels. Patient with history or evidence upon physical examination of CNS disease, including primary brain tumor, seizures not controlled with standard medical therapy, any brain metastases or history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA, stroke) transient ischemic attack (TIA) or subarachnoid hemorrhage within 6 months of the first date of treatment on this study. a. Patients with metastatic CNS tumors may participate in this trial, if the patient is &gt; 4 weeks from therapy completion (including radiation and/or surgery), is clinically stable at the time of study entry and is not receiving corticosteroid therapy. Patients with proteinuria: patients discovered to have a urine protein of 1+ on dipstick or ≥ 30 mg/dl at baseline should undergo a 24hour urine collection, which must be an adequate collection and must demonstrate &lt; 1000 mg protein/24 hours to allow participation in the study.
