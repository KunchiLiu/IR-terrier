	<brief_summary>Background: Research has extensively documented the adverse impact that caring for an individual with an acquired brain injury can have including financial difficulties, social isolation, family tension and conflict, relationship difficulties, role adjustment and psychological distress (Foster et al., 2012). Research has indicated that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) shows promise for increasing wellbeing and psychological flexibility in caregivers and could be a useful intervention for use with this population. Aims: The primary aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using an ACT intervention to enhance the wellbeing and the psychological flexibility of carers using the Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes (PICO) framework. Methods: The current study is a randomised control design, exploring the feasibility of comparing the efficacy of an ACT intervention to Enhanced Treatment As Usual (ETAU), to improve the wellbeing of the carers of adults with an acquired brain injury (ABI). Participants will be recruited from the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust (BIRT) in Glasgow, Scotland and randomly assigned to either an ACT intervention group or TAU control group. Both will be assessed in parallel to one another completing a range of baseline and post-baseline measures. Applications: This feasibility study will provide information for further research on the utilisation of an ACT intervention to improve the wellbeing of carers and whether this is an acceptable intervention for this population.</brief_summary>
