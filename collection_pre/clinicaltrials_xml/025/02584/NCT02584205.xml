	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic, progressive and disabling disease and can affect functional capacity due to the weakness of the respiratory muscles. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of inspiratory muscle training on functional capacity in patients with OSA. A pilot study will be conducted to calculate the sample. Individuals of both genders, diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea moderate or severe (measured by polysomnography) will be invited and the data collected in the Sleep Laboratory of the Pronto-Socorro Cardiológico de Pernambuco (PROCAPE), located in Recife- PE- BRAZIL. The study deals with a test-clinical randomized double-blind.The intervention groups held inspiratory muscle training (IMT) and the load is equivalent to 40% of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). The evaluations will be performed once a week during twelve weeks. Control groups will be submitted to a simulated training with load less than 10% of MIP (insufficient charge to train the muscles), during the same period as the intervention group. The guidelines for the training and weekly evaluations will be performed by the responsible for the researcher physiotherapist in Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy Laboratory (LACAP- UFPE). After the training period, the groups will be reassessed by the evaluation tests of functional capacity (ADL- Glittre Test and Ergospirometry), inspiratory muscle strength (manometer) and lung function (spirometry) and then compared. Expected results: The interventional groups will improve their functional capacity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Inspiratory Muscle Training Improve Functional Capacity in Subjects With Obstructive Sleep Apnea?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic, progressive and disabling disease and can affect functional capacity due to the weakness of the respiratory muscles. The inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has improved exercise tolerance in other cardiopulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure. Objectives: Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of inspiratory muscle training on functional capacity in patients with OSA. Patients and Methods: A pilot study will be conducted to calculate the sample. Individuals of both genders, diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea moderate or severe (measured by polysomnography) will be invited and the data collected in the Sleep Laboratory of the Pronto-Socorro Cardiológico de Pernambuco (PROCAPE), located in Recife- PE- BRAZIL. The study deals with a test-clinical randomized double-blind to be held in four groups: A) Patients with OSA and Obesity - intervention, B) Patients with OSA and Obesity - control, C) Patients with OSA eutrophic - intervention , D) Patients with OSA eutrophic - control. The intervention groups held inspiratory muscle training (IMT) and the load is equivalent to 40% of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). The evaluations will be performed once a week during twelve weeks. Control groups will be submitted to a simulated training with load less than 10% of MIP (insufficient charge to train the muscles), during the same period as the intervention group. The guidelines for the training and weekly evaluations will be performed by the responsible for the researcher physiotherapist in Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy Laboratory (LACAP- UFPE). After the training period, the groups will be reassessed by the evaluation tests of functional capacity (ADL-Glittre Test and Ergospirometry), inspiratory muscle strength (manometer) and lung function (spirometry) and then compared. Expected results: The interventional groups will improve their functional capacity.</detailed_description>
