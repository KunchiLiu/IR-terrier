	<brief_title>360° - Video Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimated 10-11% of the US population experiences a specific phobia at some point in their lives (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Magee et al., 1996). About 60-85% of those individuals with a specific phobia never seek treatment (Agras, Sylvester, &amp; Oliveau, 1969; Boyd et al., 1990; Magee et al., 1996). Clinical psychologist can help improve the number of phobia sufferers to seek treatment. Advances in technology are helping clinicians create novel treatment strategies for different anxiety disorders. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) may help these individuals confront their fears and treat their phobia. While virtual reality exposure therapy has shown promise in research (Powers &amp; Emmelkamp, 2008), studies have shown that many users complain that the computer generated virtual reality (VR) stimuli looks unrealistic, eccentric and too much like a video game (Kwon, Powell, &amp; Chalmers, 2013). Virtual reality environments have been traditionally created by programmers using video game assets and computer generated imagery (CGI). While CGI can be used to make intricate virtual environments, unless there is a team of expert digital artists, the virtual stimulus may end up looking rudimentary and exhibit a number of graphical glitches which could prove distracting in therapy. Furthermore CGI often suffers from the uncanny valley effect: the tendency of CGI representations of people to be viewed as unsettling as the representations become more lifelike. In addition the many current CGI virtual reality packages are expensive and only available for limited number of fear domains. Recently however an exciting alternative to traditional computer generated virtual reality has emerged: 360° Video VR. 360° Video VR is a radical filmmaking technology that can turn live action footage into a 360° environment that users can interact with. 360° Video VR is made by filming with an array of multiple HD cameras carefully arranged to capture all angles in a 360° area of a live action event. Then those angles are stitched together in post-production into a 360° texture sphere and the sphere is then mapped to the head tracker on the users HDM. Leading to the effect that when a user turns his head, their view of the live action video footage turns with them in real time (e.g. if the user looks down, the camera pans down and the user sees the floor) allowing the user to look around anywhere in the 360° of filmed footage of the live action event. The benefit of 360° video VR as opposed CGI VR is that it is photo realistic, does not suffer from a uncanny valley effect of CGI, and is able to capture nuances of real life fears that are hard to reproduce with CGI.</detailed_description>
