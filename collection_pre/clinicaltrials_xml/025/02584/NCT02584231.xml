	<brief_summary>Patients suffering from nocturnal enuresis (starting from the age of 5 till adulthood) are all treated with the same dose of desmopressin, i.e. 120mcg once daily. In treatment resistant enuresis, this dose is doubled: those patients take 240mcg once daily. A pilot study performed at our department showed a correlation between weight and plasma concentration when a fixed dose of desmopressin oral lyophilisate formulation was given to the pediatric patient (older than 6 years). This study will investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of desmopressin in young children, less than 8 years old. Additionally, the efficacy of desmopressin oral lyophilisate formulation in urinary concentration testing will be evaluated</brief_summary>
