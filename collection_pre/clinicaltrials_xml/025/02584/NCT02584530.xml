	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled study comparing US guided vs standard procedure for PICC line placement in newborns admitted to Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Neonatal Intensive Care Unit who require a PICC line. Patients will be randomized using REDCap randomization module (stratified by gestational age &lt; 28 weeks and &gt;= 28 weeks and blocked to ensure approximate balance with each stratum) into two arms. - Arm 1: PICC line insertion procedure using anatomical landmarks and tip placement will be confirmed by X-ray (current standard); Arm 2: US guided PICC line insertion procedure and tip placement confirmation by both US and X-ray. Sample size of 33 infants per group would achieve greater than 80% power to detect a difference between groups. Primary outcome: Time to complete the standard versus the US-guided procedure. Secondary outcomes (comparison between two arms): The number of total "venipuncture" attempts needed to place a PICC line Number of tip manipulations after complete insertion Proportion of successful tip placement</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) line placement is one of the most commonly performed procedures in Neonatology. Due to prematurity and small vein size, the procedure often requires multiple attempts over an increased timeframe. As a standard of care, the position is confirmed by X-ray. Frequently, catheters are not optimally positioned, necessitating repositioning and further radiographs. The use of ultrasound (US) guidance for PICC line placement enhances the visualization of the veins and provides a better selection for optimal access. It could decrease or even eliminate the need for X-rays when used to confirm the tip position. Objectives To demonstrate that using US-guidance to place and confirm tip positioning for PICC line insertion in neonates will decrease the number of cannulation attempts, will shorten the time needed to complete the procedure, and will decrease infants' exposure to radiation. Methods This is a randomized controlled study comparing US guided vs standard procedure for PICC line placement in newborns admitted to CHEO NICU who require a PICC line (approximately 130-150 infants per year). Patients will be randomized using REDCap randomization module (stratified by gestational age &lt; 28 weeks and &gt;= 28 weeks and blocked to ensure approximate balance with each stratum) into two arms - Arm 1: PICC line insertion procedure using anatomical landmarks and tip placement will be confirmed by X-ray (current standard); Arm 2: US guided PICC line insertion procedure and tip placement confirmation by both US and X-ray. A sample size of 33 infants per group would be sufficient to achieve greater than 80% power to detect a difference between groups. Results of this study may demonstrate that US guided PICC line placement is superior (shorter and safer procedure, reduced radiation and pain) to currently used procedure and could lead to practice change.</detailed_description>
