	<brief_summary>This is a open label, randomized phase VI study, to assess the safety and immunogenicity of co-administration of Hepatitis E vaccine with Hepatitis B vaccine. The concomitant group (n =300) received Hepatitis B vaccine concomitantly with Hepatitis E vaccine at day 1 and months 1 and 6; The nonconcomitant group (n =150) received Hepatitis E vaccine at at day 1 and months 1 and 6. Another nonconcomitant group (n=150) received Hepatitis B vaccine at at day 1 and months 1 and 6. Anti-HEV IgG and HBsAb were determined. Injection-site and systemic adverse events (AEs) were monitored for 30 days after any vaccination; serious AEs were monitored throughout the study.</brief_summary>
