	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important risk factor of cardio-cerebral vascular disease such as coronary heart disease. GLP-1 is a kind of incretin secreted by the L-cell located in Ileum. It acts as an incretin hormone by protentiating glucose-stimulated insulin release. Recent studies reported that GLP-1 RA can protect the vascular endothelial and prevent vascular from atherosclerosis. Investigators design this study to investigate exenatide's effect on the improvement of the coronary endothelial function by evaluating endothelium dependent diastolic function and testing the vascular endothelial active substance and related inflammatory factors.</brief_summary>
