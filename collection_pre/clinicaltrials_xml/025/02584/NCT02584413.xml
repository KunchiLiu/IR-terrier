	<brief_summary>Currently, optic pathway gliomas (OPG) are detected based on abnormal findings made during annual ophthalmologic exams. However, because these exams are annual, it is possible for healthcare providers to miss the point at which a child's vision begins to decline (potentially indicating an OPG). If at-risk children are screened for hypotonia early in life, those children who are hypotonic may undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for OPG before they are showing ophthalmologic symptoms. This would enable healthcare providers to discover vision loss earlier and treat symptomatic OPGs earlier, thereby allowing us a better chance of preventing further vision loss in children with OPGs.</brief_summary>
