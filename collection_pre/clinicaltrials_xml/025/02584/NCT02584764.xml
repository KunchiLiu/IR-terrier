	<brief_summary>The primary aim is to develop, and test the feasibility and efficacy of, a manual based, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) treatment for Hoarding Disorder (HD) delivered in a group format combined with an Internet support system. The investigators' secondary aim is to investigate the neurocognitive profile of the participants before and after treatment in order to explore if the treatment might have an impact on neurocognitive functioning and if certain neurocognitive profiles predict outcome. For the primary aim, the investigators hypothesize that the treatment will be acceptable to participants and decrease symptoms of hoarding. Regarding the secondary aim, the investigators hypothesize that deficiencies in executive functioning, as measured with a neurocognitive battery, will reduce upon completion of treatment and that baseline executive function will be associated with treatment outcome.</brief_summary>
