	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine retrospectively if the application of rivaroxaban after endovenous laser ablation with and without miniphlebectomy is safe and if it lowers the risk of venous thrombosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rivaroxaban in Endovenous Laser Ablation With and Without Miniphlebectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rivaroxaban is an orally active direct factor Xa inhibitor, that is used for thrombosis prophylaxis for example in the setting of orthopaedic surgery. In the observed situation Rivaroxaban was applied in a dosage of 10mg daily during 5 days after endovenous laser ablation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients age greater than 18 years, informed consent was given. Endovenous Laser Ablation (EVLA) of the greater saphenous vein (GSV), autologous saphenous vein (ASV) and/or small saphenous vein (SSV) using 1470 nm wavelength radial laser (ELVeS, Biolitec, Austria) and postinterventional Endothermal Heat Induced Thrombosis (EHIT) prophylaxis with rivaroxaban. Patients are ineligible if they had: an endovenous ablation technique other than EVLA, other veins than GSV, ASV or SSV treated with EVLA (i.e. perforators), postinterventional EHIT prophylaxis other than prophylactic dose of rivaroxaban or informed consent was not given.</criteria>
