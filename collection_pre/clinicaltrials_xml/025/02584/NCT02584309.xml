	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to look at whether giving a drug called dexrazoxane plus olaratumab with standard of care doxorubicin affects the progression of the disease. Dexrazoxane is often given at the same time as doxorubicin to help reduce the incidence and severity of disease of the heart muscle (which can be caused by doxorubicin).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed grade 2 or 3 soft tissue sarcoma that is unresectable or metastatic. Surgery for primary or metastatic disease after chemotherapy following a response is allowed. Patients with the following tumor types are eligible: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma Leiomyosarcoma Malignant fibrous histiocytoma Liposarcoma (myxoid/round cell, pleomorphic or dedifferentiated) Synovial sarcoma Myxofibrosarcoma Angiosarcoma Fibrosarcoma Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor Epithelioid sarcoma Unclassified highgrade sarcoma (not otherwise specified) Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1; that is, measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan, as ≥ 20 mm by chest xray, or ≥ 10 mm with calipers by clinical exam. Planning to initiate treatment with doxorubicin (starting dose 75 mg/m2) and olaratumab (starting dose of 15 mg/kg) as routine care. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and/or docetaxel/paclitaxel is allowed. At least 18 years of age. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 Adequate organ function defined as: Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3.0 x IULN Creatinine ≤ IULN OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable). Myocardial infarction within the past 12 months, or stable or unstable angina. Systolic heart failure defined as left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45%. Symptomatic valvular heart disease. Prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease. Known brain metastases. Prior or second primary malignancies within the last two years (except carcinoma in situ of the cervix, nonmetastatic prostate cancer, or basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only; prior adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy in the case of prostate cancer is permitted, but current adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy is not). Currently receiving any investigational agents. A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to dexrazoxane or other agents used in the study. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry. Known HIVpositivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with dexrazoxane. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated. Prior treatment with anthracyclines.</criteria>
