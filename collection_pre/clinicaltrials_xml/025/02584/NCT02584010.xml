	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Two Silicon-based Products to Treat Scars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Improve the final aspect of scars, have been a challenge for medicine. Silicon based products have been used in various ways to prevent hypertrophic scars and keloids since 1980. A great percentage of studies shows that silicon-based products improves the aspect of scars in different pathologies. The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy, using the Vancouver scale, of two silicon-based products (Kelofin gel and Kelofin aerosol) after 180 days. 300 participants that meet all the inclusion criteria and are not classified in any of the exclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to one of thre treatment groups( Kelofin Gel, Kelofin Aerosol and no treatment) of the study.</detailed_description>
