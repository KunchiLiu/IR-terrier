	<brief_title>PrEP Adherence Enhancement Guided by iTAB and Drug Levels for Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label single-arm longitudinal clinical trial to estimate medication adherence and retention in a PrEP HIV prevention program that implements a combination intervention strategy that uses text-messages (iTAB) and a staged adherence counseling support strategy titrated from real-time drug levels in women at-risk for HIV acquisition. A total of 135 participants will receive the combined intervention of text messaging adherence reminders and adherence support. The text messaging system consists of daily, personalized, automated 2-way text messages to maintain adherence and retention. Participants that have a low intracellular tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentration will receive escalated, targeted adherence support. All participants will receive access to PrEP in accordance with standardized comprehensive methods of prescribing and clinical assessments that include safety monitoring as well as regular HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening. All participants will be followed for 48 weeks after enrollment and will receive a post study follow-up at 60 weeks. The primary endpoint will be measured at 48 weeks.</detailed_description>
