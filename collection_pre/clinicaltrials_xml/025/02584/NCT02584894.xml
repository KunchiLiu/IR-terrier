	<detailed_description>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is characterized by intrusive and persistent memory of past result from an event causing or able to cause death, be a threat of death, a severe injury or constitute a threat for physical integrity. It is a frequent disorder in general population (8%). In France, The most frequent traumatic events causing PTSD are serious accidents, rape, physical assaults, violence, etc. PTSD treatment involves antidepressant and cognitive and behavioural psychotherapy, which encourage exposure to elements that remind the trauma (memories, circumstances), with the objective of reducing the fear associated with the traumatic memories. Innovative therapeutic strategies aim to improve the psychotherapeutic effect with enhancement drugs or using neuromodulatory techniques, such as repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy in PTSD treatment of concomitant voluntary reactivation of personal traumatic memories with neuromodulation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using 10Hz rTMS, compared to 1Hz rTMS, during 2 weeks.</detailed_description>
