	<brief_summary>Despite the apparent multifaceted benefit in differentiating blockade sites and duration of nerve blockade, the efficacy of continuous adductor canal blockade utilized specifically in ACL reconstruction has not been extensively studied. This study will test the hypothesis that the use of the adductor canal continuous nerve catheter will result in lower subjective pain scores on postoperative day 2 and improved quadriceps strength on postoperative day 1.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Evaluating Postop Pain and Muscle Strength Among Regional Anesthesia Techniques for Ambulatory ACL Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participants will be randomized to 2 groups: (1) continuous adductor canal nerve catheter or (2) long-acting single bolus adductor canal nerve block. Following random selection via random envelope selection patients will receive the following procedures. Both groups will receive ultrasound guided femoral nerve block with 20cc of 2% mepivacaine &lt;20 minutes prior to in room time. Intraoperative care will consist of general anesthesia under the care of the attending anesthesiologist assigned to the patient. Induction will include a propofol bolus and placement of laryngeal mask airway. Intraoperative opioid should be limited to no more than 150mcg of fentanyl. Upon completion of wound closure, appropriate dressing placement, emergence from anesthesia and removal of LMA, patients to be taken to PACU. Once adequately awake and alert, Group 1 patients 1 will receive ultrasound guided adductor canal continuous nerve catheter using normal saline as bolus for placement, followed by initiation of 1/8% bupivacaine infusion through catheter at 8cc/h. Group 2 will receive ultrasound guided adductor canal nerve block with 10cc of 0.5% ropivacaine + 2mg dexamethasone (0. 5cc), keeping total injectate at 10.5cc to spare significant proximal spread to femoral nerve14. After adequate instruction including catheter education (if applicable) patients are to be discharged home.</detailed_description>
