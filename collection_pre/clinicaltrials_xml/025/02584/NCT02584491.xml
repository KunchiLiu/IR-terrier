	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the associations between changes in neural activity and structure, advanced gross motor skills, gait characteristics, and physical activity participation following a gait-related intervention that is based on motor learning principles for ambulatory children and youth with hemiplegic and diplegic cerebral palsy. The investigators' hypothesis is that in conjunction with a program of motor learning based training, functional neuroplastic changes in the involved motor areas will be strongly associated with changes in gait and advanced gross motor skills, moderately associated with physical activity based participation changes, and will have a fair association with structural neuroplastic change.</brief_summary>
