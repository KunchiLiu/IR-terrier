	<brief_summary>Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) is the most common vasculitis and has significant morbidity in terms of blindness, stroke, and tissue necrosis. It requires protracted treatment with high-dose steroids, and despite this there is a risk of flare during the treatment. Little is known about the initial triggers for the inflammatory process, and there are no good markers of response or relapse. We will study patients referred with suspected GCA to identify important components of the immune response in GCA, and follow them over time to collect evidence of how best to monitor their condition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aetiology of TemporaL Arteritis Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives and Study Plan: Study Purpose: The purpose of the study is to investigate the underlying immunological processes in GCA and to study the pattern of expression of immune response over time to give us information about how best to monitor GCA. End Point: The end point will be the final visit of the final patient. Milestones: The project is in 3 phases. In phase 1 (0-2 years) patients will be recruited to fulfil the specified primary and secondary objectives. In phase 2 (0-4 years), these patients will be followed up for a total of 2 years each, or until they are discharged from clinic. In phase 3 (1-5 years), further studies will be defined and tissue and data collected under amended ethics.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. 18 years of age or over 2. A clinical suspicion of a new diagnosis of GCA e.g. patients with a new onset of headache, scalp tenderness, with or without elevated CRP or ESR, jaw or tongue claudication with or without visual loss 3. Participants must be willing to give informed written consent or willing to give permission for a nominated friend or relative to provide written informed assent if they are unable to do so because of physical disabilities e.g. sudden onset of blindness/vision loss which can be caused by GCA (this will be made clear in the ethics approval application) 1. Previous diagnosis of GCA 2. Long term (&gt;1 month) high dose (&gt;20mg per day at any time) steroids for conditions other than PMR, within three months prior to study entry 3. Inability to give informed consent (either written consent or verbal assent from a relative or carer)</criteria>
