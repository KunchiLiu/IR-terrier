	<brief_summary>The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is a 20-item self-report instrument designed to measure fatigue. It covers the following dimensions: general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation and reduced activity. Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) contains nine statements that rate the severity of fatigue symptoms. The purposes of this study are to translate fatigue questionnaires of -MFI- and -FSS- to Taiwan-version, and to examine the reliability and validity of the scales. A hundred adult people without diagnosed physical nor mental disabilities will be recruited. Subjects will fill out the Taiwan-version of MFI, FSS, SF-36 and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to establish the validity. Subjects will re-fill the MFI and FSS one week later to evaluate the test-retest reliability. Another twenty people who are familiar with both English and Chinese will be recruited to evaluate the translation reliability. Subjects will fill out the English version of MFI and FSS and, then, fill out the Taiwan-version of the MFI and FSS with at least ten minutes apart. The translation reliability will be evaluated by paired t test and the intraclass correlation coefficient.</brief_summary>
