	<brief_title>Dextromethorphan Effect on Central Sensitization to Pain in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a cross-over group, double-blind, randomized clinical trial in healthy volunteers comparing dextromethorphan and inactive control on freeze-induced hyperalgesia, experimental pain, diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC), pupillary reaction and reaction time. The influence of CYP3A4 and MDR1 polymorphism on the dextromethorphan analgesic efficacy will be measured. The study design is divided in two study sequences and each subject participates in the two study sequences and receive the two treatments (dextromethorphan and placebo). Each study sequence consists of 3 assessment days (Day -1, Day 0 = first treatment administration and Day 1).</detailed_description>
