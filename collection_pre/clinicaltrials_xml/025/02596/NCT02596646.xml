	<brief_summary>This study evaluates whether an early precut strategy in cases of difficult biliary cannulation could reduce the incidence of PEP compared with that after prolonged cannulation attempts. Secondary aims are to compare the success of biliary cannulation and complications rates of the two techniques.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Precut in Difficult Biliary Cannulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this prospective multicenter randomized clinical trial the investigators assign patients referred for therapeutic biliary ERCP and difficult biliary cannulation (unsuccessful cannulation after 5 minutes) to early precut (group A) or repeated papillary cannulation attempts followed, in case of failure, by late precut (group B). Group A patients undergo precut immediately after randomization ("early precut"), while for group B cannulation attempts are continued for another 10 minutes, after which a precut is done if these fail or there are three unintended additional passages of the guide-wire into the MPD ("delayed precut").</detailed_description>
