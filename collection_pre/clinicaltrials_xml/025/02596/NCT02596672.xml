	<brief_title>Promoting Walking in Older Adults Living in Independent Living Communities in Northern Ireland: A Feasibility Study.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a cluster randomized controlled feasibility trial of a multi-level peer-led walking intervention. The socio-ecological model and social cognitive theory provides the framework that will help inform and test the feasibility of a multi-level peer-led walking intervention for inactive older adults living in independent living communities in Northern Ireland. The behaviour change techniques identified and extracted from a previous systematic review on the effectiveness of peer-led physical activity interventions helped guide the decision-making process of which behavior change strategies should be included in this study. The logic model helped inform the design and development of the 12 week peer-led walking programme.</detailed_description>
