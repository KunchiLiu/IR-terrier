	<brief_summary>Dialysis patients typically undergo 3 treatments a week every other day with an almost 3 day gap during the weekend. After this gap and before the first dialysis of the week the serum Potassium level is expected to be maximal. Participants will be recruited from the dialysis clinic at Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital. The research team would personally meet the patients who answer inclusion criteria f and ask whether they wish to participate. Each willing participant will undergo Sialometry and blood will be drawn from the dialysis connections for CBC and Biochemistry to establish a baseline. The study measurements namely Sialometry and collection of Saliva as well as blood test will be taken before the initiation of the dialysis. Blood testing will be done via the laboratories of the Hadassah hospital. Saliva analysis will be done in the research lab of Prof. Doron Aframian.</brief_summary>
