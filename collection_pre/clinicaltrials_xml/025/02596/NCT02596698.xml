	<detailed_description>This is a research study looking at the biology of mood disorders in youth. The investigator ask participants to come in for three visits. The first visit includes a diagnostic interview, some questionnaires, and a blood draw. The blood draw will take place at the Fairview Outpatient Lab. A trained technician will take about 4 teaspoons of blood from the participant's arm. This sample will be sent to Dr. Andreazza in Toronto, Ontario for further analysis. No results will be shared with the participant. The second visit would take place at the Fairview Riverside Ambulatory Research Center (ARC). This appointment will include the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). For this, participants will be asked to prepare a short speech for 5 minutes and deliver that speech for in front of an audience with another task to follow. This task will be videotaped. After the participant has completed the speech task, the participant will be asked to complete a number of laptop games which will test for things like attention and memory. Participants will be asked to provide 5 saliva samples throughout the course of this visit so the investigators can look at Cortisol which is a hormone naturally found in saliva. The investigators will also ask participants to complete an additional set of 5 spit samples at home during the course of a normal day and bring those back to their next appointment. The third visit would take place at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) and would include a brain MRI. The MRI scan is noninvasive and takes about 2 hours. Participants will be asked to provide a urine sample and complete a urine toxicology screen (drug test) and pregnancy test (if female) prior to the MRI scan. Participants may not participate if drug or pregnancy testing is positive. The MRI involves taking pictures of the brain, from which measures of the integrity of certain brain tissues can be derived. For the scan, participants will be asked to lie down quietly on a scanner bed. Once they are inside the scanner, it will start to take pictures. While in the scanner, participants will be doing things like resting, or listening to music.</detailed_description>
