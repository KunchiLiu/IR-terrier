	<brief_summary>RE-COVERY is a large, multi-national, multi-center observational study based on new data collection. The study will enroll and characterize patients within 30 days of being diagnosed with an acute DVT and/or PE. The study has two main objectives. Objective 1 will characterize the DVT / PE patient population. All patients with a DVT and/or PE will be enrolled for cross-sectional characterization of the VTE patient population. Objective 2 will compare the safety and effectiveness of dabigatran etexilate regimens for treatment of VTE in comparison to VKA regimens. Patients treated with dabigatran etexilate or VKA will be followed up for the occurrence of outcome events for up to one year.</brief_summary>
