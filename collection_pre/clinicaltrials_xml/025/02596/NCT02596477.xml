	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether vepoloxamer can provide a blood chemical marker and functional benefit to damaged heart muscle cells. This will be evaluated by measurement of blood-based laboratory markers, exercise tolerance, and echocardiograms. In addition, the safety and blood levels of vepoloxamer in subjects with chronic heart failure will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
