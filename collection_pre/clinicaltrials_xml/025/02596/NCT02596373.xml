	<brief_title>A Study of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection in Advanced Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection is a kind of anthraquinone compounds, and its antineoplastic effect has been viewed in preclinical tests. The investigator's phase Ⅰstudy has shown that the drug's toxicity is manageable and the tolerable does is 20 mg/m2. The hypothesis of this clinical research study is to discover if the study drug Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection can shrink or slow the growth of advanced recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The safety of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection will also be studied. Patients physical state, symptoms, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings obtained while on-study will help the research team decide if Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection is safe and effective in advanced recurrent or metastatic breast cancer patients.</detailed_description>
