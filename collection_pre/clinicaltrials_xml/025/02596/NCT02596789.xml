	<brief_summary>This study has two main goals : - to investigate the impact of aging on cortical excitability (CE) - to investigate the impact of "state dependency" on CE, using a cognitive task and an emotional one. A Neuronavigation system of transcranial magnetic stimulation is used, and electromyographic response are recorded.</brief_summary>
