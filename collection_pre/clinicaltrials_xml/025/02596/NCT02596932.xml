	<brief_summary>Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common medical complications of pregnancy. Neonatal hypoglycemia is a common and well described complication for infants born to mothers with GDM and diabetes mellitus (DM) and studies have linked intrapartum maternal glucose levels with neonatal hypoglycemia. While guidelines exist to guide practitioners in how to best manage intrapartum maternal glucose levels among Type I and and Type II DM, there is a paucity of data guiding practitioners in the intrapartum management of blood glucose levels for women with GDM, particularly those treated with insulin antepartum. The goal of this project is to compare two protocols of intrapartum glucose management in women with GDM and investigate the impact on neonatal blood glucose levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrapartum Glucose Management Among Women With Gestational Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research objective- To compare "Tight" vs. "Less Tight" intrapartum glucose management Hypothesis: Neonates born to mothers managed via the "Less Tight" intrapartum glucose management protocol will have lower mean glucose levels in the first 24 hours of life when compared to mean glucose levels among infants born to mothers managed via the "Tight" intrapartum glucose management protocol. Study Design: Randomized trial Population: English or Spanish speaking women with a diagnosis of GDM managed at the Diabetes in Pregnancy Program at Women &amp; Infants Hospital, with a plan to deliver at Women &amp; Infants Hospital Once enrolled, patients will then be randomized to "Tight" or "Less Tight" intrapartum glucose control. Once admitted to the labor floor for intrapartum management the appropriate power plan for glucose control will be initiated. The specifics of labor management will be left to the discretion of the provider.</detailed_description>
