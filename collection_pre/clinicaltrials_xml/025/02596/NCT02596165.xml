	<brief_summary>The significance of parameters of the central hemodynamic is based upon their strong association with left ventricular hypertrophy and target organ damage at the heart. Noninvasive, auscultatory/ oscillometric and therefore easy applicable measurements of the central hemodynamic such as presented by the Schiller BR-102 plus PWA device implicate highly promising potential for research and daily clinical praxis for improved cardiovascular risk assessment on the population level. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the validity of the central and peripheral blood pressure and central arterial stiffness measured with the device BR-102 plus PWA from Schiller (Schiller AG, Baar, Switzerland).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of the Schiller BR-102 Plus PWA Device to Measure Central and Peripheral Hemodynamics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is an open, monocentric cross-sectional research study for the evaluation of the validity of the central and peripheral blood pressure and central arterial stiffness measured with the device BR-102 plus PWA from Schiller (Schiller AG, Baar, Switzerland). For that purpose measurement of the respective parameters in cardiovascular disease free individuals will be compared with validated devices and the agreement between the devices will be statistically analyzed. Central blood pressure and central arterial stiffness are clinically increasingly meaningful parameters of the cardiovascular system that allow improved, early cardiovascular risk stratification. The significance of parameters of the central hemodynamic is based upon their strong association with left ventricular hypertrophy and target organ damage at the heart. Noninvasive, auscultatory/ oscillometric and therefore easy applicable measurements of the central hemodynamic such as presented by the Schiller BR-102 plus PWA device implicate highly promising potential for research and daily clinical praxis for improved cardiovascular risk assessment on the population level.</detailed_description>
