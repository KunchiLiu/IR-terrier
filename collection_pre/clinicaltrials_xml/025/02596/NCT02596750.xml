	<brief_title>The Effect of Microneedle Pretreatment on Topical Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluates whether the time to anesthesia with topical 4% lidocaine can be accelerated with the use of microneedle pretreatment. The study will evaluate the anesthesia as a randomized split-body study where each subject serves as their own control. The study will be performed on the volar forearm. Prior to application of the topical 4% lidocaine, one arm will be exposed to a microneedle pretreatment on a microneedle roller and the other arm will be exposed to sham microneedle treatment that will consist of a flat roller with no microneedles. Then pain will be assessed with the use of a spring loaded needle lancet that will be applied at 2 min, 5 min, 10 min, and 30 minutes after treatment.</detailed_description>
