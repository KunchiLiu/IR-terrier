	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the feasibility of running a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a psychotherapy called "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)", delivered in a self-help format with additional telephone support from a therapist, for people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and low mood.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A RCT of Telephone-supported ACT in MS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large proportion of people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) suffer from emotional problems, therefore a large percentage of people with MS would be eligible to take part in a study offering a psychotherapeutic component to address these issues. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been found to be effective for mood problems, and been successfully used in self-help format, but no study has thus-far examined potential for use as an effective intervention in this (MS) population. People will MS and low mood will be recruited from a neurology outpatient clinic. They will be randomized to either receive treatment as usual, or an ACT self-help book with 8 supportive telephone calls from a trainee clinical psychologist. Measures of anxiety, depression, quality of life and physical health will be administered at baseline, post-intervention and six month follow up. A sub sample of 10 participants will be interviewed to find out their view on taking part in the study.</detailed_description>
