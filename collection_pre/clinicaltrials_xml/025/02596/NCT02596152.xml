	<brief_summary>The effects of mini-trampoline training on balance, cardiorespiratory fitness, strength and neuropsychological parameters in an overweight or obese population are unknown. The aim of this 2-arm randomized controlled trial is to compare the effects of a 12-week mini-trampoline training and a 12-week nordic walking training on balance, fitness and strength in overweight/obese individuals.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A growing body of literature suggests, that obesity is not only associated with medical conditions such as diabetes, but also linked to altered gait, impaired balance and a greater likelihood of falls. Weight reduction has been shown to improve balance controle. Methods to increase physical activity are largely not accepted in this population and those which conserve the musculoskeletal system are rare. Physical activity has been shown to influence mood, quality of life and eating behavior. Mini-trampoline training has been shown to enhance stability and increase fitness.</detailed_description>
