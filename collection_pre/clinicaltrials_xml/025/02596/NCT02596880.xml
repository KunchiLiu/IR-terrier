	<brief_summary>The investigators will treat 100 patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C with sofosbuvir 400 mg daily, daclatasvir 60 mg daily and weight-based ribavirin (1000 mg/d if &lt;75 kg, 1200 mg/d if &gt;75 kg, divided in two daily doses) for 12 weeks and calculate the sustained viral response rate at 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sofosbuvir, Daclatasvir, Ribavirin for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Cirrhotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cirrhosis due to Hepatitis C presents a rather difficult treatment problem as many cannot tolerate interferon, the previous standard of treatment. The new direct acting antivirals have provided these patients with a new hope. One such combination is sofosbuvir (SOF) 400 mg and daclatasvir (DCV) 60 mg given once daily with or without weight-based ribavirin (RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks. The current recommendation for cirrhotics is SOF/DCV/RBV for 24 weeks but that recommendation is based on the lack of data for shorter periods. In order to evaluate the response rate to the combination of SOF/DCV/RBV the investigators decided to treat 100 HCV cirrhotics with this combination for 12 weeks. Subjects include genotype 1 and 3 patients, the prevalent genotypes in Iran. Patients with Model for End stage Liver Disease (MELD) &gt; 20 are excluded. The investigators will calculate the sustained viral response rate at 12 weeks (SVR12).</detailed_description>
