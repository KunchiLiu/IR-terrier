	<criteria>1. Women ≥ 18 years 2. Biopsy proven uVIN, biopsies to have been taken within the last three months 3. Written informed consent to participate in the trial 4. At least one lesion that can be accurately measured (using RECIST criteria) in at least one dimension with longest diameter ≥ 20mm OR in two perpendicular dimensions that when multiplied together give a surface area of ≥ 120mm2 (e.g. 15mm x 8mm or 12mm x 10mm) This is to ensure that 4x4mm biopsies can be performed on this lesion. 1. Has any concomitant disease or significant medical conditions that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, potentially compromise the safety or compliance of the patient or may preclude the patient's successful completion of the clinical trial. 2. Clinically significant abnormalities, as judged by the Investigator, in laboratory test results (including hepatic and renal panels, complete blood count, chemistry panel and urinalysis) or ECG. In the case of uncertain or questionable results, tests performed during screening may be repeated before randomization to confirm eligibility or judged to be clinically irrelevant for healthy subjects. 3. Indication of a current active infectious disease of the vulva, other than HPV 4. Pregnant, breast feeding or trying to conceive 5. Active treatment for uVIN (i.e. surgical excision, lasertherapy, imiquimod, photodynamic therapy) within the previous month 6. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy 7. HIV positive or transplant patients 8. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with the conduct of the study</criteria>
