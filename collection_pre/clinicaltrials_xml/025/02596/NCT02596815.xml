	<brief_title>Hypoalgesic Effect of Median Nerve Neural Mobilization Compared to a Controlled Group</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Median Nerve Neural Mobilization (MNNM) is a non invasive physical therapy technique that achieves pain relief through mechanical stimulation of the Median Nerve and the brachial plexus. It is believed that the hypoalgesic effect offered by the neural tissue mobilization procedure is a consequence of descending nervous system pain modulation activity and an improvement in the distinct biomechanical and sensitive properties of the involved neural tissue. The neural tissue mobilization procedure is associated to an increase in nerve mobility, edema, inflammation and intraneural pressure reduction without any known side effects when applied properly which is an important contrast to the wide variety of side effects caused by commonly used drug therapy to treat cervicobrachial pain. Despite the crescent interest among the scientific community in evidence based options to treat pain there is a current lack of enough controlled double blind clinical trials that measure the effectiveness of neural tissue mobilization techniques such as the (MNNM) and its specific effect over cervicobrachial pain. For this reason the present investigation consisted in the application of a treatment protocol based on Median Nerve Neural Mobilization in a controlled double blind clinical trial with the aim to assess its clinical effectiveness in treating pain symptoms.</detailed_description>
