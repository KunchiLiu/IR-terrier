	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate whether there is a difference in the bile acid content in the bowel in patients after right versus left colectomy. There is compelling evidence that patients under going resection of the right colon versus left coolon have a lower polyp detection rate in surveillance colonoscopies. The investigators intend to evaluate feces of patients undergoing left and right colectomies; prior to their surgery and again three and six months aftet the surgery. The investigators plan to compare the content of the different bile acids and to compare the content between the two groups.</brief_summary>
