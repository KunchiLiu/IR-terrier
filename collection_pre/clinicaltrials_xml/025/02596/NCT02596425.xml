	<brief_title>Pulmonary Recruitment Maneuver for Postlaparoscopic Shoulder Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shoulder pain after laparoscopy is common and its probable mechanism is residual CO2 gas after surgery. The pulmonary recruitment maneuver can mechanically remove residual CO2 and reduce pain. In literature, there are two different recruitment maneuvers, which was manual inflation of the lungs with positive pressure ventilation of either 40cmH2O or 60cmH2O at the end of surgery. However, the higher positive pressure may be associated with more chance of barotrauma. Therefore, it is important to determine the lowest effective pressure for reducing postlaparoscopic shoulder pain. The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different recruitment maneuvers (40cmH2O or 60cmH2O) for reducing postlaparoscopic shoulder pain.</detailed_description>
