	<brief_summary>This trial is a Phase II study using the "window-of-opportunity" design in which the treatment-free window between breast cancer diagnosis and surgical tumor resection is used to study the biological effects of the beta blocker propranolol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Propanolol in Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients will be recruited from the Garbar Breast Care Center and University Medical Center following diagnosis of invasive breast cancer by breast biopsy. - The sympatholytic nonselective beta blocker propranolol will be administered to all participants in a non-randomized manner at an equal dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day. - Following surgical resection of the tumor , the primary endpoint of this study is quantified by comparing the proliferative index of the tumor before propranolol administration (quantified using the initial tumor biopsy) and after 3 weeks of propranolol (quantified using the surgically resected tumor). - Additional molecular analyses and evaluation of safety and toxicity will also be performed to better understand the effects of this treatment on breast cancers and patient adherence to the drug.</detailed_description>
