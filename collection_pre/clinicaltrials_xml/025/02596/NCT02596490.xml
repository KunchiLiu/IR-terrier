	<brief_summary>Objectives: Our specific aims are to: Aim 1: Examine the feasibility of a couple-based meditation program in 50 patients with metastatic lung cancer and their partners. Aim 2: Establish the initial efficacy of a couple-based meditation program in patients and their partners regarding physical, psychological, and spiritual quality of life outcomes. Exploratory Aim: Explore potential intervention mediators (i.e., mindfulness, compassion, holding back, and intimacy) and a moderator (i.e., baseline distress) of the intervention effects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Partner Phase 1: If you agree to take part in this study, your demographic information (such as your age, sex, and race) will be recorded. Meditation and Discussion Program: You will take part in a meditation and discussion program. Two (2) times you will meet with a mediation trained instructor. You should attend each session together as a couple. During the sessions, you will do deep breathing and visualization exercises and then asked to review the exercises based on your experiences and what you prefer. You will also be asked for feedback about the instructions to make sure they were clear and easy to follow. You will also be asked to read written materials that are part of this program. You will be asked to complete a written review about the program in general and a questionnaire about your general health and well-being. Each session will last about 60-90 minutes. Length of Study Participation: Your participation in this study will be over when you have completed the last session for Phase I. Partner Phase 2: If you agree to take part in this study, your demographic information (such as your age, sex, and race) will be recorded. Questionnaires: You will complete 12 questionnaires before your first meditation and discussion session. The questionnaires ask about your health, your mood, your level of fatigue, your sleeping habits, your relationship, and your quality of life. It should take about 45 minutes to complete these questionnaires. After completing the last session, about 4 weeks later, you will be asked to complete the same questionnaires again. Additionally, you will be asked to complete a program review asking you what you liked and did not like about the program. If you cannot complete the questionnaires in the clinic, you will be given a self-addressed postage-paid envelope so that you can mail the questionnaires back to the study staff. You should try to finish and mail back the questionnaires no more than 7 days after you begin filling them out. Meditation and Discussion Program: You will take part in a meditation and discussion program. Each week for 4 weeks, you will have a meditation session with a trained meditation instructor. You will attend up to 4 sessions. You should attend each session together as a couple. During the meditation sessions, you will do deep breathing and visualization exercises. You will discuss your experiences and observations afterwards with your partner and instructor. Each session will last about 60 minutes total. You will be asked to continue daily meditation practice and some other short exercises at home outside of the classes. You will receive a compact disc and printed materials to help with your home practice. The study staff will call you 2 times per week over the 4-week period to remind you to practice your meditation. You will also be asked about any problems you may be having completing your practice. Each call should last about 10-15 minutes. All meditation and discussion sessions will be videotaped. This is so the researchers can keep track of the quality of the sessions. The video files are digital and will be deleted after all the data are studied. Length of Study Participation: Your participation in this study will be over when you have completed the questionnaires within 1 week after your last session for Phase 2. Your total participation length is about 4-6 weeks. Partner Phase 3: If you agree to take part in this study, your demographic information (such as your age, sex, and race) will be recorded. You will complete 12 questionnaires at the beginning of this study. The questionnaires ask about your health, your mood, your level of fatigue, your sleeping habits, your relationship, and your quality of life. It should take about 45 minutes to complete these questionnaires. If you cannot complete the questionnaires in the clinic, you will be given a self-addressed postage-paid envelope so that you can mail the questionnaires back to the study staff. You should try to finish and mail back the questionnaires no more than 7 days after you begin filling them out. Study Groups: You will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 3 groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group: - If you are in Group 1, you will take part in a couple-based meditation program. - If you are in Group 2, you will take part in a couple-based cancer-related discussion program. - If you are in Group 3, you will not take part in the couple-based meditation or cancer-related discussion program but will complete the same questionnaires as Group 1 and 2. You will be given the option to take part in the couple-based mediation and discussion program (off study) after the other groups finish their last questionnaire packet. The group assignment is based on other factors such as patient's age and gender. Meditation and Discussion Program for Group 1: If you are in Group 1, you will take part in a meditation and discussion program. Each week for 4 weeks, you will have a meditation class with a trained meditation instructor. You should attend each session together as a couple.

You will also be asked about any problems you may be having completing your practice. Each call should last about 10-15 minutes. Cancer-Related Discussion Program for Group 2: If you are in Group 2, you will take part in a discussion program. You will have 1 discussion session each week for 4 weeks with a trained interventionist. These will be one-on-one sessions. During the discussion sessions, you will discuss issues for couples coping with cancer. Each session will last about 60 minutes. For Groups 1 and 2: All meditation and discussion sessions will be videotaped. This is so the researchers can keep track of the quality of the sessions. The video files are digital and will be deleted after all the data are studied. All Groups: You will complete the same questionnaires you completed at the beginning of the study, 4 weeks later, and again 3 months later. Length of Study Participation: Your participation on this study will be over when you have completed the questionnaires at 3 months after your last session for Phase 3.
