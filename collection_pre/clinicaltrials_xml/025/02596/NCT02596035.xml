	<brief_summary>This protocol will generate safety data on nivolumab monotherapy for advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) patients and will have as its primary objective, the assessment of high grade immune-mediated adverse events (IMAE) in this patient population treated with nivolumab. In addition to continuing the investigation of safety for RCC patients with clear cell histology and prior treatment with anti- vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, this study will explore the safety and efficacy data for RCC patients with non-clear cell histology and RCC patients with either histology and brain metastases.</brief_summary>
