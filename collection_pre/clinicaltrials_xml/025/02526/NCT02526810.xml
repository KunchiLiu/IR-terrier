	<brief_title>Comparison of Glycaemic Fluctuation and Oxidative Stress Between Two Short-term Therapies for Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was a single-center, randomized, controled and prospective trial. Type 2 diabetic patients were randomized into 2 groups (Group A and Group B). Subjects in group A would be treated by using continuous subcutaneous insulin injection with insulin lispro, while subjects in group B would be treated by using glargine with oral drugs (metformin and gliclazide modified release tablets). After achieving the target glucose levels by two different approaches in 3-5 days, maintain the target glucose level for 3-5 days. Then a Medtronic dynamic blood glucose meter would be applied to the subjects for 72 hours. The clinical data, such as demographic information, present history, past history, personal history and so on were collected in the 1st day. In the 2nd day and the last day of the trial, the blood samples of the patient were collected for the Laboratory Measurements: Cr, uric acid, aminotransferase, lipid profiles, white blood cell count, N%, fasting plasma glucose, fasting C-peptide, insulin, HbA1c and standard meal test (0.5h-postprandial and 2h-postprandial blood glucose levels, C peptide and insulin, et al. The parameters of b-cell function and glycemia fluctuation were calculated and then analyzed by spss 13.0.</detailed_description>
