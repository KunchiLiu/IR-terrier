	<detailed_description>Postnatal depression is the most common complication of the puerperium. Disturbances in mother-infant relationship in depressed mothers negatively influence the child's development. There are a number of efficient treatments for postnatal depression including antidepressant medication, psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Tele-health and mobile health is a novel and emerging field in psychiatric and psychological care and treatment of mental health difficulties, it involves the use of telecommunications to provide health care, support and intervention from a distance. The proposed study will test the efficacy of an innovative, affordable mobile based intervention program that can help mothers with postnatal depression in low resource countries such as Pakistan. Participants will be recruited from maternal and child care centres in Karachi, Pakistan and those participants (n = 36) meeting inclusion criteria of the study will be randomized into one of the 2 treatment arms, i.e., intervention or control, after completion of baseline assessment.
