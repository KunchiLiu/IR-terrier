	<brief_title>Self-administered Acupressure for Symptom Management of Caregiver Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Taking care of an elderly family member can be stressful and family caregivers are at risk for emotional, mental and physical health problems arising from caregiver stress. Although a variety of psychosocial and pharmacological strategies have been developed to reduce caregiver stress, the efficacy in mitigating caregiver distress is modest. Acupressure, a non-invasive technique of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) by applying pressure on acupoints, has been successfully used for management of multiple symptoms without adverse effects. Thus, this study using a randomized, wait-list controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of self-administered acupressure intervention on caregiver stress and associated distress symptoms of fatigue, insomnia or depression. A total of 200 Chinese family caregivers with caregiver stress and stress related symptoms of fatigue, insomnia or depression will be recruited from a community setting in Hong Kong and randomized to receive either a self-administered acupressure intervention or wait-list condition. The self-administered acupressure intervention will comprise (i) 5-hr individual learning and training session in the first 2 weeks, (ii) 2-hr home-visit reinforcement during 3rd and 4th week, and (iii) a total of 21-hr self-practice at home over 6 weeks. It is hypothesized that the family caregivers in the intervention group will have, upon completion of the program, lower levels of caregiver stress, lower scores of fatigue, insomnia, and depression with improved health-related quality of life as compared with that in the wait-list control group.</detailed_description>
