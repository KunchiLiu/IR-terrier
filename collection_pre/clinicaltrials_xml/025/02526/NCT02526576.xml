	<brief_summary>This phase two, randomized, double-blind study is designed to demonstrate the enhanced efficacy of SVF-enriched autologous facial fat grafts, in relation to standard, non-SVF enriched, facial fat grafts by evaluating volumetric retention and contour of the engrafted region over the course of one year.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adipose Derived Stem Cells in Facial Fat Grafting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human Adipose Tissue is considered as a new source for Stromal Stem Cells and offers a large therapeutic potential for many rare and common diseases that impacts millions of patients worldwide. The Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) of Adipose Tissue is relatively easy to extract with minimally invasive procedures such as elective liposuction in large quantities and therefore may be a cost effective source for cellular therapies in a wide range of medical specialties. The term "Facial Atrophy" describes the lost of subcutaneous fat within the face and can be a result of the aging process as well as some pathological diseases. It can be corrected via autologous fat transfer but usually the majority of the grafted cells will die after 6-12 months. Several publications demonstrate that the addition of SVF cells to the graft may enhance the graft survival. This double blind, randomized study aims to demonstrated the efficacy of Antria Cell Preparation Process in autologous facial fat grafting.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Female or Male, Age 18 to 70 years old 2. Subjects that are eligible for liposuction and facial fat grafting procedures for cosmetic purposes and facial atrophy. 3. Subjects must require augmentation to the inframalar region. Furthermore, facial engraftment to additional, nonstudy related regions is optional, but not required. 4. Inframalar Atrophy Assessment Scale of 2 to 4 5. Facial volume defect range: 2 to 10 mL 6. Body Mass Index (BMI) between and including 22 and 29 7. Able to understand and provide written and verbal informed consent 8. Fitzpatrick Scale 1 to 6 1. Currently taking or have taken None Steroid Antiinflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) within last two weeks or corticosteroids within the last six weeks prior to screening 2. Diagnosis of any of the following medical conditions: Active malignancy (diagnosed within 5 years), except for treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or other noninvasive or insitu neoplasm (e.g. cervical cancer) Active infection Type I or Type II Diabetes Skin/Bone deformities in the face, including scaring or hyperpigmentation within the graft site. 3. Subjects who are unlikely to comply with the protocol (e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for subsequent visits, dementia, and/or otherwise considered by the Investigator to be unlikely to complete the study) 4. Subjects with a known drug or alcohol dependence within the past 12 months as judged by the Investigator 5. Dermal fillers or facial reconstruction within the past 24 months, Subjects must also refrain from such procedures during the duration of the study. 6. Subjects with major illnesses involving the renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, and/or nervous systems. 7. Subjects with elevated kidney and/or liver functions 8. Any other disease condition or laboratory results that in the opinion of the investigator may be clinically significant and render the subject inappropriate for the study procedure(s), may alter the accuracy of study results, or increase risk for subjects. 9. Subjects with lifeexpectancies less than 9 months 10. Subjects with known collagenase allergies 11. Subjects with idiopathic or druginduced coagulopathy 12. Pregnant females 13. On radiotherapy or chemotherapy agents 14. Taking strong CYP450 inhibitors 15. Subjects with a history of keloids or hypertrophic scar formations 16. Previous treatment with any synthetic fillers in the inframalar area</criteria>
