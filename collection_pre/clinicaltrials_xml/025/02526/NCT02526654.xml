	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to compare standard automated perimetry (SAP) using the Heidelberg Edge Perimeter (HEP) with the Octopus Visual Field (OVF) analyzer and determine test-retest reliability of both parameters in detecting glaucomatous visual field losses. A secondary outcome measure is investigation of novel imaging parameters of the optic nerve head and a new automated structure-function report.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heidelberg Edge Perimetery Compared to Octopus Visual Field Testing and Investigation of New Ocular Imaging Parameters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After obtaining informed consent, each patient will undergo the following tests: 1. Standard ophthalmic examination (usual care): Best-corrected visual acuity testing, slit lamp biomicroscopy, Goldman applanation tonometry, corneal thickness measurement and fundoscopy. 2. G-top strategy using the OVF Analyzer (G-Top, Koeniz, Switzerland). The MD, PSD will be recorded. 3. HEP SAP using the advanced staircase thresholding algorithm (ASTA). This will be performed once. The MD and PSD will be recorded. 4. Spectralis OCT using the GMPE program will be performed twice in a non - dilated condition. The MRW and RNFL thickness in 6 sectors (SN, ST, IN, IT, N and T) along with the structure-function correlation will be recorded. The investigators will randomize the order of the HEP SAP III and the OVF, and the order of the eye tested (right vs. left) if both eyes of the patients meet the inclusion criteria. Forty eyes (40) of patients with glaucoma will be randomly chosen from this group and will be asked to return in 3-6 month for retesting HEP and OVF.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years. Best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better in the tested eye. Spherical refraction within ±5.0 D, and cylinder correction within ±3.0 D. History of glaucoma, defined as: Characteristic of glaucomatous disc damage: (local narrowing, notching, or absence of the neuroretinal rim in the absence of disc pallor elsewhere). Any condition preventing adequate examination of the pupil or visual field testing (e.g. ptosis, dense corneal opacities or lens opacities); Active infection of the anterior or posterior segments of the eye; Any intraocular surgical or laser procedure within the previous 4 weeks; Participants taking a medication known to affect visual field sensitivity, a coexisting intraocular disease affecting visual field, or a problem other than glaucoma affecting color vision will be excluded.</criteria>
