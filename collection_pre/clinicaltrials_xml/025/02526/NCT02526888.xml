	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to investigate whether repeated administration of a cardiac medication (diltiazem) can affect the pharmacokinetics (i.e., amount and time of presence in the blood) of ACT-541468</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Interaction Between Diltiazem and ACT-541468 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because ACT-541468 appears to be mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, it is deemed of interest to investigate the potential influence of diltiazem, a well-known CYP3A4 inhibitor on the pharmacokinetic profile of ACT-541468. Safety of the concomitant administration of the two drugs will also be assessed</detailed_description>
