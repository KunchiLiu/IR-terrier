	<brief_summary>Traditionally the watertightness of urethrovesical anastomosis after robotic radical prostatectomy is controlled by cystogram. However, clinical observations and one previous study showed that patients with anastomotic leakage have red coloured urine. If the investigators can verify this finding, the most of the cystograms can be avoided. In this study the investigators estimate urine colour after cystogram and take a picture from urine collecting pag. Later on the pictures are digitally analyzed and compared to cystogram finding.</brief_summary>
