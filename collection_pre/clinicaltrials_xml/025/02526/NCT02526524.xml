	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare the glycemic effects of delayed-release metformin (Met DR) to placebo in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) over 16 weeks. The study is designed to evaluate several doses of Met DR (600 to 1500 mg once daily in the morning [qAM]) compared to placebo. A single-blind reference treatment of 2000 mg metformin immediate-release (Met IR) per day administered as equal divided doses (1000 mg Met IR BID) will also be included.</brief_summary>
