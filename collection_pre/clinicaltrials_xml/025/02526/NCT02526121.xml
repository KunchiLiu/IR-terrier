	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of iron depletion with phlebotomies on blood triglyceride concentration, in subjects with hypertriglyceridemia and iron overload, compared with a dietary intervention alone. All subjects in this study will follow dietary and lifestyle counseling in a period of 3 months. A randomized group will receive phlebotomies every 3 weeks in this period.</brief_summary>
