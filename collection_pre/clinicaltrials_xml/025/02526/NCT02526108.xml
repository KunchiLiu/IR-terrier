	<brief_title>Energy Expenditure of High Intensity Functional Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High Intensity Functional Training (HIFT), which alternates short periods of intense exercise using varied, multiple-joint movements, with less-intense active recovery periods, may offer an attractive, time efficient alternative to traditional aerobic exercise. Variations of HIFT such as Cross Fit, home workout videos (ie.P90x and Insanity), and boot-camp style group exercise classes have become increasingly popular. The cardiovascular benefits of HIFT have been demonstrated; however, by doing this study researchers hope to get more information regarding the potential effectiveness of HIFT for weight management, such as the actual level of energy expenditure and exercise intensity elicited by a HIFT session.</detailed_description>
