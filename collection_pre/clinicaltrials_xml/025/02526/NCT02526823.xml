	<brief_summary>Anthracyclines were basic drugs in lymphoma treatment. However, their dose accumulation related cardiac toxicity limits their clinical application, especially adriamycin. Adriamycin has been gradually replaced by epirubicin. Polyethylene glycol liposome doxorubicin (PLD) can go into tumor tissues through tumor angiogenesis and produces targeted killing effect to tumor tissues. PLD has potential advantages in the treatment of malignant tumors,including lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Application of Polyethylene Glycol Liposome Doxorubicin (PLD) in Primary Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymphoma is one of the most rapidly growing malignant tumors in the world. It was divided into two major categories (Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Anthracyclines were basic drugs in lymphoma treatment. However, their dose accumulation related cardiac toxicity limits their clinical application, especially adriamycin. Adriamycin has been gradually replaced by epirubicin in malignant tumor treatment because of its similar effects and less toxic side effects. Polyethylene glycol liposome doxorubicin (PLD) is the liposome formulation of doxorubicin. Methoxy Polyethylene Glycol (MPEG) contained in liposome surface can decrease the peak plasma levels of free drugs, extend drugs circulation time in blood and reduce the chance of non-specific distribution to normal tissues. PLD goes into tumor tissues through tumor angiogenesis and produces targeted killing effect to tumor tissues. PLD has potential advantages in the treatment of malignant tumors. In lymphoma patients' therapy, the clinical application of PLD is expected to be a new method. Therefore, the investigators designed the randomized controlled clinical study and aimed to compare the efficacy and safety between PLD and epirubicin in primary B-NHL, peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and HL patients.</detailed_description>
