	<brief_summary>Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) preservation is a promising method to decrease the complication of marginal donor livers compared to cold storage (CS). The aim of this project is to assess safety and feasibility of NMP in human liver transplantation. This will be a single center prospective cohort pilot study. Thirty-two livers with acceptable quality for transplantation will be preserved with NMP in 4-18 hours and transplanted. The follow-up period will be 6 months post-transplantation. The outcome will be compared to 128 historical patients transplanted in our program in the past 5 years (liver preserved using CS) with matched characteristics on age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, preservation time, etc.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study to Assess Safety and Feasibility of Normothermic Machine Preservation In Human Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The shortage of donor organs leads to the use of marginal donors including donors after cardiac death. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) preservation is a promising method to decrease their high risk of complication compared to the standard cold storage (CS). The aim of this project is to assess safety and feasibility of NMP in human liver transplantation. This will be a single center prospective cohort pilot study. Thirty-two livers that have acceptable quality for transplantation will be preserved with NMP in 4-18 hours after cross clamp and cold flush. The liver grafts at NMP will be at physiological temperature and have oxygen and nutrient supply with continuous perfusion. The transplantation and post-transplant care will follow the standard of care. The follow-up period is 6 months after transplantation. The primary end point will be the rate of post-transplant Early Allograft Dysfunction (EAD), while the secondary end points will be: primary non function (PNF) rate, 1 and 6 months patient and graft survival, peak liver function tests in the first 7 days after transplantation, intraoperative hepatic arterial and portal flow measurement, rate and magnitude of post-reperfusion syndrome, surgical outcomes (operative time, transfusion requirement etc.), rate of post-transplant kidney failure, assessment of histological ischemia reperfusion (liver and bile duct), rate of vascular complications, rate of biliary complications, hospital and ICU length of stay, rejection rate, infection rate, the ability to predict function based on "on-pump" viability markers, and the incidence of adverse effect (AE). The outcome will be compared to a control group of 128 historical patients (matched with a 1:4 ratio) transplanted in our program in the past 5 years (liver preserved using CS). Control subjects will be matched using donor and recipient age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, cold ischemia time, donor risk index and presence of steatosis.</detailed_description>
