	<brief_summary>The main goal of this project is to identify and remediate the cognitive difficulties, including processing speed and attention deficits in individuals who have undergone chemotherapy treatment. Recent research has demonstrated objective cognitive deficits following chemotherapy and that it is not an emotional reaction to the cancer diagnosis as it was once considered. There are a large number of woman diagnosed and treated for breast cancer that experience chemotherapy induced cognitive deficits. Subjects who participate in the study will be evaluated for cognitive abilities prior to chemotherapy treatment and after completion of chemotherapy. Participants will then have the option to participate in the second phase of the study, which involves the use of a computer-based Brain Fitness Program for 12 weeks. This is followed by another cognitive evaluation.</brief_summary>
