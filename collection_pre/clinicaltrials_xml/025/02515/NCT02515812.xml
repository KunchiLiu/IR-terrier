	<brief_summary>Cardiological examination constitute one of the major directions in nuclear medicine for detection of myocardial ischemia in patients suspected of coronary disease. In Caen, they constitute 20% of the activity of nuclear medicine. Systolic heart failure (HF) ischemic or nonischemic origin represents a new area of activity of the nuclear cardiology. This is HF stratification study based on cardiac adrenergic function after injection of a tracer: I-123-MIBG. The team Caen nuclear cardiology is one of two teams recognized internationally in the field of evaluating the cardiac sympathetic innervation in cardiomyopathies. Numerous publications from 1992 to the present day have reported encouraging results for the daily use of this tracer in the evaluation of patients with LV dysfunction IC. Recently, interest in using the MIBG has been shown as a prognostic marker of HF in a prospective study of 961 patients. Typically, the camera used was an Anger camera with collimating Nai standard called parallel holes. The main objective is to validate the measurements of cardiac adrenergic function evaluated by cardiopulmonary mediastinal reports and sympathetic innervation scores VG after injection of I-123-MIBG in 80 patients with heart failure.</brief_summary>
