	<brief_summary>In a computerized experiment, visual stimuli will be presented to the parkinson's disease patients and to the controls. They will respond to each image by acting on the keyboard in a specific manner. Each participant will repeat that task 384 times per session. A break will be inserted every 12 tests so that participants can rest. The experiment consists of three sessions. Each image will be presented three times. For the first two presentations it is assumed that a link will be created between the image and the task, and the image and action. In the third presentation, the same task and the same action will be maintained or will be swapped. In this way, It can be checked whether associations thus generated will affect the performance of the participants when tasks and actions will be incongruent.</brief_summary>
