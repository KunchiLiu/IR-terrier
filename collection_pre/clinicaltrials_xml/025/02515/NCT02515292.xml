	<brief_summary>Purpose: Clinical assessment (anthropometric) and paraclinical (biochemical and immunological by dosing serum insuline growth factors IGF1 and IGF2 and their receptors) of neonates with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and the integration in a multidimensional statistical model . Objectives: 1. IGF1 and IGF2 evaluation of serum and IGF1 receptor, IGF2 receptor and IGF2 receptor gene expression in cord blood from newborns with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). (Prospective) 2. Evaluation and monitoring of anthropometric, clinical (non-cardiac morbidity) and paraclinical. (Retrospective &amp; prospective) 3. Evaluation and monitoring of morphological and functional by echocardiography. (Prospective) 4. Integrating multidimensional clinical and paraclinical parameters in a statistical model for evaluating newborn with intrauterine growth restriction.</brief_summary>
