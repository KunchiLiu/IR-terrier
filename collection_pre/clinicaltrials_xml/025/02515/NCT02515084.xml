	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the concordance between the 18F-PET/CT under thyrotropin stimulation and the diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging, in the detection of residual mass in 40 patients with partial response or relapsed differentiated thyroid carcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison DW-MRI vs FDG PET/CT in the Detection of Early Recurrence of Cervical Well-differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The schedule and the procedures of the study are the following ones : - Baseline evaluation : - Clinical examination with neck echography after rhTSH stimulation - Normal whole body scan - First visit (inclusion): 18F-FDG PET/CT DW-MRI of the neck if possible performed shortly after the PET CT or within following days - Following visits: at 6 months and 12 months - DW-MRI of the neck performed shortly after the PET CT or within following days. - Ultrasonography guided fine needle aspiration for cytology for detection of cervical metastases and identifying thyroglobuline in the needle washout fluid if needed and in case of positivity of either PET or DW-MRI exams. - Histological assessment of biopsies if performed</detailed_description>
