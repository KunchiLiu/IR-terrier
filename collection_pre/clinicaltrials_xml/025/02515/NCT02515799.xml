	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the mucolytic activity of Tacholiquine® compared to saline (0.9%) in chronic bronchitis patients. Lung function parameters, biomarker profiles in sputum and serum, and clinical symptoms by standardized questionnaires [COPD activity index (CAT), Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) &amp; Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI)and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)] will be evaluated in response to Tacholiquine® vs. saline in chronic bronchitis patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mucolytic Effectiveness of Tacholiquine ® in Chronic Bronchitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to compare Tacholiquine ® and saline (0.9%) regarding their ability to promote the discharge of mucus from the respiratory passages in patients with chronic bronchitis (COPD). Alleviated discharge of mucus should ease breathing, improve subjective wellbeing, reduce inflammation in the air passages and improve lung function. Determine the magnitude of the effect of Tacholiquine ® compared to saline (0.9%) in chronic bronchitis patients. Lung function parameters, biomarker profiles in sputum and serum, and clinical symptoms and quality of life by standardized questionnaires [COPD activity index (CAT), Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) &amp; Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI), St George's respiratory Quality of Life Questionnaire] will be evaluated in response to Tacholiquine ® vs. saline at day one and at end of treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. 2. Female or male subjects aged 4085 years inclusive at Visit 1. 3. Documented history of COPD with a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC&lt;0.70 and a postbronchodilator FEV1&lt;80% of predicted normal value at screening (spirometry will be used for this criteria assessment). 4. Current smoker or exsmoker with a tobacco history of ≥10 packyears (1 pack year = 20 cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year). 5. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use a highly effective form of birth control (confirmed by the Investigator). − Women &gt;50 years old would be considered postmenopausal 6. At least a CAT value &gt; 10 at Visit 1. 7. Presence of chronic cough and sputum production either "several days per week" or "almost every day" 1. Clinically important pulmonary disease other than COPD (e.g. active lung infection, clinically significant bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, hypoventilation syndrome associated with obesity, lung cancer, alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency and primary ciliary dyskinesia) or another diagnosed pulmonary or systemic disease that is associated with elevated peripheral eosinophil counts (e.g. allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis/mycosis, ChurgStrauss syndrome, hypereosinophilic syndrome). 2. Any disorder, including, but not limited to, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, infectious, endocrine, metabolic, haematological, psychiatric, or major physical impairment that is not stable in the opinion of the Investigator and could: Affect the safety of the subject throughout the study Influence the findings of the study or their interpretation Impede the subject's ability to complete the entire duration of study 3. Documented Unstable ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, renal failure, uncontrolled hypertension as defined by the Investigator, or any other relevant cardiovascular disorder as judged by the Investigator that in Investigator's judgment may put the patient at risk or negatively affect the outcome of the study. 4. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics, and/or hospitalization for a COPD exacerbation within 4 weeks prior to (Visit 1). 5. Acute upper or lower respiratory infection requiring antibiotics or antiviral medication within 4 weeks prior to (Visit 1). 6. Pneumonia within 4 weeks prior to (Visit 1), based on the last day of antibiotic treatment or hospitalization date, whatever occurred later. The subject cannot be rescreened if this exclusion criterion is met. 7. History of anaphylaxis to Tacholiquine®. 8. Long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) defined as need for oxygen &gt; 4L 02 flow with signs and/or symptoms of cor pulmonale, right ventricular failure or evidence by echocardiogram or pulmonary artery catheterization of moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. In order to be admitted to the trial subjects on LTOT have to be ambulatory and be able to attend clinic visits. 9. Any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examination, vital signs, hematology, or urinalysis during Visit 1, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the subject at risk because of his/her participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the subject's ability to complete entire duration of the study. 10. Use of immunosuppressive medication, including rectal corticosteroids, high potency topical corticosteroids and systemic steroids within 28 days prior to (Visit 1).</criteria>
