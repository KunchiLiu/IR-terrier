	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Care Investigational Contact Lens Compared to a Marketed Monthly Replacement Contact Lens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective of the study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the JJVCI investigational contact lens by comparison to the marketed, monthly replacement contact lens, both worn for thirty days on a daily wear modality.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and receive a fully executed copy of the form. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical protocol. The subject must be at least 18 years of age. The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in the range of 1.00 to 6.00 in each eye. The subject's refractive cylinder must be ≤ 1.00 Diopters in each eye. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye. Subjects should own a wearable pair of spectacles. The subject must be an adapted frequent replacement daily wear spherical silicone hydrogel soft contact lens wearer in both eyes. The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any type). Subjects must be able and willing to wear the study lenses at least 6 hours a day, a minimum of 4 days per week Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will be discontinued). Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may interfere with contact lens wear. This may include, but not be limited to, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, recurrent herpes simplex/zoster, Sjögren's syndrome, xerophthalmia, acne rosacea, StevensJohnson syndrome, and immunosuppressive diseases or any infectious diseases (e.g. hepatitis, tuberculosis). Use of any of the following medications within 1 week prior to enrollment: oral retinoid isotretinoin (e.g. Accutane), oral tetracyclines, topical scopolamine, oral (e.g. Seldane, ChlorTrimeton, and Benadryl) and ophthalmic antihistamines, oral phenothiazines (e.g., Haldol, Mellaril, Thorazine, Elavil, Pamelor, Compazine), oral and ophthalmic Betaadrenergic blockers (e.g., Propranolol, Timolol, and Practolol), systemic steroids, and any prescribed or over the counter (OTC) ocular medication. Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, or moderate or above corneal distortion by keratometry. Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), etc.). Any grade 2 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lensrelated corneal inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear. Any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to Optifree®Puremoist® multipurpose care solution or EyeCept® rewetting drop solution Any ocular infection, allergy or clinically significant ocular disease (e.g. corneal edema, uveitis, severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca, ocular hypertension), or ocular conditions (e.g. strabismus), which might interfere with the study. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact lens wear. Daily disposables, extended wear, monovision or multifocal contact lens correction. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 30 days prior to study enrollment. History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus. Employee or relative of employees of sponsor or investigational clinic (e.g., Investigator, Coordinator, Technician)</criteria>
