	<detailed_description>The overall goal of this implementation research is to improve retention in care and adherence to ART to 2 years postpartum among HIV infected women in urban and rural Uganda choosing PMTCT Option B+. Formative research will first be conducted to assess knowledge and attitudes regarding Option B+ and lifelong ART among PMTCT clients, community members and health workers. The formative research will inform the design of the group peer support intervention. Interventional research will then be conducted randomizing 540 women to either enhanced group peer support with income generating activities called the Friends for Life Circle (FLC) or MOH standard of care counselling with follow-up to 2 years postpartum. Primary outcomes will include retention in health care, ARV adherence and viral suppression at 6 weeks and 24 months postpartum.
