	<detailed_description>Interviews and Questionnaires: If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to provide some personal information, such as your education level and if you are currently attending school. This information will either be collected from your medical record or a member of the study staff will ask you. You will complete a questionnaire about your symptoms. You may also be asked to take part in a short interview about the symptom questionnaire that will be digitally recorded by the interviewer. During the interview, you will be asked if the questionnaire was easy to understand and complete, and if you think there are any other questions that should be included. You will then be asked to complete 2 more questionnaires about your health status and your quality of life. The study staff will use your opinions and questionnaire responses to decide if changes should be made to the symptom questionnaire. It should take about 15-30 minutes to complete the questionnaires and the interview. Assessments will be conducted in a private area in either the ambulatory pediatric adolescent clinics or in the hospital. The private area may be different, based on which types of rooms are available (for example, an exam room, conference room, or a single-occupancy hospital room), but it will always be a closed private space with only you and a member of the research staff present. After you complete the questionnaires and interview for the first time, you will complete the symptom questionnaire again up to 7 more times. The first 2 times will be done 1 day apart. After that, the following 5 times will be done about 1 week apart. It will take about 5 minutes to complete the questionnaire each time. You may complete the questionnaires in the clinic, over the phone, or online. The study staff will tell you which method you will use to complete the questionnaires. If researchers make any changes to the symptom questionnaires, depending on when you joined this study, you may also have an interview each time you complete the questionnaires. Length of Study: Your active participation in this study will be over after you have completed the questionnaires. This is an investigational study. Up to 105 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
