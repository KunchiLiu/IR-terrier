	<brief_title>Phase 1a Study in Healthy Smokers to Investigate the Effect With MMI-0100 on Airway Inflammation in Induced Sputum After Challenge With Inhaled Lipopolysaccharide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this Phase 1a, randomized, placebo controlled, two-way crossover study is to determine the effect of inhaled MMI-0100 compared to placebo on inflammatory markers following 5 days once daily (qd) dose of MMI-0100 or placebo administered by inhalation. On Day 5 of each treatment period, subjects will be challenged with inhaled LPS. Pharmacokinetics and biomarkers will be conducted at selected timepoints.</detailed_description>
