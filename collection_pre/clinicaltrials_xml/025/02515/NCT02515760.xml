	<brief_summary>Non-small cell lung cancer is characterized by aggressive growth and treatment resistance. New approaches include immunotherapeutic strategies but spontaneous immune responses against tumor antigens remain unclear. The aim of this study is to characterize localization and frequencies of spontaneously induced memory T cells specific for a panel of tumor-associated antigens in peripheral blood and bone marrow of non-small cell lung cancer patients.</brief_summary>
