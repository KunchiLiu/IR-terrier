	<brief_title>Metformin for Overweight &amp; OBese ChILdren and Adolescents With BDS Treated With SGAs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to recruit 1800 overweight/obese youth with Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (BSD) who are prescribed second generation anti psychotics (SGAs) from at least 24 public and private mental health practices in the Greater Cincinnati and New York City regions, (approximately 900 each from ~12 Cincinnati region and ~12 Long Island/New York mental health treatment sites) to participate in the proposed patient-centered large pragmatic trial examining the effectiveness of MET and LIFE vs. LIFE alone. Patients will be eligible if they are ages 8-17 years old, inclusive, overweight or obese (BMI &gt; 85%), continuing or starting treatment with at least one SGA (i.e., olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, iloperidone, lurasidone, paliperidone, or asenapine) and have a clinical diagnosis of BSD (bipolar I or II disorder, cyclothymia, or bipolar or mood disorder not otherwise specified [or by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V (DSM-5), other specified bipolar or mood disorder). The enrollment rate will be 2-3 patients/month/site for a recruitment time of 30 months.</detailed_description>
