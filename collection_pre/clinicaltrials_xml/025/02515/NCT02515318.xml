	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is projected to be the fifth leading burden of disease worldwide by the year 2020. An acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is defined as an acute event characterized by a worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms that requires a modification in the medication. AECOPD are frequent (mean of 1-4 exacerbations each year). It increases in frequency with the severity of the disease. The objective of this study is to examine whether a physical therapy intervention can reduce impairment in patients with COPD during hospitalization due to an acute exacerbation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading diseases causing mortality and morbidity, despite advanced pharmacotherapy and therapeutic management. COPD patients suffer frequent exacerbations, defined as 'acute events characterized by a worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variations and leads to a change in medication'. Acute illness and prolonged bed rest are associated with loss of muscle mass and a significant decline in functional ability and mobility. Interventions to counteract these impairments are indicated.</detailed_description>
