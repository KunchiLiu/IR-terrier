	<brief_summary>POLYGYNAX® is a broad spectrum combination of nystatin, neomycin and polymixin B indicated for the local treatment of vaginitis due to sensitive germs and treatment of non specific vaginitis of adults. POLYGYNAX® has been marketed in France since 1969. Nevertheless, despite the well established use of POLYGYNAX®, there is no clinical study supporting the interest of the combinaison of antifungal and antibiotics agents versus antifungal agent alone. The aim of this project is to demonstrate that POLYGYNAX® is more effective than miconazole in the treatment of women experiencing symptoms of infectious vaginitis.</brief_summary>
