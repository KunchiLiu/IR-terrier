	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete collapse of the upper airway during sleep, leading to pauses of breathing and arousals. Although previously considered as a local abnormality of the respiratory track, it is nowadays recognized as a systemic disease and an important cause of morbidity and mortality, since it is strongly associated with obesity (especially abdominal obesity) and cardiometabolic diseases, including the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. The modification of lifestyle habits, e.g. in terms of diet and physical activity, is currently explored as a mean of managing the disease in combination with the first line treatment, i.e., the application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep. The available data support that weight loss, achieved through lifestyle modification, effectively reduces the severity of OSA and improves the associated cardiometabolic disorders in overweight or obese patients. However, studies exploring the potential effect of diet's quality or other lifestyle habits (such as physical activity) on OSA severity, besides weight loss, are currently lacking. Given that a Mediterranean dietary pattern as well as other lifestyle habits adopted by the populations in the Mediterranean region have been proven beneficial both for the prevention and the resolution of the metabolic syndrome and its associated cardiometabolic diseases, the aim of the present randomized, controlled, single-blind study is to implement an intensive 6-month intervention based on the Mediterranean lifestyle (hypocaloric diet and 7 group lifestyle counselling sessions) and to evaluate its potential benefits, compared with standard care (hypocaloric diet and written advice for healthy lifestyle), in a sample of patients with OSA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mediterranean Lifestyle Intervention in Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a chronic disease characterized by recurrent complete or partial interruptions of breathing during sleep due to obstruction of the upper airways, which leads to disturbances in gas exchange, hypoxia and consequent arousals. Beyond its adverse impact on sleep duration, sleep quality, as well as the functionality and cognitive function during the day (typical symptoms include fatigue, sleepiness, decreased reflexes, impaired memory, etc.). OSA is currently recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to its strong association with obesity and cardiometabolic diseases, including the metabolic syndrome (and its individual components, namely abdominal adiposity, impaired fasting glucose, dyslipidaemia and hypertension), cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. According to epidemiological data, its prevalence ranges from 2% to 7% in the general population (with a clear lead of obese middle-aged men), however it is estimated that a large proportion of patients (70-80%) remain undiagnosed making the disease a major public health challenge for the 21st century. Currently, the first line treatment for the management of moderate-to-severe OSA or mild OSA accompanied by symptoms (such as daytime sleepiness and cognitive disorders) and other diseases (such as hypertension and heart disease) is the application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep, usually via a renal mask. CPAP has been proven effective in alleviating the symptoms of the disease (e.g. pauses of breathing during sleep and daytime sleepiness), however it is also characterized by high rates of non-compliance and its effectiveness in improving cardiometabolic indices has not yet been confirmed. Given the strong relationship of OSA with obesity and its concomitant metabolic disorders, as well as the aforementioned restrictions of the use of CPAP as the sole treatment for the disease, lifestyle changes have currently emerged as a promising treatment for OSA. Indeed, several interventional studies have investigated the effect of lifestyle changes on the treatment of OSA, focusing primarily on weight loss - achieved through a hypocaloric diet, either solely or in combination with exercise and lifestyle counselling - and the available data support its effectiveness in reducing the severity of the disease and improving its associated cardiometabolic disorders in overweight patients. However, studies exploring the potential effect of diet's quality or other lifestyle habits (such as physical activity) on OSA severity and associated disorders, besides weight loss, are currently lacking. Given that a Mediterranean dietary pattern as well as other lifestyle habits adopted by the populations in the Mediterranean region (e.g. consumption of seasonal, traditional and eco-friendly food products, regular physical activity, adequate rest during the day, etc.) have been proven beneficial both for the prevention and the resolution of the metabolic syndrome and its associated cardiometabolic diseases, the aim of the present study is to implement an intervention based on the Mediterranean lifestyle and to evaluate its potential beneficial effect on biochemical and clinical characteristics of a sample of patients with OSA, compared with standard care. This study will be a randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical trial. The study sample will consist of adult (18-65 year old), overweight or obese (Body Mass Index &gt; 25 kg/m2) patients with moderate or severe OSA (Apnea Hypopnea Index &gt; 15) confirmed through polysomnography at the Center of Sleep Disorders of the 1st Department of Critical Care and Pulmonary Services of "Evaggelismos" General Hospital of Athens. At baseline, patients will be informed in detail about the study and will give their written consent. Then, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: (a) the control group, receiving a hypocaloric diet (1500 kcal/d for women and 1800 kcal/d for men) and written general advice for a healthy lifestyle and (b) the Mediterranean lifestyle group, receiving a hypocaloric diet (1500 kcal/d for women and 1800 kcal/d for men) and attending a comprehensive lifestyle intervention, comprising 7 60-min group counselling sessions, conducted every two weeks for the first 2 months and every month for the following 4 months until the end of the 6-month intervention. In the Mediterranean lifestyle group, all food groups of the Mediterranean diet will be targeted according to the pattern proposed in the Mediterranean diet pyramid (e.g. increase in the consumption of fruits, vegetables and whole grains, decrease in the consumption of red meat and sweets, preference in olive oil as the main source of dietary fat), while beneficial culinary practices, seasonality and locality of food products consumed, adequate rest during the day, as well as the adoption of a physically active lifestyle will be additionally addressed. Lifestyle counselling will be based on the goal setting theory, while motivational and behavioural strategies will also be used. The lifestyle intervention will also aim at achieving a 5-10% weight loss within the first 6 months. The dietary intervention and monitoring will be carried out in the laboratory of Clinical Nutrition &amp; Dietetics at Harokopio University, where experienced clinical dietitians will conduct all consultations. The assessment of patients' clinical, laboratory and lifestyle characteristics will be performed at baseline, at the end of the 6-month intervention and 1 year after the study entry at the Center of Sleep Disorders of the 1st Department of Critical Care and Pulmonary Services of "Evaggelismos" General Hospital of Athens. The evaluation will include: 1) brief medical history assessment, 2) assessment of the severity of the disease through polysomnography, 3) evaluation of insomnia through the Athens Insomnia Scale, 4) assessment of daytime sleepiness through the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, 5) evaluation of the quality of life through the SF-36 questionnaire, 6) dietary assessment through a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (data from the food frequency questionnaire will be used to evaluate participants' food group and individual food and beverage consumption, as well as their adherence to the Mediterranean diet through the Mediterranean Diet Score) and 24-hour dietary recalls (data from the 24-h dietary recalls will be analysed in terms of energy, macro- and micronutrient intake using the Nutritionist Pro, version 2.2 software, as well as of meal frequency and patterns), 7) physical activity assessment through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, 8) anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist and hip circumference), 9) blood pressure measurement and 10) fasting blood sample and urine sample collection for laboratory measurements (lipid profile, markers of glucose metabolism, markers of liver function, inflammatory markers, markers of oxidative stress, etc.) using automated analysers and/or commercial ELISA kits.</detailed_description>
