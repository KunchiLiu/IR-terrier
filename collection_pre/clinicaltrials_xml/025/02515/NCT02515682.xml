	<brief_summary>We propose to perform a 24-week randomized, double-blind a placebo-controlled trial among 207 non-equol producing postmenopausal women with prehypertension to examine the effectiveness of equol (10mg and 20mg/d) on 24h ambulatory blood pressure, vascular function and other cardiovascular risks (lipid profile, glycemic control and inflammatory biomarkers) and explore the optimal dosage of equol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Equol Supplementation on Blood Pressure and Vascular Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inclusion criteria 1. Hong Kong Chinese women aged 45-65 y with 2~8 years menopausal; 2. Mean SBP above 130 mmHg or DBP above 80 mmHg or both based on an average of 6 BP readings on two different occasions measured by sphygmomanometer. 3. Equol non-producer is defined as 24-hour urinary log10 S-equol:daidzein ratio less than -1.75 after daidzein challenge (60mg daidzein daily for 7 consecutive days). Exclusion criteria 1. Subjects on anti-hypertensive medication or with average SBP≥160 or DBP≥100 or both; 2. Use of medications known to affect BP within past 6 months; 3. Medical history or presence of certain chronic diseases that could affect BP or limit the individual's ability to participate in the study; 4. Present or history of certain cancers; 5. Regular smoker or alcohol consumption more than 30 g/day; 6. Known soy allergy.</detailed_description>
