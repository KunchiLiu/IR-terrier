	<brief_summary>In France, despite the implementation of bundles to prevent Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) in the last decades, the VAP incidence remains high above 10 per cent. In the last american recommendations of VAP prevention, the drainage of subglottic secretions (SSD) has been notified among the "basic practices" to prevent VAP. Nevertheless, the diffusion of SSD in ICUs remains limited. This situation is largely due to the initial overcost of the specific endotracheal tubes allowing SSD and to the unavailability of these devices in medical units in which patients are intubated before the ICU admission. So, this pragmatical cluster randomized and cross-over study evaluates the medico-economic impact of the subglottic secretions drainage in addition to VAP prevention bundles in ICU.</brief_summary>
