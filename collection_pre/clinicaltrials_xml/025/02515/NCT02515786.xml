	<brief_summary>During normal breathing, the upper and lower airways performs the priming of inspired gas: humidification, heating and filtering from nose to the bronchios for adequate gas exchange occurs in the lungs. Many patients with severe or advanced cardiopulmonary conditions (cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, advanced heart failure among others) may develop chronic respiratory failure and require treatment with oxygen therapy. High fractions of inspired oxygen have been associated with deleterious effects on the nasal ciliary beating and nose mucociliary transport. At home assistance, the patient with chronic respiratory receives oxygen via nasal cannula to the patient has been applied with and without humidification, however, does not know the effects of these two types of dry and humidified administration on the mucosa of the nose, airways and lungs. The investigators will assess the subject in use of home oxygen therapy at baseline, 12 hours, 7 days 30 days, 12 months and 24 months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After agreeing to the terms of informed consent, the individual will be admitted to the study. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of humidified oxygen and not humidified nasal catheter (12-24 hours/day) on the nasal epithelium of patients with chronic respiratory failure by non-invasive tests in 36 volunteers, of both sexes aged ≥ 18 years with a medical indication for the use of home oxygen via nasal cannula on: (1) nasal mucociliary transport through the saccharin test, (2) the physical properties of nasal mucus by simulated cough machine and contact angle, (3) cellularity via nasal and total count differential white blood cell nasal lavage, (4) ph nasal lavage and exhaled breath condensate (5) quantification of cytokines in nasal lavage and (6) quality of life questionnaire with rhinosinusitis (SNOT20). Assessments will be performed at baseline, 12 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 12 months and 24 months of use. Volunteers will be recruited from three Basic Health Supervision of Cathedral Health, City Health Department, City of São Paulo.</detailed_description>
