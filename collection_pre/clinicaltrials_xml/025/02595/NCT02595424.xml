	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well temozolomide and capecitabine work compared to standard treatment with cisplatin and etoposide in treating patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract or pancreas that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, capecitabine, cisplatin, and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Certain types of neuroendocrine carcinomas may respond better to treatments other than the current standard treatment of cisplatin and etoposide. It is not yet known whether temozolomide and capecitabine may work better than cisplatin and etoposide in treating patients with this type of neuroendocrine carcinoma, called non-small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin and Etoposide or Temozolomide and Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Gastrointestinal Tract or Pancreas That Is Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the progression free survival (PFS) of cisplatin and etoposide versus the PFS of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the response rate (RR) of cisplatin and etoposide versus the RR of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas. II. To assess the overall survival (OS) of cisplatin and etoposide versus the OS of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas. III. To evaluate the toxicities associated with the combination of temozolomide and capecitabine and the combination of cisplatin and etoposide, respectively, in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the impact of each treatment regimen on PFS, RR and OS based on marker of proliferation Ki-67 (Ki-67) index in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas. (Laboratory) II. To assess the prognostic significance of well differentiated versus poorly differentiated non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in relationship to survival and response to treatment. (Laboratory) III. To assess the agreement in marker of proliferation Ki-67 (Ki-67) status between that reported by institutional pathologist and that reported by central pathology review. (Laboratory) OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 10-14. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM B: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over approximately 30 minutes and etoposide IV over approximately 60 minutes on days 1-3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.</detailed_description>
