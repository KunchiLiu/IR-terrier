	<brief_summary>Background: Genes are the instructions a person s body uses to function. Genome sequencing is a new way to look at genes that your main research team is using to learn the causes of the condition they are studying. When a new cause is found this way, it is called a primary variant. Each person has many variants. Most do not cause disease. Sequencing can also find secondary variants. These are not related to the condition your main research team is studying, but may show a person to be at high risk for cancer or another condition. Researchers want to learn more about what it means to have a secondary variant. Objectives: To find new gene changes that lead to certain medical conditions. To better understand the causes of certain diseases. To learn about how people understand their genetic test results. Eligibility: People with rare diseases who have already consented to and enrolled in another protocol run by a group other than the National Human Genome Research Institute. Design: DNA samples that were already collected will be studied. Participants may be asked to send in a second DNA sample (blood or saliva). These will be used to verify any findings. If a primary variant for the participant s health condition is found through genome sequencing, this will be shared with the participant by their primary research team. If the participant has a secondary finding, it will be shared by phone call or videoconference by this research group in the National Human Genome Research Institute. Some participants may get their results in person at the clinic. Three months after getting their secondary findings, participants will do an online survey and phone interview. They will be asked about how they have used the information. Some people who do not receive a secondary finding from genome sequencing will be asked to do an online survey three months after the get that result. Participants who have a secondary finding can get genetic counseling.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Center Genomics Opportunity Secondary Findings Analysis and Return</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The implementation of genome and exome sequencing creates challenges and opportunities. We propose to pilot the implementation of exome sequencing for incidental/secondary findings in the NIHCC and measure its perceived utility. Through the Clinical Center Genomics Opportunity (CCGO), we have offered to investigators in 10 institutes access to exome sequencing for gene identification studies of their rare disease patients. We are using this research resource to increase the research use of genomics outside NHGRI, to begin to build the NIHCC clinical laboratory infrastructure to support genome scale data, and to familiarize clinicians in the NIHCC with genomic medicine. To accomplish these clinical goals, we propose to generate exome data in a CLIA- (NotEqual)compliant environment at NISC and use those data to evaluate patients for the presence of variants in genes recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics policy on incidental and secondary findings, which is consistent with the policy recommendations of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. Thus, the exome data will have a dual purpose the entire dataset will be available for research to the ordering principal investigator and a small subset of those data will be used to test our ability to identify high risk variants for actionable disorders, coupled to knowledgeable clinical interpretation, genetic counseling and referral for ongoing care. The human subjects review and approval of the gene identification research use of the exome data will be addressed by the approved PIs through their own IRBs. Here, we are requesting review of the generation of the sequence data by next-gen technology for secondary variants, a bioinformatic pipeline for filtering those variants, manual curation of the variants, and behavioral follow up of participants who receive secondary findings results to measure their utility and perceived value. Additional and critical Specific Aims are to measure the efficacy by which we communicate 1) to the participants who do not receive a secondary finding the concept that a secondary findings analysis is not a substitute for an indicated single gene and 2) explore the interpretation and outcomes of results for those who receive a secondary finding.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: any English (NotEqual)speaking participant who is enrolled in one of the approved CCGO applications after this protocol s approval by the IRB who has a secondary variant report available (positive or negative). These studies include a wide range of ages of patients, children and adults. For minors or decisionallyimpaired adults, one parent/guardian, typically the self designated primary health care support parent, will be enrolled. If the parents claim equal roles, whichever of the parents selects to participate in the interview/survey will be enrolled. It is important to emphasize that we will not ask minors or decisionally impaired adults to participate in the social and behavioral components of the study. Because validated instruments for our surveys largely do not exist in languages other than English, we cannot administer these measures to nonEnglish speakers.</criteria>
