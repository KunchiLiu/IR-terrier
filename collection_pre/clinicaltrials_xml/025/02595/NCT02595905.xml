	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well cisplatin works with or without veliparib in treating patients with stage IV triple-negative breast cancer and/or breast cancer (BRCA) mutation-associated breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known if cisplatin is more effective with or without veliparib in treating patients with triple-negative and/or BRCA mutation-associated breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin With or Without Veliparib in Treating Patients With Stage IV Triple-Negative and/or BRCA Mutation-Associated Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the efficacy of cisplatin with or without ABT-888 (veliparib) on progression-free survival (PFS) in each of the following groups: patients with germline BRCA (gBRCA) mutation-associated breast cancer, patients with germline BRCA wild-type breast cancer who have evidence of BRCAness phenotype, and patients with germline BRCA wild-type breast cancer who do not have evidence of BRCAness phenotype. II. To compare the efficacy of cisplatin with or without ABT-888 on PFS in patients with triple negative and/or gBRCA mutation-associated breast cancer and brain metastases. (Brain metastases cohort) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. For patients with gBRCA mutation associated breast cancer or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with or without BRCAness phenotype, to compare the efficacy of cisplatin with or without ABT-888 on overall survival (OS), response rate, and clinical benefit rate. II. To compare the differential benefit of ABT-888 across the three groups using both PFS and OS as outcomes. III. For patients in the brain metastases cohort, to compare the efficacy of cisplatin with or without ABT-888 on OS. IV. For patients in the brain metastases cohort, to compare the efficacy of cisplatin with or without ABT-888 on intracranial and extracranial response rates (intracranial by Response Assessment Neuro-Oncology Criteria [RANO] and extracranial by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 [RECIST 1.1]). V. To compare toxicities of ABT-888 to placebo in each of the four groups separately. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the impact of homologous recombination deficiency score (independent of other BRCAness markers) on response rate (RR) and PFS in patients treated with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy plus ABT-888. II. To evaluate the overlap among various markers utilized to define the BRCAness phenotype. III. To evaluate the combined impact of PAM50 basal subtype and BRCAness phenotype on RR and PFS in patients treated with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy plus ABT-888. IV. To evaluate the impact of BRCA1 mRNA expression (independent other BRCAness markers) on response rate (RR) and PFS in patients treated with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy plus ABT-888. V. Application of somatic BRCAness phenotype markers on metastatic tumor tissue to identify patients likely to benefit from platinum-based therapy and ABT-888. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and placebo orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and veliparib PO BID on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 9 weeks for 54 weeks, every 18 weeks until progression, and then every 6 months for up to 5 years after progression.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have metastatic breast cancer (stage IV disease) and be human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) nonover expressing per 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)College of American Pathologists (CAP) HER testing guidelines (0 or 1+ by immunohistochemistry [IHC]; and/or HER2 ratio &lt; 2.0 and HER2 copy number &lt; 4 signals/cell by insitu hybridization [ISH]) Patients must also meet at least one of the following criteria: Triple negative: histologically confirmed primary and/or metastatic site that is estrogen receptor (ER)negative (=&lt; 1%), progesterone receptor (PR)negative (=&lt; 1%), and HER2negative BRCA mutation: previously confirmed deleterious breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1) or breast cancer 2, early onset (BRCA2) germline mutation or suspected deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation if the classification being used is the 5tier classification; documentation of germline test results are required Patients must have measurable or nonmeasurable disease; patients must have a chest/abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan (or positron emission tomography [PET]/CT of diagnostic quality, conventional or spiral) and bone scan prior to registration; if the patient is unable to undergo CT with IV contrast due to allergy or renal insufficiency, a noncontrast CT may be performed; all scans needed for assessment of measurable disease must be performed within 28 days prior to registration; nonmeasurable disease must be assessed within 42 days prior to registration; all disease must be assessed and documented on the Baseline Tumor Assessment Form Patients must have adequate tissue available, must agree to have specimens submitted for germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing and other correlative studies Patients must have had =&lt;
