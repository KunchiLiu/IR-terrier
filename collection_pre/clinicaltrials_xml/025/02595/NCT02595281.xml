	<brief_summary>HE4 is a more sensitive marker than CA-125 in patients with ovarian cancers. The interest of serum HE4 before surgery has been demonstrated to predict overall survival and its interest has also been shown in combination with CA-125 (ROMA algorithm) to identify high risk patients. To date, no study shows clearly the predictive potential of serum HE4 as an early relapse biomarker in ovarian cancers.</brief_summary>
