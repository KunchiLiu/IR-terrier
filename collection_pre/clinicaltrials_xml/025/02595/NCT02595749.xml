	<brief_summary>Socioemotional processing dysfunctions (i.e., disruptions in affective, cognitive, and neural processes that encode, interpret, and respond to socially and emotionally relevant stimuli) have been implicated in tobacco smoking and relapse, however this potential target for medication development has not been systematically examined. Evidence from animal and human laboratories indicate that administration of intranasal oxytocin enhances socioemotional processing and may be efficacious for the treatment of drug addiction, including nicotine dependence. In order to evaluate the potential efficacy of intranasal oxytocin for smoking cessation, this laboratory-based proposal will examine whether intranasal oxytocin attenuates smoking lapse, nicotine withdrawal, and socioemotional processing disruptions in regular smokers following overnight abstinence.</brief_summary>
