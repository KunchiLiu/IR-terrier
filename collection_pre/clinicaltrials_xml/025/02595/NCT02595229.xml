	<brief_summary>Investigation of the influence of the pronator quadratus (PQ) muscle repair following volar plate fixation of distal radius fractures with regard to the forearm pronation strength. During the early recovery period of 3 months an improvement of pronation strength and functional scorings was hypothesized for the PQ repair when compared to no repair. Randomization of the patients in two groups ( PQ repair and no repair) and follow-up examinations after 6 and 12 weeks included bilateral isometric pronation strength measurement, range of motion, the QuickDASH and the Mayo-Wrist-Score, and a visual analogue scale (VAS)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigation of the influence of the pronator quadratus (PQ) muscle repair following volar plate fixation of distal radius fractures with special regards to the forearm pronation strength. During the early recovery period of 3 months an improvement of pronation strength and functional scorings was hypothesized for the PQ repair when compared to no repair. Therefore the patients are randomized to group A = PQ repair and group B = no repair. Follow-up examinations after 6 and 12 weeks are scheduled included bilateral isometric pronation strength measurement, range of motion, the QuickDASH and the Mayo-Wrist-Score, and a visual analogue scale (VAS)</detailed_description>
