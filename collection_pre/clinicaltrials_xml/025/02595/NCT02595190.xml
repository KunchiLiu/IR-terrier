	<brief_summary>There are very few data and analysis in the literature regarding the symptomatic sacral perineurial cysts. Most studies are case reports or small retrospective sample, which rarely more than 20 cases. There is no an consensus on the choice of treatment (medicine conservative treatment and surgical treatment) for symptomatic sacral perineurial cysts.Our aim, therefore, is to compare the efficacy of medicine conservative treatment and surgical treatment for symptomatic sacral perineurial cysts by a randomized controlled trial. Meanwhile, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging is used to detect the changes at pain related brain areas, which will be develop an objective method to evaluate the clinical curative effect of the two treatment options.</brief_summary>
