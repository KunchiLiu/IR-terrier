	<brief_summary>To compare refractive outcomes and patient's visual quality after bilateral cataract surgery when implanting multifocal intraocular lens, monofocal with monovision or hybrid monovision.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multifocal Intraocular Lens x Monovision x Hybrid Monovision After Bilateral Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the results in randomized patients that receive bilateral multifocal IOLs, monofocal IOLs with monovision with emmetropia in one eye and 1.50 D of myopia in the other eye, or monofocal IOL in the dominant eye and multifocal IOL in the non-dominant eye, then evaluate visual and refractive outcomes, as well as independence for glasses after bilateral surgery with 1 year of follow up.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Bilateral senile cataracts. Implantation of IOL in the capsular bag; Implants from 1030 diopter; Potential Visual Acuity in ≥ 0.2 logMAR (20/32, metric scale) after surgery; Amblyopia; Single Eye; History of intraocular surgery in the previous year; Sequel to prior ocular trauma; Important Microphthalmia or aniridia; History of damage to the corneal endothelium (chemical burns, herpetic keratitis, corneal guttata); Corneal astigmatism &gt; 1.0 D; IOP ≥ 21 mmHg in standard caliper; Ocular pathology that affects visual function (uveitis, diabetic retinopathy, agerelated macular degeneration, macular dystrophy, retinal detachment, glaucoma, optic neuropathy); Pupil &gt; 5 mm or &lt; 2 mm under photopic conditions; Asymmetrical pupils in the eye or between the eyes; Binocular vision absence; Any situation that endangers the implant position in the capsular bag (posttraumatic zonular weakness, pseudoexfoliation, for example); Patient probably need to laser treatment of the retina; Patients whose expectations are unrealistic; Patients whose lifestyle involves high expectations of visual acuity (writer, driver, for example); Patients at risk of not meeting the clinical followup requirements (distance of travel difficulties, for example);</criteria>
