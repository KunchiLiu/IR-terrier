	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies how well nivolumab after surgery and chemotherapy work in treating patients with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and kill tumor cells remaining after surgery and standard of care chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab After Surgery and Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage IB-IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate whether adjuvant therapy with nivolumab will result in improved overall survival (OS) and/or disease-free survival (DFS) over standard observation in patients with stage IB &gt;= 4 cm, II and IIIA, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following surgical resection and standard adjuvant therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety profile of nivolumab when given as an adjuvant therapy. II. To evaluate and compare disease free and overall survival in patients with tumors that express programmed cell death ligand (PD-L)1 in various patterns associated with nivolumab and standard observation. III. To evaluate and compare disease free and overall survival in patients with tumors that have high mutational load associated with nivolumab and standard observation. IV. To evaluate OS and DFS by stage. V. To evaluate OS and DFS by each stratification factor. VI. To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years (OS and DFS rate). OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients are followed serially with imaging. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then every 12 months for 6 years.</detailed_description>
