	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to observe the feasibility and its application of autologous prefabrication for body surface tissues/oranges</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Prefabrication of Body Surface Tissues/ Organs(e.g. Joint)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the field of tissue regeneration techniques, the in vitro processes and other exogenous factors still have many uncertainties. These uncertainties have hampered road to the clinical application. As the importance of in vivo environment has aroused more awareness, the investigators validated the hypothesis that the feasibility of self-regeneration prefabricated unaided by any in vitro culture process or exogenous elements.</detailed_description>
