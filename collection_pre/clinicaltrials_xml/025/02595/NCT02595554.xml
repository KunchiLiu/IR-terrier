	<brief_summary>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and radical surgery (RS) may have a possible better outcome to concurrent chemoirradiation (CCRT) in stage IIB cervical cancer. We try to verify such a hypothesis in terms of survival and treatment related morbidity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIB cervical cancer are eligible for our study. They will receive cisplatin based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) 3 cycles followed by radical surgery (RS) (type III to V radical hysterectomy plus systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy) (arm A) or external beam radiation (EBRT) with concurrent weekly platinum 40mg/m2 followed by brachyradiotherapy (arm B).</detailed_description>
