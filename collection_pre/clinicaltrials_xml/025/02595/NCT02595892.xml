	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well Ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related [ATR] kinase inhibitor VX-970 (VX-970) and gemcitabine hydrochloride work compared to standard treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride alone in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent). ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking an enzyme needed for cell growth, and may also help gemcitabine hydrochloride work better. Gemcitabine hydrochloride is a drug used in chemotherapy that works to stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking cells from growing and repairing themselves, causing them to die. It is not yet known whether adding ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 to standard treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride is more effective than gemcitabine hydrochloride alone in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess and compare progression free survival (PFS) between gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride)/VX-970 and gemcitabine alone arms. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine and compare overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) between gemcitabine/VX-970 and gemcitabine alone arms. II. Determine and compare the safety profile of gemcitabine/VX-970 and gemcitabine alone regimens. III. Assess and compare PFS at 6 months between gemcitabine/VX-970 and gemcitabine alone arms. IV. Determine and compare the clinical benefit rate (CBR) between gemcitabine/VX-970 and gemcitabine alone arms. V. Determine and compare the duration of response (DOR) between gemcitabine/VX-970 and gemcitabine alone arms. VI. Determine and compare cancer antigen (CA)125 reduction by &gt;= 50% between gemcitabine/VX-970 and gemcitabine alone arms. VII. Determine and compare overall survival (OS) between gemcitabine/VX-970 and gemcitabine alone arms. VIII. Determine the ORR for subjects in the gemcitabine alone arm who cross over to the gemcitabine/VX-970 arm. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing disease progression may crossover to Arm II. ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride as in Arm I and ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 IV over 60-90 minutes on days 2 and 9. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically confirmed high grade serous ovarian or primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer; platinum resistant disease is defined as progression within 6 months after last platinum regimen Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;= 20 mm (&gt;= 2 cm) with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm (&gt;= 1 cm) with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam; measurable disease by RECIST version (v)1.1 with at least one measurable target lesion Prior therapy: No line limit but no more than 1 prior regimens in the platinum resistant setting; no prior treatment targeting the ATR/checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) pathway and no prior gemcitabine as single agent; hormonal therapies and antiangiogenic therapies (as single agents) do not count as lines; poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]ribose) polymerases (PARP)inhibitors count as line of therapy; prior carboplatin/gemcitabine is allowed provided that there was no disease progression within 12 months after completion of the carboplatin/gemcitabine regimen; subjects may begin protocol treatment at least 4 weeks or 5 halflives, whichever is shorter, after their last dose of chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, assuming they are otherwise eligible Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 (Karnofsky &gt;= 70%) Life expectancy of greater than 6 months Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt;
