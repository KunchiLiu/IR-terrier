	<brief_summary>Triple-negative breast cancer is a special type of breast cancer with poor prgnosis and limited choices. Chemotherapy is the only choice of adjuvant systemic treatment options. Previous study suggested that zoledronic acid might have anti-tumor effect by eliminating the number of DTCs(Disseminated Tumor Cell )and had been proved to be effective as adjvant therapy in postmenopausal women whose breast cancer was Homonal receptor positive and who were receiving aromatase inhibitors. So it might be able to improve the survival of triple negative breast cancer patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zoledronic Acid as Adjuvant Treatment of Triple-negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Triple negative breast cancer patients with high risk factor will be randomized to receive either zoledronic acid or observation after the completion of standard chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Recurrence status will be followed and Disease free survival will be compared. Overall survival is the secondary endpoint.</detailed_description>
