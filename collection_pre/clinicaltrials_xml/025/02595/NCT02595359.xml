	<brief_title>Intracameral Moxifloxacin for Prevention of Postcataract Endophthalmitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although cataract surgery is generally considered a safe procedure resulting in a favourable visual outcome, surgical complications do occur. The most feared complication is postoperative endophthalmitis which is an infectious condition caused by micro-organisms introduced to the interior of the eye during or after the surgical procedure. As endophthalmitis is an infection, it should be preventable by antibiotic treatment. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment can be given as topical treatment preoperatively, or during surgery directly into the anterior chamber, or as a subconjunctival, or it can be given as topical treatment postoperatively. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the prophylactic effect of intracameral moxifloxacin for prevention of postcataract endophthalmitis.</detailed_description>
