	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of triapine when given with radiation therapy and cisplatin in treating patients with stage IB2-IVA cervical or vulvar cancer. Triapine may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking an enzyme needed for cell growth. Cisplatin is a drug used in chemotherapy that kills cancer cells by damaging their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Adding triapine to standard treatment with cisplatin and radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triapine With Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With IB2-IVA Cervical or Vulvar Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of oral triapine when used in combination with cisplatin plus radiation therapy. II. To determine the oral bioavailability of triapine. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral and intravenous triapine. II. To determine metabolic complete response (mCR) rate of oral triapine in combination with cisplatin chemoradiation using fludeoxyglucose F 18 (18F-FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) at post-therapy (3-months). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether the overexpression of ribonucleotide reductase (RR) in archival tumor tissue is correlated with the antitumor activity of triapine. II. To determine the effect of combined modality treatment on activation of ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM) and H2A histone family, member X (H2AX) and possibly other markers in peripheral blood. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of triapine. Patients undergo pelvic external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) 5 days per week for 5 weeks (25 fractions) with a 3-day boost in week 6, and 1 or 3 applications of low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy in week 6 or 5 fractions of high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy at week 4 or 5. Patients also receive triapine intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 11 and orally (PO) on days 2-5, 8-10, 12, 15-19, 22-26, and 29-33 within 90 minutes after pelvic irradiation, and cisplatin IV over 90-120 minutes once weekly for 5 weeks (days 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30). Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.</detailed_description>
