	<brief_summary>The main purpose is to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Triferic iron administered intravenously in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease on chronic hemodialysis (CKD-5HD). It is an open-label, two-period sequential dosing study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triferic Pediatric Pharmacokinetic Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, 2-period, single-dose study assessing the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Triferic (ferric pyrophosphate citrate, or FPC) administered via dialysate and IV to pediatric patients (&lt; 18 years of age) receiving chronic hemodialysis (CKD-5HD). Total participation in the study is approximately three weeks and is comprised of a screening visit, two dosing (PK) visits, and a follow-up visit. Each patient will receive a single dose of Triferic administered IV into the venous blood return line over the duration of the dialysis. At the next scheduled dialysis session each patient will receive a single dose of Triferic administered via dialysate during a single hemodialysis session. Blood samples will be obtained at various times to analyze for serum iron parameters and for safety.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A patient will be eligible for inclusion in the study only if all of the following criteria are met: 1. Parents/legal guardians of the patient have the ability to understand the requirements of the study and have demonstrated a willingness to have their child comply with all study procedures by signing an institutional review boardapproved informed consent form. Where applicable, assent of the patient has also been obtained for all study procedures prior to any studyrelated activities. 2. Patient is &lt;18 years of age at screening. 3. Patient has chronic kidney disease receiving incenter hemodialysis at least twice weekly for at least 1 month prior to screening. 4. Patient is receiving adequate hemodialysis as assessed by the investigator and based on a single pool Kt/V measurement &gt;1.2. 5. Patient has a vascular access (tunneled catheter, AV fistula or AV graft) suitable to support blood flows for hemodialysis treatment. 6. Patient has a body mass of 11 lbs (5 kg). 7. Patient is ironreplete as measured by a TSAT 20% and a ferritin &gt;100 micrograms/L at screening. 8. Patient has a whole blood Hgb concentration of 10.0 g/dL at screening. 9. If patient is receiving ESA, the dose has been stable (unchanged) for at least 3 weeks prior to Baseline admission. 10. Patient has appropriate laboratory values for their disease state at screening (per investigator judgment). 11. Patient has no significant abnormal findings on physical examination that would preclude participation in the study. 12. If the patient is female, she must be prepubertal, have had documented surgical sterilization prior to Baseline admission, or be practicing adequate birth control. All female patients 9 years of age and older, and also any who have reached menarche before age 9 years, must have a negative serum pregnancy test during screening. It is the investigator's responsibility to determine whether the patient has adequate birth control for study participation. A patient will not be eligible for inclusion in the study if any of the following criteria apply: 1. Patient is positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B by history. 2. Patient has an acute illness within 1 week of Baseline admission (patient may be screened again 2 weeks post resolution of the acute illness). 3. Patient is receiving intravenous or oral antibiotics or antifungals for any infectious process. Prophylactic antibiotics administered on a regular basis are allowed. 4. Patient has evidence of an ongoing active inflammatory process (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, acute or chronic active hepatitis, etc.). 5. Patient has participated in an investigational drug study within the 30 days prior to Baseline admission. 6. Administration of IV or oral iron supplements within 2 weeks prior to Baseline admission.</criteria>
