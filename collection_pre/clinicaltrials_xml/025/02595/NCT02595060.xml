	<brief_summary>This trial evaluates efficacy and safety of inhaled molgramostim (rhGM-CSF) in 45 patients with pneumonia associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A third of the patients will receive 150 mcg inhaled molgramostim, another third 450 mcg and the remaining third will receive inhaled placebo for 3 days. The patients will be followed for 28 days.</brief_summary>
