	<brief_title>A Trial of Oseltamivir in High-Risk Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department With Influenza</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will test for influenza using a point-of-care rapid test and if positive for influenza participants will be randomized to oseltamivir or placebo and followed prospectively. The primary outcome will firstly be defined as a non-elective admission to hospital, in contrast to return visits to the emergency department where admission does not take place, which will be classified separately. However, a prolonged stay in the emergency department (&gt; 24 hours) will also be considered to be hospitalization. Hospitalizations, as well as all other outcomes, will be counted up to 28 days following randomization. Secondary outcomes will be lower respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, antimicrobial prescriptions, acute sinusitis, visits to medical providers and work related absenteeism for up to 28 days following randomization will be captured as secondary outcomes during the follow up.</detailed_description>
