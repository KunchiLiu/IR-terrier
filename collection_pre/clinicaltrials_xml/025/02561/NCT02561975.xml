	<brief_summary>An injury of haematosis in post ischemic chronic heart failure limits the clinic tolerance. There is a correlation between injury of pulmonary diffusing, chronic heart failure intensity and aerobic physic ability evaluated by an heart-rate maximal exercise tolerance test (VO2 max). This injury is a new follow-up parameter of cardiac function for the adult. The nature of damage (vascular or membrane) can be determined by the measure of double pulmonary diffusing capacity to carbon monoxide (CO) associated to nitric oxide (NO). Today, in chronic heart failure consecutive to a congenital heart disease, there is no data on evolution of membrane and capillar factors.It is impossible to predict if membrane damage will be the best factor correlated to the VO2max in patients suffering from complex congenital heart disease. Assessing these parameters could be an comparative evaluation of heart-rate exercise tolerance test with VO2max and an early control of his damage without risks related to heart-rate maximal exercise and independently of age, sex, hemoglobin, type of heart disease.These results would have an early prognostic value that would permit to refine the follow-up and the treatment. The main objective of this trial is to assess the statistic correlation between the membrane injury of alveolar-capillary diffusing at rest and aerobic physic ability restriction in children and adults suffering from complex congenital heart disease.</brief_summary>
