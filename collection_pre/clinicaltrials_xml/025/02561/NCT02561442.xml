	<brief_summary>The proposed study aims to assess the time above MIC (4 mg/mL), and the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and bioavailability of 1 g ceftriaxone administered by constant rate subcutaneous infusion over 2 hours compared with 1 g of ceftriaxone administered as a constant IV infusion over 0.5 hours. In addition, the study will compare the results obtained after 1 g ceftriaxone intravenous or subcutaneous administration with 2 g ceftriaxone administered subcutaneously</brief_summary>
