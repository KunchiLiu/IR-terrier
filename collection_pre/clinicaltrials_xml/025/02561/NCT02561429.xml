	<brief_summary>Skin prick test (SPT) was used for diagnostic test for type 1 hypersensitivity. The efficacy and safety of SPT were proved. The positive control of SPT is histamine. In Thailand, the most common concentration of histamine for SPT is 10 mg/ml. However, in some practice they use other concentration (1, 2.5 mg/ml). This study will find the proper concentration of histamine for positive control use in SPT.</brief_summary>
