	<brief_summary>Patients in fast-track programmes are required to take an active part in their treatment and rehabilitation. Spouses of older patients can often provide valued practical and emotional support, reducing stress, pain and length of stay - yet they are seldom invited to participate in a supporting role. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of spouses' involvement in older patients fast-track treatment programs using case management as intervention. A two-group quasi-experimental design with pre-test and repeated post-test measures (protocol approved in November 2012) was used. Patients aged 65 years or older going through a fast-track programme for a total hip replacement and their spouses was recruited in dyads from one Danish orthopaedic ward for the intervention group (n=15) and for the control group (n=14). Data was collected from both groups at baseline, two weeks and three months after surgery. Outcome measures for patients include: functional status, nutrition, pain, depression and healthcare consumptions; and for spouses: caregiver satisfaction and difficulties and anxiety.</brief_summary>
