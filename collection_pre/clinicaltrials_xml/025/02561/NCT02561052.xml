	<brief_summary>Masimo Corporation has developed a new parameter for noninvasive monitoring by optical sensors, Oxygen Reserve index (ORI). ORI is believed to correlate with the partial pressure of arterial blood oxygen (PaO2). Aim of this study is to validate the oxygen reserve index in healthy volunteers undergoing controlled hyperoxia and hypoxia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) Validation in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: Monitoring a patient's oxygen status during anesthesia using pulse oximetry is essential. The new Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI), a relative indicator of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) in the range of 100 to 200 mmHg, may help provide clinicians real-time visibility to oxygenation in a moderate hypoxic range and serve as a warning of an impending hypoxic state. In this way, ORI may enable proactive interventions to avoid hypoxia. Objective: The primary objective is to validate the new Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) by collecting optical data using the Rainbow SET Pulse CO-Oximeter (Masimo Corp.) and comparing them to whole blood references of arterial and venous blood drawn in healthy volunteers. Secondary objectives are to determine and quantify the capability of the new Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) to serve as an early alarm of changes in patient's oxygen status and to quantify the effects of changes in inspired oxygen concentration on cerebral and peripheral tissue oxygenation. Study design: Prospective first in human validation intervention study at one single center (UMCG) Study population: Subjects will be healthy men and/or women of non-childbearing potential between 18 and 45 years of age (inclusive) consisting of members of the community at large Intervention (if applicable): Each subject will undergo the following interventions - Change in inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2): - Normoxia: room air (FiO2 0.21) (baseline) - Hyperoxia: 100% oxygen (FiO2 1.0) - Hypoxia: breathing mixtures of N2 in air via a tight fitting facemask to reach arterial oxygen saturation levels of just below 90% as measured by pulse oximetry (Radical 7, Masimo Corp.) - Change in expiratory carbon dioxide concentration (etCO2) (during normoxia, awake state): - Normoventilation (etCO2 4.5 - 5 Vol%) - Partial re-breathing or adding external medical CO2 (target etCO2 7 - 7.5 Vol%) - Hyperventilation (target etCO2 2.5 - 3 Vol%) - A vascular occlusion test (VOT) will be performed by inflating an upper arm blood pressure cuff at each intervention. Main study parameters/endpoints: The purpose of the study is to collect optical data using the Rainbow SET Pulse CO-Oximeter for computing the Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI). The collected optical data is compared to whole blood reference samples and is used to assess the effects of changing partial pressure of O2 and CO2 on wavelength absorbance as measured by the Rainbow SET Pulse CO-Oximeter. The Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) is an index, which is designed to differentiate between normoxic and hyperoxic states by scaling the measured absorption information between a scale of 0.00 and 1.00. The scale is obtained by observing the changes in absorption measurements on a large group of healthy volunteers as they transition between normoxic and hyperoxic regions. Further measurements include systemic blood flow = Cardiac output (non-invasively via Nexfin monitor), peripheral tissue oxygenation at the thenar eminence (InSpectra 650 tissue oximeter, Hutchinson) and at the forehead (Near infrared spectroscopy, NIRS).</detailed_description>
