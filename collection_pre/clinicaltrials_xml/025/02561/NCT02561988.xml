	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and antineoplastic activity of BLU-285, administered orally (PO), in adult patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis and other relapsed or refractory myeloid malignancies. The study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation part (Part 1) and an expansion part (Part 2).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>For Part 1:Patients must have one of the following diagnoses: Aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) as confirmed by World Heath Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria. Systemic mastocytosisassociated hematologic nonmast cell disease (SMAHNMD) as confirmed by WHO diagnostic criteria, and the patient also has at least 1 Cfinding attributable to systemic mastocytosis (SM). The AHNMD must be myeloid, with the following exceptions that are excluded: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that is very high or highrisk as defined by the International prognostic scoring system for myelodysplastic syndromes (IPSSR) and Philadelphia chromosome positive malignancies. Mast cell leukemia (MCL) as confirmed per WHO diagnostic criteria. Histologically or cytologically confirmed myeloid malignancy as confirmed by IWGMRT or WHO diagnostic criteria that is relapsed or refractory to standard treatments. AML, MDS that is very high or highrisk as defined by the IPSSR, and Philadelphia chromosome positive malignancies are excluded. Upon discussion with the sponsor, other relapsed or refractory, potentially BLU285responsive hematologic neoplasms (e.g., evidence of aberrant KIT or platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling) may be considered for enrollment. For Part 2: Group 1: ASM as confirmed by WHO diagnostic criteria. Group 2: SMAHNMD as confirmed by WHO diagnostic criteria, that also has at least 1 Cfinding attributable to SM. The AHNMD must be myeloid, with the following exceptions that are excluded: AML, MDS that is very high or highrisk as defined by the IPSSR, and Philadelphia chromosome positive malignancies. Group 3: MCL as confirmed per WHO diagnostic criteria. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 03. QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;470 milliseconds Platelet count &lt;25,000/mL Absolute neutrophil count &lt;500/mL Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN); &gt;5 × ULN if associated with clinically suspected liver infiltration by mastocytosis or another disease for which the patient enrolled into the study Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 × ULN; &gt;3 × ULN if associated with liver infiltration by the disease being treated or in the presence of Gilbert's Disease Estimated (CockroftGault formula) or measured creatinine clearance &lt;40 mL/min Brain malignancy or metastases to the brain History of a seizure disorder or requirement for antiseizure medication Known risk of intracranial bleeding, such as a brain aneurysm or history of subdural or subarachnoid bleeding</criteria>
