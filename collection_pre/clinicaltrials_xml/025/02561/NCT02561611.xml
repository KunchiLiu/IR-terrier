	<brief_summary>The purpose of the WorkACTIVE-P study is to assess the outcome of an innovative multi-component intervention focused on increasing energy expenditure and re-balancing the disrupted energy balance equation of sedentary workplaces with an ultimate target of reducing workers' abdominal obesity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-component Workplace Energy Balance Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The energy expenditure intervention includes replacing workplace sedentary time with access to a dedicated pedal desk and increasing steps/day with wearable monitors. Both components are incorporated into an electronically-delivered behavior monitoring and support infrastructure, thus enabling continuous management. The investigators will utilize pedaldesks manufactured and owned by Pennington Biomedical Research Center to conduct this study at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana offices in Baton Rouge, La. 40 individuals will be recruited and randomized to either a control arm or combined Walk More Pedal Desk (WMPD) intervention. Primary (MRI-determined visceral adipose tissue) and secondary (changes in body weight, total adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue, blood pressure, blood lipids, fasting glucose and insulin, HbA1-c, free-living accelerometer-determined walking, time spent in sedentary behavior, exercise, and dietary intake) outcomes will be assessed at baseline and month 3.</detailed_description>
