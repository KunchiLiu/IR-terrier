	<brief_summary>The prevalence of Allergic rhinitis(AR) and asthma was increased world wide. In 1998, ISAAC found that prevalence of AR and asthma inThailand was in moderately high group. Tests for immediated reaction SPT and spIgE, were used for evaluated sensitization of allergen in patient. They guided the investigators for proper management as well as patient education. Clinician will use the result for choose allergen in case that might need immunotherapy. SPT is safe and more economic for patient. Specific IgE has an advantage in patient who cannot withhold antihistamine prior SPT. In United state had a trial of result between SPT and spIgE for cockroach, cat, house dust mite and mold. It showed the correlation between two tests. In Thailand, the investigators haven't had data about it yet.</brief_summary>
