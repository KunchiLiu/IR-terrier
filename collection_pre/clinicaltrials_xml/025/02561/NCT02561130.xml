	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether in patients with early type 2 diabetes, a short-term intensive metabolic intervention comprising Forxiga, metformin, basal insulin glargine and lifestyle approaches will be superior to standard diabetes therapy in achieving sustained diabetes remission.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Remission Evaluation of a Metabolic Intervention in Type 2 Diabetes With Forxiga</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre, open-label, randomized controlled trial in 152 patients with recently-diagnosed T2DM. Participants will be randomized to 2 treatment groups: (a) a 12-week course of treatment with Forxiga, metformin, insulin glargine and lifestyle therapy, and (b) standard diabetes therapy, and followed for a total of 64 weeks (1 year and 3 months). In all participants with HbA1C&lt;7.3% at the 12 week visit, glucose-lowering medications will be discontinued and participants will be encouraged to continue with lifestyle modifications and regular glucose monitoring. Participants with HbA1C ≥ 7.3% at this visit or who experience hyperglycemia relapse after stopping drugs will receive standard glycemic management as informed by the current Canadian Diabetes Association clinical practice guidelines.</detailed_description>
