	<brief_title>Effect of Resistance Training on Metabolic Control and Outcome in Prediabetes (NMR-based Metabonomics)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most of exercise interventions involved aerobic exercises, investigators were not able to find a single long term study focusing on type 2 diabetes prevention with resistance training and aerobic exercise. It has been known that for those who have already had diabetes, resistance training can reduce insulin resistance and HbA1c level, improve lipid profile, and decrease blood pressure. Based on previous findings, investigators will evaluate how the different exercising interventions impact on insulin resistance, metabolic control, and the incidence and prevalence of diabetes in prediabetes population who receive 12 months of either resistant training or aerobic exercise. Further more, metabolomics approach will be introduced to detect biological markers,and therefore,to analyze the predictive values of metabolomics on long term outcomes of prediabetes population.</detailed_description>
