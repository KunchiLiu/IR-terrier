	<brief_title>p53 Gene Therapy in Treatment of Diabetes Concurrent With Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It was found in the treatment of HCC using p53 gene therapy that the concurrent diabetes was controlled as well. The objectives of this study are to investigate both anti-diabetic and anti-tumor role of p53 gene therapy. This is an open-labeled, randomized, active-controlled phase 2 study. p53 will be injected via the artery, which supplies blood for the tumor nodules. The study endpoints for anti-diabetic role are fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial glucose (PPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) at 30 days after the start of treatment; and for antitumor effect are progression-free survival and overall survival.</detailed_description>
