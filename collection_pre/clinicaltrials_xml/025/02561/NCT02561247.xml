	<criteria>1. Patients with a body weight ≥8 and &lt;20 kg (ie, ≥17.6 and &lt;44.09 lbs). 2. Patients with acute kidney injury/failure. Acute renal failure will be defined as either 1) Acute Kidney Injury by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Acute Kidney Injury Guideline serum creatinine criteria, which is a &gt;50% rise in serum creatinine over baseline or a 0.3 mg/dl SCr rise in 48 hours, OR 2) as Acute Kidney Injury as defined by the pediatric modified RIFLE criteria (pRIFLE) which is a 25% reduction in estimated creatinine clearance, OR 3) a serum creatinine &gt;1.2 mg/dl. OR Patients with severe fluid overload, defined as a &gt;10% Intensive Care Unit (ICU) fluid accumulation (based on ICU admission weight) will be included in the study (% fluid accumulation = [(Fluids In (liters) Fluid Out (liters)/ICU admit weight (kg) * 100%] 3. Patients who have received renal replacement therapy previously can be included in the study if &gt;72 hours have elapsed since previous RRT provision 4. Provide written informed consent from one or both parents as required by the local IRB or a legal guardian unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child per 21 CFR Part 50.55(e). 1. Patients with a hemoglobin of &lt;9 g/dl at the time of starting CRRT 2. Children who are wards of the state 3. Children undergoing or requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment</criteria>
