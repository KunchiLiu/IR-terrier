	<criteria>Subjects must have signed and dated informed consent after receiving verbal and written information about the clinical trial. Subjects with unequivocal clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe scalp alopecia areata (patch type, totalis, universalis), as determined by the (sub) investigator, affecting a minimum of 30% scalp area at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 2 (Day 1, baseline). Minimum 6 month duration of hair loss at Visit 1 (Screening). No upper limit time limit. Subject must accept to not cut hair in the treated scalp areas during the trial. Females who are pregnant or are breast feeding. Current signs of spontaneous hair regrowth. Diffuse type alopecia areata. Coexisting moderate to severe androgenic alopecia (NorwoodHamilton stage IVVI and Ludwig stage II and III) Subjects with changed or expected changes in medication for thyroid disease within 6 month before Visit 1 (screening) or during the trial. Systemic treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine), chloroquin derivatives, corticosteroids, or any other systemic therapy that in the opinion of the investigator could affect hair regrowth, within 6 weeks prior to randomization (inhaled or intranasal steroids corresponding to up to 1 mg prednisone for asthma or rhinitis may be used).</criteria>
