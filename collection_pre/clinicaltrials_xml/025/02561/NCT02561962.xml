	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a first in human phase 1 multicenter open label study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 224 in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 is the dose-exploration and part 2 is the dose-expansion. Study medication will be administered once every 3 weeks by IV.</detailed_description>
