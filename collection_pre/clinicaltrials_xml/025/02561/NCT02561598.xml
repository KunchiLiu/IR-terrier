	<brief_title>A Case Control Study of Patients With Diagnosis of Malignant Hyperthermia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study will use the combination of electronic medical records and genomic information in samples of persons who have exhibited signs of Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) or have family history or high risk of MH to see if risk factors can be identified. These will be compared with control samples of children who have been exposed to the same agents which could induce MH, yet showed no signs of the disorder.</detailed_description>
