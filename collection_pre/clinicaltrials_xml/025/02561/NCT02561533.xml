	<brief_summary>Immunohistochemical detection of the BRAF-V600E mutation on pre-operative fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) from patients suspected for papillary thyroid carcinoma, using the mutation specific antibody VE1.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection of BRAF Mutation on FNAB From Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The BRAF mutation is reported to be present in approximately 50% of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). The mutation has been associated with poor prognosis and more advanced disease stage. Therefore, pre-operative detection of the BRAF-V600E mutation may be of clinical interest in order to individualize treatment of patients with BRAF positive PTC. FNABs are performed immediately before the thyroid operation, and BRAF-V600E detection using VE1 is performed on clots. The VE1 stain is compared to the mutation status of the removed cancer or control tissue using the Cobas test.</detailed_description>
