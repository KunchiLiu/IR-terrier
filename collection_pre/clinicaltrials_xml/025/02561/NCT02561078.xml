If TDD of U500R and other insulins are combined, then insulin other than U500R not to exceed 25% of TDD. HbA1c ≥7.5% and ≤12.0%. Body mass index ≥25 but ≤50 kilograms per meter squared. Have a history of stable body weight. Concomitant antihyperglycemic agent (AHA) therapy may include metformin (MET), dipeptidyl peptidase4 inhibitors and/or pioglitazone. Approximately 64 to 96 subjects using glucagonlike peptide1 (GLP1) receptor agonists or sodiumglucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors will be enrolled in Study Group B. Diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or other types of diabetes apart from T2DM. Have obvious clinical or radiographic signs or symptoms of liver disease (except nonalcoholic fatty liver disease), cirrhosis, acute or chronic hepatitis, or alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) levels ≥2.5X upper limit of normal (ULN), alkaline phosphatase ≥2X ULN or total bilirubin ≥2X ULN. Have chronic kidney disease Stage 4 and higher or history of renal transplantation. Have history of more than 1 episode of severe hypoglycemia within the 6 months prior to screening. Have received U500R insulin by CSII in the 3 months prior to screening. Have had a blood transfusion or severe blood loss within 3 months prior to screening or have known hemoglobinopathy, hemolytic anemia, or sickle cell anemia. Are taking chronic (lasting longer than 14 consecutive days) systemic glucocorticoid therapy. Have an irregular sleep/wake cycle. Have used any weight loss drugs in the 3 months prior to screening. Have a history of bariatric surgery including RouxenY gastric bypass surgery, gastric banding, and/or gastric sleeve. Have a history of an active or untreated malignancy, or in remission from a clinically significant malignancy during the last 5 years before screening. Significant hearing loss and/or vision impairment deemed by the investigator to interfere with the safe use of OmniPod U500 system. Have cardiac disease with functional status that is New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV per New York Heart Association Cardiac Disease Functional Classification or have congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic treatment. Are women breastfeeding or pregnant, or intend to become pregnant during the course of the study; are men who intend to impregnate their partners; or are sexually active of procreation potential not actively practicing birth control by a method determined by the investigator to be medically acceptable.
