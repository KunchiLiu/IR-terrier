	<brief_summary>The use of long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) is shown to reduce malaria prevalence. The Tanzania Net Voucher Scheme has been an active component of bed net distribution to pregnant women in Tanzania since 2004. The transition from paper vouchers to electronic vouchers in this program has increased efficiency and the ability to track and distribute nets since 2007. Although the program has been successful, to date, electronic voucher redemption varies widely across the country and it has not been clearly established as to what barriers exist for women who receive electronic vouchers in the program. This cluster-randomized trial was designed to examine perceived barriers to electronic voucher redemption among pregnant women and to evaluate if educational and personalized text messages around electronic voucher redemption and bed net usage will increase electronic voucher redemption when directed at pregnant women who receive electronic vouchers in the currently existing program.</brief_summary>
