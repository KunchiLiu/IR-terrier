	<brief_summary>Investigators are evaluating the nutritional role of IAtta supplementation along with nutritional counselling in delaying the progression of cachexia to refractory cachexia in adult cancer Indian patients. Patients will receive IAtta (100 g) or whole wheat flour (100 g) for daily consumption for 6 months. Dietary and physical activity counseling will be imparted every fortnight to patients. Nutritional, biochemical, quality of life and anthropometric estimations will be assessed at baseline, after 3 months and at 6 months of intervention for all patients. Investigators hypothesize that intake of nutrient rich bread mix IAtta (along with dietary and physical activity counselling) for six months will improve the health status and quality of life in free-living patients suffering from cancer cachexia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Nutritional Counselling and "Improved Atta" Supplementation in Cachexic Adult Indian Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomly distributed into two groups i.e. control and intervention group. 75 patients will be allocated in intervention group and receive nutrient rich flour mix i.e. IAtta (100 g) along with dietary and physical activity counseling and 75 patients will be allocated in the control group who will receive whole wheat flour with dietary and physical activity counseling. Intervention group patients will collect 14 packets of 100 g of IAtta every fortnight during their clinician appointments while the control patients will collect 14 packets of 100 g of whole wheat flour at every clinician visit for 6 months. Dietary counseling for 30 minutes will be imparted to all patients on each visit by the nutritionist. Depending on the physical status of the patients, low level of physical activity (walking and/or stairs), will be encouraged daily during counseling sessions. Nutritional, biochemical, quality of life and anthropometric estimations would be assessed at baseline, after 3 months and at 6 months of intervention for all patients.</detailed_description>
