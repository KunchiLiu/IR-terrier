	<brief_title>A Multi-center 12-week Study of HMS5552 in T2DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glucokinase (GK, also called hexokinase IV or D) can phosphosphorylate glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) in pancreatic β-cells and liver cells, which represents the first step of glucose metabolism. GK also acts as a glucose sensor and exerts a key role in maintaining glucose homeostasis. HMS5552 is a 4th-generation GK agonist or activator (GKA), which was originally licensed from Roche and subsequently developed by Hua Medicine. HMS5552 has been shown to activate GK in pancreatic beta cells, liver and intestinal epithelial cells. It regulates systemic blood glucose through a variety of mechanisms including directly enhancing insulin release (pancreas), inhibiting production of endogenous glucose (liver) and by indirectly promoting GLP-1 release (enteroendocrine L-cells).</detailed_description>
