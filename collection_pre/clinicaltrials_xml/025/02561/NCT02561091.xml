	<brief_title>AM-111 in the Treatment of Acute Inner Ear Hearing Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase III study is assessing the drug's safety and is aiming to demonstrate efficacy of intratympanic AM-111 injections in the treatment of severe to profound idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL). The active pharmaceutical ingredient of AM-111 is the JNK inhibitor (D-JNKI-1), a synthetic peptide consisting of 31 D-amino acids, which acts as a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) ligand.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Unilateral ISSNHL with onset within 72 hours prior to study treatment; 2. Mean hearing threshold of equal to or worse than (≥) 60 dB averaged across the 3 most affected contiguous air conduction audiometric pure tone frequencies ("pure tone average", PTA);* 3. Mean hearing loss of equal to or worse than (≥) 40 dB averaged across the air conducted PTA frequencies compared with the unaffected contralateral ear or reference values from a preexisting audiogram or ISO 7029;2000 norm values in case of asymmetric hearing prior to the ISSNHL incident; 4. Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 65 years on the day of screening; Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. 1. Bilateral ISSNHL; 2. Acute hearing loss from noise trauma, barotrauma or head trauma; 3. History of autoimmune hearing loss, radiationinduced hearing loss, endolymphatic hydrops or Menière's disease in the affected ear; 4. History of chronic inflammatory or suppurative ear disease or cholesteatoma in the affected ear; 5. History of acoustic neuroma or other retrocochlear damage in the affected ear; 6. History of otosclerosis in the affected ear; 7. Suspected perilymph fistula or membrane rupture in the affected ear; 8. Congenital hearing loss; 9. History of ISSNHL in the past 2 years; 10. Otitis media or otitis externa that is ongoing or ended within 7 days prior to study treatment; Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
