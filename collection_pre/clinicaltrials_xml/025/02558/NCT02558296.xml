	<detailed_description>Approximately 130 investigative sites globally are planned to participate in this study. An estimated 1650 subjects with inadequately controlled T2DM and an elevated risk of cardiovascular adverse events will be randomized to bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg, or placebo in a ratio of 2:1 in addition to the background anti-diabetic medications. The study is an event-driven trial. The treatment period will end when the last randomized subject has completed at least 52 weeks of treatment and a total of at least 134 subjects have experienced a cardiac event.</detailed_description>
