	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify and quantify circulating tumor markers, which are associated with the presence of tumors. The current imaging available does not allow specificity of tumor size as it relates to pseudoprogression (a temporary enlargement or "swelling" of the tumor after treatment before it shrinks). Our hope is that CTCs will provide a more accurate description of tumor state for high grade glioma patients.</brief_summary>
