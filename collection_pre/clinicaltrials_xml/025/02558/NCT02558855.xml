	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to examine how different physical therapy interventions affect the resting state and contraction state of a certain abdominal muscle in patients with low back pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Thrust Joint Manipulation on the Resting and Contracting Thickness of Transversus Abdominis in Subjects With Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with low back pain (LBP) will undergo ultrasound imaging of the transversus abdominis to measure the muscle thickness at rest and at the contracted state prior to intervention and again immediately after intervention. In this randomized controlled trial, patients will be randomized into one of two groups. One group will receive the intervention of thrust joint manipulation of the lumbar spine and the other group will receive the intervention of non-thrust joint manipulation of the lumbar spine.</detailed_description>
