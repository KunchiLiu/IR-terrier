	<brief_summary>The combination of asthma and being a carrier of genetic variants (mutations and / or polymorphisms) in the CFTR gene variant would cause bronchial asthma with mucus hypersecretion. This phenotype is characterized by a more severe disease, in terms of control, quality of life, exacerbations and lung function, and a different asthma the bronchial hypersecretion without inflammatory phenotype.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Asthma With Hypersecretion-associated Gene for Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: Determine the presence of genetic variants (mutations and / or polymorphisms) of the CFTR gene in patients with asthma with or without bronchial mucus hypersecretion. Secondary objectives: To identify genetic variants (mutations and / or polymorphisms) of the most common CFTR gene in the asthmatic population. -To define the inflammatory phenotype of asthma with bronchial mucus hypersecretion. -To compare the severity, control, quality of life and frequency of exacerbations of asthma patients with or without bronchial mucus hypersecretion</detailed_description>
