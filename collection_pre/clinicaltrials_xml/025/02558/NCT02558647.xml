	<brief_summary>This first aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a cost-effective, more accessible alternative treatment approach for insomniacs. Traditional CBT-I has been adapted to an online intervention system, so individuals can access a personalized treatment when they want. This newly developed web-based computer technology has produced remarkable preliminary results, comparable to the results one can achieve when delivering CBT-I in a face-to-face format. The current project will test this approach for use on a population scale. Of the 13 500 participants reporting symptoms of insomnia in HUNT3, 1500 will be randomized into CBT-I or a placebo control group. The large scale of this trial will allow detailed analyses of subgroups (insomniacs with comorbid conditions), which has not been possible in the previous small clinical trials. The upcoming HUNT4 in 2017-2018 will together with data from FD-Trygd provide unique long-term FU-data on both a range of health parameters and employment status. The second aim is to use the HUNT3 Biobank to examine how genes may be related to insomnia. Our study will also be the first of its kind to examine if genes may predict the outcome for individuals in the treatment study.</brief_summary>
