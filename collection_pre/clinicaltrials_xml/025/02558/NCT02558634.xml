	<brief_summary>Laryngeal Dystonia (LD), also commonly referred to as spasmodic dysphonia, is a neurological voice disorder characterized by involuntary dystonic contractions of the laryngeal muscles. Current treatments such as botox and voice therapy only provide temporary relief and thus, the investigators are exploring new strategies to provide long-term, sustained improvement. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure that involves the implantation of electrodes to deliver electrical stimuli to specific brain regions. It is the standard surgical treatment for many other movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and primary dystonia. This trial has been designed to test the hypothesis that DBS can improve the vocal dysfunction of LD.</brief_summary>
