	<brief_summary>The objective of this clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of an initial triple oral treatment regimen (macitentan, tadalafil, selexipag) versus an initial dual oral treatment regimen (macitentan, tadalafil, placebo) in newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.</brief_summary>
