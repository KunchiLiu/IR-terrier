	<brief_title>European Transplant Registry of Senior Renal Transplant Recipients on Advagraf</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the registry is to establish data on the long-term outcome of elderly renal transplant recipients receiving an initial standard immunosuppression with tacrolimus once daily, mycophenolate and steroids The objectives of this registry are to investigate the long-term course of renal transplantation in the elderly European population (≥65 years) under immunosuppression with tacrolimus once daily, mycophenolate and steroids in order to better define risk factors for patient death and graft loss and predictors for favourable outcomes in this growing population. For this purpose, the SENIOR transplant registry will be implemented to collect data on graft loss, death, renal function, quality of life and biopsy proven acute rejections (BPAR), analyze common complications such as severe infections, opportunistic infections (CMV and/or BKV viremia), malignancies, cardiovascular events, and hospitalisations in a large population of European senior renal allograft recipients. In addition, type and severity of rejections (Banff-grade, steroid resistant rejections, antibody-mediated rejections, antibody-treated rejections, recurrent rejections), development of circulating donor specific antibodies (DSA), cardiovascular risk factors (such as diabetes, development of posttransplant diabetes (PTDM), hypertension), renal function (as estimated by CKD-EPI), and proteinuria will be longitudinally assessed in parallel to immunosuppressive doses and drug levels. The registry will focus on common side effects of immunosuppressive therapy (such as leucopenia, anemia), treatment patterns and reasons for treatment changes. Finally, a prospective analysis of quality of life including the burden of medication in elderly transplant recipients is planned. All recipients (≥65 years) of a kidney transplant who are willing to participate in the European SENIOR-Registry may enter the registry prior to transplantation if they are fulfilling all in- and none of the exclusion criteria and receive the intended initial immunosuppression consisting of tacrolimus once daily (Advagraf, initially adjusted to trough blood levels of ≥5ng/ml), mycophenolate (either ≥1.0g/day Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or ≥720mg/d enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium (EC-MPS)) and Steroids. There will be 12 study visits during the 10 year period. Except for quality of life questionnaires there are no study specific procedures planned. Only data will be recorded which anyway will be recorded in clinical routine. The study population will consist of a representative group of approximately 1000 senior (≥65 years) kidney transplant patients, who receive a renal allograft and an initial standard triple immunosuppression (tacrolimus once daily (Advagraf), mycophenolate (either ≥1.0g/day Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or ≥720mg/d enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium (EC-MPS)) and steroids. The patients will be recruited from approximately 42 transplant centers in Europe.</detailed_description>
