	<brief_summary>Radiofrequency catheter ablation is effective in the treatment of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In order to reduce the recurrence rate after catheter ablation, we propose to apply 'virtual' ablation on patient-specific atria by simulating 3D atrial computer model. We will conduct virtual rotor mapping in the patient specific atrial model. Then, we will compare the clinical outcome of conventional circumferential pulmonary vein isolation and additional rotor ablation guided by virtual rotor mapping.</brief_summary>
