	<brief_summary>Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) strategy is a powerful tool to identify genes implicated in very rare diseases for which the previous genetic explorations remain negative to date. The aim of this project is based on groups of patients with original clinical phenotypes including neurosensory impairment without genetic cause identified to date. The investigators will study these families using whole exome sequencing to potentially identify new genes and new underlying biological pathways involved in neurosensory diseases.</brief_summary>
