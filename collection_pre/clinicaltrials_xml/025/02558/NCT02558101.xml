	<brief_summary>This study tests the impact of a novel invitation strategy on attendance rates to a pre-lung cancer screening lung health check appointment. Patients will be individually randomised (1:1) to receive either control invitation materials or intervention invitation materials. Those who attend will undergo a "lung health check" and be invited to a baseline screening scan if eligibility criteria are fulfilled.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lung Screen Uptake Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer screening using low dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans has been shown to reduce lung cancer-specific and all-cause mortality in a large United States (US) trial, and screening is now being carried out in the US. Studies have shown that participation rates are invariably low, particularly by current smokers and those from socioeconomically deprived backgrounds; groups within which high risk candidates are overrepresented. In this study the investigators aim to improve informed participation in screening and reduce socioeconomic and smoking-related biases in participation. The investigators will identify individuals at high risk of lung cancer; specifically adults aged 60-75 who are current or recent former smokers. Eligible individuals will be invited by their General Practitioner to a "lung health check appointment" via one of two randomly allocated invitation strategies. The control materials will be similar to those used by UK screening programmes for other cancer types. The intervention materials have been designed to reduce barriers to participation among smokers from low socioeconomic status backgrounds. Those that attend will have a lung cancer risk assessment, and if confirmed to be eligible, will undergo a baseline LDCT scan. Data will be collected with respect to demographics, risk and various clinical and radiological outcomes.</detailed_description>
