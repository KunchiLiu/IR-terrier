	<brief_summary>Recently, sorafenib which can target VEGFR and PDGFR demonstrated 13-16% of response rate in patients with recurrent/metastatic salivary gland cancers, suggesting that VEGFR and PDGFR might be important role in salivary gland cancers. Accordingly, several trials with various anti-angiogenic molecular targeted agents such as dasatinib, dovitinib, or sunitinib in salivary gland cancer are ongoing. Nintedanib (BIBF1120) is a potent small molecule triple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (PDGFR/ FGFR1-2 and VEGFR1-3). VEGFR-2 is considered to be the crucial receptor involved in initiation of the formation as well as the maintenance of tumor vasculature. In vitro, the target receptors are all inhibited by nintedanib in low nanomolar concentrations. In in vivo nude mouse models, nintedanib showed good anti-tumor efficacy at doses of 50-100mg/kg, leading to a substantial delay of tumor growth or even complete tumor stasis in xenografts of a broad range of differing human tumors. Based on this background, in this study, the investigators would like to conduct a phase II study of Nintedanib (BIBF 1120) in patients with recurrent or metastatic salivary gland cancer of the head and neck to evaluate efficacy and safety.</brief_summary>
