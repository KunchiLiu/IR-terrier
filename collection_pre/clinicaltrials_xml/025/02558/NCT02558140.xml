	<brief_summary>This first-in-human study consists of three parts. The primary purpose of Part I is to characterize the safety and tolerability of RO6874813 in participants with locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors whose disease has progressed despite standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists. In addition, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) will be determined. In Part II the safety and tolerability of RO6874813 will continue to be characterized in participants with locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors known to be fibroblast activation protein-alpha positive (FAP+). In addition, treatment-induced efficacy effects of RO6874813 will be assessed by functional imaging and paired tumor biopsies. The primary purpose of Part III is to demonstrate anti-tumor activity of RO6874813 in participants with recurrent or metastatic FAP+ sarcomas.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age &gt;= 18 years Part I: Patients with histologically/cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic, nonresectable solid tumors whose disease has progressed despite standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists. Part II: Patients with histologically/ cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic, nonresectable solid tumors known to be fibroblast activation proteinalpha positive (FAP+). Part III: Patients with histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic, nonresectable confirmed FAP+ sarcoma with two or fewer prior regimens for advanced disease. Measurable disease as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. World Health Organization (WHO)/ Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)Performance Status (PS) 01 Recovery from all reversible adverse events (AEs) of previous anticancer therapies to baseline or Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1, except for alopecia (any grade) and Grade &lt;=2 sensory peripheral neuropathy. Negative pregnancy test Primary CNS tumors or CNS tumor involvement. Major surgery or any other prior anticancer treatment within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1. Received widefield radiotherapy &lt;= 4 weeks or limitedfield radiotherapy &lt;=2 weeks prior to starting study drug. Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of RO6874813 or to the contrast agents used in the study Another invasive malignancy in the last 2 years except for those with a minimal risk of metastasis or death. Any other conditions or diseases that would contraindicate participation in the clinical study because of safety concerns or compliance with clinical study procedures.</criteria>
