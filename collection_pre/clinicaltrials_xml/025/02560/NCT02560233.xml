	<detailed_description>The overall goal of the outlined study is to establish an RT-fMRI-NF protocol aiming at modulating neural, endocrine, and subjective reactivity to psychosocial stress. More specifically, the investigators pursue the following goals: a) to evaluate whether neural and subjective stress-reactivity can be modified by training volitional control over targeted brain activity by means of RT-fMRI-NF; b) to evaluate whether neuromodulation by means of RT-fMRI-NF can be used as a new way to modulate hormone-release into the periphery; and c) to evaluate whether the efficacy of neuromodulation by RT-fMRI-NF can also be reflected on EEG data as well as the autonomic nervous system (ANS) measured by heart rate variability (HRV).</detailed_description>
