	<brief_summary>Many ovarian cancer patients have been offered different standard cytostatics and gradually develop chemo-resistance. However, a considerable fraction of these patients are still in good general health and have a strong wish for further treatment. Cabazitaxel (Jevtana®) is a new taxane with effect in breast and prostatic cancer. In both tumors it has shown effect in patients refractory to docetaxel. Therefore, it could be anticipated that cabazitaxel may also have an effect in chemo-resistant ovarian cancer. Tocotrienol is a fraction of the natural E-vitamin with several biological effects, including effect on malignant cells and angiogenesis. The aim of the study is to investigate whether cabazitaxel and tocotrienol could be reasonable treatment options in patients with chemo-resistant and refractory ovarian cancer with regard to effect and toxicity. In case of progression on cabazitaxel there is an option of crossing over to tocotrienol and vice versa.</brief_summary>

Other experimental therapy or participation in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to treatment initiation. History of any chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that is not medically controlled or in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risks associated with study drug administration. (e.g. diabetes, cardiac diseases, hypertension, renal, thyroid or liver disease). Vaccination with yellow fever vaccine or any live attenuated vaccine during the treatment.</criteria>
