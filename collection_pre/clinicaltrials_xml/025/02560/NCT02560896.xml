	<brief_summary>Currently, there is no clear legal or ethical guidance about how researchers and IRBs ought to proceed when the research participant in a biobank is deceased and there is clinically relevant information that could be disclosed to family members. This study is designed to test a procedure offering genetic information to family members of research participants who participated in a pancreatic cancer biobank in a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) -compliant design.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Understanding Genetic Incidental Findings in Your Family (UNIFY Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To develop, prototype, and evaluate a novel procedure for offering probands' genetic results to family members. The intervention is to offer a deceased research participant's actionable germline genetic research finding, and depending upon the choice made by the next of kin, a disclosure of the research finding by a genetic counselor in a family conference call. Using mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative), the investigators will assess decision making, family communication, and actions and responses in individuals from families in which a proband is known to have a deleterious germline mutation in one of several known cancer susceptibility genes.</detailed_description>
