	<brief_title>Analysis of Surface EKG Signals to Identify Myocardial Dysfunction in Patients at Risk for Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Myocardial ischemia is caused by myocardial oxygen supply and demand mismatch. Despite that coronary artery disease (CAD) is the major cause of myocardial ischemia, the symptoms may occur even in the absence of significant CAD. One of the mechanisms suggested for myocardial ischemia in these patients is microvascular ischemia (i.e. mismatch in microscopic vessels), affecting the myocardium (i.e. heart muscle) at the cellular level. A novel electrocardiographic recording method, the iECG is capable of capturing and amplifying signals from the cellular level that are much lower biologic signals than those processed by a traditional electrocardiogram (ECG). These recordings focus on early detection of myocardial abnormalities by non-linear analysis of electrical activity and physiological phenomenon. This novel assessment might be capable of detecting subclinical myocardial dysfunction in a variety of heart diseases. Specific Aims Aim#1: Study the feasibility of detection of CAD using iECG compared to computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTA). Aim#2: Study the association between patterns of iECG and myocardial dysfunction in patients without CAD compared to echocardiography. Aim#3: Study the effect of changes in iECG output on future outcomes of CAD and need for revascularization.</detailed_description>
