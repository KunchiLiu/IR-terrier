	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study to test whether a medication called ramelteon (Brand Name: Remeron) will help smokers quit and whether it reduces sleep problems that smokers experience during a quit attempt.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Ramelteon on Smoking Abstinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ramelteon, an FDA-approved treatment for insomnia, is used to treat sleep problems (e.g., specifically sleep onset latency) by enhancing melatonin receptor function. The investigators propose a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. Fifty chronic smokers will complete a validated procedure for screening new medications. All subjects will receive 8mg ramelteon and placebo. The order in which ramelteon and placebo is received will be randomized across participants. This is a 6-week study consisting of two 2-week medication phases separated by a 2-week washout. Each phase includes 1 week of ad libitum smoking (baseline) and 1 week of medication (ramelteon vs. placebo) plus transdermal nicotine patches while trying to abstain from smoking (quit assessment). Subjects will complete the same procedures during each study phase. Following completion of the study, participants will be offered standard smoking cessation treatment. For the duration of the study, subjects will be asked to keep sleep diaries and to wear an armband while sleeping, which provides objective indices of sleep duration and quality (SensewearPro® armband). The primary outcome will be the total number of days abstinent (out of 5) during each quit assessment period. Intermediate outcomes include sleep onset latency (self-report) and sleep efficiency (SensewearPro®). This study will provide information about the role of the melatonin system during brief abstinence and whether enhancing melatonin reduces abstinence-induced sleep problems that promote smoking relapse. Information obtained in this study may further establish the role of sleep disturbance in promoting smoking relapse.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Smokers who are between 18 and 65 years of age who selfreport smoking at least 10 cigarettes per day for at least the last 6 months. 2. Interest in quitting smoking in the next 2 to 4 months. 3. Healthy as determined by the Study Physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history and physical examination, and psychiatric evaluation. 4. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the combined consent and HIPAA form. 5. Women of childbearing potential must consent to use a medically accepted method of birth control while participating in the study (e.g., condoms and spermicide, oral contraceptive, Depoprovera injection, contraceptive patch, tubal ligation). Smoking Behavior: 1. Current enrollment in a smoking cessation program, or use of other smoking cessation medications in the last month or plans to do either in the next 2 months. 2. Daily use of chewing tobacco, snuff and/or snus, or electronic cigarettes. 3. Provide a carbon monoxide (CO) breath sample reading less than 10 parts per million (ppm) at Intake. Alcohol/Drugs: 1. Selfreport current alcohol consumption that exceeds 25 standard drinks/week over the past 6 months. Subjects will be told to limit or avoid the use of alcohol while in the study to avoid any adverse reactions to the study medication. 2. Selfreports substance use disorders (abuse or dependence involving alcohol, opiates, cocaine or other stimulants, or benzodiazepines; not nicotine) in the last 6 months. 3. Providing a breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) reading of greater than or equal to 0.01 during any session. 4. A positive urine drug screen for cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, PCP, methadone, barbiturates, marijuana, ecstasy (MDMA), oxycodone, tricyclic antidepressants, and opiates (low level cutoff 300 ng/mL) during any session. Psychiatric Exclusion (as determined by selfreport on phone screen and/or through MINI during Intake): 1. Current psychiatric disorders (depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, hypomanic/manic episode) as determined by selfreport and/or MINI psychological interview. 2. Past history of psychiatric disorders (including suicide attempt) other than depression as determined by selfreport and/or MINI psychological interview. 3. Suicide risk score on MINI greater than 1. Medical: 1. Females who are currently pregnant, planning a pregnancy during the study, or currently breastfeeding/lactating. All female subjects shall undergo a urine pregnancy test at the Intake and must agree in writing to use an approved method of contraception. Following enrollment, pregnancy tests will be conducted at the beginning of each baseline week. 2. For those with a history of jaundice/liver disease: liver function tests more than 20% outside of the normal range; Gammaglutamyl Transpepsidase (GGT) values more than 20% outside of the normal range. If Albumin/Globulin ratios are 20% outside of normal range the abnormal value will be evaluated for clinical significance by the Study Physician and eligibility will determined on a casebycase basis. 3. Heart/Cardiovascular disease (e.g., angina, coronary heart disease, stroke, etc.) in the past 6 months. 4. Endocrine or metabolic disorders (e.g., TypeI diabetes). 5. Blood disorders (e.g., anemia or hemophilia). 6. Uncontrolled hypertension (BP systolic greater than 159 and/or diastolic greater than 99)*. 7. Clinically significant dyssomnia (except insomnia; e.g. sleep apnea syndrome, narcolepsy). Participants presenting with SBP greater than 159 mmHg and/or DBP greater than 99 mmHg at the Intake visit will be instructed to sit quietly for 10 minutes. Then the participant will have a second blood pressure reading taken after a 10 minute period. If, after the second reading the SBP greater than 159 mmHg and the DBP greater than 99 mmHg, the individual will be instructed to sit comfortably for 10 minutes and then have a third blood pressure reading. If, after the third reading the SBP greater than 159 mmHg and the DBP greater than 99 mmHg, the individual will be ineligible to participate. Medication: 1. Current use or recent discontinuation (within the past month) of any of the following medications: 1. Antianxiety or panic disorder medications (e.g., clonazepam, alprazolam). 2. Antipsychotic medications (e.g., thorazine, Seroquel). 3. Moodstabilizers (e.g., Lithium, Lamictal/lamotrigine, valproic acid, Neurontin/gabapentin, Topamax/topiramate, Tegretol/carbamazepine). 4. Prescription stimulants (e.g., Provigil, Ritalin, Adderall). 5. Medications contraindicated with ramelteon (e.g., fluvoxamine, buprenorphine or other medications metabolized by certain cytochrome P450 enzymes) 2. Current use or recent discontinuation (within the past 2 weeks) of any of the following medications (subjects must agree to refrain from using any other sleep aids while enrolled in the study): 1. Sleep medications (e.g., zolpidem/Ambien, eszopiclone/Lunesta) 2. Overthecounter sleep aids (e.g., melatonin, diphenhydramine/Benadryl) 3. Daily use of opiatecontaining medications for chronic pain (Duragesic/fentanyl patches, Percocet, Oxycontin). Smokers who report taking opiatecontaining medications on an "asneeded" basis will be instructed to refrain from use until their study participation is over and that they will be tested to ensure they have complied with this requirement. 4. Known allergy to study medication (e.g., angioedema). Subjects will be instructed to refrain from using any study prohibited drugs/medications (both recreational and prescription) throughout their participation in the study. After final eligibility is confirmed, subjects who report taking contraindicated medication(s) over the course of the study period may only remain eligible if the Study Physician and/or Principal Investigator determines that the contraindicated medication(s) do/did not impact the study design, data quality, and/or subject safety/welfare. Subjects are permitted to take necessary prescription medications not included within the exclusion list during the study. General Exclusion: 1.
