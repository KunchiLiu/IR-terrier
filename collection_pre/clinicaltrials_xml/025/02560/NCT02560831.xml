	<brief_summary>Knee Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease associated with muscle weakness, arthralgia, rigidity and postural instability. Therapeutic exercise can reduce pain and improve muscle strength and postural balance, however benefits from association with pompage is not known. This study aims to evaluate the effects of therapeutic exercise on pain, muscle strength and postural balance in elderly women with knee osteoarthritis. Methodology: Almost randomized controlled trial, in which were included elderly between 60 and 80 years diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis, randomized into two groups with 11 participants each. Intervention group held strengthening exercises for flexors and knee extensors, balance training, and manual knee pompage for 12 weeks. Control Group received educational lectures. Arthralgia was estimated by pain subscale of the questionnaire Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and (WOMAC); muscle strength was assessed by the isokinetic dynamometer HUMACÂ® NORM Testing &amp; Rehabilitation System and the postural balance by the Biodex Balance SD postural stability protocol (Biodex Medical Systems, Inc. New York, USA). The Student t test was used for statistical analysis.</brief_summary>
