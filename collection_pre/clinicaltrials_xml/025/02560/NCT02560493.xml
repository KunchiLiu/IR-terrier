	<detailed_description>The GAMESQUAD study is a 6-month, 2-arm randomized controlled trial among 46 overweight/obese children (aged 10 to 12 years) assigned to: 1) 3 hours/week of in-home exergaming or 2) a control group. An innovative aspect is the inclusion of a fitness trainer who will regularly video chat with the participant and virtually monitor gameplay. The study will advance the field by: 1) establishing the efficacy of exergaming to reduce BMIz among overweight and obese children and 2) demonstrating the potential of exergaming to reduce body fat and improve children's cardiovascular health.</detailed_description>
