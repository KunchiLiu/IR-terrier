	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography in patients with cardiomyopathy (HCM) can detect resting hypo-perfusion due to fibrosis or stress induced perfusion defects due to associated abnormalities in intramyocardial arteries and the microcirculation. A secondary aim will be to determine whether abnormalities in perfusion are associated with either severity of symptoms (chest pain and dyspnea), presence of arrhythmias, and regional function of the septum.</brief_summary>
