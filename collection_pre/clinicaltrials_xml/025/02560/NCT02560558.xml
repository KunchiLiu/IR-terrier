	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to transition patients who have been stable on Belatacept for one year after kidney transplant from standard 4-week to an investigational 8-week belatacept dosing schedule. The investigators hypothesize that renal function and acute rejection rates will be non-inferior with 8-week belatacept dosing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bela 8 Week Dosing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current dosing protocol for patients who have undergone a kidney transplant requires that Belacept be given as an infusion every 4 weeks. The investigator wants to assess if the patients who have been stable for one year after transplant can be safely transitioned to an 8-week Belatacept infusion schedule. Renal function and any episodes of acute rejection will be closely monitored.</detailed_description>
