	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and potential therapeutic benefit of use of clazosentan in reversing cerebral vasospasm (a narrowing of blood vessels in the brain due to the presence of blood in the space around the brain) in patients who have suffered a condition known as aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by bleeding onto the surface of the brain from a ruptured brain aneurysm</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Clazosentan in Reversing Cerebral Vasospasm in Adult Subjects With Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is characterized by bleeding onto the brain surface due to a rupture of a pouch or bulge in a brain vessel (called an aneurysm). It is a rare but serious condition with a high risk of death. Even patients who have had successful repair of the aneurysm remain at risk for developing cerebral vasospasm, which can result in harmful conditions related to the lack of oxygen to parts of the brain and death. Cerebral vasospasm usually occurs within the first couple of weeks after aSAH, and it is difficult to treat. Currently there is no safe, efficacious and widely available treatment. Previous animal studies have shown that a new drug under investigation, clazosentan, was able to reverse cerebral vasospasm in animal models of SAH. A first trial conducted in a small number of patients showed some benefit of clazosentan in reversing established cerebral vasospasm after aSAH. Clazosentan has already been evaluated in the prevention of cerebral vasospasm in several large clinical trials in aSAH. This current study aims to evaluate if clazosentan is effective and safe in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm after aSAH.</detailed_description>
