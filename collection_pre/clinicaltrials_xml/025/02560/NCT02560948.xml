	<criteria>Key Allergy diagnosis: A medical history of moderate to severe seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (SARC) for the grass pollen season during at least the two previous seasons (definition of allergy severity according to ARIA (Bousquet et al 2001)) A positive skin prick test (SPT wheal diameter ≥ 3 mm) to grass pollen mixture, histamine wheal ≥ 3 mm, NaCl control reaction &lt; 2 mm Specific IgE against grass pollen (with recombinant allergens g213) &gt; 0.7 kU/L Positive response to CPT with at least 10,000 SQE/mL of grass allergens Patients treated with antiallergic medication for at least 2 grass pollen seasons prior to enrollment For asthmatic patients: confirmed diagnosis of controlled asthma according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines (steps 13, GINA 2014) Key Previous immunotherapy with grass allergens within the last 5 years Ongoing immunotherapy with grass allergens or any other allergens Patients with a history of anaphylaxis, including food (e.g. peanut or marine animals) or hymenoptera venom (e.g. bee or wasp stings) or medication (e.g. penicillin) Patients with partly controlled or uncontrolled asthma according to GINA guidelines (GINA 2014) Patients with chronic asthma or emphysema, particularly with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) &lt; 80% of the predicted value (ECSC) or with a peak expiratory flow (PEF) &lt; 70% of the individual optimum value Patients symptomatic to inhaled allergens circulating during the grass pollen season (specific to each country: e.g. birch, hazel, mugwort, ragweed, olive, Alternaria alternata) Patients symptomatic to perennial inhaled allergens (house dust mites, cat, dog) to which the patients are regularly exposed</criteria>
