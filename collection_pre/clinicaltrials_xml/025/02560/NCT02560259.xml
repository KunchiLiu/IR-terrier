	<brief_title>The Role of Referred Pain From the Retro Trochanteric Region in Patients With Knee Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Knee pain is a great problem in the society. Besides obvious and known causes, for which there are increasing understanding and ways to treat, there is still a rather large group of patients in which the symptoms are not easily understood and harder to treat. This group is often characterized by having symptoms ranging from months to years, having seen several physicians, gone through several x-rays/mriÂ´s, and various treatment with no help. The investigators find ever more suspicion towards specific mechanisms in the hip region as a source of knee pain. It is well known in pediatric medicine that children with serious disease in the hip often debut with knee pain. This relationship is not so well established in adults. Pain in the lower extremity can arise from inflammation or strain of the retro trochanteric muscles, and/or more indirectly if these processes impact the sciatic nerve. The later explanation is commonly known as the piriformis syndrome. Professor Oddmund Johansen has studied this type of pain extensively. In the later years he has found interest in patients with knee pain. These patients will often have pain with deep palpation to the posterior hip region, when tightening the hip rotators with flexion and adduction, and they will often respond with pain relief, within minutes, when local anesthesia is placed on the distal attachment of the hip rotators on the posterior margin of the greater trochanter. Afterwards, lasting pain relief can be seen with a specified stretching regiment for these muscles. The investigators will recruit suiting patients from a knee referral list. Inclusion will be based on clinical examination and whether they respond to the injection. After inclusion they will be scored with pain and quality of life forms, randomised in two groups, one with a stretching regime and one with conservative and symptomatic treatment. There is interest in defining and quantifying this sub group of knee patients. They will be followed up after 3 months, with a new examination and scoring to evaluate the effect of the intervention. The study will examine how the patients react and comply with the proposed diagnosis and treatment. A cost analysis will also be considered.</detailed_description>
