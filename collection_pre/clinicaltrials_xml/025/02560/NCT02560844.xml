	<detailed_description>Baseline ECG markers of electrical instability will be measured in patients with cardiomyopathy. These ECG markers will be evaluated from a clinical Holter recording. All patients will have a primary implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) as part of their clinical care. Patients will be followed prospectively for 2 years to evaluate the primary outcome of appropriate ICD shocks. Multivariable modelling will be performed to determine whether the ECG markers of electrical instability independently predict the primary clinical outcome.</detailed_description>
