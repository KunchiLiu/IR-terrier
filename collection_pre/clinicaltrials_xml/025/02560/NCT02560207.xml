	<brief_summary>This study evaluates target attainment after either intermittent intravenous bolus or intravenous continuous infusion of cefotaxime in critically ill patients. Critically ill patients will be randomized to intermittent infusion or continuous infusion of cefotaxime.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial of Continuous Versus Intermittent Cefotaxime Infusion on ICU.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Critically ill patients have other pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles than healthy volunteers. Suboptimal, both under- and overdosing of antibiotics is an important threat in this patient category. Given the time-dependent character of beta-lactam antibiotics continuous dosing as opposed to traditional intermittent dosing is likely to render better target attainment and maintenance and might improve clinical outcome.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Admitted to intensive care Able to give informed consent by themselves or informed consent can be obtained via next of kin Indication for treatment with cefotaxime (as judged by treating physician) in the context of our standard treatment protocol of Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD). Renal replacement therapy Contraindication for cefotaxime, including known or suspected allergy to cefotaxime No indication for an arterial line; an arterial line will not be placed solely for the purpose of this study; thus, only patients with an indication for an arterial line outside this protocol are eligible.</criteria>
