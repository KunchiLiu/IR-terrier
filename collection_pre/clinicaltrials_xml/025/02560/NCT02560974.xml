	<brief_summary>This study will compare capecitabine/oxaliplatin as adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation alone in chemotherapy-naive participants who have undergone potentially curative resection for gastric cancer. Participants will be randomized to either the chemotherapy arm or the observation arm. Capecitabine will be administered orally, 1000 milligrams per meter-squared (mg/m^2) twice daily (BID) on Days 1 to 15 of a 3-week cycle, for 8 cycles, and oxaliplatin will be administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion, 130 mg/m^2 every 3 weeks for 8 cycles. The anticipated time on study treatment in 6 months and the target sample size is 1024 individuals.</brief_summary>
