	<brief_summary>The prevalence of acute and chronic groin injuries in athletes is between 5 and 10 %. This observational case-control study follows three contact sport teams (soccer, ice-hockey and bandy) for two years to find out the prevalence and reasons for groin pain. Clinical examination, pain scores and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are performed. Hip and groin questionnaire (HAGOS) is used to determine severity of groin injuries.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prevalence of chronic groin pain in athletes and physically active adults is between 5 and 10 %.

Adult (&gt;18 years old) male athletes with acute or chronic groin pain during the study pediod are included. Outcome measures are clinical examination, pain scores, exact diagnosis and repeated pelvic MRI (two times) are performed in each patients and three control atheletes in each team.
