	<brief_summary>Major liver resection is associated with substantial intraoperative blood loss. Blood loss in elective liver surgery is a significant factor of perioperative morbidity and mortality, as well as possibly long-term oncologic outcome. The purpose of this study is to use whole blood phlebotomy to decrease the central venous pressure, resulting in a state of relative hypovolemia. It is hypothesized that this intervention will lead to a decrease in blood loss at the time of liver resection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phlebotomy to Prevent Blood Loss in Major Hepatic Resections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major liver resection is associated with significant intraoperative blood loss. Blood loss in elective liver surgery is a key determinant of perioperative morbidity and mortality, as well as possibly long-term oncologic outcome. Whole blood phlebotomy is a simple intervention, whose aim is to decrease the central venous pressure yielding a state of relative hypovolemia and thus lead to decreased blood loss. Small studies, mostly from the liver transplant literature, would suggest that phlebotomy with controlled hypovolemia can result in decreased blood loss and blood transfusion. Since blood loss is an important issue in liver surgery, and the benefits of phlebotomy and controlled hypovolemia are unknown in liver resection patients, a rigorously conducted trial in a representative population of patients undergoing liver resection is warranted, and feasible. In this proposal, it is hypothesized that by the use of phlebotomy and controlled hypovolemia, it is possible to decrease blood loss and blood transfusions. To test this hypothesis the investigators plan to randomly allocate participants to phlebotomy plus standard of care or to standard of care. Participants will be those patients undergoing elective major liver resection at the Ottawa Hospital for any indication. The primary outcome will be intraoperative blood loss. Secondary outcomes will include transfusion requirements, perioperative morbidity and mortality, safety, physiologic parameters, and feasibility elements. A total of 62 patients will be randomized. The efficacy of phlebotomy in terms of blood loss prevention will be assessed.</detailed_description>
