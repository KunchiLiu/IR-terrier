	<brief_summary>The study is a single-center, double blinded, randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the effects of focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy (fESWT) on Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) of the non-dominant biceps brachialis muscle in healthy voluntary adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Focused Shock Wave in the Release od Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty-five participants agreed to participate and signed a written informed consent. After enrollment, muscle soreness was induced and participants were subsequently randomized to receive either (1) focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy (Verum), (2) sham shock wave (Sham) or (3) no treatment (Control). Thereafter, treatments were administered once, only. Measures were repeated after the treatment and at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Main outcome parameter was the pain intensity at rest and in movement as assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) in the elbow region of the non-dominant arm. Secondary outcome included the pressure pain threshold (PPT) over the biceps muscle belly, the maximum isometric voluntary force (MIVF) of the elbow flexors and the assessing the impairment of activities of the daily living. Participants were followed-up 72 hours after the induction of Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness.</detailed_description>
