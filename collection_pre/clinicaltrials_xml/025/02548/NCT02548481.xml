	<brief_summary>Every year in France, from 100 000 to 145 000 people are affected by a stroke. 75% patients survived with aftereffects, in particular aphasic disorders. A sketch of a new tool called BESTA aiming to a rapid handover to the acute phase post stroke had been worked out. After a meeting, 13 multidisciplinary experts have discussed, adjusted and a new complete tool (BESTA) had been created in order to evaluate the different states of aphasia. The goal of this study is the validation and the standardization of this new BESTA tool.</brief_summary>
