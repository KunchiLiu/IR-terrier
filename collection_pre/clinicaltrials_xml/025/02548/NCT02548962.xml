	<brief_summary>Phase 1 will be an open-label, dose finding, multicenter study of ibrutinib in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Phase 2b will be conducted as a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of ibrutinib or placebo, in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Ibrutinib in Combination With Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is an enzyme that is present in hematopoietic cells other than T cells and is necessary for downstream signal transduction from various hematopoietic receptors including the B cell receptor as well as some Fc, chemokine, and adhesion receptors, and is crucial for both B cell development and osteoclastogenesis. Although down-regulated in normal plasma cells, Btk is highly expressed in the malignant cells from many myeloma patients and some cell lines. Ibrutinib is a potent and specific inhibitor of Btk currently in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. The current study is designed and intended to determine the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.</detailed_description>
