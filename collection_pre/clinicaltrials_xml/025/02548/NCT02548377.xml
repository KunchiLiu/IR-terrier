	<brief_summary>The purpose of the trial is to investigate, if remote ischemic preconditioning reduces the risk of complications in patients undergoing resection of head and neck cancer and immediate reconstruction with autologous free tissue transfer. Remote ischemic preconditioning is a treatment, which is carried out by inducing brief episodes of upper arm occlusion using an inflatable tourniquet. Blood samples will be taken during the operation and postoperatively to evaluate the effects of remote ischemic preconditioning. These blood samples will be analyzed for clotting properties and markers of inflammation. Furthermore, effects on the blood supply of the transferred tissue flap will be measured by infrared thermography. Effects on surgical complication rates will be obtained by clinical follow-up and patient chart review.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically verified or clinically suspected malignant tumor in the oral cavity, maxillae, mandible, pharynx, larynx, and/or esophagus. Will undergo tumor resection and immediate free flap reconstruction at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. The reconstruction is planned with a single free flap. Arterial and/or venous thromboembolism within the last three months. The reconstruction is planned with more than one free flap.</criteria>
