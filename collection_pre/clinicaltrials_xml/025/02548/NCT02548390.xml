	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, Phase I/Ib, dose escalation study of intravenous RXDX-107 administered to subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study is designed to explore the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity of RXDX-107 and to define a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)</brief_summary>

ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. 4. Life expectancy of at least 3 months. 5. Received the last dose of previous treatment / therapy before Day 1 of cycle 1: 28 days for cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, whole brain radiotherapy, anticonvulsive therapy, stereotactic radiosurgery and major surgery 42 days for nitrosureas, mitomycin C, and liposomal anthracycline 14 days for noncytotoxic cancer therapies and radiotherapy 6. Recovered from all toxic effects (excluding alopecia) of any prior anticancer therapy to Grade â‰¤ 1 or to the baseline laboratory values. 7. Adequate organ function and baseline laboratory values 8. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy Phase 1b: Patient must have measurable disease 1. Receiving other experimental therapy 2. Known symptomatic brain mets or leptomeningeal involvement 3. Myocardial infarction in the previous 12 weeks. Active ischemia or any other uncontrolled cardiac condition such as angina pectoris, significant cardiac arrhythmia requiring therapy, uncontrolled hypertension, or CHF. 4. Another concurrent illness which would preclude study conduct and assessment, uncontrolled: medical condition, active infection, risk of bleeding, diabetes mellitus, or pulmonary disease, or alcoholic liver disease, or primary biliary cirrhosis. 5.
