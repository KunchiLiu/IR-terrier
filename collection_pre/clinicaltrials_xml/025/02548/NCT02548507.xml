	<brief_summary>Background : Nocturnal leg cramps (NLC) are defined as painful involuntary contractions of the lower limbs occurring during prolonged periods of rest, typically during the night. They may cause severe pain and sleep disturbance, and are particularly common among older adults, though they can occur in all decades of life. They are frequently unreported to physicians. To the investigators' knowledge, no epidemiological studies have been conducted in Switzerland, but in a general population survey carried out in the UK (n=233), the overall prevalence of NLC was 37% and the disorder was more prevalent in older subjects (&gt;80 years old: 54%). Of those who experienced NLC, 40% had cramps three or more times per week and 6% nightly. Another study performed in older US veterans (n=515) showed that 56% suffered from NLC. The precise cause of these cramps is unclear. Most NLC occurring in adults appear to be idiopathic, but potential contributing factors include low levels of certain minerals, extracellular fluid volume depletion and prolonged sitting or inappropriate leg position during sedentary activity. Research question : What are the prevalence and the main features of NLC in patients consulting primary care physicians (PCPs) in Geneva, and how do PCPs treat this affection? Primary objective : To compute the prevalence of NLC in patients consulting PCPs in Geneva, explore its main features (number, duration, severity and sleep disturbance) and assess how PCPs treat this affection. Study design : Prospective observational study using questionnaire and daily log completed by patients.</brief_summary>
