	<brief_summary>Dyslipidemia, is a cardiovascular risk factor of great importance whose prevalence has increased over the last decade. Part of the components of metabolic syndrome and consensus so far contemplated to increased triglycerides and reduced HDL-C as part of the elements for classification, which includes mixed dyslipidemia. Currently fibrates, such as bezafibrate, are drugs whose utility in treating hypertriglyceridemia is fully proven, besides reducing the risk of coronary disease. However, although this treatment is safe, it is not without risks; with increased prevalence of adverse effects as the dose thereof is increased or joins combination with a statin drug for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia long term. Among the alternative therapies is berberine, which to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides may be useful in combination with the bezafribrato in the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia and as an option with lower cost and lower frequency of adverse events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Administration of the Combination Bezafibrate More Berberine on Lipid Profile in Patients With Dyslipidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical trial, double-blind, simple random assignment and parallel groups. Three study groups of patients will be between 30-60 years of age diagnosed with mixed dyslipidemia with failure to control medical nutrition therapy, which by simple random assignment with random numbers will be assigned to one of three groups: 1. 20 patients will receive berberine, 1500 mg / day 2. Patients receive 20 bezafibrate 400 mg / day 3. 20 patients will receive combination of berberine (1500 mg / day) plus bezafibrate (400 mg / day) They were determined before and after the intervention: lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, LDL-C, VLDL), weight, BMI, waist circumference, glucose, blood pressure, tolerability. Statistical analysis was performed upon the sample of subjects. Before starting the statistical analysis of the groups will proceed to verify the behavior of the distribution of the variables included by Z Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit. The distribution of all the variables under this test is cataloged in normal or not normal, which define the type of statistical test would be performed (parametric or non-parametric). However, based on the sample size, non-parametric tests will be those considered most suitable for application. The data obtained will be expressed and presented using measures of central tendency and dispersion for quantitative (mean and standard deviation) variables and qualitative variables are expressed as frequencies and percentages.</detailed_description>
