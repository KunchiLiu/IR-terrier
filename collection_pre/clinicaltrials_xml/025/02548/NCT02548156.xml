	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the impact of formulation differences on fluoride retention clearance with US levels of fluoride (1150 ppm of fluoride) by evaluating and comparing between treatments the concentrations of fluoride and calcium ions in saliva over 60 minutes after a single brushing with US marketed fluoridated dentifrices and following a dietary acid challenge post 60 minutes of brushing with study treatment.</brief_summary>
