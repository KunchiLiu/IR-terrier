	<brief_title>Enhancing Physical Activity and Weight Reduction Through Smartcare and Financial Incentives</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To test the feasibility and potential impact of smartcare with or without financial incentives, the study employed a three-arm, open label randomized controlled trial design: control, smartcare, and smartcare plus financial incentives. The investigators hypothesized that the 'smartcare + financial incentive' arm will show the greatest change in outcomes, followed by the 'smartcare' only arm, and lastly the control arm. Specific aims of the study are as follows: - To quantify the effectiveness of a 'smartcare' intervention to promote physical activity and reduce weight over a 12 week period. - To quantify the incremental effectiveness of adding financial incentives to 'smartcare' intervention</detailed_description>
