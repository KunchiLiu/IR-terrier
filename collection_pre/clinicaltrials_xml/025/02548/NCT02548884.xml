	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare two different techniques (pancreatic sphincterotomy (PS) and double wire technique (DGW)) regarding the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) and the success of cannulation in difficult cannulation. For the study, the difficult cannulation is de-fined as situation when the common bile duct has not been cannulated in five minutes, after five attempts or after two pancreatic guide wire passages or when any of those limits is exceeded. The two techniques, the PS and the DGW, will be compared in random fashion. The primary end-point is the risk of PEP .</brief_summary>
