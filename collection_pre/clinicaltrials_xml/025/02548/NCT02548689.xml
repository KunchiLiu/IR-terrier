	<brief_summary>This study will investigate whether subjects who suffer from hair loss have increased levels of PAI-1 compared to age-matched control subjects. The level of PAI-1 expression will be determined in subjects without hair loss and in subjects with non-scarring hair loss, including androgenetic alopecia, telogen effluvium and alopecia areata.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PAI-1 Expression in Non-scarring Hair Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will compare the levels of PAI-1 expression in subjects with different forms of non-scarring hair loss and in these subjects vs normal age-matched controls. Hair loss subjects will have their Northwestern Memorial Hospital and Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation medical records reviewed to ensure they meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. All subjects will have a 4 mm punch biopsy on the scalp. Tissue PAI-1 levels from scalp skin biopsies will be determined by immunohistochemical staining. Samples will be kept for approximately 15 years, after which time unused samples will be destroyed.</detailed_description>
