	<brief_title>Effect of Mirror Therapy Versus Bilateral Arm Training for Rehabilitation After Chronic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study background: Approximately 80% of stroke survivors have an upper and/or lower limb impairment (Barker 1997), and impairment of the arm explains up to 50% of the variance in functional limitation after stroke. Brain imaging research using magnetoencephalography found that mirror therapy combined with bilateral arm training could potentially aid stroke rehabilitation by normalizing an asymmetrical pattern of movement-related beta desynchronization in primary motor cortex. However, different neural mechanisms may cause different effect of motor control recovery after the two different approaches, which have yet to be studied. Study purpose：To compare the efficacy of mirror therapy and bilateral arm training on movement strategies of the affected upper extremity and functional outcome in chronic stroke patients. Study method: This was a single-blind, randomized, comparative efficacy research. Sixty participants with chronic stroke will be recruited in China medical university hospital and randomly assigned to the mirror therapy and bilateral arm training groups. The intervention will consist of 1.5 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 4 wks, including 3 days of hospital-based therapy and 5 days of home treatments. Primary outcomes were muscular properties (muscle tone and stiffness) and sensorimotor measurements. Secondary outcomes included measures of daily functions and acceleration to gain insight about movement capabilities. The validity and reliability of all measurements have been proposed. Finally, Chi-square test, Analysis of variance and Analysis of covariance will be used to compare the significant differences in mean values between the two approaches. Partial η2 will be reported also for the effect size of dependent variables.</detailed_description>
