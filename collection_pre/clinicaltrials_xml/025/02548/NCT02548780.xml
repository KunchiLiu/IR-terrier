	<brief_title>LifePearl-Doxo Pharmacokinetic (PK) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre, prospective dose escalation/PK study, designed to assess the clinical performance of LifePearl™ beads loaded with Doxorubicin in the primary treatment of unresectable HCC by chemoembolization. Data from this study will be used as supportive data post CE-mark approval. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of LifePearl™ beads loaded with Doxorubicin in the treatment of patients with unresectable liver cancer (HCC) by chemoembolization. This will be measured as treatment-related complications and plasma levels of Doxorubicin in peripheral blood. In addition, objective tumour response will be assessed by computed tomography or MRI. Two cohorts of patients will be evaluated: Cohort I to assess safety (dose escalation) and pharmacokinetic profile; Cohort II will assess pharmacokinetic profile, safety and efficacy with the doxorubicin dose determined with Cohort I.</detailed_description>
