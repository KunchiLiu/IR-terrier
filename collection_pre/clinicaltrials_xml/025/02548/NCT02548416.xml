	<brief_summary>Atelectasis is common during and after general anaesthesia and a number of interventions have been suggested in order to prevent their formation. The use of Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) during general anaesthesia has in recent years been questioned. The investigators hypothesize that the use of PEEP as a single intervention improves oxygenation and prevents atelectasis as investigated by computed tomography compared to a control group with zero PEEP.</brief_summary>
