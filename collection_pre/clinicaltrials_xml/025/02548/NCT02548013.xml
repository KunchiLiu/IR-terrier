	<brief_title>Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes, Outpatient Management vs Inpatient Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Now the current practice is to manage patients with PPROM at hospital, however it is not known yet whether this practice is better than outpatient management as regard maternal and neonatal outcome. There is some recent evidence that home management of PPROM is safe for both mother and neonate, home management is also more convenient with less expenses.</detailed_description>
