	<brief_title>Clinical Validation of a Novel Classification for Predicting Surgical Complexity in Mandibular Wisdom Teeth Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The extraction of mandibular impacted wisdom teeth is the most widespread surgical procedure performed in oral surgery. There are many situations indicating the extraction of those teeth as well as risks and protective factors that may contraindicate it. A reliable classification predicting the complexity of the surgical procedure and the related risk of complications would greatly help the surgeon in the diagnostic phase. The aim of the study is to evaluate if the classification proposed by Juodzbalys and Daugela in 2013 could be effective in predicting the complexity of impacted mandibular third molars surgical extraction, and to compare its effectiveness with commonly used Pell and Gregory, Winter classifications. A blind expert surgeon will assess postoperatively all CBCTs (Cone beam computed tomographies) and OPGs (orthopantomographs) not older than 12 months, and will assign the score for each extracted tooth for the three classification (Juodzbalys and Daugela - Pell and Gregory - Winter). Duration of the surgical procedure, assessment of the surgical technique and of intra- and post-operative complications will be considered as the main parameters to evaluate surgical difficulty. VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) pain score and NSAID (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) pills count taken by each patient of the 7 days postoperative period will be also evaluated. Statistical unit analyzed will be the single tooth. It should be noted that if a single patient has a bilateral impacted tooth to be extracted it will be randomly selected only one to be analyzed. Patients will be divided into two groups according to Juodzbalys and Daugela classification score (x&lt;9≤y), two groups according to each predicted extraction difficulty to Pell Gregory (x&lt;Class 2B≤y) and Winter (x&lt;Horizontal impaction≤y) classifications.</detailed_description>
