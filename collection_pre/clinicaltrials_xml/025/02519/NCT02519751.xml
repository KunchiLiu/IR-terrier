	<brief_summary>Creatine (methyl-d3) dilution (D3-creatine) is a novel technique for the estimation of muscle mass. The method uses a dose of deuterium-labelled creatine to determine total skeletal muscle mass via estimation of total body creatine pool size.The aim of this study is to compare estimates of total body skeletal muscle mass by D3-creatine dilution method and whole body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in an athletic population.</brief_summary>
