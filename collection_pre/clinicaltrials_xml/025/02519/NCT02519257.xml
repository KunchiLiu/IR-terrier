	<brief_summary>Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process in which immune mechanisms interact with metabolic risk factors to initiate, propagate, and activate lesions in the arterial trees and is known as the main cause of coronary artery disease (CAD). Recently, there are more and more studies highlighted the potential importance of adipose tissue in relation to inflammation effects on CAD pathogenesis. However, it remains unclear whether Thy-1, adiponectin or any other inflammatory mediators in mediastinal adipose tissue contribute to CAD. In this study, we aim to analyze the expression of inflammatory mediators' expression via in vitro assay (3T3-L1 cell culture) and in vivo assay (human adipose tissues).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In addition, we'd like to investigate the association of the investigators' findings with clinical atherosclerotic risks, medications (statins or antiplatelet), and blood sugar. Now, we've established cell assay and successfully transformed mature adipocyte from 3T3-L1 cells. Besides, there were nighty-six patients enrolled into this study. Flow cytometry of Thy-1 and MCP-1 concentration in cultured medium by ELISA were also analyzed.</detailed_description>
