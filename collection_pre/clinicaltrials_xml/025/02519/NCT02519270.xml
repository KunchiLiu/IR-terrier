	<brief_summary>A Phase 1, Open-Label, Dose-Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Intravenous Doses of IGN002 Administered Weekly to Subjects with Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1, Dose-Escalation Study of IGN002 in NHL Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label, non-randomized, first-in-human Phase 1 study involves two stages: In the Dose-Escalation Stage, ascending dose cohorts will be treated in 2 periods until the maximum tolerated dose is identified. In Period 1, subjects will receive 2 doses of IGN002 administered weekly. In Period 2, subjects will receive up to 24 additional doses of IGN002 administered weekly in three 8-week cycles. Subjects that have not progressed following the treatment period will be followed for another 6 months. In the Expansion Stage, subjects will receive up to 24 doses of IGN002 at the identified maximum tolerated dose administered weekly in three 8-week cycles. Subjects that have not progressed following the treatment period will be followed for another 6 months.</detailed_description>
