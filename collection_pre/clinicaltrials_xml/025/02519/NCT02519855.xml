	<brief_summary>The study evaluated immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of ZOSTAVAX™ Vaccine (V211) administered concomitantly versus nonconcomitantly with Quadrivalent Influenza Virus vaccine (inactivated) in participants ≥50 years of age. The primary hypotheses tested 1) the noninferiority of concomitant versus nonconcomitant vaccination with regard to Varicella zoster virus (VZV) Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) antibody responses, 2) the acceptability of geometric mean fold rise in VZV antibody response after concomitant vaccination, and 3) the noninferiority of concomitant versus nonconcomitant vaccination with regard to influenza virus strain-specific GMT antibody responses.</brief_summary>
