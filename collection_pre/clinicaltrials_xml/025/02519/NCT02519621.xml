	<brief_summary>This study is designed to assess the efficacy and economics of two NPWT branded devices of wound healing outcomes. It is also designed to assess the effectiveness of negative pressure and negative pressure with continuous irrigation on multiple parameters of wound healing. It is a single-center, open-label, active controlled, parallel-group trial that aims to determine the efficacy of Quantum with simultaneous irrigation in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Specifically, eligible participants will be randomized to receive either PRO negative press therapy with simultaneous irrigation; or PRO negative pressure therapy without irrigation; or KCI Ulta negative pressure therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Compare the Efficacy of NPWT PRO Versus KCI Ulta® NPWT and to Compare NPWT PRO Versus NPWT PRO With Simultaneous Irrigation on Wound Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be taken to the operating room for the initial debridement procedure of the wound. At the end of the procedure, subjects who continue to meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to be treated with either PRO, PRO with simultaneous irrigation (PROI), or KCI Ulta NPWT. Prior to study initiation sealed pre-numbered randomization envelopes will be provided to the research staff and used to obtain randomization assignment. Opening of the randomization envelop will occur intraoperatively at the conclusion of the initial surgical debridement of the wound and conformation of all eligibility requirements. Study staff will use the randomization number labels contained in the envelop. The number will become the subject ID. The assignment will be subjects randomized to PRO, PRO with simultaneous irrigation, or KCI Ulta NPWT. The research staff will note treatment assignments on the intra operative randomization CRF and instruct the investigator. Treatment therapy wound dressings will be applied in the operating room or in the patient's room immediately after surgery per the investigators discretion, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In order to ensure consistent study treatment, subjects will receive assigned treatment therapies within their study arm after the initial and any subsequent surgical debridements until the wound is deemed ready for closure or coverage by the Investigator. Subjects randomized to the PRO with simultaneous irrigation Treatment arm are the only subjects that will receive irrigation therapy at any time during the study period. If irrigation therapy is discontinued, subjects in the Treatment arm will transition to PRO NPWT without irrigation. Subjects randomized to the PRO Control arm will receive NPWT only from the PRO therapy unit.</detailed_description>
