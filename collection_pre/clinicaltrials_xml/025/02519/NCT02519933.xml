	<brief_summary>A well-functioning vascular access is essential for effective hemodialysis. The native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access because of the lower thrombosis and infection risks compared to either synthetic arteriovenous grafts or central venous catheters. Brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (BCAVF) and transposed brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula (T-BBAVF) are recommended when there is either a primary failure or no suitable vessels for the forearm fistula. However, BCAVF is frequently cannulated at the antecubital fossa, the risks of stenosis and thrombosis are high, which will compromise proper BCAVF function and survival. T-BBAVF is not only technically challenging, but also associates with severe arm swelling and pain. Thus, the investigators introduced a novel modified Non-transposed brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula (mNT-BBAVF) for long-term hemodialysis patients. To confirm its efficacy, a prospective clinical study would be carried out.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of mNT-BBAVF and BCAVF in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study aims to compare the outcomes of a novel modified Non-transposed brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula (mNT-BBAVF) and the standard brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (BCAVF) for long-term hemodialysis patients. Briefly, in mNT-BBAVF, a side-to-side anastomosis between the brachial artery and non-transposed proximal basilic vein is disposed, followed by the ligation of the vein above anastomosis. All the perforating in the surgical field should be ligated. All patients will be followed up for 12 months after surgeries. The outcomes includes: hemodynamic parameters (vessels's diameters, blood flow velocities and blood volumes) detected by ultrasound in 12 months, Complications in 1-month and 12-month, primary patency and secondary patency (cumulative patency).</detailed_description>
