	<brief_summary>The aerosol associated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and high flow therapy with nasal interface have been employed in an attempt to relieve respiratory distress and optimize the deposition of drugs by inhalation. Some studies report the effects of NIV association with fogging in healthy subjects, asthmatics and COPD 7.8, but studies evaluating the association between high flow nasal mist interface and therapy are scarce and most are found in vitro and animal models. The objective of this study is to evaluate the deposition of the aerosol scintigraphy using the high flow nasal interface system with vibrating mesh nebulizers using in healthy adults.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>The study included healthy individuals of both sexes, between 18 to 65 years, without history of lung disease and forced vital capacity (FVC) or forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) higher or equal to 80% from predicted values, ability to verbal commands understand and willing to provide signed consent to participate in this study. Participants were excluded if there unable to understand and follow the procedures and were pregnant and unable to tolerate nebulization.</criteria>
