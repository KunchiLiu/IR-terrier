	<brief_title>Lower Fluorescein Sodium Dose on Confocal Laser Endoscopy Image Quality and Yellow Discoloration of the Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fluorescein sodium is one of the commonly used staining agents in confocal laser endoscopy, a device for in vivo real-time histological observation of the gastrointestinal mucosa. The conventional intravenous dosage of fluorescein sodium is in the range of 5ml to 10ml of 10% fluorescein. Image quality can be guaranteed with this range of fluorescein sodium, but yellow discoloration of the skin seriously influences daily life. This study was to test whether a lower dose of fluorescein sodium, which has minimal discoloration of skin, can provide satisfied image quality by a randomized blinded controlled trial.</detailed_description>
