	<brief_summary>Investigators studied 15 patients scheduled for pulmonary resection through thoracotomy. Initial tidal volume (VT) 10ml kg-1 was reduced to 8ml kg-1 after one lung ventilation (OLV) and the rate adjusted to maintain partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 30-35 mm Hg. Data were obtained at: T1, 15 min post establishing OLV with normocapnia, T2, 15 min post establishing OLV with hypercapnia (PaCO2 7.98kPa (60mmHg) and 9.31kPa (70mmHg) and pH &gt;7.1), and T3, 15 min after resuming OLV with normocapnia. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with post hoc Dunnet´s test were used for analysis. A P value &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators studied 15 patients scheduled for elective pulmonary resection through thoracotomy. Patients had a standardized management for thoracotomies. Initial VT 10ml/ kg was reduced to 8ml/kg after OLV and the rate adjusted to maintain PaCO2 30-35 mm Hg. Haemodynamic, respiratory variables and echocardiographic data (Tei index and TAPSE) were obtained at: T1, 15 min post establishing OLV with normocapnia, T2, 15 min post establishing OLV with hypercapnia (PaCO2 7.98kPa (60mmHg) and 9.31kPa (70mmHg) and pH &gt;7.1), and T3, 15 min after resuming OLV with normocapnia. One-way repeated measures ANOVA, with post hoc Dunnet´s test were used for analysis. A P value &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.</detailed_description>
