	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fosaprepitant (MK-0517) plus ondansetron versus ondansetron alone for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in pediatric participants scheduled to receive chemotherapeutic agent(s) associated with moderate or high risk of causing emesis (vomiting), or chemotherapy agent(s) not previously tolerated due to vomiting. The primary hypothesis is that a single dose of fosaprepitant in combination with ondansetron provides superior control of CINV compared to ondansetron alone as measured by the percentage of participants with a Complete Response (no vomiting, no retching, and no use of rescue medications) in the delayed phase (&gt;24 to 120 hours) following initiation of emetogneic chemotherapy in Cycle 1.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Fosaprepitant (MK-0517) Plus Ondandsetron Versus Ondansetron Alone for the Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting in Pediatric Participants (MK-0517-044)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Cycle 1, participants will receive double-blind study drug (fosaprepitant plus ondansetron with or without dexamethasone OR placebo to fosaprepitant plus ondansetron with or without dexamethasone). Upon completion of Cycle 1, participants may have the option to continue for up to 5 additional open-label cycles, receiving fosaprepitant plus ondansetron with or without dexamethasone.</detailed_description>
