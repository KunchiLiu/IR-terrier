	<brief_summary>Pediatric heart transplant patients have a high-risk cardiovascular profile affecting their long-term outcomes and survival. Currently, no effective cardiovascular preventative care is provided for this pediatric population, in part, due to the fact that clinic-based programs are not easily accessible to children and their families. However, tele-health has been show to improve medical outcomes by making care more accessible to these patients. This study aims to meet the urgent need for an effective and sustainable delivery of preventative care to pediatric heart transplant patients using a diet and exercise intervention program delivered live over the internet direct to these patients' homes.</brief_summary>
