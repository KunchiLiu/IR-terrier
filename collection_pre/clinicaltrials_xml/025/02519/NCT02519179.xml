	<brief_summary>The objective this research is to conduct a within-subject, experimental study that will describe mothers' feeding practices during typical bottle-feeding conditions and will examine whether removal of visual cues related to the amount of milk/formula in the bottle will alter these feeding practices. The investigators hypothesize that mothers will show higher levels of infant-directed feeding practices and lower levels of mother-directed feeding practices when using opaque, weighted bottles compared to when using standard, clear bottles. The investigators also hypothesize that infants will consume less breast milk or formula when fed from opaque, weighted bottles compared to when fed from standard, clear bottles.</brief_summary>
