	<brief_summary>This is a study to determine how the viscosity (thickness) of an FDA approved gel made by Cook medical affects the ease in which endoscopic mucosal resections (EMR) - a type of endoscopic surgery performed for localised cancer - can be performed when the gel is injected submucosally. The lifting characteristics of the gel will be assessed by height and diameter and ease with which the subsequent EMR dissection can be performed. These characteristics would be assessed on excised human stomachs and colon, which are harvested during routine sleeve gastrectomy surgeries or colectomies, in an ex-vivo manner.</brief_summary>
