	<brief_summary>Studies indicate that bleeding irregularities and dysmenorrhea are common reasons for copper IUD method discontinuation. Some evidence suggests that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) can help improve bleeding during Cu-IUD use. However, these studies did not examine NSAID use with the TCu380A specifically, nor did they evaluate readily available NSAIDs such as over-the-counter naproxen. For this reason, the investigators propose a pilot trial in which new TCu380A users complaining of heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding or spotting after 1 month of use are randomized to naproxen or placebo to be taken the first 7 days of menstruation for three consecutive cycles, and then observed for one cycle without treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Copper IUD Treatment Observation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Copper IUD (Cu-IUD) is the most widely used IUD in the world, and its use in the United States (US) is on the rise. The Cu-IUD is considered one of the most effective contraception methods, being as effective as permanent sterilization but having the convenience of being reversible should a woman decide to conceive.2 The Copper 380A (TCu380A) is the only Cu-IUD available in the US; of all Cu-IUDs, the TCu380A is considered the most effective. Despite its increasing popularity in the US, studies indicate that bleeding irregularities and dysmenorrhea are common reasons for method discontinuation. Some evidence suggests that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) can help improve bleeding during Cu-IUD use. However, these studies did not examine NSAID use with the TCu380A specifically, nor did they evaluate readily available NSAIDs such as over-the-counter naproxen. For this reason, the investigators propose a pilot trial in which new TCu380A users complaining of heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding or spotting after 1 month of use are randomized to naproxen or placebo to be taken the first 7 days of menstruation for three consecutive cycles, and then observed for one cycle without treatment. The number of bleeding/spotting days will be compared using Student t-test. In addition to assessing how well naproxen reduces incidence and amount of bleeding, the investigators will also assess the use of naproxen and TCu380A on quality of life, sexual function, method satisfaction, menstrual pain, and adverse events. By measuring these variables, the investigators will assess both positive and negative consequences of TCu380A use, ensuring that harm does not outweigh benefits.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• Age ≥ 18 and &lt; 49 years. We are including a wide range of ages because women of all ages request TCu380A. While we recognize that some women approaching menopause (median age = 51.4 years) may have changes in their baseline menstruation, we trust that clinicians enrolling the patients into the study will ensure that these women meet all inclusion (i.e., regular cycles) and exclusion criteria (i.e., do not have diagnosis of menorrhagia). Requesting to have TCu380A IUD inserted as contraceptive method. Englishspeaking. Regular menstrual cycles ranging 2135 days apart. Generally healthy. Willing to attend a 4 to 6week followup visit and complete surveys. Known or suspected pregnancy. Contraindications to NSAID use. This includes underlying heart failure, chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, peptic ulcer disease, or history of upper gastrointestinal bleed, and allergy to NSAIDs. Current regular use of a NSAID. Unwilling to avoid use of NSAIDs (except for study medication) for the duration of the study. Current diagnosis of menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, symptomatic uterine fibroids, or endometrial polyps. Use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) or levonorgestrelreleasing intrauterine device (LNG IUD) within the previous 3 months. Postpartum in the past 4 weeks. The average day in which nonbreastfeeding postpartum women ovulate is 25 days after birth, indicating that menstrual cycles can resume after the 4th postpartum week. Existing medical condition for which placement of TCu380A IUD is a contraindication according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC 4 medical conditions; see Appendix A). Currently breastfeeding. Previous use of the TCu380A.</criteria>
