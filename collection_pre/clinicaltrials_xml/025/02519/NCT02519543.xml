	<brief_summary>In a previous study by Dr. Calkin, the principal investigator of this study, persons with bipolar disorder and either type II diabetes or insulin resistance were found to experience more severe symptoms of bipolar illness and a lower response to treatment, compared to persons with bipolar disorder who did not have type II diabetes or insulin resistance. To further explore these findings, the investigators have developed this study to see if adding metformin, a drug used to improve the body's use of insulin, may also help improve the symptoms of bipolar illness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating Insulin Resistance as a Strategy to Improve Outcome in Refractory Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a 26-week randomized, double-blind, parallel group prospective study of the efficacy of metformin as add-on treatment in patients with insulin resistance ( IR) and non-remitting bipolar illness, conducted over three years. The investigators will compare the effects of metformin versus placebo on outcome in each patient, while their current optimized mood stabilizing treatment as usual (TAU, according to the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments [CANMAT]or American Psychiatric Association (APA) guidelines) remains unchanged for a period of at least 8 weeks prior to and throughout the study. Patients will undergo a baseline assessment and then be randomized to treatment with placebo or metformin with titration to full dose after 2 weeks. Patients will remain on full treatment for 24 weeks thereafter (total trial duration of 26 weeks for each patient). The investigators will compare response to metformin versus placebo (measured by Montgomery-Çºsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] as the primary outcome). Subjects: Enrolment of 110 subjects with IR and non-remitting bipolar depression will be recruited over three years from 2 sites, the primary site in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada and a second site in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.</detailed_description>
