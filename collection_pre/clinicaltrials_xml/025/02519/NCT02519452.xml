	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety from the mixture of daratumumab and rHuPH20 prepared immediately before administration via Subcutaneous (SC) delivery (Part 1) and CF (co-formulated daratumumab and rHuPH20 preparation) administration via SC delivery of daratumumab (Part 2).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Daratumumab With the Addition of Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) for the Treatment of Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), multicenter, 2-part, Phase 1b dose escalation/expansion study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (study of what the body does to a drug), and antitumor activity of SC delivery of daratumumab to participant with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Up to approximately 53 participants in part 1 and 80 participants in part 2 will be enrolled. The purpose of Part 1 is to select an appropriate SC therapeutic dose for the mixture of daratumumab with rHuPH20 based on safety and pharmacokinetics. This dose, selected from part 1 will be the initial dose for the co-formulated daratumumab and rHuPH20 preparation to be evaluated in Part 2. The purpose of Part 2 is to evaluate the SC delivery of CF and confirm the dose level selected from Part 1 based on the pharmacokinetics, safety, and antitumor activity. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants proven to have multiple myeloma (MM) diagnosis according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) diagnostic criteria Measurable disease as defined by any of the following: (a) immunoglobulin (Ig) G myeloma (serum monoclonal paraprotein [Mprotein] level &gt;=1.0 gram/deciliter [g/dL] or urine Mprotein level greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 200 milligram[mg]/24 hours[hrs]; or (b) IgA, IgD, or IgE multiple myeloma (serum Mprotein level &gt;= 0.5 g/dL or urine Mprotein level &gt;= 200 mg/24 hrs); or (c) light chain multiple myeloma (serum immunoglobulin free light chain &gt;=10 mg/dL and abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa lambda free light chain ratio) Participant must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1, or 2 Pretreatment clinical laboratory values must meet protocoldefined parameters during the Screening phase Man, who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had a vasectomy, must agree to use an adequate contraception method as deemed appropriate by the Investigator, and must also agree to not donate sperm during the study and 3 months after last dose of daratumumab Relapsed or refractory disease. Relapse is defined as progression of disease after an initial response to previous treatment, more than 60 days after cessation of treatment. Refractory disease is defined as less than (&lt;) 25 percent (%) reduction in Mprotein or progression of disease during treatment or within 60 days after cessation of treatment Prior treatment with less than or equal to (&gt;=) 2 treatment lines of antimyeloma therapy. Prior lines of therapy must include a proteasome inhibitor (PI) (eg, bortezomib, carfilzomib) and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) (example, thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide) in any order during the course of treatment. Each prior line of therapy may consist of one or more agents and may include induction, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and/or maintenance therapy. Radiotherapy, bisphosphonates, or a single short course of steroids is not considered a prior line of therapy Participant has received daratumumab or other anticluster of differentiation 38 (antiCD38) therapies previously Participant has received antimyeloma treatment within 2 weeks before Cycle 1 Day 1 Participant has previously received an allogenic stem cell transplant; or participant has received autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) within 12 weeks before Cycle 1 Day 1 Participant has a history of malignancy (other than multiple myeloma) within 5 years before Cycle 1 Day 1 (exceptions are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy that in the opinion of the investigator, with concurrence with the sponsor's medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence) Participant is exhibiting clinical signs of meningeal involvement of multiple myeloma</criteria>
