	<brief_summary>People infected with HIV often have cognitive dysfunction even if they are on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and have undetectable viral loads. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the addition of maraviroc (MVC) and dolutegravir (DTG) (which are two antiretroviral [ARV] medications) to participants' existing ART regimens will improve participants' neurocognitive performance.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV-infected people often have cognitive dysfunction (HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, or HAND), which includes asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD), even if they are on ART and have undetectable viral loads. In this study, researchers will evaluate the effectiveness of adding MVC and DTG to the current ART regimen of HIV-infected people with undetectable (&lt;50 copies/mL) plasma HIV-1 RNA who have mild to moderate neurocognitive impairment and who have been on stable ART for at least 6 months prior to study entry. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the addition of MVC and DTG to participants' existing ART regimens will improve participants' neurocognitive performance. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three arms. All participants will remain on their existing ART regimens; they will take their assigned study drugs in addition to their ART regimen. Participants in Arm A will receive placebo for MVC and placebo for DTG. Participants in Arm B will receive DTG and placebo for MVC. Participants in Arm C will receive MVC and DTG. Study visits will occur at entry and Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96. Visits may include physical examinations, blood collection, neurocognitive testing, and questionnaires. Some participants may have an optional lumbar puncture procedure. Participants will have to return for refills of study drugs on Weeks 36, 60, and 84. No evaluations will be performed during these visits.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIV1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV1 antigen or plasma HIV1 RNA viral load. NOTE: The term "licensed" refers to a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved kit, which is required for all IND studies. WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (eg, indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV1 RNA. On current ART for at least 6 months prior to study entry with no interruption in treatment of greater than or equal to 7 days. Note: The following ART changes are allowed: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF)/TAFcontaining fixeddose combination regimens Ritonavir (RTV) to cobicistat (COBI)/COBIcontaining fixeddose combination regimens No plans to change ART while on study. Note: The following ART changes are allowed: TDF to TAF/TAFcontaining fixeddose combination regimens RTV to COBI/COBIcontaining fixeddose combination regimens HIV1 plasma RNA less than 50 copies/mL obtained within 90 days prior to study entry by any FDAapproved assay at any United States laboratory that has a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification or its equivalent No more than one HIV1 plasma RNA greater than or equal to 50 and less than 200 copies/mL (only one "blip") in the past 6 months with a subsequent HIV1 plasma RNA less than 50 copies/mL. NOTE: There should be no observation of HIV1 plasma RNA greater than 200 copies/mL within the 6 months prior to study entry. HAND diagnosis (ANI, MND, or HAD) within 45 days prior to study entry. HAND diagnosis is neurocognitive impairment defined as at least mild impairment (more than one standard deviation below appropriate normative data in two domains of functioning) and no severely confounding factors. Screening laboratory values obtained within 45 days prior to study entry: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 500/mm^3 Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 7.5 g/dL Platelet count greater than or equal to 40,000/mm^3 Creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate transaminase (AST) less than or equal to 5 x ULN Alanine transaminase (ALT) less than 3 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 5 x ULN Total bilirubin less than 1.5 x ULN. NOTE: If the potential participant is taking an indinavir (IDV) or atazanavir (ATV)containing regimen at the time of screening, total bilirubin less than or equal to 5 x ULN is acceptable. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than or equal to 60 mL/min, either measured or estimated by CockcroftGault equation. NOTE: A calculator for estimating the CrCl can be found at www.fstrf.org/ACTG/ccc.html Females of reproductive potential (women who have not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, ie, who have had menses within the preceding 24 months, or women who have not undergone surgical sterilization, hysterectomy or bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of less than or equal to 25 mIU/mL within 48 hours prior to study entry Females of reproductive potential must agree not to participate in the conception process (ie, active attempt to become pregnant, in vitro fertilization), and if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, must use at least one reliable form of contraceptive. Female participants must use contraceptives while receiving study treatment and for 6 weeks after stopping study treatment. More information on this criterion is available in the protocol. Men and women 18 years of age and older who are able to complete the neuropsychological tests Ability and willingness of participant or a legally authorized representative (see protocol for more information) to provide informed consent Ability and willingness to take oral study medications Indication of willingness to participate in the optional lumbar puncture (LP) procedure NOTES: Participants who do not agree to participate in the optional LP may still participate in the study. Participants currently taking antiplatelet agents, except aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are excluded from participation in the optional LP. However they may still participate in the study. Current or past medical condition(s) that in the opinion of the investigator prevents attribution of the cause of cognitive impairment to HIV. For example: Major depressive disorder with psychotic features Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) with a clear impact on activities of daily living Mental retardation and/or severe educational disability resulting in some dependence for activities of daily living Ongoing substance use disorder with significant impact on activities of daily living. Difficult or impossible to determine whether cognitive or functional decline is due to substance use or HIV, or both Evidence of intoxication or withdrawal during the screening evaluation Central nervous system (CNS) infections or opportunistic conditions: brain abscess (bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal or Toxoplasma), meningitis with persistent resulting neurologic impairment, primary CNS lymphoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), or another structural brain lesion with neurological sequelae Other CNS conditions: nonopportunistic primary or metastatic brain tumors, uncontrolled seizure disorder, progressive multiple sclerosis, stroke with neurological sequelae, or dementia due to causes other than HIV (eg, Alzheimer's disease) Constitutional illness (eg, persistent unexplained fever, diarrhea, significant weight loss, disabling weakness) within 30 days of screening Known untreated B12 deficiency or malnutrition (body mass index [BMI] less than 18) at screening Evidence of current hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) (ie, HCV antibody positive within 90 days prior to study entry unless also shown to be HCV RNA negative within the same time period) Unstable and advanced liver disease (as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices, or persistent jaundice) Prior or current use of any integrase inhibitor or MVC Current use of any medication, including antiretrovirals, prohibited in the study (refer to the protocol for the prohibited medications) Breastfeeding Presence of an AIDSdefining opportunistic infection within 180 days prior to entry. Note: Refer to the A5324 Manual of Operations (MOPS) for the list of AIDSdefining opportunistic infections. Active syphilis or treatment for syphilis within 90 days prior to study entry. NOTE: Active syphilis is defined as fourfold increase in serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) tests in a patient with past syphilis, or newly reactive serum RPR or VDRL with a reactive confirmatory test (enzyme immunoassays [EIA], T. pallidum particle agglutination [TPPA], or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed [FTAABS]).
