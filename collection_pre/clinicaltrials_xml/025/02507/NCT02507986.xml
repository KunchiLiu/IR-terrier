	<brief_title>Mobile Phones in Cryptogenic Stroke Patients Bringing Single Lead ECGs to Detect Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: A standard work-up of stroke patients to identify a cause of stroke consists of Computed Tomography (CT), CT angiography of head and neck arteries, transthoracic echocardiography, 12-lead 10-seconds electrocardiogram (ECG), blood tests and 24-hour ECG monitoring. A stroke is called "cryptogenic" if no cause can be determined after standard work-up. Current detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) after stroke is 2.0%. Recent studies revealed that prolonged monitoring yields higher percentages of detected AF (12.0%). Devices used in these trials suffer from drawbacks. The investigators' hypothesis is that a new, smartphone compatible device, producing a single lead ECG (single lead ECG device), can be used for prolonged ECG monitoring in cryptogenic stroke patients. Objective: The main objective of this study is to compare the incidence of detected AF in cryptogenic stroke patients by a single lead ECG device with the incidence of detected AF by a 7-Day Holter ECG. Study design: A multicenter randomized trial. Study population: Cryptogenic stroke patients admitted to a hospital participating in the study. The calculated sample size is 200 (100 per arm). Intervention: After inclusion, patients will be randomized to either a single lead ECG device or a 7-Day Holter Monitor. Main study parameters/endpoints: The main endpoint will be the percentage of detected atrial fibrillation in both the single lead ECG device group and the 7-Day Holter group after one year. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Both devices are battery powered and electrically safe. Patients face a 2-3% risk that AF is detected false-positively; this might lead to incorrect oral anticoagulation (OAC) prescription. However, a potential benefit of the investigators' study is that if AF is detected and treated with OAC, this significantly reduces the chance of recurrent stroke.</detailed_description>
