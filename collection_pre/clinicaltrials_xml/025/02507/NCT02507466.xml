	<detailed_description>The overall objective of this subproject is to evaluate the individual and paired contributions of intensity and variability of stepping training on lower extremity (LE) function, health and community participation in patients with chronic hemiparesis post-stroke. Using a RCT design/Intervention Efficacy paradigm, Aim 1 will investigate the independent and combined (paired) contributions of intensity and variability of stepping training on locomotor function, with secondary measures of health and community mobility. For Aim 2, we will evaluate the independent and combined effects of intensity and variability of stepping training on non-walking LE tasks. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the cost effectiveness of providing these interventions to accelerate motor recovery and health. Our central hypothesis is that results of this study will provide a theoretical foundation for implementation of physical therapy interventions which can facilitate short-term gains in locomotor function, and contribute to long-term improvements in health, function and participation through increased community mobility.</detailed_description>
