	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the functional outcome of patients who present with a distal fibula fracture who were treated with either intermedullary nail (IMN) fixation or plate fixation. This objective will be accomplished using the Olerud-Molander score, a commonly accepted functional outcome score used to evaluate patients post-operatively who have undergone foot and ankle procedures. It is a survey that evaluates patient reported outcomes including pain, stiffness, swelling, stair climbing, running, jumping, squatting, use of supports, and work/activities of daily living (ADL) level. It does not involve physician-measured outcomes. The best possible score is a total of 100. Patients will be given a form to complete throughout follow-up and be utilized for data analysis. Functional outcome will be analyzed with regards to type of fracture, gender, cause of fracture, and affected side to determine if these factors are responsible for any difference.</detailed_description>
