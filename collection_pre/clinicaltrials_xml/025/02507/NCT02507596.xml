	<brief_title>Evaluation of Nano-crystalline Hydroxyapatite Silica Gel in Management of Periodontal Intrabony Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty patients suffering from advanced chronic periodontitis were included in this randomized controlled clinical trial. Each subject contributed matched two- or three-walled intrabony defects. Patients were equally randomly assigned into the experimental group; Nano-crystalline hydroxyapatite silica gel or the positive control group; bone allograft or negative control group;open flap debridement. Clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively.</detailed_description>
