	<brief_summary>Based on preliminary data and previous studies, we hypothesize that the ambient temperature experienced by an individual influences his or her food intake. Specifically, exposure to temperatures above the thermoneutral zone (TNZ) will decrease consumption in young adults in a sedentary situation. Researchers will execute a crossover randomized control trial specifically testing thermal exposure and its effect on individual female's food consumption.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will receive and wear a t-shirt. They will have a thermal image taken of the inner canthus of their eye and middle finger nail bed, representing a baseline of core and peripheral temperatures, respectively. They will also have their metabolic rate measured via a canopy hood method. At their initial visit, they will be randomized to either a colder environment (66-68°F) or a warmer environment (77-79°F) under the artifice of monitoring routine office work with abnormal temperature conditions. Their knowledge of the experiment will be limited until the end. They will experience this temperature while filling out paperwork and performing basic office tasks for a 7 hour work day. At the beginning and end of each day they will fill out a questionnaire on their appetite and thermal comfort. After the first 3.5 hours, another thermal image will be taken and the participant will be presented with lasagna and water and directed to eat at their leisure and subsequently finish the office tasks over the next 3.5 hours. A thermal image will be taken and metabolic rate will be assessed at the end of the day. Snacks will be available throughout the day. The participants will return approximately 1 week later to experience the other thermal environment following the same protocols. The participants will then be debriefed on the parameters of the experiment and body measurements will be taken at the end so as to prevent bias of the subject by limiting their food intake. We will quantify energy intake by weighing remaining food and comparing to known caloric content by weight from bomb calorimetry tests. The infrared thermal images will determine whether the temperatures experienced were extreme enough to initiate a change in thermoregulation.</detailed_description>
