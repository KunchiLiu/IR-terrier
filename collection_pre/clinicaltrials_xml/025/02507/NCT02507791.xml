	<brief_summary>This study is evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of using Fitbit Charge HR devices to remotely track the physical activity of obese pediatric patients who are concurrently enrolled in a comprehensive weight loss intervention program. Patients will receive Fitbit devices and will be called weekly to review their average daily steps and heart rates. Patients will receive the Fitbit either at the beginning of classes or upon completion of classes. Patients will then be followed remotely and called weekly for 12 additional weeks after completing classes. The two groups will be compared to examine for differences.</brief_summary>
