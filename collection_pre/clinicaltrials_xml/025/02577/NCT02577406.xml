	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of AG-221 (CC-90007) Versus Conventional Care Regimens in Older Subjects With Late Stage Acute Myeloid Leukemia Harboring an Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 2 Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a form of cancer that is common in older patients. Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme 2 (IDH2) have been found in approximately 15% of patients with AML. The outcome of first line chemotherapy treatment is poor and many patients fail to attain complete remission (CR, ie refractory) or will eventually relapse. There is no single standard of care for relapsed or refractory AML. Since the prognosis is very poor there is a great need for new therapies. Inhibition of IDH2 mutations may represent a promising targeted therapy for AML. AG-221 is designed to only block the IDH2 mutations. Data from the ongoing first-in-human study has shown AG-221 to be generally well tolerated and demonstrated CR in patients with IDH2 mutation positive relapsed or refractory AML. The study purpose is to test the safety and efficacy of AG-221 compared with conventional care regimens (CCR), which include best supportive care (BSC) only, azacitidine plus BSC, low-dose cytarabine plus BSC or intermediate-dose cytarabine plus BSC, in patients with late stage AML refractory to or relapsed after second or third line therapy and positive for the IDH2 mutation. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive open-label tablets of AG-221 or one of the CCR on continuous 28-day treatment cycles. The trial duration is expected to be 28 months which includes 24 months enrollment, approximately 4 months treatment and a follow-up period. Study procedures include: vital signs, physical exams, ECGs, ECHO, urine/blood samples, bone marrow aspirates and/or biopsies and peripheral blood to test for IDH2 and assess treatment response. Bone marrow, blood, cheek swab samples will be used for genetic tests. This study is being sponsored by Celgene Corporation. Approximately 280 participants will take part in the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study: 1. Subject is ≥ 60 years of age at the time of signing the ICF 2. Subject has primary (ie, de novo) or secondary (progression of MDS or myeloproliferative neoplasms ([MPN], or therapyrelated) AML according to WHO classification (Appendix B) 3. Subject has received second or thirdline/regimen of AML therapy; note that, for subjects having AML secondary to prior higher risk [Intermediate2 or High risk according to the International Prognostic Scoring System] MDS treated with a hypomethylating agent [eg, azacitidine or decitabine], the hypomethylating therapy can be counted as a line/regimen if there is disease progression to AML during or shortly [eg, within 60 days] after the hypomethylating therapy.) 4. Subject has the following disease status: 1. Refractory to or relapsed after second or thirdline/regimen of intensive therapy for AML (eg, the "7 + 3" regimen): at least 5% leukemic blasts in bone marrow (the minimum number of treatment cycles of the intensive therapy is per the investigator's discretion); or 2. Refractory to or relapsed after second or thirdline lowintensity AML therapy (eg, LDAC, azacitidine or decitabine): at least 5% leukemic blasts in bone marrow after at least 2 treatment cycles 5. Subject is eligible for and willing to receive the preselected CCR treatment option, according to the investigator's assessment (Note: Subjects with degenerative and toxic encephalopathies, especially after the use of methotrexate or treatment with ionizing radiation, should not receive cytarabine.) 6. Subject has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2 (Appendix D) 7. Subject has IDH2 gene mutations tested centrally (using the "investigational use only"PCR assay, Abbott RealTime IDH2) in samples of bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood, and confirmed positive in bone marrow aspirate and/or peripheral blood. (Note: in the event that the central laboratory result is delayed and precludes acute clinical management of a subject who has confirmed IDH2 gene mutation by local evaluation, the subject may be eligible for randomization with approval by the Medical Monitor.) 8. Subject has adequate organ function defined as: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless considered due to leukemic organ involvement, following review by the Medical Monitor; and Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN, unless considered due to Gilbert's syndrome (eg, a gene mutation in UGT1A1) or leukemic organ involvement, following review by the Medical Monitor; and Creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) glomerular filtration rate (GFR): GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 × (serum creatinine)1.154 × (Age)0.203 × (0.742 if female) × (1.212 if African American) 9. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)* may participate, providing they meet the following conditions: Agree to practice true abstinence from sexual intercourse or to use highly effective contraceptive methods (eg, combined [containing estrogen and progestogen] or progestogenonly associated with inhibition of ovulation, oral, injectable, intravaginal, patch, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; bilateral tubal occlusion; intrauterine device; intrauterine hormonereleasing system; or male partner sterilization [note that vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the FCBP trial participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success]) at screening and throughout the study, and for 4 months following the last study treatment (6 months following the last dose of cytarabine); and Have a negative serum βsubunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) pregnancy test (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) at screening; and Have a negative serum or urine (investigator's discretion under local regulations) βhCG pregnancy test (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) within 72 hours prior to the start of study treatment in the Treatment Phase (note that the screening serum pregnancy test can be used as the test prior to the start of study treatment in the Treatment Phase if it is performed within the 72hour timeframe). 10. Male subjects must agree to practice true abstinence from sexual intercourse or to the use of highly effective contraceptive methods (as described above) with nonpregnant female partners of childbearing potential at screening and throughout the course of the study, and should avoid conception with their partners during the course of the study and for 4 months following the last study treatment (6 months following the last dose of cytarabine; 6 months following the last dose of azacitidine in Canada) 11.
