	<brief_summary>Computerized decision support systems (CDSSs) are information technology-based software that provide health professionals with actionable, patient-specific recommendations or guidelines for disease diagnosis, treatment, and management at the point-of-care. CDSSs may be integrated with patient electronic health records (EHRs) and evidence-based knowledge.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computerized Decision Support System Linked to Electronic Health Records to Improve Patient Care in a General Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators designed a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of patient-specific, point-of-care reminders on clinical practice and the quality of care. The investigators hypothesize that these reminders can increase clinician adherence to guidelines and, eventually, improve the quality of care offered to hospitalized patients. The results of the investigators study will contribute to the current understanding of the effectiveness of CDSSs in primary care and hospital settings.</detailed_description>
