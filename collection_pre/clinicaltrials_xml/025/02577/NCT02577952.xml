	<detailed_description>Lipodystrophy is a heterogeneous group of rare and inherited syndromes characterized by the complete or partial loss or absence of subcutaneous adipose tissue. People living with lipodystrophy lack the fat tissue required for normal metabolic function. To enhance knowledge of the underlying biology of these conditions and to institute effective clinical treatments, the Lipodystrophy community has developed a mechanism for individuals with any of the Lipodystrophy conditions to enroll in a Lipodystrophy registry called Lipodystrophy Connect. The objective of such a registry is to create a platform that connects all of the Lipodystrophy community, including persons with Lipodystrophy, family members, healthcare providers, researchers, drug companies, advocacy groups, federal research organizations, and regulators. A patient registry will provide the foundation for a resource to meet the current and future needs of the Lipodystrophy community as well as accelerate the rate of research and development of therapies that improve the quality of life of those with Lipodystrophy. Lipodystrophy Connect is an online survey tool that collects basic demographic information and health information from people with any rare form of Lipodystrophy.</detailed_description>
