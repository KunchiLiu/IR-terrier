	<brief_summary>Patients with head and neck cancer and their caregivers face many challenges. These include learning about cancer and its treatment, coping with symptoms from illness and treatment side effects, making adjustments to usual activities, and managing the emotional effects of having a serious illness. This study tests whether different forms of education and support can help family caregivers feel better prepared. To find out if education about caregiving and different kinds of support are effective, this study wants to compare approaches.One group includes caregivers who will receive an education and support program throughout radiation treatment in addition to usual care by their doctors and nurses. The other group receives an educational booklet about caregiving in addition to usual care by their doctors and nurses. The caregiver also completes surveys about his or her emotions, distress, confidence as a care giver, and quality of life. In addition, the study asks the caregiver questions about his or her age, race, ethnicity, marital status, employment status, education, annual household income, and current living arrangements. This pilot study will only be offered at the Case Medical Center, University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center Main Campus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Building Caregiver Skills Using a Simulation-based Intervention for Care of Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1: Conduct a pilot test of the effects of a novel caregiver intervention, as compared to a control group, on family caregiver self-efficacy for caregiving, anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life. Aim 2: Explore the acceptability of a caregiver intervention that utilizes simulation. Aim 3: Assess the feasibility of the intervention. Aim 4: Describe the incidence of patient events that may be impacted by caregiver self-efficacy, such as acute care visits, admissions to the hospital, visits to the emergency department, need for fluids in the radiation oncology department, and interrupted treatment course.</detailed_description>
