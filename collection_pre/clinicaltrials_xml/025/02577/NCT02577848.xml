	<brief_title>GLP-1 on Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are a heterogeneous group with respect to the risk of having a major adverse cardiac event (MACE). Elevation of blood glucose is a common metabolic disorder among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and is associated with adverse prognosis. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that regulates plasma glucose. GLP-1 analogues have significant cardiovascular protective effects in patients with AMI. GLP-1 may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and protect endothelial function. Studies in conscious, chronically instrumented dogs demonstrated that GLP-1 infusion increases insulin sensitivity and myocardial glucose uptake in postischemic contractile dysfunction and dilated cardiomyopathy. Liraglutide, a GLP-1 analogue, was reported to reduce cardiac rupture and infarct size and improve cardiac output in normal and diabetic mice. Continuous infusion of GLP-1 (1.5 pmol/kg/min) has been shown to improve functional recovery in patients with AMI complicated by decreased left ventricular function GLP-1 could protect against ischemia-reperfusion injury and improve cardiac function in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. However, the effects of GLP-1 on NSTEMI patients remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of liraglutide on left ventricular function in patients with NSTEMI.</detailed_description>
