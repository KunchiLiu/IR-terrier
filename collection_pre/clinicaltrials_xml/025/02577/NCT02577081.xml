	<brief_summary>Neck of femur fractures are common in the elderly and are the source of significant morbidity and mortality. This study is based on a new technique developed in Ben Gurion University, with which investigators are able to asses the structural 3 dimensional strength of a bone by applying a unique simulation on a CAT scan of the bone. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the risk of a contralateral neck of femur fracture after the first neck of femur fracture and to estimate the potential fracture characteristics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of the Risk of Contralateral Non Simultaneous Neck of Femur Fracture in the Elderly.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neck of femur fractures are common in the elderly and are the source of significant morbidity and mortality. literature shows that around 10 percent of those who fracture their femoral neck for the first time will later fracture their contralateral neck of femur and in most cases with the same fracture characteristics. This study is based on a new technique developed in Ben Gurion University, with which investigators are able to asses the structural 3 dimensional strength of a bone by applying a unique simulation on a CAT scan of the bone. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the risk of a contralateral neck of femur fracture after the first neck of femur fracture and to estimate the potential fracture characteristics.</detailed_description>
