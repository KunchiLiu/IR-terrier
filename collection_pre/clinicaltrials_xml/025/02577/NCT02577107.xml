	<brief_summary>This prospective, randomized, open label study will enroll patients with neovascular AMD who are naïve to anti-VEGF therapy or have not received intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for the previous 3 months. Patients will be randomized in two treatment arms for 3 months: - Study arm 1: Three monthly injections of 0.5mg Ranibizumab - Study arm 2: Three monthly injections of 0.5mg Conbercept Blood sample (plasma/serum) will be collected at baseline (pre-dose), 3h post-injections and days 1, 3, 7 and 28, following doses 1 and 3 for PK and systemic VEGF analysis. The lab staff will be blinded for treatment allocation. Plasma VEGF concentration will be measured by a blinded laboratory using Quantikine® ELISA kits. Serum ranibizumab and conbercept concentration will be determined using validated ELISA assay. The study will be divided into 2 stages: the 1st initial feasibility stage with 6 patients per arm (12 patients in total) to verify SD for sample size justification and 2nd stage to confirm the findings with justified sample size.</brief_summary>
