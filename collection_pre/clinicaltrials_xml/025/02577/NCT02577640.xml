	<brief_title>Dietary Soy Isoflavones In Chronic Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Management of pancreatic disorders imparts a major burden on healthcare costs, estimated at over 3 billion dollars annually. Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by chronic inflammation and progressive scarring, leading to abdominal pain, irreversible damage to the pancreas and the loss of both exocrine and endocrine function. Additionally, chronic pancreatic inflammation is a risk factor for pancreas cancer. There are no current treatments to modify the natural history of this disorder. Thus, identifying novel therapeutic options for this disease represents a high priority, and could fill an unmet medical need to improve quality of life, reduce risk of malignant transformation, and limit exorbitant medical costs associated with patient care. The investigators have assembled a multi-disciplinary research team to pursue an alternative, non-pharmacologic approach to limiting inflammatory cascades in (Chronic Pancreatitis) CP patients. They will assess compliance, toxicity and measure the changes in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression from a soy based dietary bread product using a classic 3+3 dose escalation study design in subjects with chronic pancreatitis.</detailed_description>
