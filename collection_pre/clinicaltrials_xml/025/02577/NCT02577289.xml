	<brief_title>Open Sinus Lift Technique With Simultaneous Implantation Using Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) Versus Nano-crystalline Hydroxyapatite</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evaluation of bone quantity in open sinus lift technique with simultaneous implantation using platelet rich fibrin (PRF) versus Nano-crystalline Hydroxyapatite as sole grafting material in patients with atrophied posterior maxillary ridge which provides a new modality for treatment of patients with atrophied posterior maxillary ridge with least cost and a much easier way using platelet rich fibrin (PRF) as substitution to bone graft</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Atrophy</mesh_term>
	<criteria>All patients should be seeking for implant supported prosthesis in posterior maxilla bilaterally All patients should have atrophied posterior maxillary ridge with the maximum height of the alveolar bone is from 3 mm to 5 mm Ongoing steroid therapy; Uncontrolled diabetes; Recent cardiovascular diseases; Inflammation of the maxillary sinus; Previous radiant therapy for neoplastic pathologies Patient who have had previous failed sinus augmentation, or exhibited pathological finding or had a history of maxillary sinus disease or operations or whose medical condition might increase surgical risk of the research protocol were excluded.</criteria>
