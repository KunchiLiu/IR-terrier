	<brief_summary>The investigators conducted this phase II study of EGCG therapy protection of the esophagus from damage induced by radiotherapy. In order to observe the effectiveness of EGCG, esophageal toxicity was recorded weekly using a grading scale based on symptomatology, following the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scoring system. Patient-reported pain related to esophagitis was measured using the numerical rating scale (NRS) every week from EGCG application to 2 weeks after the end of radiotherapy. The scales are translated into Chinese and guides in Chinese are developed instructing how to use the scales and perform the assessments.</brief_summary>
