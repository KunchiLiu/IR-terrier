	<brief_summary>Breast milk is the reference normative standard for infant feeding. When an infant is diagnosed with chylothorax, provision of breast milk must be temporarily discontinued due to the presence of long chain triglycerides (LCT) that contribute to persistent chylous drainage. In its place, the infant is prescribed a therapeutic formula high in medium chain triglycerides (MCT) as treatment for chylothorax. Families and health care providers are interested in using breast milk, in a modified fat form, as treatment for chylothorax instead. This study will assess growth in infants receiving one of two nutrient enriched modified fat breast milk (MFBM) treatments for chylothorax. If either of the proposed nutrient enrichment methods support growth, MFBM will become a standard chylothorax treatment option for infants at SickKids.</brief_summary>
