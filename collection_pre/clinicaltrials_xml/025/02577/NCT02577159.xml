	<brief_summary>The investigators will investigate whether dapagliflozin (FORXIGA) might improve lipoprotein metabolism as well as hyperglycemia in Japanese patients with type II diabetes mellitus whose HbA1c levels are less than 7.0% (from 20 to 65 years of age). The investigators will examine changes of fasting lipoprotein profile including TG, TC, HDL-C, apoB-48 and RemL-C before and after the 8 weeks administration of dapagliflozin.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigators will investigate whether dapagliflozin (FORXIGA) might improve lipoprotein metabolism as well as hyperglycemia in Japanese patients with type II diabetes mellitus. Primary Objective is to examine changes of fasting lipoprotein profile by the administration of dapagliflozin; Concentrations of apoB-48 and RemL-C. Secondary Objectives are; to examine changes of fasting glucose and HbA1c (NGSP) level by the administration of dapagliflozin, to examine changes of fasting lipid profile by the administration of dapagliflozin; Concentrations of TG, TC, HDL-C and LDL-C, to examine changes of fractions of free fatty acids, protein mass of LPL, and lipoprotein profile assessed by the HPLC by the administration of dapagliflozin, to examine changes of biomarkers for renal and hepatic function by the administration of dapagliflozin, and to examine the frequency of adverse effects by the administration of dapagliflozin. This study is open-label study and contains patients who are diabetes mellitus of from 20 to 65 years of age and their Patients who have not achieve the clinical target of the glycemic control (less than 7.0% in HbA1c).</detailed_description>
