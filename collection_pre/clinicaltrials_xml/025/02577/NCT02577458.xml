	<brief_title>Study of the Combination of CM082 With Everolimus in Patients With mRCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I Dose-Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Efficacy of CM082 in Combination with Everolimus in Chinese Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). After the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the optimal biological dose is identified, an expansion cohort of ~10 advanced renal cell carcinoma patients will be enrolled to further characterize the safety and tumor response by CT.</detailed_description>
