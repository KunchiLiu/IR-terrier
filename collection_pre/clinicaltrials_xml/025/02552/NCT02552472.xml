	<brief_title>A Study of Inhaler Use in the Community</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over a 2-4 week period, consecutive patients with a history of respiratory illness already prescribed a salmeterol/fluticasone Diskus inhaler will be asked to participate in this study. Patients will give informed consent to participate in this study of adherence, which will be assessed with the INCA device. Both clinicians and patients will be fully aware that the device is an acoustic recording device and that both time and technique of inhaler use will be assessed. Once consented, patients will be given an INCA enabled inhaler for 1 month and asked to use it as they normally would and then to return it at the end of one month. The days used and the number of doses used in the study period, as per the dose counter, will also be recorded.</detailed_description>
