	<detailed_description>During surgical endodontics the cortical bone is exposed by elevating a full- thickness tissue flap. Cutting across mucosal blood vessels disturbs perfusion and causes ischemia. On the other hand, preserving sufficient blood flow of the soft tissue segment is important for the postoperative wound healing. In order to minimize the damage of the microvasculature of the operated area, the incision should be properly designed. The investigators will model surgical incisions by strangulation of the gingiva of healthy human subjects based on the commonly applied endodontic incision such as horizontal, vertical and papilla base. The primary aim is to determine the effect of a short term disruption of the blood flow at the respective region on the surrounding area in order to assess the functionally active collateral circulation. Using Laser Speckle Contrast Analysis (LASCA), which provides blood perfusion data, the investigators will have the possibility to detect functional alterations in gingival microcirculation during and after a short term of strangulation. The secondary aim is to assess the time course of the restoration of the circulation on the affected area.</detailed_description>
