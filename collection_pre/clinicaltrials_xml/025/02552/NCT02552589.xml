	<brief_summary>The purpose of this double blind study is to prove whether a fluoride containing toothpaste is able to reduce dental plaque and gingival inflammation in patients who have gingivitis when applied twice daily during brushing at home over a period of 12 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before study start, investigators and study nurses will be trained on how to apply SOPs, parameters, and adverse event management. On-site monitoring will be done by the sponsor after recruitment, after visit 2 and after the final visit. All source data will be entered in paper CRFs. For the statistical analysis these data will be entered into the data bank via double data entry. Programmed range checks, validity checks, consistency checks, and manual/visual data checks for medicinal plausibility will be done before the blind data review meeting. During blind data review meeting minor protocol violations will be recorded and assessed. No imputation of missing data will be done for ITT or PP analyses. The sample size estimation was carried out by means of one-sided unpaired t-test with a one-sided significance level of α=0.05. For testing superiority of the test product over negative control, the investigators test the hypothesis, H0: μTest product - μNegative control ≤ 0 H1: μTest product - μNegative control &gt; 0 by using a one-sided t-test with α=0.05. A relevant difference of Δ=0.14 and a standard deviation of σ=0.4 was assumed based on previous studies. When estimating a drop-out rate of about 20 % a total of 120 = 102 + 18 subjects per group will be assigned at study start. Drop-outs will not be replaced during the study. The primary parameter is the difference of plaque index between baseline (V1) value and the value after 12 weeks +/- 5 days (V3) of product use. For primary statistical analysis, a t-tests (unpaired situation) will be performed at a one-sided significance level of α=0.05. The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT-analysis set. Secondary variables will be assessed with t-tests and confidence intervals to compare differences between V2, V3, and baseline for test product group and negative control group. Descriptive statistics will be performed for oral examinations for each group (counts and percentages of scores for nominal and ordinal scaled data, for at least ordinal scaled data minimum, maximum, median, mean value and standard deviation). A two-sided significance level of α=0.05 is chosen for all secondary analyses, no adjustment for multiplicity will be done. Safety assessments will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse events.</detailed_description>
