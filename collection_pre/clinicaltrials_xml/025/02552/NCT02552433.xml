	<brief_title>Complications in Body Contouring Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the recently published guideline of the Dutch Association of Plastic Surgeons it is advised that assessment and improvement of the nutritional status should be part of pre-operative work-up of all post-bariatric patients who undergo body contouring surgery (BCS). The assessment should consist of consultation of a dietician and measurement of the nutritional parameters associated with wound healing. It is advised to assess the following parameters: - albumin - hemoglobin - vitamin D (25-hydroxy vitamin D) - ferritin - folic acid - vitamin B12 Standard treatment in this study will consist of the pre-operative work-up as advised by the guideline. Participants will have a consultation with the dietician to assess (protein) intake. In addition the first blood sample, which is part of standard treatment according to the new protocol, will be obtained to assess foregoing parameters. If there are nutritional deficiencies they will be treated according to the protocol of the department of Bariatric Surgery of the treating hospital. To evaluate the effect of the treatment of deficiencies and to be sure that there are no deficiencies present during the BCS a second blood sample will be drawn during the body contouring procedure. For study purposes this second sample will be collected in all patients, even if a deficiency was not present at the first blood sample. The dietician will assess current intake of the patients, with special attention the protein intake. Based on guidelines on protein-intake in post-bariatric patients and after consultation of experts (Dieticians of Maastricht University) investigators decided that the aim of the minimum protein intake is 1.5 gram per kilogram bodyweight (calculated with BMI 27kg/m2) per day. The first consultation at the dietician will be eight weeks prior to surgery. Patients will be advised to start with the extra protein-intake four weeks prior to surgery and continue this until the wounds are completely healed. Six weeks after surgery a questionnaire will be handed-out to the patients, to assess the compliance to the treatment regime.</detailed_description>
