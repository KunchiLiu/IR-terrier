	<brief_summary>Some individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) also demonstrate irritability or aggression, which can interfere with functioning. The purpose of this pilot study is to test whether transdermal nicotine is effective for irritability and/or aggression in adults with ASD using a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Subjects will participate in three visits. At the first visit, subjects are screened for eligibility and enrolled. Baseline measures include rating scales and a frustrative computerized task. They will then wear seven days of transdermal nicotine or placebo. Visit two is on day seven and the study measures are repeated, vital signs and side effects monitored. Subjects will return for a third and final visit on day 21 to repeat the study measures performed during visit two.</brief_summary>
