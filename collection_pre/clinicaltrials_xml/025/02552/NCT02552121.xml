	<brief_title>Tisotumab Vedotin (HuMax®-TF-ADC) Safety Study in Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is conducted in two parts. The dose escalation portion of the trial subjects are enrolled into cohorts at increasing dose levels of tisotumab vedotin (HuMax-TF-ADC) in 28 day treatment cycles. In the Cohort Expansion part of the trial, will further explore the recommended phase 2 dose of tisotumab vedotin (HuMax-TF-ADC) as determined in Part 1</detailed_description>
