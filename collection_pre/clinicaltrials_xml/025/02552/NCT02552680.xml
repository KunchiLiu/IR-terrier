	<brief_summary>Introduction: Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) are characterized by inflammation of muscles, tendons, fascia and nerves of upper limbs, shoulder girdle and neck. Its incidence is increasing and there is evidence of its association with the pace of work. As WMSDs, another major public health problem is back pain, which also negatively influence the quality of life of patients. These diseases affect many workers, among them, workers in the health area, including surgeons. Studies show that many surgeons are suffering from fatigue and musculoskeletal pain after undergoing surgery, especially laparoscopy. Regarding the quality of life of doctors, a study indicates that surgeons have commitment of domains "Vitality" and "Pain". For these reasons it is important to develop strategies for prevention of occupational risks (WMSDs) in this class of workers. Objectives: To evaluate the influence of a Preventive Program (educational and gymnastics) for prevention of WMSDs, in the quality of life, in limitation of the work, in intensity and frequency of musculoskeletal pain in surgeons of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre. There will also be evaluated the effects of the program on muscular strength and flexibility of medics participating in the Preventive Program. Methodology: Randomized clinical trial with a sample of 54 surgeons, divided into two groups: A ("Intervention": will participate in eight meetings consisting of exercise and guidelines on care and prevention of WMSDs in activities of daily living, especially those relating work activities) and B ("Control": will receive a manual-brochure - containing information about general health). Participants will sign a Letter of Consent.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical Trial Study with 54 surgeons allocated in two groups: A and B. They received two protocols in accordance with the groups they have been allocated. Group A: participated in eight meetings supervised by physical education professionals, with 15 minutes duration, individually administered, twice a week, during the surgeons working hours, at times and places combined with them. The meetings were composed of endurance exercise, mobility and muscle stretching. They were also given guidance on care and prevention of Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders in activities fo daily life, especially those related to work activities. Group B: received a manual (brochure ) containing information on general health care, especially designed for this study. With food guide, sleep, physical activity and smoking. Were measured the quality of life, muscle force, muscle stretching and pain. The dates were collected at the beginning of the procedures, 4 weeks after the protocols and 26 after the protocols.</detailed_description>
