	<brief_summary>The investigators propose that post-exercise milk protein feeding will enhance the mitochondrial protein synthesis (biogenesis) response to an exercise-training program. In addition, the investigators propose that this stimulatory effect of protein feeding will overcome the potential blunting effect of metformin on exercise responses. The investigators will investigate these outcomes over a 12-week exercise-training program in older adults with pre-diabetes with or without metformin treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Milk Protein Feeding After Aerobic Exercise in Older Adults With Pre-diabetes Taking the Biguanide Metformin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study. 60 men and women over the age of 55 with indications of pre-diabetes will be recruited for participation and randomly assigned to one of four 12 week exercise training programs: 1)Supervised aerobic exercise 3 days per week followed by a carbohydrate drink along with daily oral administration of Metformin. 2) Supervised aerobic exercise 3 days per week followed by a protein drink along with daily oral administration of Metformin. 3) Supervised aerobic exercise 3 days per week followed by a carbohydrate drink along with daily oral administration of matching placebo. 4) Supervised aerobic exercise 3 days per week followed by a protein drink along with daily oral administration of placebo. Daily administration of Metformin will begin as one 500 mg tablet for the first week and will increase by 500 mg/day/week until reaching 2000 mg/day by week 4 during a 12 week exercise training program. The titration dosing scheme and taking metformin/placebo with meals will help reduce the most common side effects (i.e.,gastrointestinal discomfort). If participants experience gastrointestinal discomfort, the dose will be lowered to 1500 mg/day.</detailed_description>
