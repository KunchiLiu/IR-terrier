	<brief_summary>This study is a pilot, randomized controlled trial to provide feasibility and conduct preliminary analyses on physical (strength and stretch) mechanisms associated with a yoga intervention for non-specific chronic low back pain (cLBP). Recent large-scale trials have demonstrated the efficacy of a yoga intervention for cLBP however, many types of yoga classes are available to the public and a specialized yoga protocol for individuals with cLBP is needed. This study's goal is to quantify trunk strength and flexibility to better understand how these potential physical mechanisms specifically lead to improvement in pain-related outcomes including pain and disability. This knowledge will be used to design a large scale trial of mechanisms of yoga for cLBP. For this pilot study, 40 participants will be randomized to either a yoga intervention (N=20) or to a usual care group (N=20) that will receive The Back Pain Helpbook, a mind-body self-care program for better living. The yoga intervention will be offered weekly yoga classes and instructional materials will be provided for home practice.</brief_summary>
