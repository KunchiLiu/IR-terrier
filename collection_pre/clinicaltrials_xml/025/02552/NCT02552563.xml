	<brief_summary>This pilot study seeks to examine the extent to which, relative to usual care, a dementia care management program for veterans and their caregivers (CGs)improves patient (e.g., behavioral symptoms, delayed nursing home placement) and caregiver (e.g., CG mastery, burden, affect) outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Engaging Caregivers in Dementia Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dementia care guidelines and pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments have been shown to reduce symptom burden and rates of institutionalization for individuals with dementia. However, there remain a variety of factors that complicate dementia care management in primary care settings. Patient-centered, integrated care management programs that involve caregiver (CG) education and psychosocial support may help facilitate access to and use of services and improve outcomes. The aims of this pilot were to examine 1) whether, relative to usual care (UC), a dementia care management program is associated with improved CG (e.g., mastery, burden, affect) and patient (e.g., behavioral symptoms) outcomes, 2) if, relative to UC, participants enrolled in the program have greater perceived access to and use of medical, social, and community/VA services, and 3) whether the dementia care management program is feasible and acceptable to participants.</detailed_description>
