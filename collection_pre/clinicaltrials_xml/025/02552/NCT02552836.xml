	<brief_title>Efficacy of Psychotherapy for Depressed Parkinson`s Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is to determine whether IPT is more efficacious than an intervention that controls for non-specific factors (i.e., supportive psychotherapy) in reducing depressive symptoms. A secondary aim is to determine whether IPT is better than supportive therapy in improving quality of life, interpersonal functioning, attachment patters, and motor symptoms, and whether treatment gains are durable at 6-months follow-up. An exploratory aim of the study is identify moderators and mediators of treatment outcome. Patients who meet study criteria will be randomly assigned to either 12 sessions of IPT or 12 sessions of supportive therapy. The primary efficacy measure (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) will be administered at baseline, weeks 6 and 12, and at 6 months follow-up.</detailed_description>
