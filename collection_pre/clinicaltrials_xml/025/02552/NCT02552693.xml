	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effectiveness of an enhanced package of support for activities described in the "Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Patient Tracing in Health Facilities in Zimbabwe". This package is intended to increase the effectiveness of active patient tracing activities by developing tools, providing mentorship and implementing systematic review of processes to improve communication, coordination, and supervision between community health workers and facility-based staff.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The TracTOR (Tracking and Tracing Operations Research) Study -- Zimbabwe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consists of a pre-/post- intervention rapid assessment of SOP implementation in study health facilities. The rapid assessment includes a facility audit, and the cross-verification of Mother-baby pair service records, and scheduled appointments. Following the baseline rapid assessment, the research team implements the proposed intervention package in health facilities randomly assigned to the intervention arm of the study. Data collectors conduct monthly visits to study facilities in order to extract appointment attendance information from PMTCT, ART, pharmacy, HIV exposed infants (HEI), and early infant diagnoses (EID) service registers.</detailed_description>

Infant was born between October 1st, 2013 and March 30th, 2015, or initiates HIV exposed infant services within the first seven months of the data collection period 3. Mothers and infants are assigned unique facilityissued ID numbers that can be used to pair their records, and link service attendance between clinical units, and over time 4.

Based on guidelines in the SOP, MBP cannot be classified as lost to followup at beginning of data collection period Community Health Workers (CHW): 1.
