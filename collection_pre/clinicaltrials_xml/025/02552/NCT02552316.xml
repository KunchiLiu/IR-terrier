	<brief_summary>The ASPIRE study is a clinical trial designed to examine the microbes (e.g., bacteria) within psoriasis skin lesions compared with normal skin. The investigators will also examine the effect of NB-UVB (narrow-band ultraviolet B) phototherapy (i.e., light therapy) on skin microbes.</brief_summary>

Subject is receiving therapy for psoriasis that requires a wash out period of more than 14 days (e.g., psoralenUVA phototherapy, oral systemic therapy, biologic therapy, or other investigational therapy). 6.
