	<brief_summary>Dystonia in Wilson's disease represent a major issue. The persistence of disabling motor symptoms despite medical treatments justifies conducting a study on deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Wilson's disease (WD). For bradykinetic patients, subthalamic nucleus (STN) could be considered as a better target than the globus pallidus (GPi). For patients with hyperkinetic dystonia, the internal globus pallidus (GPi) will be chosen as the target of DBS. The investigators hypothesize that STN DBS will improve Wilson's disease patients, who, despite copper chelators drugs, are still impaired by severe dystonia and akinesia (more or less associated with other movement disorders). The investigators primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of STN/GPi DBS on dystonia associated with Wilson's disease. Secondary objectives: - To evaluate the impact of STN/GPi DBS on other movements disorders (tremor, Parkinsonism, chorea) observed in Wilson's disease. - To describe cognitive status of patients and to evaluate the consequences of STN/GPi DBS on cognition and behavioral aspects of the disease. - To evaluate the consequences of the stimulation on speech and swallowing. - To evaluate the social impact of STN/GPi DBS in Wilson's disease. - To evaluate the safety of STN/GPi DBS in the specific context of Wilson's disease.</brief_summary>
