	<brief_summary>The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a functioning and clinically feasible method for restoring function to motor-impaired stroke survivors. This ultimate goal will be approached through two different means. The first method is to develop a functioning brain-computer interface that operates based on cortical activity ipsilateral to an intended movement on the motor-impaired side of the body. And secondly, to develop new methods of rehabilitation that involve stimulating peripheral muscles based upon cortical activity ipsilateral to intended movements. Finally, the study seeks to assess changes in functional connectivity as a result of using a BCI device.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will be carried out in two phases designed to achieve the objectives described above. The first phase will determine the feasibility of recording ipsilateral (contralesional) motor commands and use the signals to control a computer. This phase will involve recording EEG signals during the performance of real and imagined motor movements of both the impaired and non-impaired hand in stroke survivors. After recording the signals and analyzing the data, the signals will be used to try to control a cursor on a computer screen or a robotic hand. The second phase of the study will determine if the BCI system can be used to impact rehabilitation. Motor commands would be performed as in phase 1 to determine the accompanying EEG signals. The EEG signals would then be used to control stimulation of the impaired limb. Rehabilitation would be assessed by examining changes in commonly used functional motor scores.
