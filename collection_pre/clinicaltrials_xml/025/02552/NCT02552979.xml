APT seems to have a better specificity than the IgE methods and seems to reflect late-phase clinical reactions.The aims of this study were to evaluate: (i) The prevalence of positive reaction of APTs for atopic dermatitis (ii)Positive reaction of APT compare with skin prick test. (iii)Positive reaction of APT using lyophilized food vs commercially available food extracts. (iv)Side effect or adverse</detailed_description>
