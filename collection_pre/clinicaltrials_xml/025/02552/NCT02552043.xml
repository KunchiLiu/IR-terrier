	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a long-term domiciliary exercise program using the Wii video game platform as a training modality in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. Investigators hypothesize that an exercise program performed by active videogames (AVG) will produce an improvement in exercise tolerance and muscular strength to be maintained over time in young CF patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized and longitudinal trial. Participants will be randomize in 2 groups: control group (CG) and experimental group (EG), by the Â©GrapfPad Software, Inc. The CG will carry out their routine patient management, and the EG will perform also a domiciliary Pulmonary Rehabilitation program of 30-60 min exercise, 5 days/week during 6 weeks using a Nintendo WiiTM platform with the game EA SPORTS ACTIVE 2. Before and after we will measure: 1. exercise tolerance using the six minutes walk test (6MWT) and the modified shuttle walk test (MSWT); 2. muscular strength using horizontal jump test (HJT), medicine ball throw (MBT) and handgrip strength (right hand (HGR); left hand (HGL)); and 3. HRQoL using the 3 versions of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R 6-11, CFQ-R 14+, CFQ-R Parents).</detailed_description>
