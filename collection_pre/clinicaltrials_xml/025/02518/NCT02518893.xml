	<brief_title>Health Research Participation: Experiences and Decisions of Military Members</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent studies of war injuries have included as research participants US military service members returning from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Despite the increased demand for military relevant research, little is known about the recent experiences of service members as research participants or about their research participation decisions. The study aims are to: 1). Describe the experiences of military service members who have participated in health research; 2). Explore the reasons military service members decide for or against participation in health research; and 3). Identify effective strategies for promoting military service members' participation in research. Demographic data will be collected from up to 50 service members who have participated in health research or who have previously declined research participation. Up to 40 service members will participate in individual, in-depth, semi-structured interviews in person or via telephone.</detailed_description>
