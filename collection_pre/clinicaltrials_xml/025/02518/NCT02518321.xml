	<brief_summary>Toileting is a private activity of daily living. Geriatric rehabilitation patients are often unable to toilet themselves independently, leading to embarrassment and loss of self-esteem. Relationships with their caregivers may also become strained. Furthermore, improper toileting hygiene can lead to skin irritation, breakdown and infection. Technology-assisted toilets (TATs) clean and dry the anal and vaginal regions using a stream of water and a fan. They can therefore potentially eliminate the need for patients to be able to wipe themselves. TATs are operated using wall-mounted remote controls. This study will examine the potential benefits of TAT use in geriatric rehabilitation patients. Forty patients aged ≥65 years referred for treatment of physical impairments to the Geriatric Rehabilitation Unit (GRU) of the Elisabeth Bruyère Hospital (EBH) will be recruited for this study. Participants will have a bowel movement on two occasions, once using toilet paper and once using the TAT. The Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale (PIADS), a validated questionnaire, will be used to analyze participants' toileting experience. Participants will be visually evaluated for cleanliness before and after each testing session. The investigators hypothesize that participants will report that, in comparison with use of a standard toilet, toileting using the TAT: 1) is easier to use, 2) improves psychological well-being and 3) is more effective at cleaning than regular wiping techniques.</brief_summary>
