	<brief_title>Effectiveness Study of a Behavioral Teacher Program Targeting ADHD Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Most behavioral teacher programs involve intensive and expensive teacher trainings by health care specialists, which may limit successful large-scale implementation. This behavioral program, on the contrary, involves a self-containing manual that does not require expert training in order to increase the likelihood of successful implementation (if proven effective). The aim was to investigate the program's effects on behavioral, socio-emotional and school functioning in primary school children. Methods: Children with ADHD symptoms were randomly assigned at school level to the intervention condition (receiving the program during 18 weeks) or control group (not receiving the program but who were allowed to receive care as usual). Measures to assess program's effectiveness: - Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD-symptoms and Normal Behavior, - Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - Social Skills Rating Scale - Spence Children's Anxiety Scale - Classroom Observation Code - Actigraphy - Sociometric measures (peer nomination and peer rating) - Dutch arithmetic test (Tempo-Test-Rekenen) - reading test (Drie-Minuten-Toets) and writing test (PI-dictee). Additional measures: - Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Block Design and Vocabulary; used to estimate IQ); - Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire and several neuropsychological computer tasks</detailed_description>
