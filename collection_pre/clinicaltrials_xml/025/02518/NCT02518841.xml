	<brief_summary>The investigators will compare Achilles tendon stretching with a new product called a ThermaWedge™ device, a foam wedge designed to help with certain foot stretches and exercises, in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciopathy. There will be 2 groups each of 25 - 30 participants who have chronic plantar fasciopathy, which is a common cause of foot pain. Exercises will be done for 6 weeks and then each group will do the other exercise protocol for another 6 weeks. Participants will fill out the Foot and Ankle Disability Index scale and numerical analog pain scale and the Global Rating of Change Scale prior to any treatment, weekly during treatment and post treatment. The investigators' hypothesis is that use of the ThermaWedge™ device will result in decreased pain and disability when compared to achilles tendon stretching.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>diagnosis of plantar fasciopathy which has persisted (chronic) for at least 12 months. participants need to be able to understand simple instructions about the stretches which will likely include both verbal instructions and pictures and participants need to be able to do all the necessary exercises. Participants must have current British Columbia (BC) Medical Service Plan (MSP) health coverage so that if they become injured, they are covered medically. Participants must be able to fill out surveys online. Participants must also pass a clinical screen where a senior medical student or a physiotherapist, Scott Fraser, will assess the patient for for plantar fasciopathy/fasciitis. Previous ankle or foot trauma or surgery duration of pain of less than 12 months, those receiving adjuvant treatment such as injections during the time of the study, those who are unable to do the necessary exercises required in the study Those who do not have current BC MSP health insurance coverage.</criteria>
