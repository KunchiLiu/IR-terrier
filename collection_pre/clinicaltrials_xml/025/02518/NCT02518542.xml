	<brief_summary>Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder, which leads to clinical symptoms such as dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain and consecutive weight loss. Although conventional treatment such as laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) and balloon dilatation (BD) can provide sufficient symptom relief in many patients, both interventions have their individual drawbacks. Additionally, treatment after failed LHM or BD can be challenging and in few might even lead to esophagectomy. Per oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) and prolonged dilatation (PRD) are two novel endoscopically performed therapeutic options for achalasia and other esophageal motility disorders. Both not only appear to provide good results, when performed as initial treatment but also might be an excellent option after e.g failed LHM. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy of four different treatment options, such as POEM, PRD with stent-fixation, PD and conventional LHM for achalasia in an individualized treatment setting.</brief_summary>
