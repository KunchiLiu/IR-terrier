	<brief_summary>This double-blind, randomized trial examined whether tramadol wound infiltration decreased postoperative pain following cesarean delivery under general anesthesia or reduced the need for analgesics in the immediate postoperative period. Patients in the tramadol group consumed significantly less morphine at all time intervals than those in the control group. The investigators suggest that the use of wound infiltration with tramadol may be a useful technique in patients who undergo cesarean section under general anesthesia to reduce postoperative pain, improve recovery, and facilitate early contact of mothers with their babies.</brief_summary>
