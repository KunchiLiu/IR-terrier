	<brief_summary>Dysfunctional adipose tissue predisposes to cardiovascular disease. Similarly, the risk of cardiovascular disease appears to be increased in subjects with obstructive sleep apnoea. Reduced adipose tissue oxygen availability has been described in obesity and may also be a mechanism in obstructive sleep apnoea. Hypoxia induces inflammation and fibrosis in adipose tissue which are factors contributing to cardiovascular risk. The investigators hypothesize that adipose tissue's oxygen uptake is reduced in subjects with obstructive sleep apnoea by comparing in vivo AT oxygenation and blood flow in tissue of control subjects.</brief_summary>
