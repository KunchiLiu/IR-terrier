	<brief_title>The Effect of VTC-G15 (a Pentapeptide Cleavage Product og GLP-1) on Whole Body Glucose Metabolism in Man</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators have previously demonstrated that infusion of the pentapeptide during hyperglycemic clamps in dogs significantly increases the glucose infusion rate necessary to maintain stable hyperglycemia without any significant differences in insulin or glucagon secretion. The present study's aim is to examine whether this also occurs in humans. It may be necessary to examine a dose response curve. Specifically, in twenty healthy volunteers glucose infusion rate during the peptide infusion will be compared to the glucose infusion rate during saline administration during a 4 hour hyperglycemic clamp, in a cross over design(mg/kg/min).</detailed_description>
