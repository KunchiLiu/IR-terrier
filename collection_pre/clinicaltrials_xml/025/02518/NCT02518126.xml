	<brief_title>Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Level in Intrauterine Growth Restriction Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During embryonic development, there are several cytokines such as: LIF (Leukemia inhibitory factor), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), epidermal growth factor family (EGF), neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) that were found are associated with neurogenesis and differentiation of brain cells . LIF is a cytokine that is essential for the development of the central nervous system, and has recently been shown in rats that maternal LIF stimulates placental ACTH that in turn promotes secretion of fetal LIF from nRBC , which in turn promotes brain development of the fetus Other studies on IUGR (Intra Uterine Growth Restriction) have shown that IUGR fetuses have more CP (Cerebral palsy) than those who were AGA (Average for Gestational Age) The hypothesis is that LIF is related to the proper development of the nervous system in the fetus and by testing cord blood of embryos IUGR and the placenta we will find changes in LIF and ACTH compared with AGA fetuses level. Studies have also shown a relationship between CP and IUGR, but the mechanism for this relationship is unclear. The purpose of our research is to see if there is a relationship between the level of LIF in IUGR fetuses and compared to the level of LIF in AGA fetuses, in one of two ways: - Changes in the secretion of ACTH in placenta - Changes in levels of LIF in the umbilical cord blood</detailed_description>
