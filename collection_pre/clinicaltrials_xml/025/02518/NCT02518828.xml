	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this pilot trial is to determine whether inpatients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with symptoms suggestive of Acute Heart Failure (AHF), who receive supplemental oxygen adjusted at either a high (SpO2 range ≥96%) or low (SpO2 range 90-92%) oxygen saturation level, leads to greater reduction in N-terminal-proBNP (NT-proBNP) at 72 hours.</brief_summary>
