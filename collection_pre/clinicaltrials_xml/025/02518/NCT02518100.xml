	<brief_title>Vital Signs Patch: Automated Monitoring of Vital Signs Measurements in the In-Patient Hospital Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess the feasibility and usability of the total Vital Signs Patch (VSP) System in an actual hospital environment on in-patients by monitoring specified vital signs. The VSP System will be assessed for incorporation into the study site's Information Technology infrastructure. The VSP measurements will be compared with the predetermined expected results of the established vital signs equipment normally used by the facility based upon clinician protocols. The VSP System can take and monitor patient vital signs in a more reliable and consistent manner by removing the human variability that occurs when clinicians manually take a patient's vital signs. The VSP has been designed to automatically take and monitor the following vital signs: - Arterial blood oxygen Saturation (SpO2) - ECG (up to 3 - Lead) - Heart Rate (Part of ECG) - Surface Temperature - Respiration</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult male and female hospital inpatients Vital signs considered 'stable' by clinical caregivers Pediatric patients Female patients who are pregnant Patients with internal or external defibrillators Patients who have undergone surgery and still have a fresh incision on the chest Patients with skin damage on the chest such as burns, irritation, infections, wounds, etc. Patients who are in the Critical Care Unit (CCU) Patients who otherwise satisfy any of the contraindications associated with the VSP system.</criteria>
