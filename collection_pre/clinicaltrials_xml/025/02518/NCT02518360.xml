	<brief_title>Osteopathic Treatment in Patients With Low Back Pain: Stabilometry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty patients participate in this study (25 experimental group with body adjustment protocol of osteopathy and 25 control group). For a first objective of this study, all the patients determine if the osteopathic approach to the body adjustment approach will improve low back pain (Oswestry Questionnaire). For the second aim, the investigators want to know if there are changes in the distribution of body weight in lower limbs in group experimental and control group, analyzed with a stabilometric platform (Footscan®). The experimental group is treated with osteopathy, three sessions (20 minutes/session) and a frequency one session/week. The treatment osteopathic is the body adjustment protocol. In the other hand, the control group made 2 stretching global postures once a week (10 minutes for each posture) for three weeks: the first was for the anterior muscular chain and the second posture to stretch the posterior muscle chain. Before treatment, immediately after the last session and a month later, are measured stabilometric parameters, height and Oswestry. The analysis will be made with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Statistics) 22.0</detailed_description>
