	<detailed_description>The investigators propose the following two specific aims in a randomized crossover placebo-controlled trial in participants with two or more features of the metabolic syndrome and symptomatic osteoarthritis in this 12-week efficacy study: Aim 1: To assess the effects of strawberries on biomarkers of inflammation [serum levels of C-reactive protein: CRP; inflammatory cytokines: interleukin-6: IL-6; interleukin 1β: IL-1β; tumor necrosis factor-alpha: TNFα] Aim 2: To assess the effects of strawberries on knee function as assessed by overall musculoskeletal examination and pain score (ICOAP and HAQ-DI).</detailed_description>
