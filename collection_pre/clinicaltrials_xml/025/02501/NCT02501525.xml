	<brief_summary>This study will include patients aged between 18 and 70 who will undergo retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) due to renal stone(s). A total of 80 patients (male or female) will be recruited, and will be randomized into 2 groups consisting of 40 patients in each group. The first group of patients will undergo RIRS with a ureteral access sheath (UAS) positioned prior to surgery; and the second group will undergo RIRS without UAS. As use of UAS decreases the pressure in the renal pelvis during RIRS, it is aimed to evaluate whether using UAS or not affects the level of pain felt by patients in the postoperative period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Ureteral Access Sheath Use on Postoperative Pain Level in Patients Undergoing RIRS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The level of pain of the patients in both groups will be evaluated by using visual analog score (VAS) and verbal rating score (VRS) in the postoperative 0 min (the moment patients gets consciousness after he/she wakes up from general anesthesia), 10th min, 30th min, 60th min and 120th min.</detailed_description>
