	<brief_summary>Drawing on a vertical surface, such as a blackboard (rather than a horizontal surface) is often used by occupational therapists as a way of developing fine motor control and visual motor integration in children. While there is anecdotal evidence to support this intervention, preliminary results in healthy children showed no differences in graphical quality while drawing on vertical or horizontal surfaces. This however was not investigated in children with graphomotor impairments. The goal of this study is to determine whether movements produced on a vertical surface differ in their performance level and muscle activation patterns compared to movements produced on a horizontal surface. The investigators predict that the level of performance on the vertical surface will exceed the level of performance on the horizontal surface. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that the proximal muscles will be more activated and fatigued (in longer tasks) while drawing on the vertical surface, while the distal muscle will be more activated and fatigued while drawing on the horizontal surface.</brief_summary>
