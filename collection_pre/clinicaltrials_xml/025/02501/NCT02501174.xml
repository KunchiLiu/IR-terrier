	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to establish a common geriatric oncology medical database. The patients concerned are the patients having benefited from a geriatric oncology consultation in one of the participating centres. This database is designed with a view on the one hand to better describe to better understand this population and on the other hand to facilitate the conduct of future retrospective or prospective studies on this population. The constitution of this observatory of patients seen in consultation should facilitate the development of studies from the analysis of data collected, and occasional surveys by the rapid identification of cases. Data from this database could provide clinicians with valuable informative elements of descriptive epidemiology and concerning the organization of care in the geriatric oncology field.</brief_summary>
