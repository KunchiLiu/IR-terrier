	<brief_summary>Hemodialysis patients may experience drops in blood oxygen saturation during the hemodialysis treatment, which may lead to hypoxia in the tissues. The investigators hypothesize that: 1. The cumulative number, severity, or other characteristics of such deoxygenation episodes may be a predictor of adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients. 2. There may be demographic, anthropometric, clinical, treatment prescription, lab analytical, and other parameters that correlate with the number and severity of deoxygenation episodes and, therefore, may be used for risk stratification. Further, some of these parameters may be modifiable.</brief_summary>
