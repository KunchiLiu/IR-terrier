	<brief_summary>In recent years, it has been observed that the type 2 diabetic patients (DM-2) have an increased risk of developing dementia, both vascular and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes a transition state between normal cognitive function and dementia. The annual rate of conversion to dementia in MCI patients is around 15% in the general population, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. At present it is not possible to identify which patients with MCI are most likely to progress to AD. On this basis, the main objective of this study is to evaluate whether the presence of diabetes and or the presence of its related genes favors the conversion of MCI to AD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In recent years, it has been observed that the type 2 diabetic patients (DM-2) have an increased risk of developing dementia, both vascular and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes a transition state between normal cognitive function and dementia. The annual rate of conversion to dementia in MCI patients is around 15% in the general population, ie regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. At present it is not possible to identify which patients with MCI are most likely to progress to AD. On this basis, the main objective of this study is to evaluate whether the presence of diabetes favors the conversion of MCI to AD. We propose a case-control study comparing a group of 110 diabetic patients and a group of 110 non-diabetic patients with MCI matched by age, sex and cardiovascular risk factors. The main objective is the conversion to AD between the groups and if DM-2 is an independent risk factor. The secondary objective is to investigate whether genetic mechanisms related both to AD and DM-2 are associated with the increased risk of AD in diabetic patients. We will analyze 10 genes simultaneously associated with an increased risk of diabetes and / or its complications and AD.</detailed_description>
