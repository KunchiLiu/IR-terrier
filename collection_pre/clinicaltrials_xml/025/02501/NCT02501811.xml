	<brief_summary>This is a phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to assess feasibility, safety, and effect of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and c-kit+ cardiac stem cells (CSCs) both alone and in combination (Combo), compared to placebo (cell-free Plasmalyte-A medium) as well as each other, administered by transendocardial injection in subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effect of Combo, MSCs alone, and CSCs alone compared with placebo as well as each other in subjects with heart failure of ischemic etiology. Following a successful lead-in phase, a total of one hundred forty-four (144) subjects will be randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive Combo, MSCs, CSCs, or placebo. After randomization, baseline imaging, relevant harvest procedures, and study product injection, subjects will be followed up at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post study product injection. All subjects will receive study product injection (cells or placebo) using the NOGA® XP Mapping and Navigation System. Subjects will have delayed-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DEMRI) scans to assess scar size and LV function and structure at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post study product administration. All endpoints will be assessed at the 6 and 12 month visits which will occur 180 ±30 days and 365 ±30 days respectively from the day of study product injection (Day 0). For the purpose of the endpoint analysis and safety evaluations, the Investigators will utilize an "intention-to-treat" study population, however an as treated analysis will also be conducted.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Be ≥ 21 and &lt;80 years of age 2. Have documented coronary artery disease (CAD) with evidence of myocardial injury, LV dysfunction, and clinical evidence of HF 3. Have a "detectable" area of myocardial injury defined as ≥ 5% LV involvement (infarct volume) and any subendocardial involvement by cMRI 4. Have an EF ≤ 40% by cMRI 5. Be receiving guideline‐driven medical therapy for heart failure at stable and tolerated doses for ≥ 1 month prior to consent. For beta‐blockade "stable" is defined as no greater than a 50% reduction in dose or no more than a 100% increase in dose. 6. Be a candidate for cardiac catheterization 7. Have New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III heart failure symptoms 8. If a female of childbearing potential, be willing to use one form of birth control for the duration of the study, and undergo a pregnancy test at baseline and within 36 hours prior to injection 1. Indication for standardofcare surgery (including valve surgery, placement of leftventricular assist device, or heart transplantation), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure, and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the treatment of ischemic and/or valvular heart disease. Subjects who require or undergo PCI should undergo these procedures a minimum of 3 months in advance of randomization. Subjects who require or undergo CABG should undergo these procedures a minimum of 4 months in advance of randomization. In addition, subjects who develop a need for revascularization following enrollment should undergo revascularization without delay. 2. Valvular heart disease including 1) mechanical or bioprosthetic heart valve; or 2) severe (any valve) insufficiency/regurgitation within 12 months of consent 3. Aortic stenosis with valve area ≤ 1.5 cm2 4. History of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke within 90 days of consent 5. History of a left ventricular remodeling surgical procedure utilizing prosthetic material 6. Presence of a pacemaker and/or implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) generator with any of the following limitations/conditions: manufactured before the year 2000 leads implanted &lt; 6 weeks prior to consent nontransvenous epicardial, or abandoned leads subcutaneous ICDs leadless pacemakers any other condition that, in the judgment of devicetrained staff, would deem an MRI contraindicated 7. Pacemakerdependence with an ICD (Note: pacemakerdependent candidates without an ICD are not excluded) 8. A cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device implanted less than 3 months prior to consent 9. Other MRI contraindications (e.g. patient body habitus incompatible with MRI) 10. An appropriate ICD firing or antitachycardia pacing (ATP) for ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia within 30 days of consent 11. Ventricular tachycardia ≥ 20 consecutive beats without an ICD within 3 months of consent, or symptomatic Mobitz II or higher degree atrioventricular block without a functioning pacemaker within 3 months of consent 12. Presence of LV thrombus 13. Evidence of active myocarditis 14. Baseline maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) greater than 75% of age and gender based predictive values 15. Baseline eGFR &lt;35 ml/min/1.73m2 16. Poorly controlled blood glucose levels (HbA1c &gt; 8.5%) and/or history of proliferative retinopathy 17. Hematologic abnormality evidenced by hematocrit &lt; 25%, white blood cell &lt; 2,500/ul or platelet count &lt; 100,000/ul 18. Liver dysfunction evidenced by enzymes (AST and ALT) ˃ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) 19. Coagulopathy (INR ≥ 1.3) not due to a reversible cause (e.g., warfarin and/or Factor Xa inhibitors). Subjects who cannot be withdrawn from anticoagulation will be excluded. 20. HIV and/or active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) 21. Allergy to radiographic contrast material that cannot adequately be managed by premedication 22. Known allergies to penicillin or streptomycin 23. History of organ or cell transplantation, except for transplantation of bone, skin, ligament, tendon, or cornea 24. History of malignancy within 5 years (i.e., subjects with prior malignancy must be disease free for 5 years), excluding basal cell carcinoma with clean border pathology report and cervical carcinoma in situ which have been definitively treated 25. Condition that limits lifespan to &lt; 1 year 26. History of drug abuse (illegal "street" drugs except marijuana, or prescription medications not being used appropriately for a preexisting medical condition) or alcohol abuse (≥ 5 drinks/day for ˃ 3 months), or documented medical, occupational, or legal problems arising from the use of alcohol or drugs within the past 24 months 27. Chronic immunosuppressant therapy such as corticosteroids or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) antagonists 28. Participation in an investigational therapeutic or device trial within 30 days of consent 29. Cognitive or language barriers that prohibit obtaining informed consent or any study elements 30. Pregnancy or lactation or plans to become pregnant in the next 12 months 31. Any other condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator or Sponsor, would impair enrollment, study product administration, or followup</criteria>
