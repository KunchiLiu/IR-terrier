	<brief_summary>Background. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and was associated with greater morbidity, mortality (including suicide), and healthcare costs. By 2030, MDD will become the leading cause of disability in high-income countries. Notably, among patients with a previous experience of a major depressive episode, it was indeed estimated that up to 85% of those patients will suffer from relapse. Two main factors were associated with a significantly higher risk of relapse: poor medication adherence and low self-efficacy in disease management. Interestingly, these issues could become the targets of psychoeducational programs for chronic diseases. Inded psychoeducational program for depression are recommended in international guidelines, but have not yet been proposed in France. Methods/Design: The investigators propose to evaluate the first French psychoeducational program for depression named "ENVIE" in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Its aim is to educate patients on the latest knowledge on depression and effective treatments through didactic and interactive sessions. Patients will experiment the latest innovating psychological skills (from acceptance and commitment therapy) to cope with depressive symptoms and maintain motivation in behavioral activation. In total, 332 unipolar non-chronic (&lt; 2 years) outpatients with moderate to severe depression, without psychotic features, will be randomly allocated to the add-on ENVIE program (N=166) or to a waiting list (N=166). The follow-up will last 15 months and include 5 assessment visits (enrollment, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 months). Discussion. If the proposed trial shows the effectiveness of the intervention, but also an increased remission rate in depressed outpatients at 15-months post-inclusion, in addition to improved treatment adherence in patients, it will further promotes arguments in favor of a wide dissemination of psychoeducational programs for depression.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to study the rate of remission at 15-month follow-up and time to achieve remission of index episode in a multicentric randomized controlled trial using ENVIE program and treatment as usual versus treatment as usual only. The investigators will include depressed subjects suffering from non a first depressive episode as well as recurrent episode.The eligible patients will be randomized into two groups (computer-generated randomisation in a 1 :1 ratio, blocked in groups of 4, stratified on the number of episodes : 1 , 2 , 3 and more). Only outpatients consulting in the investigation centres will be recruited. Sociodemographic data, psychiatric diagnoses using Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) and Screening Interview for Axis II Disorder (SCID-II) for borderline personality disorder, pharmacological treatment will be also recorded.Patients will be assessed by clinicians blind to treatment allocation, at inclusion (before intervention) and at 3 months (end of the intervention), 6, 9 and 15 months after the inclusion.</detailed_description>
