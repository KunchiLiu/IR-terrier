	<brief_summary>The Kinesio Taping (KT ) method was developed more than thirty years ago in order to cause sensory effects through the epidermis and dermis, generating a variety of physiological effects in other systems. Clinical effects are well known levels in muscle, neurological system, injuries, inflammation, edema, among other physiological effects are thus largely in the theoretical framework. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the Electromyographic (EMG), Electroencephalographic (EEG), muscle temperature and flexibility effects with the Rectus Femoral muscle KT application. Methods: This is a pilot study with six subjects in which they were divided into two groups, A and B. Group A received the application of KT from muscle Origin to Insertion and group B Insertion to Origin, with both groups taped the non-dominant limb and the dominant limb was used as control group. The first application was conducted at 0% and the second with 75 to 100% tension. Evaluations were performed before the first application, immediately and 24 hours later. After this last evaluation, was withdrawn taping, evaluated without taping, reapplied 75 to 100 % of rated voltage and in sequence. The sixth last review was conducted 24 hours after this last application. Before every application a specific vibration was performed on the patellar tendon in order to trigger a neurophysiological imbalance rectus femoral.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Individuals who have authorized the evaluation procedure and through the Term Informed Consent; Individuals male and female of any race, duly enrolled in some college course of Universidade Salgado de Oliveira aged between 1850 years old; Healthy subjects without disorders of locomotion without injury history the last 6 months in the lower limbs. They are considered unfit for research individuals who do not meet the requirements listed above ; Individuals who have higher body mass index (BMI ) to 24.99, as the concentrated presence of fat on muscles can limit the effect of bracing; Individuals with musculoskeletal disorders and referring pain. Since there report that the pain and dysfunction of movement restricted range of motion and function muscular18 ; Individuals who possess too much on the thigh in which prevent proper attachment of bracing and the EMG electrode , or who refuse to perform the trichotomy . they show taping allergy ( an allergy test by putting a small bandage on the skin will be held and observed for 24 hours ) ; Patients with any contraindication how physical activity according to the guideline of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM , 1995), nerve root involvement, cardiorespiratory conditions and pregnancy .</criteria>
