	<brief_summary>Blepharoptosis, inferodisplacement of the upper eyelid, can be congenital or acquired. Acquired Blepharoptosis is usually aponeurotic, due to stretching or disinsertion of the levator aponeurosis. Treatment is surgical and can be performed by three common procedures - Levator advancement, MÃ¼ller's muscle-conjunctival resection procedure and White line advancement. A number of reports inspected the possibility that Blepharoptosis repair procedures may cause deterioration in dry eye status. The investigators would like to assess whether there is a difference between the different procedures in their influence on dry eye status.</brief_summary>
