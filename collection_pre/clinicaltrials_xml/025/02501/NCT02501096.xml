	<brief_summary>This is an open-label Phase 1b/2 trial of lenvatinib (E7080) plus pembrolizumab in participants with selected solid tumors. Phase 1b will determine and confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for lenvatinib in combination with 200 milligrams (mg) (intravenous [IV], every 3 weeks [Q3W]) pembrolizumab in participants with selected solid tumors (i.e. non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or melanoma). Phase 2 (Expansion) will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination in 6 cohorts at the MTD from Phase 1b (lenvatinib 20 mg/day orally + pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W, IV).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Phase 1b: Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed metastatic selected solid tumor types that have progressed after treatment with approved therapies or for which there are no standard effective therapies available. If nivolumab or pembrolizumab is an approved therapy for the participant's tumor type, but the participant has not been treated with it, the Investigator may enroll the participant in this study. Phase 2: Up to two prior lines of systemic therapy in the selected tumor types described above (unless discussed with the sponsor) For the nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma cohorts, participants must have progressed on or after prior treatment with one antiPD1, antiPDL1, or antiPDL2 agent Selected tumor types of both phases: NSCLC, predominantly clear cell renal cell carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or melanoma (excluding uveal melanoma) 2. Life expectancy of 12 weeks or more 3. Phase 2: Measurable disease meeting the following criteria: 1. At least 1 lesion of greater than or equal to 10 mm in the longest diameter for a nonlymph node or greater than or equal to 15 mm in the shortaxis diameter for a lymph node that is serially measurable according to irRECIST (immunerelated RECIST) using computerized tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) 2. Lesions that have had external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or locoregional therapies such as radiofrequency (RF) ablation must show subsequent evidence of substantial size increase to be deemed a target lesion 4. Participants must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 1 5. Adequately controlled blood pressure (BP) with or without antihypertensive medications, defined as BP less than or equal to 150/90 mmHg at screening and no change in antihypertensive medications within 1 week prior to the Cycle 1 Day 1 6. Adequate renal function defined as creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN (upper limit of normal) or calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 40 mL/min per the Cockcroft and Gault formula with creatinine levels greater than 1.5 X ULN 7. Adequate bone marrow function: 1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1500/mm3 (greater than or equal to 1.5 X 103/uL) 2. Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3 (greater than or equal to 100 X 109/L) 3. Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL 8. Adequate blood coagulation function as evidenced by an International Normalized Ratio (INR) less than or equal to 1.5 9. Adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the ULN and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to 3 X ULN (in the case of liver metastases less than or equal to 5 X ULN). In case ALP is greater than 3 X ULN (in the absence of liver metastases) or greater than 5 X ULN (in the presence of liver metastases) AND the participant also is known to have bone metastases, the liver specific ALP must be separated from the total and used to assess the liver function instead of the total ALP 10. Males or females age greater than or equal to 18 years at the time of informed consent 11. Participants with known brain metastases will be eligible if they have completed the primary brain therapy (such as whole brain radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, or complete surgical resection) and if they have remained clinically stable, asymptomatic, and off of steroids for at least 28 days 12. All females must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [BhCG]) at the Screening Visit and the Baseline Visit. A pregnancy test needs to be performed within 72 hours of the first dose of study drug. Females of childbearing potential, if not practicing total abstinence or having a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia, must agree to use two highly effective methods of contraception, eg, 1) an intrauterine device [IUD], or intrauterine system (IUS); 2) a barrier method such as condom or occlusive cup (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) + spermicide (foam, gel, cream, etc.); 3) oral, injected, or implanted hormonal contraceptives throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after study treatment discontinuation. Use of a doublebarrier method (ie, use at the same time of a condom + occlusive cup [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] + spermicide [foam, gel, cream, etc.]) is accepted as two highly effective methods of contraception. The only participants who will be exempt from this requirement are postmenopausal women (defined as women who have been amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age group, without other known or suspected primary cause) or participants who have been sterilized surgically or who are otherwise proven sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation with surgery at least 1 month prior to dosing, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy with surgery at least 1 month prior to dosing). All women who are of reproductive potential and who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use contraception (as described above) for the duration of the study through 120 days after the last dose and for 120 days after study drug discontinuation. 13. Male participants who are partners of women of childbearing potential must use a condom + spermicide and their female partners if of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception (see methods described in Inclusion Criterion #12) beginning at least 1 menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug(s), throughout the entire study period, and for 120 days after the last dose of study drug, unless the male participants are totally sexually abstinent or have undergone a successful vasectomy with confirmed azoospermia or unless the female partners have been sterilized surgically or are otherwise proven sterile. 14. Voluntary agreement to provide written informed consent and the willingness and ability to comply with all aspects of the protocol 15. Archival tumor tissue or a newly obtained biopsy must be available prior to the first dose of study drug for biomarker analysis. In the case archival tissue cannot be provided, participants with inaccessible tumors for biopsy specimens can be enrolled without a biopsy upon consultation and agreement by the sponsor Note: In case of submitting unstained cut slides, freshly cut slides should be submitted to the testing laboratory within 14 days from when the slides are cut 1. Prior anticancer treatment within 28 days (or 5 times the halflife time, whichever is shorter) or any investigational agent within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drugs. All acute toxicities related to prior treatments must be resolved to Grade less than or equal to 1 2. Participants must have recovered adequately from any toxicity and/or complications from major surgery prior to starting therapy 3. Participants having greater than 1+ proteinuria on urinalysis will undergo 24h urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Participants with urine protein greater than or equal to 1 g/24hour will be ineligible. 4. Gastrointestinal malabsorption, gastrointestinal anastomosis, or any other condition that might affect the absorption of lenvatinib 5. New York Heart Association congestive heart failure of grade II or above, unstable angina, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, or serious cardiac arrhythmia associated with significant cardiovascular impairment within the past 6 months 6. Prolongation of QTc interval to greater than 480 msec 7. Active hemoptysis (bright red blood of at least 0.5 teaspoon) within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug 8.

Serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture 11. Known intolerance to either of the study drugs (or any of the excipients) 12. History of organ allograft 13. Biologic response modifiers (eg, granulocyte colonystimulating factor) within 4 weeks before study entry. Chronic erythropoietin therapy is permitted provided that no dose adjustments were made within 2 months before first dose of study treatment 14. Any medical or other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in a clinical trial 15. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding 16. Excluding the primary tumor leading to enrollment in this study, any other active malignancy (except for definitively treated melanoma insitu, basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma insitu of the bladder or cervix) within the past 24 months 17. Prior treatment with lenvatinib or any PD1, antiPDL1, or antiPDL2 agent, excluding melanoma and NSCLC where prior treatment with one PD1, antiPDL1, or antiPDL2 agent is allowed 18. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids (up to 7.5mg/d of prednisone or equivalent) may be approved after consultation with the sponsor. 19. No active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (ie, with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. 20. Has a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis 21. Has received a livevirus vaccination within 30 days of planned treatment start.
