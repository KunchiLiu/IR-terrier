	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this project is to conduct a randomized controlled pilot study evaluating the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a newly developed combined Health At Every Size and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (HAES/ACT) treatment, known as Accept Yourself! compared to a commercial behavioral weight loss program, Weight Watchers (WW). Obese women (BMI â‰¥ 30) with Major Depressive Disorder will be randomly assigned to one of these two treatments. Depression, physical health, and other psychosocial outcomes will be assessed prior to treatment, at post-treatment, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12-month follow up assessments.</brief_summary>
