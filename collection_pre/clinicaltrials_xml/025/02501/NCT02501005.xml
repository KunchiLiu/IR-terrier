	<brief_summary>The BERLIN VT study is designed to evaluate the impact of prophylactic ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation on all-cause mortality and unplanned hospital admission for congestive heart failure or symptomatic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VF) when compared to VT ablation after the third appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shock.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. History of remote myocardial infarction 2. Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 30 to ≤ 50 % as estimated by cardiac MRI, 3Dechocardiography or via ventriculography within 30 days before enrollment 3. Documentation of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) by any kind of Electrocardiography (ECG) including 12 lead ECG, holter ECG, rhythm strip, event monitoring, event recorder or pacemaker within 30 days before enrollment 4. Implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) indication for secondary prevention 5. Patients who are planned to be implanted with BIOTRONIK ICDs (single, dual, triple chamber or DX device) 6. Patient has provided written informed consent 7. Patient accepts activation of Home Monitoring® 1. Age &lt; 18 years or &gt; 80 years 2. Known arterial or venous thrombosis 3. Class IV New York Heart Association (NYHA) heart failure 4. Valvular heart disease or mechanical heart valve precluding access to the left ventricle 5. Acute myocardial reinfarction or acute coronary syndrome 6. Cardiac surgery involving cardiotomy within the past 2 months 7. Patients requiring chronic renal dialysis 8. Thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy 9. Incessant VT or electrical storm 10. Bundle branch reentry tachycardia as the presenting VT 11. Preexisting implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) 12. Pregnancy or breast feeding women 13. Acute illness or active systemic infection 14. Other disease process likely to limit survival to less than 12 months 15. Significant medical problem that in the opinion of the principal investigator would preclude enrollment in the study 16. Unwillingness to participate or lack of availability for followup 17. Participation in another interventional clinical investigation during the course of the study, i.e. the participation in a noninterventional clinical investigation is allowed.</criteria>
