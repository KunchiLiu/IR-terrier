	<brief_title>Modulation of Biomarkers in Patients With Flesh-eating Bacterial Infections After With Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) is a complex, multi-factorial disease and the bacteria show a diverse microbial etiology. The exentisive inflammatory response caused by these bacteria is thought to be a main course of death. In Denmark, most NSTI patients are treated with hyperic oxygen therapy (HBOT). However, the effects of HBOT have never been investigated in NSTI patients. Location: Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark. Design: Observational cohort study. Cohort: NSTI patients in Denmark treated with HBOT. Biomarkers: Cytokines, acute-phase proteins, vasoactive biomarkers and other inflammatory biomarkers. Sample size calculation: The investigators expect a mean IL-6 concentration before HBOT of 3500 pg/ml (standard deviation 1500 pg/ml) and consider a reduction of 800 pg/ml to be clinically relevant. With an alpha = 0.05 and a power of 80%, 112 patients will be required. Data: The Danish Data Protection Agency has approved the processing of personal data for the NSTI patients (J. no. 30-0900). Ethics: The trial will adhere to the Helsinki Declaration and the Danish law. The National Ethics Committee and the Regional Scientific Ethics Committee of Copenhagen have approved the study (CVK-1211709 and H-2-2014-071). Analysis: Biomarker analyses will be performed once the recruitment of patients has ended.</detailed_description>
