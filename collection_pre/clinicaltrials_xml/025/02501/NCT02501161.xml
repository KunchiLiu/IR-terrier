	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. The purpose is to compare long-term glycaemic control of insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) versus insulin glargine (IGlar) in insulin naïve subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with oral anti diabetics.</brief_summary>
