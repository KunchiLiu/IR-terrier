	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of interventions for drinking-reduction and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among HIV-positive primary care patients. The interventions consist of brief meetings to discuss drinking and ART adherence enhanced with daily self-monitoring through the use of a smart phone application that tracks drinking and other aspects of health. These meetings will either be based on the Clinician's Guide, a brief intervention for heavy drinking in primary care settings advocated by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, or Motivational Interviewing. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 30, 60, 90 days, 6 and 12 months after baseline. By the end of treatment (60 days) and throughout the follow-up period, alcohol use is expected to highest among participants who receive the Clinician's Guide alone, intermediate among participants who receive the enhanced Clinician's Guide, and lowest among participants who receive enhanced Motivational Interviewing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reducing Alcohol Dependence Among HIV-Positive Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV infection is a widespread health problem in the U.S. Antiretroviral (ART) therapy has increased longevity and changed the nature of risk factors for morbidity and mortality. Alcohol consumption has become an increasingly serious health issue among HIV primary care patients. Drinking is a key factor in progression to severe liver damage (especially those co-infected with hepatitis), and liver disease is now one of the most common causes of death among those with HIV. Excess drinking is also associated with medication noncompliance, reduces the effect of antiretroviral treatment, and is linked to other health problems. Therefore, helping HIV patients reduce unsafe drinking is crucial to their long-term health. This study aims to evaluate two evidence-based approaches when combined with an innovative smart phone application designed to help users track drinking and other aspects of health. An effective, easily implemented alcohol-reduction intervention could be incorporated into standard care in HIV clinics to help prevent or slow the progress of some medical problems in HIV-infected individuals, improve medication compliance, prolong lifespan and decrease risk behavior associated with alcohol use.</detailed_description>
