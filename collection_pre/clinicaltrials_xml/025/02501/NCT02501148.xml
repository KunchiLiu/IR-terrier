	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Carotid Stenosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Documented stenotic atherosclerotic lesion located at carotid bifurcation and / or proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) Subject is either (A) symptomatic within 6 months of procedure, with an ipsilateral carotid stenosis ≥ 50% by angiography, or (B) asymptomatic with carotid stenosis ≥ 70% by angiography Target lesion can be covered by a single stent of no more than 40 mm in length Target lesion reference vessel diameter (RVD) is 4.0 mm 7.0mm Sufficient landing zone required for successful deployment of integrated embolic protection filter Willing to comply with all followup required study visits Provision of written informed consent before index procedure Life expectancy of less than one year An evolving, acute or recent stroke within 14 days of study evaluation Acute myocardial infarction within 72 hours before procedure Known sensitivity to contrast media that cannot be adequately controlled with premedication Subject has a total occlusion of target carotid artery Subject has a previously place stent in ipsilateral carotid artery Severe circumferential lesion calcification that may restrict full deployment of carotid stent Presence of filling defect or thrombus in target vessel Presence of "string sign" of target vessel Carotid (intracranial) stenosis located distal to target lesion Greater than 50% stenosis of common carotid artery proximal to target lesion. Known mobile plaque in aortic arch</criteria>
