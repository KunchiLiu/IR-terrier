	<brief_summary>Periodontitis and Rhematoid arthritis are chronic inflammatory diseases which share common risk factors The purpose of this study is to determine if Pentraxin 3 and Porphyromonas Gingivalis levels play an important role in the progression of both the diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Estimation of Pentraxin3 and PGingivalis Levels in Patients With Knee Joint and Gum Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Periodontal disease progression might play a significant role in the severity and outcome of systemic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Pentraxin3 is a newly discovered inflammatory biomarker. It is a member of acute phase proteins and it has been observed from previous studies that plasma pentraxin3 levels have increased with increasing severity of cardiac and renal problems. Porphyromonas gingivalis proteinase is responsible for the epitope development in RF-Fc region These proteinases are important virulence factors which lead to degradation of host tissue. Porphyromonas gingivalis is also a key periodonto pathogen. Thus the aim of this study is to compare the plasma pentraxin3 and p.gingivalis levels in patients with periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis.</detailed_description>
