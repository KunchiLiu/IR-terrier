	<brief_summary>The goal of this interventional crossover study in morbidly obese intubated and mechanically ventilated patients is to describe the respiratory mechanics and the heart-lung interaction at titrated positive end-expiratory pressure levels following a recruitment maneuver with transthoracic echocardiography and electric impedance tomography imaging.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Lung Strategy in Critically Ill Morbid Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obese patients under mechanical ventilation are more likely to develop atelectasis as a consequence of the increased abdominal weight. Atelectasis is the primary responsible for respiratory insufficiency and impossibility to wean obese patients from respiratory support. In a previous study we demonstrated the efficacy of the application of titrated PEEP levels following a recruitment maneuver in obese patients, i.e. improvement in respiratory mechanics and gas exchanges without negative hemodynamic effects. The application of lung and heat imaging will allow us to quantitatively describe: - Increase in aerated lung tissue (reduction of atelectasis) - Reduction of over-inflation of the ventilated regions - Recoupling of ventilation and perfusion - Improvement in right heart function by reduction of right heart afterload</detailed_description>
