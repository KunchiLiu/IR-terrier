	<brief_title>Effect of Harvoni on Proteinuria and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) in Hepatitis C (HCV) Associated Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that patients with early stage (1-3) CKD caused by HCV infection will have significantly improved proteinuria and eGFR after viral eradication with 12 weeks of treatment Harvoni (LDV/SOF). This trial data will serve as the basis to support further study of LDV/SOF in patients with early CKD. Slowing progression of CKD is a critical goal, as the increasing incidence and prevalence of advanced CKD and ESRD (end stage renal disease) places significant health burden on patients and tremendous costs on our health-care system.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The subject has signed the written informed consent Male or female ≥ 18 year of age HCV genotype 1 or 4 with ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) greater than 1000 international units (IU)/milliliter (mL), determined by HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction Roche TaqMan quantitative assay. Initial diagnosis of proteinuric chronic kidney disease occurred &lt; 7 years prior to completion of screening Women of childbearing potential (i.e. women who have not undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or no medically documented ovarian failure, and are ≤ 50 years of age) must agree to 1 medically approved contraceptive measures and have their partners agree to an additional barrier method of contraception for the duration of the study and for 4 weeks after the last administration of the study drug. Women of childbearing potential must not rely on hormonecontaining contraceptive as a form of birth control during the study but may use. An intrauterine device, female barrier methods with cervical cap or diaphragm with spermicidal agent, tubal sterilization, or vasectomy in male partners. Male subjects must agree to consistently and correctly use a condom during heterosexual intercourse and avoid sperm donation for the duration of this study and for 90 days after the last dose of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. Additionally, if their female partner is of childbearing potential (as defined above), their partner must agree to use either 1 of the nonhormonal methods of birth control listed above or a hormonecontaining contraceptive for 90 days after last study drug date. Hormonecontaining contraceptive options for partners include implants of levonorgestrel, injectable progesterone, oral contraceptives, contraceptive vaginal ring, or transdermal contraceptive pat Adequate organ function defined as follows platelets ≥ 50 x 109/L; hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30mL/min/1.73m2 as estimated by CKDEpi equation. Liver imaging to exclude hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is required within 6 months in any patient with cirrhosis. Has &gt; 300mg/g creatinine proteinuria on two urine samples obtained within 30 days of starting ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. History of evidence of clinically significant disorder other than hepatitis C virus infection or clinically significant laboratory finding that in the investigator's judgment would pose a risk to subject safety, interfere with study procedures, or prevent completion of the study. Pregnant or lactating female Uncontrolled depression or psychiatric disease interfering with the ability to comply with the study procedures or complete the study History or presence of any form of cancer within 3 years prior to enrollment, with the exception of excised basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, stage 0 or 1 melanoma, or cervical carcinoma in site or breast carcinoma in situ that has been excised or resected completely and is without evidence of local recurrence or metastasis. Experience lifethreatening cryoglobulinemic vasculitis requiring initiation of rituximab, steroids or plasmapheresis. Concomitant use of cimetidine, trimethoprim or other drugs which can increase tubular creatinine reabsorption Uncontrolled cardiovascular or pulmonary disease Uncontrolled hypertension Known HIV infection Known hypersensitivity to ledipasvir or sofosbuvir Prior HCV treatment failure using a medication in the NS5A inhibitor class Individuals who are taking the following medications and require continuation of the medications during the proposed study period will be excluded, given known interactions with ledipasvirsofosbuvir: Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, oxcarbazepine, rifabutin, rifampin, isoniazid, rifapentine, rosuvastatin, proton pump inhibitors, digoxin, modafinil, and St. John's wort, milk thistle, Echinacea. Having an alternate explanation of chronic kidney disease, including: Diabetic kidney disease, either by biopsy findings or duration of uncontrolled diabetes &gt; 8 years without serologic evidence of immunecomplex related kidney disease Chronic hypertensive nephropathy without proteinuria Lupus nephritis Multiple myeloma Obesity related proteinuria, BMI &gt; 35 Ongoing nephrotoxic medication use, including NSAIDS Polycystic kidney disease Kidney biopsy showing an alternate explanation for chronic kidney disease</criteria>
