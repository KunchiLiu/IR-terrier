	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of selumetinib when given together with paclitaxel as a second line therapy in treating patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Selumetinib may stop or slow the growth of tumor cells by blocking a protein called mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) that is needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving selumetinib together with paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selumetinib and Paclitaxel as Second-Line Treatment in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB-IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and tolerability of three pre-planned arms of continuous, intermittent, and pulsatile selumetinib with paclitaxel as second-line treatment in patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the preliminary clinical response of continuous, intermittent, and pulsatile selumetinib with paclitaxel as second-line treatment in patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of selumetinib in this patient population. II. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with selumetinib/paclitaxel. III. To assess correlations between cell-free DNA (cfDNA) molecular features from blood and molecular features and pathways from the biopsy samples, and use this as a surrogate measure of tumor response and duration of response as evaluated in the primary and secondary objectives. OUTLINE: This is a dose-finding study of selumetinib. The goal is to find out what dose and dosing schedule is the most effective in this population. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. ARM II: Patients receive selumetinib PO BID on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19 and paclitaxel as in Arm I. ARM III: Patients receive selumetinib PO BID on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and paclitaxel as in Arm I. In all three arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing clinical benefit from study treatment may continue treatment based on the principal investigator (PI) approval on a patient-by-patient basis. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks for 12 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed, nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of adenocarcinoma histology. 1. Mixed tumors will be categorized by the predominant cell type; (Note: If small cell elements are present the patient is ineligible). 2. Known mutational status of KRAS and BRAF oncogenes. 3. For patients in whom mutational testing result is unknown or unavailable from a prior test, KRAS and BRAF testing will be performed (at a CLIAcertified laboratory) using an archived or fresh biopsy as per Standard of Care, prior to enrollment. Stage IIIBIV, locally advanced or metastatic disease according to the 7 th edition of the AJCC lung cancer TNM classification system Measurable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1 criteria. Baseline measurements and evaluation of ALL sites of disease must be obtained within 4 weeks prior to Enrollment. Failure of at least one line of systemic anticancer therapy for advanced NSCLC defined as either of the following: 1. Radiological documentation of disease progression (or failure to achieve a response) or 2. Discontinuation due to toxicity ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1 Estimated life expectancy, in the judgment of the Investigator, which will permit receipt of treatment of 12 weeks or more Adequate bone marrow function as defined below: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5x109 /L (1500 per mm3 ) Platelets ≥ 100x109 /L (100,000 per mm3 ) Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL Adequate liver function as defined below: Serum Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for institution [Exception: Patients who have elevated serum bilirubin due to underlying Gilbert's Syndrome or familial benign unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia are allowed.] AST (SGOT) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for institution (or &lt; 5.0 x ULN in presence of liver metastases) ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for institution (or &lt; 5.0 x ULN in presence of liver metastases) Adequate renal function as defined by one of the following: Serum Creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dl OR Serum Creatinine clearance &gt; 50ml/min (calculated by CockcroftGault formula) 18 years and older Females of child bearing potential that are sexually active must agree to either practice 2 medically accepted highly effective methods of contraception at the same time or abstain from heterosexual intercourse from the time of signing the informed consent through 30 days after the last dose of study drug.
