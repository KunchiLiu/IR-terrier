	<brief_title>OPTIONS Spinal Cord Stimulation Programming Parameters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, multi-center, open-label study evaluating programming options in spinal cord stimulation on pain relief. All eligible subjects will undergo a Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) device trial that includes an intraoperative programming trial. Subjects experiencing a positive response to the programming parameters (improvement in average overall pain relief) during the trial from baseline will move forward with a permanent implant. Those not reporting a positive response to the programming parameters will be exited from the study. The subjects will complete a number of assessment worksheets to characterize their Quality of Life and function and the level of pain they are experiencing from the baseline to 3 months post neurostimulation trial.</detailed_description>
