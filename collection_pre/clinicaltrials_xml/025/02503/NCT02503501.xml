	<brief_title>Intranasal Glulisine in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Probable Mild Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disruption of central nervous system (CNS) insulin signaling has been increasingly associated with Alzheimer's Disease pathogenesis, and consequently this disease has been referred to as a type III diabetes of the brain. Clinical trials of intranasal insulin in AD have demonstrated therapeutic effects of intranasal (IN) insulin in memory-impaired adults in terms of memory recall without significantly altering serum insulin or glucose levels. In this study, the investigators are investigating the chronic effects of the rapid acting insulin, glulisine, administered intranasally (IN) 20 IU two times daily in adults with amnestic-mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). The investigation will enroll n=90 subjects and follow them over a 6 month period. This study has the following objectives: 1. Primary: a. To measure the chronic effects of IN insulin glulisine on cognition and function in subjects with aMCI and probable mild AD over a 6 month period. 2. Secondary: 1. To measure the effect of IN insulin glulisine on mood in subjects with aMCI and mild AD over a 6 month period. 2. To measure the safety and efficacy of IN glulisine in aMCI and mild AD subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes over a 6 month period. 3. Exploratory: 1. To measure the effect of IN delivery of insulin glulisine on parieto-temporal and posterior cingulate/precuneus glucose metabolism in subjects with aMCI and mild AD over a 6 month period. 2. To measure the chronic effect of IN delivery of insulin glulisine on AD-specific cerebrospinal (CSF) biomarkers (Abeta42, tau, and phospho-tau) in subjects with aMCI and mild AD over a 6 month period.</detailed_description>
