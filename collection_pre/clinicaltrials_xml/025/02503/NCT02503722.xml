	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of transducer of regulated CREB activity 1/2 (TORC1/2) inhibitor INK128 when given together with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor AZD9291in treating patients with advanced EGFR mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced) and has progressed after treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 and EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TORC1/2 Inhibitor INK128 and EGFR Inhibitor AZD9291 in Treating Patients With Advanced EGFR Mutation Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer After Progression on a Previous EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MLN0128 (TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128) in combination with AZD9291 (EGFR inhibitor AZD9291) in patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (Dose escalation phase) II. To evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of MLN0128 in combination with AZD9291 in patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC that is negative for the resistance mutation T790M (T790M negative [-]). (Dose expansion phase) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate pharmacokinetic profiles of MLN0128 in combination with AZD9291. II. To evaluate the response rate, disease control rate and progression free survival of the combination. III. To explore biomarkers of response and resistance to the combination by studying baseline biopsies, resistance biopsies, and serial plasma deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) specimens. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128. Patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 26 (day 1 is omitted in course 1). Patients also receive EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 8 weeks thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of non squamous EGFR mutation (L858R, G719X, exon 19 deletion, L861Q) positive NSCLC Advanced or metastatic disease that is incurable Availability of tissue for correlative analyses collected after progression on the most recent epidermal growth factor receptortyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI); if tissue is not available at that time point, a rebiopsy is required prior to registration Patients must have measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 1 (Karnofsky &gt;= 70%) Patients with a prior history of brain metastases are eligible provided: The brain metastases have been treated The patient is asymptomatic from the brain metastases Corticosteroids prescribed for the management of brain metastases have been discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to registration The brain metastases are stable on preregistration imaging Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin &gt;= 90 g/L (or &gt;= 9 g/dL) Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L Calculated creatinine clearance of &gt;

grade 2 except for alopecia Prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery are permissible as follows: Chemotherapy a minimum of 21 days must have elapsed from the last dose and resolution of toxicity excluding =&lt; grade 2 peripheral neuropathy or alopecia Surgery a minimum of 21 days must have elapsed following major surgery and complete wound healing must have occurred Radiation minimum of 14 days must have elapsed following radiation therapy and resolution of all radiation induced toxicity Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Available for longterm followup of their disease after treatment Intercurrent illness that would prevent the protocol being followed, including but not limited to: Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c &gt;

women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of registration Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months following the date of last dose of MLN0128 and AZD9291 Congestive heart failure (even if medically controlled), unstable angina, active cardiomyopathy or a family history of prolonged QTc syndrome Inability to discontinue drugs that are strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) inhibitors and/or inducers Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with MLN0128 and AZD9291; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated</criteria>
