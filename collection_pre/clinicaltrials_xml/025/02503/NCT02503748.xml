	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men: In Switzerland, every year about 6,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer. Men with prostate cancer at an early stage are confronted with a difficult decision: they are faced with different treatment alternatives, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. That is why a comprehensive information delivery and processing is extremely important for patients to make an informed decision. Therefore, an online platform has been developed in collaboration with urologists and former patients. This online platform is designed to cover the individual information needs of patients with early prostate cancer. Additionally, the software aims at facilitating cooperation between patients and doctors and at increasing the satisfaction of patients with their treatment decision. In this study, the online platform will now to be tested in clinical practice, and data will be collected for the benefit of the platform: Can the online platform actually satisfy the indivudal information needs, facilitate the therapy decision and support the cooperation between doctors and patients?</detailed_description>
