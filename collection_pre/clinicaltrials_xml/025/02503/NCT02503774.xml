Have histologic or cytologic documentation of solid tumor ◦ Must have received and have progressed, are refractory, or are intolerant to standard therapy appropriate for the specific tumor type. Depending on tumor type, subjects should not have received more than 5 prior lines of therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease including both standards of care and investigational therapies 4. Subjects must have at least 1 lesion that is measureable using RECIST guidelines 5. Subjects must consent to provide archived tumor specimens or tumor biopsies for correlative biomarker studies. 6. All subjects are encouraged to consent to and provide paired pretreatment and ontreatment tumor biopsies. 7. In the doseexpansion phase, all subjects are encouraged to consent and provide paired pretreatment and ontreatment tumor biopsies 8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1 9. In the opinion of the investigator, likely to complete ≥ 56 days of treatment 10.

Female subjects of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner must use at least one highly effective method of contraception from the time of screening, and must agree to continue using such precautions for 90 days (or 180 days) after the final dose of investigational product. 12. Nonsterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use condom plus spermicide from Day 1 through 90 days (or 180 days) after receipt of the last dose of investigational product. 1. Prior treatment with tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily agonists including OX40, CD27, CD137 (41BB), CD357 (GITR). 2. Subjects who have received prior therapy with regimens containing CTLA4, PDL1, or PD1 antagonists are NOT permitted to enroll unless all of the following apply: Dose of immunotherapy must have been administered at least 28 days or 5 half lives, whichever is shorter, prior to planned first dose of MEDI9447/MEDI4736 Must not have experienced a toxicity that led to permanent discontinuation of prior immunotherapy All AEs while receiving prior immunotherapy must have resolved to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline prior to screening for this study 3. Must not have required the use of additional immunosuppression other than corticosteroids for the management of an AE, not have experienced recurrence of an AE if rechallenged, and not currently require maintenance doses of &gt; 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day 4. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to investigational product formulations 5. History of more than one event of IRR requiring permanent discontinuation of IV drug treatment 6. History of severe drug allergies or anaphylaxis to 2 or more food products or medicine (including known sensitivity to acetaminophen/paracetamol, diphenhydramine or equivalent antihistamine, and methylprednisolone or equivalent glucocorticoid) 7. Cardiac or peripheral vascular disease meeting any of the following criteria: Past history of myocardial infarction in the prior 12 months Past history of stroke or transient ischemic attack requiring medical therapy Congestive heart failure ≥ Class 3 based on New York Heart Association Functional Classification 8. Grade 3 or greater edema (eg, peripheral, pulmonary) 9. History of Grade 3 or greater thromboembolic events or unresolved thromboembolic event of any grade 10. Subjects with active tuberculosis are ineligible. In settings where there is clinical or radiographic evidence of tuberculosis, active disease must be ruled out 11. Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including inflammatory bowel disease [eg, colitis, Crohn's disease], celiac disease, or other serious gastrointestinal chronic conditions associated with diarrhea, etc) within the past 3 years prior to the start of treatment. The following are exceptions to this criterion are subjects s with vitiligo or alopecia or hypothyroidism. 12. Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastatic disease 13. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational (non interventional) clinical study or the followup period of an interventional study 14. Receipt of any conventional or investigational anticancer therapy not otherwise specified above within 28 days prior to the first dose of Investigational product 15. Any concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biologic or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment. 16. Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy 17. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days prior to the first dose of Investigational product 18. History of primary immunodeficiency, solid organ transplantation 19. Known positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), chronic or active hepatitis B or active hepatitis A or C 20. Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to the first dose of investigational products 21. Females who are pregnant, lactating, or intend to become pregnant during their participation in the study 22. Major surgery within 28 days prior to first dose of Investigational Product or still recovering from prior surgery. 23. Other invasive malignancy within 2 years except for noninvasive malignancies such as cervical carcinoma in situ, in situ prostate cancer, nonmelanomatous carcinoma of the skin, ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast that has been surgically cured 24. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement</criteria>
