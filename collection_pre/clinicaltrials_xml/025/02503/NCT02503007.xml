	<brief_summary>Sustained high-intensity activity, such as survival training with little nourishment available, can result in a loss of muscle performance. This study will examine the effects of a nutritional supplement to maintain muscle and muscle performance during this period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of 14-days of HMB-free Acid on Changes in Muscle During 4-days of Survival Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sustained high intensity activity that is often accompanied by sleep and nutrient deprivation is a common characteristic of survival training. Survival training is a requirement in the preparation of pilots, where they learn evasion and survival skills that they may need to avoid capture in a situation in which they have bailed from their plane. The physiological stresses associated with the nature of these operations often results in significant decrements in lean body mass, muscle size and muscle endurance and power. During a sudden evacuation from the aircraft the pilot only takes a small survival bag. There is a limit to what can possibly be put in this bag. However, the ability to provide a dietary supplement specifically targeting muscle may provide an important resource for maintaining muscle mass and performance. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of 14 days of HMB-FA ingestion on maintaining muscle architecture and muscle performance during 4-days of survival training. In addition, anabolic and catabolic markers of stress, inflammation and muscle damage will be assessed.</detailed_description>
