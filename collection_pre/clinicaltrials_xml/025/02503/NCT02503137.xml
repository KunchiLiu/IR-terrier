	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of SM04554 at concentrations of 0.15% and 0.25%. Improved knowledge of the changes in hair counts and immunohistochemical analysis associated with androgenetic alopecia (AGA) before and after treatment with SM04554 and compared to placebo may lead to a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of action of SM04554.</brief_summary>
