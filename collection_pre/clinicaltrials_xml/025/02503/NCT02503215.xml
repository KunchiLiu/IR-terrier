	<brief_summary>To study the effects of compression stockings on sleep apnea in hemodialysis patients with diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. The rationale of this study consists in the fluid shift theory, which consists in the nocturnal rostral fluid shift from legs, which causes upper airways edema. The aim of this study is to evaluate if compression stockings could improve such nocturnal volume redistribution and, therefore, improve obstructive sleep apnea.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Compression Stockings on Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Patients Under Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators will apply the following methods: - Sleep study, performed through polysomnography - Fluid redistribution, by bioimpedance analysis - Autonomic nervous system evaluation, by spectral heart rate variability analysis. The study protocol comprises two moments: baseline evaluation (in patients with diagnosed sleep apnea) and after using compression stockings for a one-week period.</detailed_description>
