	<brief_summary>This study aims to compare the outcomes of a traditional, exercise-based rehabilitation intervention for chronic low back pain with the outcomes achieved by combining a traditional intervention with adjunct therapy delivered using an interactive gaming-based system for home-based therapy. 50 subjects with non-specific cLBP will be recruited in the study. Following baseline measures, study volunteers will be randomized to either the Usual Care alone group or to the Interactive Home-Based System group. In each group, an endpoint assessment session will be conducted at approximately 4 and 8 weeks post baseline measures.</brief_summary>
