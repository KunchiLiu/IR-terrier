	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance, and immunogenicity of MAS-1-Adjuvanted seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) (MER4101) with hemagglutinin dose escalation compared to non-adjuvanted comparator IIV standard dose (SD) in healthy adults and high dose (HD) IIV in ambulatory elderly subjects. Hypothesis: Reduced hemagglutinin (HA) dose IIV formulated in MAS-1 adjuvant (MER4101) is safe, tolerable and immunogenic in healthy young adults 18 - 49 years of age compared to SD IIV and an optimal dose of HA formulated in MAS-1 adjuvant will be safe and immunogenic in adults who are 65 years of age and older compared to HD IIV (from Phase 1A, known to be 9µg of HA antigen).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety, Tolerance, and Immunogenicity of MAS-1-Adjuvanted Seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (MER4101)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a phase IA/B randomized, double-blind, single-center, clinical trial, in healthy adults (18-49 years old) and ambulatory elderly subjects (aged 65 years and older). Phase IA will evaluate the safety, tolerability and hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) antibody response of each of four escalating doses of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigen with a fixed dose of a water-in-oil emulsion adjuvant MAS-1 (Mercia Adjuvant System-1), compared with licensed, unadjuvanted, standard dose (SD) of licensed inactivated trivalent influenza virus vaccine (IIV). Phase IB will evaluate the optimal dose of IIV in MAS-1 selected under phase IA (known to be 9µg of HA antigen) for safety, tolerability and HAI antibody response in ambulatory elderly subjects compared to high dose (HD) IIV. The ability of SD IIV to protect against seasonal influenza virus infection in the elderly is less than vaccine efficacy observed in healthy young adults. The proposed MAS-1-adjuvanted influenza virus vaccine offers the potential for higher seroconversion and seroprotection rates, higher antibody levels, prolonged duration of protective antibodies, HA antigen dose-sparing and cross-protection against antigenically divergent viral strains. This study will determine if the adjuvanted vaccine formulated with one or more of the reduced HA antigen doses is safe. The study will also determine if it is likely to induce an improved HA antibody response (HAI) when compared to SD IIV in healthy adults and HD IIV in elderly subjects. This trial will inform future clinical trials in at-risk populations of older patients.</detailed_description>
