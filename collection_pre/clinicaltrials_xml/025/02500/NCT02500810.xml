	<brief_title>Monosialoganglioside Preventing Neurotoxicity Induced by Albumin-bound Paclitaxel Chemotherapy in Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer patients received a single-agent albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy are included in this trial. Patients are randomly assigned into the experimental group and blank control group based on segmented block randomized method. After enrollment, patients will complete at least chemotherapy and GM1 injection/blank control. During the 3w per cycle chemotherapy, albumin-bound paclitaxel is conducted in D1 and D8, GM1(40mg+250ml N.S) is injected from D1 to D8. Neurotoxicity evaluation and quality of life assessment will be conducted every cycle and 3m/6m after the chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
