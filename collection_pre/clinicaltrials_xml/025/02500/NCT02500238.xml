	<brief_summary>Electronic cigarette use may be less harmful than cigarettes in adults, however, limited data exists examining passive electronic cigarette exposure and child health outcomes. The current study seeks to compare health-related outcomes among youth who reside with non-smokers, cigarette smokers, and electronic cigarette users. The investigators propose to conduct a small pilot study with 30 youth, ages 6-17 and a caregiver. Three groups of 10 parent-child dyads will be recruited: 1) control group: parents who are non-smokers/non-vapers, 2) smoking group: parents who are exclusive cigarette smokers, and 3) vaping group: parents who are exclusively ECIG users. Groups will be compared across the following variables: child lung function and biomarkers of nicotine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current study seeks to compare health-related outcomes among youth who reside with non-smokers, cigarette smokers, and electronic cigarette users. Control Group: will consist of participants ages 6 - 17 who live in a home with adults who do not smoke. A brief breathing test will verify a non-smoker and/or are not around a certain amount of smoke in the environment (live with a smoker). The participant will be asked to complete a series of brief questionnaires that asks about basic demographic information, medical history, and that asks about their smoking history. The participant's will also be asked to complete two 5 minute breathing tests, provide a sample of saliva, a urine sample, and have their toe nails clipped. Vaping Group: will consist of participants ages 6 -17 who live in a home with adults who currently use electronic cigarettes. A brief breathing test will verify a non-tobacco smoker and/or are not around a certain amount of smoke in the environment (live with a tobacco smoker). The participant will be asked to complete a series of brief questionnaires that asks about basic demographic information, smoking or vaping history and patterns of use, and medical history. The participant will be asked to complete two 5 minute breathing tests, provide a sample of saliva, a urine sample, and have their toe nails clipped. Smoking Group: will consist of participants ages 6 - 17 who live in a home with adults who currently smoke cigarettes. Participants will then be asked to complete a series of brief questionnaires that asks about basic demographic information, smoking or vaping history and patterns of use, and medical history. The participant will also be asked to complete two 5 minute breathing tests, provide a sample of saliva, a urine sample, and have their toe nails clipped.</detailed_description>
