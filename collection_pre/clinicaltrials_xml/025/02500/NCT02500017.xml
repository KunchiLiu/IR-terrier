	<detailed_description>Night Eating Syndrome (NES) is a unique disorder characterized by a delayed pattern of food intake in which recurrent episodes of food consumption occurs after the evening meal and/or during nocturnal awakenings. Diagnostic criteria for NES include: (1) recurrent episodes of night eating, as manifested by eating after awakening from sleep or by excessive food consumption following the evening meal, (2) awareness of those eating episodes, and (3) significant distress or impairment caused by the disorder. Exclusion criteria are binge-eating disorder or another mental disorder, as well as medical disorders or medications that might better explain the disordered eating pattern. NES is also more common among patients with insomnia, eating disorders, and other psychiatric disorders. 100 participants with night eating syndrome will be recruited from the general population. They will be randomized to either a commercially available rapid-release formulation of melatonin (5 mg) or matching placebo capsules, that will be administered once a day for a total of 8 weeks. Participants will attend a screening appointment, a baseline assessment and additional research assessment visits every other week for the 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
