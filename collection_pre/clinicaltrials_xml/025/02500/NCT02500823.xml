	<brief_summary>Compelling epidemiological evidence indicates that alterations of mitochondrial DNA, including mutations and abnormal content of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), are associated with the initiation and development of cardiovascular disease. This study was undertaken to investigate whether mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood cells could be used as a risk predictor for coronary heart disease.</brief_summary>
