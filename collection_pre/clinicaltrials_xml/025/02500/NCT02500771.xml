	<brief_summary>This is a project to be funded by a Fast-Track Small Business Innovative Research to build and test the feasibility of a new software prototype called V-Motive which will facilitate the combination of two proven autism behavioral interventions: Applied Behavior Analysis therapy (ABA) and Video Modeling (VM). The investigators will conduct a Phase I feasibility analysis and Phase II pilot study of the V-Motive Prototype by observing a community therapy providers' use of the prototype in a therapy setting. Investigators will observe the users and record the success or failure of the performance of key functions of the software. Investigators will also administer surveys. The study will answer research questions about V-Motive's ability to perform its intended function: allowing interventionists to feasibly leverage video modeling within ABA therapy with a minimal amount of overhead and labor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Testing and Pilot Study of V-MOTIVE Protocol Software Version 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators will conduct a within-subject pilot study of 6 tutors and 6 children to answer research questions about V-Motive's ability to perform its intended function. The goal is to evaluate the feasibility, usability, and the potential of V-Motive to deliver comprehensive, individualized video modeling that is integrated with a child's program. Investigators will also use descriptive statistics to provide preliminary insight into the potential impact of the system on a child's performance in their ABA therapy. However, these data are NOT intended to show cause or to show effectiveness. The study will answer the following questions: 1) 3) Can V-Motive be feasibly used during ABA therapy to positively impact a child's performance within 4 weeks? 2) How laborious is it to construct a fully-indexed video repository from therapy footage using V-Motive? 3) How accurate is the system in suggesting and cueing up appropriate video for playback on demand?</detailed_description>
