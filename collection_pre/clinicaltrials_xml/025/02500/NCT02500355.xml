	<brief_title>Carpal Tunnel Release Via Two Small Incisions Comparing With Via Standard Incision And Under Endoscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) affects over 60 million people worldwide. If a regimen of conservative management has failed, surgical release of the median nerve is warranted. Numerous approaches for carpal tunnel release have been described that range from an open technique to a limited incision to endoscopic release. In addition, partial excision of the flexor retinaculum is advocated by some surgeons because of obtaining better outcomes. However, the procedure is difficult to be accomplished through small incisions owing to poor visualization. Currently, balance of incision, visualization, and partial excision of the flexor retinaculum is still controversial. The objective of this report is to introduce carpal tunnel release with partial excision of the flexor retinaculum through two small incisions. The procedures were performed under lighted head magnifier. This is the first report on the use of our technique. For comparison, the investigators also included two other groups of standard open carpal tunnel release with partial excision of the flexor retinaculum and endoscopic carpal tunnel release without excision of the flexor retinaculum.</detailed_description>
