	<brief_title>Cocamide DEA vs Permethrin for Head Lice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A formulation of cocamide diethanolamine (DEA) surfactant was previously reported as showing efficacy to eliminate head louse infestation. This study has been designed to test those data using a new formulation of 10% cocamide DEA in an aqueous basis in comparison with the standard of care product 1% permethrin creme rinse. It is believed that surfactants like cocamide DEA are capable of eliminating lice resistant to conventional insecticides. A planned total of 120 patients who, following examination, are found to suffer from active head lice infestation will be recruited to the trial. The patient will be treated with the appropriate product according to the randomization code from a pre-prepared listing in balanced blocks of 12. 10% Cocamide DEA is applied directly to dry hair and is washed off with shampoo after 60 minutes. Permethrin 1% creme rinse is applied to shampooed and towel dried hair and left in situ for 10 minutes, then rinsed off with clean water. Treatments will be applied by experienced investigators throughout the study. Assessments will be made by other investigators unaware of the treatment regimen used. After treatment (day 0), follow up assessments will be performed on days 4, 7,10 then again at day 14 after which they will leave the study. Any adverse events or side effects from the treatments will be monitored during the study.</detailed_description>
