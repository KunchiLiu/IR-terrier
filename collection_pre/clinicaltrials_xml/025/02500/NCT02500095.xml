	<brief_summary>Background: Calorie restriction increases longevity in many species and attenuate the development of chronic disorders including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. In mice reduced activity of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and/or insulin is associated with extended longevity. Growth hormone (GH) is the main regulator of IGF-I production, but the molecular mechanism whereby GH switches from IGF-I stimulation (protein anabolism) to fatty acid oxidation (fatty acid catabolism) as well as induction of insulin resistance during fasting remains enigmatic. Hypotheses: The changes of the global set of metabolites, induction of insulin resistance, and the shift in metabolism from protein anabolism to lipolysis together with the potentially favorable effect of calorie restriction during fasting depend on preserved fasting-induced GH secretion. Aim: The investigators wish to provide knowledge on changes in metabolites and shift in signaling pathways that take place at the transition to the fasting state among healthy overweight and obese subjects. Furthermore the investigators wish to determine the effect of GH on the adaption of the metabolism to a fasting state.</brief_summary>
