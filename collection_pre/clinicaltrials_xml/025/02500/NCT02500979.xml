	<brief_summary>This study is designed to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of pramlintide co-administered as a fixed-dose ratio with basal-bolus SC insulin, delivered simultaneously via 2 separate pumps, in subjects with type 1 diabetes who are failing to achieve the desired level of glycemic control using insulin therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of a Fixed Pramlintide: Insulin Dose Ratio on Postprandial Glucose in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Potentially eligible subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus who are treated with with a basal-bolus insulin regimen through multiple daily injections or insulin pump at a total daily insulin dose ≤60 U, will be eligible. Visit 1 is approximately 3-6 weeks prior to randomization. Given some variability in HbA1c and C-peptide assays, re-testing for HbA1c and C-peptide can be performed within 18 days from the initial visit. Visit 2 is approximately 2-5 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects are on lispro insulin throughout study except during Visit 4 and Visit 5, the domicile 24 hr treatment period, when they are switched to regular insulin U-100. Screen failed patients may be re-screened for inclusion in the study, as long as re-screening takes place at least 3 months after the original screening visit. If a subject is re-screened, he/she must continue to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria. All study procedures of initial Visit 1 must be repeated at the re-screening visit.</detailed_description>
