	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well nivolumab with or without ipilimumab works in treating patients with sarcoma that has spread from the primary site to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. It is not yet known whether nivolumab works better with or without ipilimumab in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab With or Without Ipilimumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic Sarcoma That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the confirmed response rate of single agent nivolumab and dual agent nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate adverse event rates (National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v]4.0) within each treatment arm. II. To evaluate duration of response, clinical benefit rate, time to progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival within each treatment arm. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To potentially detect an early signal of confirmed response rate within a histologically defined patient cohort. II. To assess the potential association between programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (by immunohistochemistry [IHC]) and clinical outcome, within each treatment. III. To evaluate associations between selected biomarker measured in serial peripheral blood and with clinical efficacy, within each treatment. IV. To evaluate the association between selected biomarker measured in tumor tissue with clinical efficacy, within each treatment. V. To evaluate the association between baseline tumor mutational burden and neoantigen production with clinical efficacy within each treatment. VI. To evaluate secondary endpoints within patients crossing over to dual agent nivolumab plus ipilimumab after experiencing progressive disease while receiving single agent nivolumab. VII. To evaluate correlative science objectives endpoints within patients crossing over to dual agent nivolumab plus ipilimumab after experiencing progressive disease while receiving single agent nivolumab. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes once every 2 weeks. Courses repeat every 42 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who progress after 10 weeks on single agent nivolumab may elect to cross over to Arm II. ARM II: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes once every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes every 2 weeks. Courses repeat every 42 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who progress by imaging during the first 12 weeks of therapy may continue treatment, at the discretion of the patient and treating investigator. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

this review is mandatory prior to registration to confirm eligibility Registration Eligibility Criteria: Patients must have histologically confirmed bone or soft tissue sarcoma by central pathology review Measurable disease Locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic disease &gt;= 1 prior systemic therapy for sarcoma, including adjuvant systemic therapy No prior therapy with ipilimumab or nivolumab, or any agent targeting programmed cell death 1 (PD1), PDL1 or cytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated protein 4 (CTLA4) No treatment with biologic therapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, investigational agent for malignancy, or radiation =&lt; 28 days before study registration; no treatment with nitrosourea or mitomycin =&lt; 42 days before study registration Patients should have resolution of any toxic effects of prior therapy (except alopecia) to NCI CTCAE, version 4.0, grade 1 or less No history of the following: Active known or suspected autoimmune disease Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are eligible if the lymphocytes &gt; 350 cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ cells and no detectable viral load Symptomatic, untreated, or uncontrolled brain metastases present Active autoimmune colitis Autoimmune panhypopituitarism Autoimmune adrenal insufficiency Known active hepatitis B or C Hepatitis B can be defined as: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) &gt;
