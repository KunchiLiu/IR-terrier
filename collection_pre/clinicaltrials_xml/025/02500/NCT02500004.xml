	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, cross-sectional study to determine BAT activity in cachectic patients with pancreatic or non-small cell lung cancer, and in cachectic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and compare results with healthy individuals and non-cachectic COPD patients, matched for age and BMI.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pancreatic cancer patients, or NSCLC cancer patients, or COPD patients The diagnostic criterion for cachexia is unintentional weight loss more than 5% over the past 6 months or more than 2% in individuals with a bodymass index &lt; 20 kg/m2 and muscle wasting assessed by DXA; Age ≥ 30 years; Gender: male and female; Caucasians. Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus; Patients with severe clotting disorder; Patients with an active second malignancy; Psychological unstable persons presumed unfit to perform the measurements, including claustrophobia; Persons unable to lie or sit still for 12 hours; Oxygen therapy; Pregnant subjects;Subjects unable to undergo MRI (e.g. pacemaker; neurostimulator; implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) or leads; Foley bladder catheter; medication pump; cochlear or hearing implant; tattoos or other items that cannot be removed and include metal parts (for instance from operations in the past); metal splinter in the eye; vascular clips; denture, which contains magnets); Subjects that received high doses of radiotherapeutic radiation of the neck and/or upper chest in their medical history; Persons that received cervical or thoracic sympathectomy or have a nerve dysfunction which is likely to influence sympathetic nerves; The use of medication that influences the sympathetic nerve system: ßblockers, αblockers, central antihypertensives, certain antidepression drugs (MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressives), reserpine, cocaine, calciumblockers, labetalol, and certain tranquillizers (fenothiazines).</criteria>
