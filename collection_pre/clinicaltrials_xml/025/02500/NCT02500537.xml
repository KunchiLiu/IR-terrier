	<brief_title>A Post-market Study of the Endo GIA™ Reinforced Reload With Tri-Staple™ Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this prospective, two-arm, multicenter, post-market study is to evaluate safety through the incidence of reported device-related adverse events (AEs) through 30 days following use of the Endo GIA™ Reinforced Reload with Tri-Staple™ Technology in subjects undergoing indicated abdominal or thoracic procedures.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. The subject must be 1880 years of age 2. The subject must be willing and able to participate in the study procedures and to understand and sign the informed consent 3. The subject is undergoing an indicated primary abdominal or thoracic procedure where the Endo GIA™ Reinforced Reload with TriStaple™ Technology (Universal Handle) will be used per its Instructions For Use (IFU) Thoracic procedures may include, but are not limited to, wedge resection and lobectomy, and may include video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) or open procedures. Abdominal procedures may include, but are not limited to, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), laparoscopic RouxenY gastric bypass (LRYGB), and biliopancreatic diversion, as well as hepatic and pancreatic resection. 4. For thoracic subjects: the subject has a FEV1 ≥40% 1. Subjects undergoing cardiac and vascular procedures 2. The procedure is an emergency procedure 3. The procedure is a revision/reoperation for the same indication 4. Any female subject who is pregnant a. Females of childbearing potential will be required to provide either a urine pregnancy test or serum pregnancy test (except for subjects who are surgically sterile or are postmenopausal for at least two years) 5. Any subject who is considered to be part of a vulnerable population (e.g. prisoners or those without sufficient mental capacity) 6. The subject is unable or unwilling to comply with the study requirements or followup schedule 7. The subject has comorbidities which, in the opinion of the Investigator, will not be appropriate for the study or the subject has an estimated life expectancy of less than 6 months 8. The subject has been diagnosed with a bleeding disorder and/or is undergoing active and not reversed anticoagulant treatment 9. The subject is concurrently enrolled in an investigational drug or device research study</criteria>
