	<brief_title>IMRT Combined With Erlotinib for EGFR Wild Type Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With 4-10 Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to assess the efficacy of IMRT combined with erlotinib compared with whole-brain radiotherapy for EGFR wild type non-small cell lung cancer with 4-10 brain metastases. All patients recruited will be randomly assigned into two groups. Patients in experimental group will receive daily IMRT at 45 Gy in 15 fractions to brain metastases, combined with daily erlotinib of 150mg for three weeks. Patients in control group will receive daily whole-brain radiotherapy at 30 Gy in 10 fractions.</detailed_description>
