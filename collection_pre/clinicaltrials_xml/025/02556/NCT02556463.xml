	<brief_title>A Study of MEDI9197 in Subjects With Solid Tumors or CTCL and in Combination With Durvalumab and Palliative Radiation in Subjects With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, unblinded study to evaluate the TLR 7/8 agonist MEDI9197 delivered by IT injection to subjects with solid tumors or CTCL, and in combination with durvalumab and palliative radiation in subjects with solid tumors. The study uses a 3 + 3 dose escalation design to evaluate a range of doses.</detailed_description>
