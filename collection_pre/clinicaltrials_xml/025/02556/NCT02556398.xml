	<brief_title>Use of Mobile-based Technologies to Improve Diabetes Self-management and Postprandial Glucose Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intervention will be three (3) months in duration and will entail use of a smart phone app for real-time data logging to identify factors causing glycemic variability, as well as use of a web-based nutrition education program. The investigators postulate that the interactive nutrition education curriculum — which will provide feedback to patients about the inter-relationship between their food intake and postprandial glucose profiles, as well as practical guidance for improvements — will lead to a change in food choices and improved post-prandial glucose control.</detailed_description>
