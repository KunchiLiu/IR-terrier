	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of cranberry juice on central and peripheral blood pressure, indices of arterial stiffness, lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and size characteristics, and HDL function. The investigators hypothesize that the bioactive compounds in cranberry juice may elicit beneficial effects on blood pressure and arterial health, as well as LDL-C and HDL function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Cranberry Juice on Cardiovascular Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to conduct a 2-period randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of cranberry juice on central and peripheral blood pressure, indices of arterial stiffness, lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and size characteristics, and HDL function. Eligibility requires non-smoking men and women to be 30 to 65 years of age with BMI greater than or equal to 18 and less than or equal to 39, total cholesterol below 240 mg/dL, triglycerides below 350 mg/dL, and have systolic blood pressure of 120 to 159 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 99 mmHg. Subjects will undergo randomized treatments including 500 mL/d cranberry juice beverage and 500 mL/d of a color and taste matched placebo beverage. The two 8 to 12 week treatment periods will be separated by an 8 week washout.</detailed_description>
