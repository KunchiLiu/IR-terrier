	<brief_summary>The study will explore CT radiation dose as low as reasonably achievable in diagnosing acute appendicitis, by using of dose simulation technique and iterative reconstruction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT Dose Simulation Study for Appendicitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three sequential non-inferiority tests are planned. First, three readers will review the original 2-mSv images. Second, the readers will review the 75%-dose images. After the readers review the 75%-dose images and before the readers reviewed the 50%-dose images, the non-inferiority of 75% dose to the original dose will be tested. If the non-inferiority is not accepted, the study will be terminated with the conclusion of 2 mSv as the lowest acceptable dose. If the non-inferiority is accepted, the study will be continue to the next step. In the same manner, the readers will review the next lower-dose images (50% and then 25%), and then the noninferiority will be tested against the original dose.</detailed_description>
