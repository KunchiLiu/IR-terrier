	<brief_title>Rituximab Plus Corticosteroids in Non-infectious Active Mixed Cryoglobulinemia Vasculitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cryoglobulinemia are responsible for systemic vasculitis, and the most frequently targeted organs are the skin, joints, kidneys and peripheral nervous system. Cryoglobulinemia vasculitis are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and require therapeutic intervention. Management of non-infectious mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis is based on corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and/or immunosuppressants. These treatments are associated with frequent side effects. To date, no study has evaluated the efficacy and safety of these different therapeutic options, explaining the lack of recommendations. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, has emerged as a novel therapeutic option in B-cell related disorders. Data from the French AutoImmunity and Rituximab (AIR) registry recently reported the positive effect of rituximab in non-infectious mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. More recently, the multidisciplinary national French CryoVas survey also suggested a significant superiority of the combination corticosteroid plus rituximab compared to the corticosteroids alone in terms of complete clinical and immunological responses and corticosteroid sparing. However, no randomized controlled data addressing this issue has been published to date.</detailed_description>

Patient with active cryoglobulinemia vasculitis define by positive cryoglobulinemia and a clinically active vasculitis with skin, joint, renal, peripheral nerve, central neurological, digestive, pulmonary and/or cardiac involvement (no histological evidence needed if presence of purpura demonstrated), 4. Patient with primary Sj√∂gren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, or another autoimmune disease, or Bcell nonHodgkin lymphoma (with cryoglobulinemia as the only therapeutic indication), or essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, 5. Naive or relapsing patients, without modification (initiation or increase) of immunosuppressive therapy in the month prior the inclusion, 6. For women of child bearing age: negative pregnancy test during the inclusion, and effective contraception during the period of 12 months after the latest rituximab infusion or placebo, 7. Patients with severe vasculitis must be treated in the 15 days prior inclusion by 3 bolus of methylprednisolone (15 mg/kg/d) AND 3 to 7 plasma exchanges (exchange volume of 60 ml/kg/session). 1. Patient with a medium and small size vessels vasculitis unrelated to cryoglobulinemia (granulomatous with polyangiitis (Wegener's disease), microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatous with polyangiitis (ChurgStrauss syndrome), polyarteritis nodose, IgA vasculitis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, infectious vasculitis, hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis), 2. Patient with a large size vessels vasculitis, 3. Patient with non active cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, 4. Patient with immunosuppressive therapy introduced or increased in the month prior to the inclusion, 5. Patients receiving corticosteroid therapy &gt; 0.5 mg/kg/d for more than one month before the inclusion or &gt; 1 mg/kg/d for more than two weeks before the inclusion, 6. Patient who had received rituximab therapy within the 12 months before the inclusion, 7. Pregnancy in progress or needed , breast feeding, 8. HIVpositive status, 9. Patient with active hepatitis B or C infection, 10. HBs Agpositive and/or HBV DNA detectable in the blood*, 11. Patients with known hypersensitivity reaction to the active substance or any of the excipients, or to murine proteins, 12. Contraindication to rituximab, 13. Active infections at screening, 14. Patient in guardianship, 15. Patient already included in a biomedical research protocol, 16. No social security scheme (Beneficiaries or eligible), 17. History of cancer during the last 3 years before inclusion, including solid tumors, hematological malignancies (except lymphoproliferative disorder associated with the mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis), and carcinoma in situ (except basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that have been treated or excized and cured)" If the hepatitis B core antibody (antiHBc) is positive, the benefit/risk will be evaluated by an hepatologist before inclusion, and patient, if enrolled, will be monitored until the end of the study.</criteria>
