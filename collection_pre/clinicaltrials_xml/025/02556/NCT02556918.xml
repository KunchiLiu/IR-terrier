	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with sitagliptin reduces the frequency and severity of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) after cardiac surgery and to determine whether treatment with sitagliptin is effective in maintaining blood sugar control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sitagliptin for Hyperglycemia in Patients With T2DM Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with sitagliptin reduces the frequency and severity of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and the need for continuous intravenous insulin infusion (CII) in the intensive care unit (ICU) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. In addition, the study seeks to determine whether treatment with sitagliptin is effective in maintaining glycemic control and in preventing the need for subcutaneous (SC) insulin therapy in patients with T2D during the transition from intensive care unit (ICU) to regular floor in cardiac surgery patients with T2D.</detailed_description>
