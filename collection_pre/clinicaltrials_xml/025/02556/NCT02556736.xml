	<brief_summary>RST-001 is a gene therapy given as an injection into the eye and delivers a gene encoding a photo switch, channelrhodopsin-2, (optogenetics) to cells in the retina of the eye. When expressed, the channelrhodopsin-2 protein can depolarize in response to light thus generating a signal that is transmitted to the brain. The study is composed of two parts. An initial dose-ranging study (part 1) is proposed whereby three dose levels of RST-001 will be studied in three separate groups of adult patients with advanced disease. This first part of the study is aimed at determining a single dose of the experimental agent which is safe and well tolerated, to further evaluate in a fourth group of patients. The second part of the study is aimed at obtaining additional safety data at the highest tolerated dose and providing important additional clinical data to guide the design of future efficacy studies.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Participants must meet all of the following criteria. 1. Age &gt;= 18 years 2. Signed and dated written informed consent obtained from the patient. 3. Ability to comply with testing and all protocol tests. 4. Diagnosis of advanced retinitis pigmentosa (RP) defined as: 1. Clinical diagnosis of advanced RP 2. Prior documented retinal electrophysiological evidence of rodcone photoreceptor degeneration 3. Baseline evidence of &lt;10microvolts maximal bwave ERG response 5. Visual acuity in the study eye of nobetterthan hand motion 6. Visual acuity in the nonstudy eye of nobetterthan finger counting 7. Presence of retinal ganglion cells and/or retinal nerve fiber layer on SDOCT testing 8. The presence of macular edema due to RP will not be considered an exclusion criteria 9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and at baseline, and agree to use an effective form of contraception, or be surgically sterile or postmenopausal (defined as last menstrual period greater than two years prior to baseline. Acceptable methods of contraception include hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills, injected hormones, dermal patch or vaginal ring), intrauterine device, barrier methods (diaphragm, condom) with spermicide, or surgical sterilization (tubal ligation). 10. Males must use two forms of contraception (including one barrier method for three months following agent administration if their partner is of childbearing potential), or must be surgically sterile. Exclusion criteria: Any one of the following will exclude patients from being enrolled into the study: 1. Unable or unwilling to meet requirements of the study; 2. Participation in a clinical study (ocular or nonocular) with an investigational drug, agent or therapy in the past six months; 3. Concurrent participation in another interventional clinical ocular study; 4. Prior participation in any gene or stem cell therapy (ocular or other); 5. Preexisting eye conditions that would preclude the planned treatment (i.e. injection) or interfere with the interpretation of study endpoints or surgical complications (example would include (but not limited to) glaucoma, diseases affecting the optic nerve causing significant visual field loss, active uveitis, corneal or lenticular opacities); 6. Complicating systemic diseases or clinically significant abnormal baseline laboratory values. Complicating systemic diseases would include those in which the disease itself, or the treatment for the disease, can alter ocular function. Examples are malignancies whose treatment could affect central nervous system function (for example, radiation treatment of the orbit; leukemia with central nervous system/optic nerve involvement). Also excluded would be subjects with any immunological response dysfunction, for example, immunocompromising diseases or use of immunosuppressive medications, among others. Subjects who are positive for hepatitis B, C, and HIV will be excluded.; 7. Cataract surgery, intraocular and/or periocular injection in the study eye within the prior six months; 8. Prior vitrectomy or aphakia in the study eye; 9. Known sensitivity to any component of the study agent or medications planned for use in the perioperative period. 10. Current pregnancy or breastfeeding; 11. Individuals of childbearing potential who are pregnant or unwilling to use effective contraception for the duration of the study; 12. Subjects will be excluded if immunological studies show presence of neutralizing antibodies to AAV2 above 1:1000; 13. Use of antiplatelet agents that may alter coagulation within 28 days prior to study agent administration; 14. Any other condition that would not allow the potential subject to complete followup examinations during the course of the study and, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the potential subject unsuitable for the study.</criteria>
