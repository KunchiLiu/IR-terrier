	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the use of the Eximo's CathiTM hybrid catheter in subjects affected with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) in lower extremity arteries.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness Study of Eximo's CathiTM Atherectomy Device for PAD Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, international, open-label, non-randomized clinical study. All enrolled subjects will undergo atherectomy procedure, during which the CathiTM catheter will be used to perform atherectomy in target lesion, followed by any other adjunctive therapy (balloon and/or stent etc.). The procedure will be done according to standard hospital procedure for atherectomy. The steps of the operation before and after the operating of the CathiTM device are routinely used practice and will be done according to local practice at each hospital. For the post-atherectomy stage, as an adjunctive therapy in the procedure, any approved device may be used (balloon and/or stent etc.). Subjects will then be followed for 12 months after the procedure.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject is ≥ 18 years old. 2. Subject is a candidate for endovascular intervention for peripheral artery disease in the lower extremities. 3. Documented symptomatic atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease Rutherford Classification 24. 4. Reference vessel lumen diameter proximal to target lesion is estimated to be &gt;150% of the outer diameter of the CathiTM, based on CT Angiogram. 5. Subject has infrainguinal target lesion(s) with stenosis (is estimated to be ≥70% based on CT angiogram), restenosis, instent restenosis or occlusions. 6. The target lesion blood flow diameter is estimated to be at least 0.5 mm smaller than Eximo catheter's outer diameter based on CT Angiogram. 7. At least one patent tibial runoff vessel at baseline. 8. Subject is capable and willing to comply with, and be present at, the followup clinic visits at least at the 30 days visit, with the intention to arrive to the 6 months and 12 months followup visits. 9. Subject has undergone standard of care and routine tests for a procedure like PAD intervention, including WBC profile, coagulation status and kidney function and found to be suitable. 10. Subject is able and willing to sign a written informed consent form (ICF). Intraoperative inclusion criteria (by fluoroscopy angiogram): 1. Reference vessel lumen diameter proximal to target lesion is &gt;150% of the outer diameter of the CathiTM. 2. The target lesion blood flow diameter is at least 0.5 mm smaller than Eximo catheter's outer diameter. 3. Target lesion has been crossed with a guidewire. 1. Target lesion is in or above inguinal level arteries. 2. Target lesion length &gt;25 cm. 3. Rutherford Class &lt; 2 or &gt; 4 4. Severe calcification in the target lesion 5. Target lesion is a thrombus only for which an embolic protection device is not intended to be used. 6. Target lesion stenosis &lt; 70% 7. Reference vessel lumen diameter proximal to target lesion is estimated to be ≤150% of the outer diameter of the CathiTM based on CT Angiogram. 8. Endovascular or surgical procedure performed on the index limb less than or equal to 30 days prior to the index procedure. 9. Planned endovascular or surgical procedure 30 days after the index procedure. 10. Intent to use other atherectomy device in the same procedure. 11. Lesion in the contralateral limb requiring intervention during the index procedure or within 30 days of the index procedure. 12. Subjects with active infections whether they are being currently treated or not. 13. Evidence or history of intracranial or gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial aneurysm, myocardial infarction or stroke within the past 2 months. 14. Evidence or history of aneurysmal target vessel within the past 2 months. 15. History of heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT). 16. Any clinical and/or angiographic complication attributed to the use of another device prior to the study procedure. 17. Any thrombolytic therapy within 2 weeks of the index procedure. 18. History of severe trauma, fracture, major surgery or biopsy of a parenchymal organ within the past 14 days. 19. Known allergy to contrast agents or medications used to perform endovascular intervention that cannot be adequately pretreated. 20. Subjects in whom antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated. 21. Serious illness that may affect subject compliance to protocol. 22. Participating in other clinical study that may interfere with study's primary and secondary endpoints. 23. Any issue that in the judgment of the investigator, may affect the results of the study. 24. Subject is pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study period. Intraoperative exclusion criteria (by fluoroscopy angiogram): 1. Total occlusion of the Target lesion that cannot be crossed by GW. 2. Reference vessel lumen diameter proximal to target lesion is ≤150% of the outer diameter of the CathiTM. 3. An embolic protection device cannot be used for a lesion that is only made of thrombus.</criteria>
