	<brief_title>AP-003-B Study to Evaluate the Efficacy And Safety Of An Intra-Articular Injection Of Ampion™ In Adults With Pain With Osteoarthritis Of The Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Study To Evaluate The Efficacy And Safety Of An Intra-Articular Injection Of AMPION™ In Adults With Pain Due to Osteoarthritis Of The Knee The primary trial objective is to evaluate the efficacy of 4 mL of AMPION™ versus 4 mL placebo intra-articular (IA) injection in improving knee pain, when administered to subjects suffering from OA of the knee. The secondary trial objective is evaluation of the safety of an intra-articular injection of AMPION™.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Able to provide written informed consent to participate in the study; Willing and able to comply with all study requirements and instructions of the site study staff; Male or female, 40 years to 85 years old (inclusive); Must be ambulatory; Index knee must be symptomatic for greater than 6 months with a clinical diagnosis of OA and supported by radiological evidence (Kellgren Lawrence Grade II to IV) read by a central reader; WOMAC 5point Likert pain subscale &lt;1.5 in the contralateral knee; Moderate to moderatelysevere OA pain in the index knee (rating of at least 1.5 on the WOMAC Index 3.1 5point Likert Pain Subscale); Moderate to moderatelysevere OA pain in the index knee (even if chronic doses of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), which have not changed in the 4 weeks prior to screening, have been/are being used); Ability to discontinue NSAID use at Screening visit and/or 72 hours prior to the Baseline visit and for the duration of the clinical study (low dose Aspirin is allowed during the study); No analgesia (including acetaminophen [paracetamol]) taken 24 hours prior to an efficacy measure; No known clinically significant liver abnormality (e.g. cirrhosis, transplant, etc.). As a result of medical review and screening investigation, the Principal Investigator considers the patient unfit for the study A history of allergic reactions to human albumin (reaction to nonhuman albumin such as egg albumin is not an exclusion criterion) A history of allergic reactions to excipients in 5% human albumin (Nacetyltryptophan, sodium caprylate) Presence of tense effusions Inflammatory or crystal arthropathies, acute fractures, history of aseptic necrosis or joint replacement in the affected knee, as assessed locally by the Principal Investigator Isolated patella femoral syndrome, also known as chondromalacia Any other disease or condition interfering with the free use and evaluation of the index knee for the duration of the trial (e.g. cancer, congenital defects, spine osteoarthritis) Major injury to the index knee within the 12 months prior to screening Severe hip osteoarthritis ipsilateral to the index knee Any pain that could interfere with the assessment of index knee pain (e.g. pain in any other part of the lower extremities, pain radiating to the knee) Any pharmacological or nonpharmacological treatment targeting OA started or changed during the 4 weeks prior to randomization or likely to be changed during the duration of the study Pregnancy or planning to become pregnant during the study. Use of the following medications: No IA injected pain medications in the study knee during the study No analgesics containing opioids. NSAIDs are not permitted during the study; acetaminophen is available as a rescue medication during the study from the provided supply. No topical treatment on osteoarthritis index knee during the study No significant anticoagulant therapy (e.g. Heparin or Lovenox) during the study (treatment such as low dose Aspirin and Plavix are allowed) No systemic treatments that may interfere with safety or efficacy assessments during the study No immunosuppressants No use of corticosteroids No human albumin treatment in the 3 months before randomization or throughout the duration of the study</criteria>
