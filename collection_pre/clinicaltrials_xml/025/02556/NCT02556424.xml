	<brief_summary>Corticosteroids, whether injected peri- or intra-ocularly, remain indispensable tools of the therapeutic arsenal in treating inflammatory macular edema. However, a few years ago, only triamcinolone acetonide was available to ophthalmologists. This molecule, developed initially for rheumatological or dermatological use, has been increasingly deployed in ophthalmology, while still off-label. In 2011, the delivery system of dexamethasone from biodegradable and injectable implant into the vitreous cavity obtained the label for inflammatory macular edema. This protocol is therefore designed to compare the efficacy and safety of peri- and intra-ocular injections of corticosteroids in the treatment of inflammatory macular edema.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerance Comparison Between Subconjunctival Injection of Triamcinolone and Intravitreal Implant of Dexamethasone for the Treatment of Inflammatory Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research compares the implantation techniques of corticosteroids in the eye, with two groups of equal size being followed. This is a multi-center, controlled study, with the reference drug being the intravitreal implant of 700μg of dexamethasone (Ozurdex®) compared to subconjunctival injection of triamcinolone (Kénacort retard®). This is an open, prospective, randomized study. It is not possible, for technical reasons, to inject blind two products with different injection routes and that are visible to the investigator during control examinations (sub-conjunctival crystals and intravitreal implant). However, the assessment of visual acuity and central macular thickness will be performed by an uninformed ophthalmologist.</detailed_description>
