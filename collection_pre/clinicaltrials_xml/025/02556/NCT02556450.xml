	<brief_summary>Despite advances in care, prognosis remains poor once overt Heart Failure (HF) has developed. Prevention is most efficient when directed toward patients at risk and when mechanistically targeted to patients most likely to respond. An increase in myocardial and possibly vascular collagen content (fibrosis) may be a major determinant of the transition to HF. In patients with hypertension and diabetes, two important risk-factors for HF, changes in blood markers of fibrosis occur before clinically overt HF develops. These markers are also related to prognosis. In the general population, Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a potential marker of fibrosis, is associated with cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, and predicts development of HF. In animal models, Gal-3 is a key mediator of aldosterone-induced CV and renal fibrosis and dysfunction. The investigators hypothesize that the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), spironolactone, may prevent HF by acting on extracellular matrix remodelling, especially in patients with active fibrogenesis, identified by high Gal-3 levels. The benefit/risk ratio of spironolactone might be superior in patients with a higher compared to lower plasma concentrations of Gal-3. Main objective is to investigate whether spironolactone can favourably alter extra-cellular matrix remodelling, assessed by changes in the fibrosis biomarker Procollagen Type III N-Terminal Peptide (PIIINP), in patients at increased risk of developing heart failure and whether this effect is greater in patients with increased plasma concentrations of Gal-3.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Written informed consent will be obtained prior to any study procedure; Age &gt;65 years Clinical risk factors for developing heart failure, either: 1. Coronary artery disease (h/o myocardial infarction, angioplasty or coronary artery bypass) Or 2. At least two of the following: Diabetes Mellitus requiring Hypoglycaemic Pharmacotherapy Receiving pharmacological treatment for Hypertension Microalbuminuria Abnormal ECG (left ventricular hypertrophy, QRS &gt;120msec, abnormal Qwaves) Biological risk: NTproBNP values between 125 and 1,000 ng/L or BNP values between 35 and 280 pg/ml (consistent with ESC guidelines indicating risk of HF but helping to rule out prevalent HF or atrial fibrillation which are associated with marked increases in NTproBNP/BNP and should be investigated) Recent wound healing/inflammation: Surgical procedure, coronary, cerebral or peripheral vascular events or infection in the prior 3 months Cancer Autoimmune disease Hepatic Disease Preexisting diagnosis of clinical HF Moderate/severe LV systolic ventricular dysfunction, i.e. LVEF &lt;45% Moderate or severe valve disease (investigators opinion) eGFR&lt; 30ml/min Serum potassium &gt;5.0 mmol/L Treatment with an MRA or a loop diuretic (furosemide, bumetanide, ethacrynic acid or torasemide) in the previous three months Potassium supplements or potassiumsparing diuretic at time of enrolment. Atrial fibrillation within one month prior to inclusion (AF lasting &lt;60 seconds on ambulatory ECG monitoring is permitted) â€¢. History of hypersensitivity to spironolactone. Patients unable to give written informed consent. Participation in another interventional trial in the preceding month Ability to walk is, in the investigators opinion, clearly limited by joint disease or other locomotor problems rather than by cardiorespiratory fitness</criteria>
