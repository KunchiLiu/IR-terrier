	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a generalized disorder of connective tissue, arterioles and microvessels, characterized by the occurrence of fibrosis and vascular obliteration phenomena. The alterations in lung microvessels are found in pulmonary involvement of scleroderma, which are the most serious complications of the disease. In pulmonary emphysema, there are also changes in pulmonary microvasculature, which are involved in the onset and development of the disease. The confocal endomicroscopy is an endoscopic technique which can be performed during a bronchoscopy. This technique makes it possible to observe in real time the most distal pulmonary elements at the microscopic scale. After injection of fluorescein, then the technique of observing the pulmonary microvasculature, in vivo and in situ. The characterization of microvascular lesions in these two pathologies could improve understanding of their mechanisms and ultimately improve the early management of patients.</brief_summary>
