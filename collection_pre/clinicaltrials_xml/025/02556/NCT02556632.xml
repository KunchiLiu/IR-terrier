	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot phase II trial studies and compares prophylactic topical agents in reducing radiation-induced dermatitis in patients with non-inflammatory breast cancer or breast cancer in situ. The prophylactic topical agents, such as curcumin-based gel or HPR Plus, may reduce the severity of the radiation-induced dermatitis by minimizing water loss and inflammation during radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prophylactic Topical Agents in Reducing Radiation-Induced Dermatitis in Patients With Non-inflammatory Breast Cancer or Breast Cancer In Situ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To investigate the effectiveness of Curcumin gel (curcumin-based gel) or HPR Plus™ in reducing radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To investigate the effectiveness of Curcumin gel or HPR Plus™ in reducing pain from radiation therapy (RT)-induced skin reactions. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the feasibility of administering prophylactic topical treatments for radiation dermatitis to breast cancer patients receiving RT. II. Identify a blood biomarker that correlates with the severity of radiation dermatitis at the end of RT and a biomarker for response to topical treatment. III. Evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of using "central blinded reviewers" for rating radiation dermatitis severity on digital photographs. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms. ARM I: Patients apply curcumin-based gel three times daily (TID) approximately every 4-6 hours beginning on the first day of radiation therapy and continuing until 1 week after completion of radiation therapy. ARM II: Patients apply HPR Plus™ topically TID approximately every 4-6 hours beginning on the first day of radiation therapy and continuing until 1 week after completion of radiation therapy. ARM III: Patients apply placebo gel topically TID approximately every 4-6 hours beginning on the first day of radiation therapy and continuing until 1 week after completion of radiation therapy. After completion of radiation therapy, patients are followed up at 2 weeks.</detailed_description>
