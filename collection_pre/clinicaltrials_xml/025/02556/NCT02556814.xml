	<brief_title>Caffeic Acid Combining High-dose Dexamethasone in Management of ITP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are undertaking a multicenter, randomized, double blinded placebo-controlled trial of 240 primary ITP adult patients from 8 medical centers in China. One part of the participants are randomly selected to receive caffeic acid tablets (given orally at a dose of 900mg per day for 3 consecutive months), combining with dexamethasone (given orally at a dose of 40 mg per day for 4 days, two cycles with an interval of 10 days); the others are selected to receive high-dose of dexamethasone treatment plus placebo. Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. In order to report the efficacy and safety of caffeic acid tablets combining with high-dose dexamethasone therapy for the treatment of adults with ITP.</detailed_description>
