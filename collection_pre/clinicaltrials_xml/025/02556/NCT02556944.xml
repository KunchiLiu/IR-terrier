	<brief_title>Mix and Match Study of Two Multifocal Intraocular Lens With Different Add Power</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multifocal intraocular lens (MIOL) is considered a prevailing alternative to restore the functional vision from far to near independent of glasses. Many clinical studies on diffractive MIOLs, refractive MIOLs, or hybrid MIOLs in enhancing quality of vision showed promising outcomes. Several studies have confirmed the satisfactory visual outcomes of Tecnis MIOL with +4.00 D add power. The purpose of study is to assess the visual performance after cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of multifocal IOL with two different add power (+2.75 D or +3.25 D) in one patient.</detailed_description>
