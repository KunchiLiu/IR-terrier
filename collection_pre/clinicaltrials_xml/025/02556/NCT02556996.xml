	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial performed in Egyptian children 6-18 months of age. The primary aim of the study is to determine the protective efficacy of an oral, inactivated whole-cell enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) vaccine against diarrhea associated with excretion of ETEC that express a vaccine-shared antigen over a one year period of follow-up by active surveillance. The vaccine consists of a mixture of five formalin-killed ETEC bacteria expressing prevalent ETEC colonization factors and recombinant cholera toxin B-subunit (killed ETEC/rCTB vaccine). The placebo preparation is heat-killed Escherichia coli K-12 bacteria.</brief_summary>
