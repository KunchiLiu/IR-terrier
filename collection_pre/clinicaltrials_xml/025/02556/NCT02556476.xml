	<brief_title>Cost Effectiveness Analysis of Critical Care in Resource Limited Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators objective was to calculate the cost effectiveness of treatment of critically ill patients in a medical ICU of a middle income country with limited access to ICU resources. Methods: Consecutive critically ill medical patients treated in a recently established medical ICU in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, were prospectively recorded and a subsequent cost utility analysis of intensive care in comparison to hospital ward treatment from the perspective of health care system was performed. Incremental cost effectiveness was calculated using estimates of ICU versus non-ICU treatment effectiveness based on a formal systematic review of published studies. Decision analytic modeling was used to compare treatment alternatives. Sensitivity analyses of the key model parameters were performed.</detailed_description>
