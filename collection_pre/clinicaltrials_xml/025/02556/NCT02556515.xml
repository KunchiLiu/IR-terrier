	<brief_summary>Interpositional arthroplasty is by many considered to be the current gold standard for the treatment of thumb carpometacarpal arthritis. The results are generally good, but the rehabilitation time can be long and failures are difficult to treat. Total joint replacements now exist with modern uncemented designs that can be an alternative treatment. Short term studies show that thumb function often is better and rehabilitation time shorter, however there is uncertainty with regards to the longevity of the implants. Currently no prospective randomized trials have compared these two treatment options. Our hypothesis is that the total joint replacement will give the same results or better when compared to the interpositional arthroplasty.</brief_summary>
