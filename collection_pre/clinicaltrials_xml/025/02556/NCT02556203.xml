	<brief_summary>To assess whether a rivaroxaban-based anticoagulation strategy, following successful TAVR, compared to an antiplatelet-based strategy, is superior in reducing death or first thromboembolic events (DTE). To assess the primary bleeding events (PBE) of the rivaroxaban-based strategy compared to an antiplateletbased strategy, following TAVR.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Successful TAVR (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) of an aortic valve stenosis (either native or valveinvalve) By iliofemoral or subclavian access With any approved/marketed device Atrial fibrillation (AF), current or previous, with an ongoing indication for oral anticoagulant treatment Any other indication for continued treatment with any oral anticoagulant (OAC) Known bleeding diathesis (such as but not limited to active internal bleeding, clinically significant bleeding, platelet count â‰¤ 50,000/mm3 at screening, hemoglobin level &lt; 8.5 g/dL, active peptic ulcer or known gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, history of intracranial hemorrhage or subdural hematoma) Any ongoing absolute indication for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) at time of screening that is unrelated to the TAVR procedure Clinically overt stroke within the last 3 months Planned coronary or vascular intervention or major surgery Severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or on dialysis, or postTAVR unresolved acute kidney injury with renal dysfunction stage 2 or higher Moderate and severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh Class B or C) or any hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy</criteria>
