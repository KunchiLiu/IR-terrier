	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigation is to conduct a randomized, patient-blinded prospective controlled trial comparing peripheral intravenous cannulation in children done by: 1. Conventional landmark cannulation where the intravenous cannulation is done by direct visual guidance or palpation or a combination thereof. 2. Ultrasound guided cannulation by means of DNTP. The investigators hypothesize that with ultrasound-guided peripheral intravenous cannulation the first-attempt success rate will be significantly higher than by the conventional landmark cannulation technique.</brief_summary>
