	<brief_title>Exploring the Effects of Sleep Patterns and Physical Activity on Asthma in Adolescents With Wrist-worn Smart Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (Pediatrics), the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and the University of Florida will work together to conduct a research study to find associations between asthma symptoms, sleep patterns, and physical activity over an 8-week period among adolescent patients with persistent asthma. The goal of this research study is to find new ways for teenagers to manage their asthma. Full understanding of the connection and interference of sleep patterns and physical activity with asthma symptoms will be very helpful for teenagers with asthma to better manage their daily routine and asthma care. This research study will use wrist-worn devices (i.e. Fitbit® wristbands) to collect participants' sleep and physical activity data.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥ 14 and ≤ 17 years; 2. Teen access to a mobile smartphone device with a data plan or a computer with reliable internet connection, compatible with the Fitbit® application during the study period; 3. Diagnosis of mild, moderate or severe persistent asthma per National Heart Lung Blood Institute (NHLBI). 1. Current smokers and adolescents with significant underlying respiratory disease other than asthma (such as cystic fibrosis) that could potentially interfere with asthmarelated outcome measures; 2. Prior diagnosis of sleep disorder; 3. Patients with significant comorbid conditions (such as moderate to severe developmental delay) that could interfere with the adolescent's ability to selfmonitor asthma; 4. Inability to speak or understand English (child or parent).</criteria>
