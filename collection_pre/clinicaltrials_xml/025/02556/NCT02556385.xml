	<brief_title>Effects of rTMS Based on Brain Activation During Language Performance in Stroke Patients With Non-fluent Aphasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In poststsroke aphasia rehabilitation, repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS) studies aimed to reinforce the activity of the brain regions in the left hemisphere. This goal can be achieved by using an excitatory protocol to reactivate the perilesional area or inhibitory protocol to reduce activities in the contralesional area. However, most conventional rTMS studies employed an inhibitory low frequency protocol for the contralesional homologs of Broca's area. In the present pilot study, investigators will perform functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) prior to rTMS treatment for selection of the most appropriate application of stimulation. Stimulation site and protocol (high frequency or low frequency rTMS) will be determined by activation pattern from the fNIRS findings with language task in individual patients.</detailed_description>
