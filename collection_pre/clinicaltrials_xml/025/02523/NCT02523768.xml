	<brief_summary>IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a histologically defined glomerulonephritis (renal biopsy) by the presence of deposits immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the renal mesangium (at least 1+) by immunofluorescence. The clinic allows excluding secondary forms (10-15%). Recurrence of this condition on the renal graft is time-dependent and confirmed in 25 to 50% of 10 years post-transplant. The primary immunosuppressive induction regimens currently used in kidney transplantation are the anti-lymphocyte globulin (GAL) whose main target is human T lymphocytes (ATG, polyclonal) and monoclonal anti-CD25 antibodies (α chain of the interleukin receptor 2 in the surface of T lymphocytes). Due to their potent and prolonged immunosuppressive properties, the ATG may prevent or delay the recurrence on renal transplant. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of induction therapy (ATG versus Basiliximab) in the cumulative incidence at 5 years of (IgAN) recurrence after a first kidney transplant. This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open trial with a follow-up period of 5 years old. Patients in the ATG arm will receive 5 antilymphocyte globulin infusions Fresenius® (rabbit immunoglobulin antilymphocyte human T-Fresenius® said ATG) from Day 0 to Day + 4 post-transplant (day 0 one dose of 4mg / kg, day 1 one dose of 4mg/kg, day2 one dose of 4mgkg, day 3 one dose of 3 m/kg and day 4 and one final dose of 3 mg/kg) and the patients in the anti-CD25 arm will receive 2 doses of 20 mg of basiliximab (Simulect®) pn day 0 and day 4 after the graft. The maintenance immunosuppressive therapy is left to the discretion of the center. The primary endpoint will be the clinical and histological recurrence of IgAN defined by the presence of mesangial deposits of IgA (at least 1) by immunofluorescence on a biopsy of the graft triggered by the onset of proteinuria 1g/j and/or microalbuminuria greater than 300 mg / day.</brief_summary>
