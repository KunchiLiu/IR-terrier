	<brief_title>Wellbeing in Pregnancy: Evaluating an Intervention to Improve Women's Emotional Wellbeing in Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is estimated that mental health problems affect 10-20% of postnatal women. Many of these women do not seek help for their mental health for numerous reasons, including lack of awareness about symptoms, available treatments, and stigma. The Wellbeing Plan is a brief self-help leaflet developed by experts in perinatal mental health, and is designed to improve emotional wellbeing of women during and after pregnancy by providing information, raising awareness, helping a woman identify her own symptoms, provide coping strategies, and identify key people who can support the woman during this time. The Wellbeing in Pregnancy project is a online pilot randomized controlled trial which aims to evaluate the efficacy of the Wellbeing Plan in improving women's emotional wellbeing in pregnancy.</detailed_description>
