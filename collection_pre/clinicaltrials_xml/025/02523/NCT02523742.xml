	<brief_summary>Recently, we have shown functional resonance imaging (fMRI) that variations in signal induced by a language task were significantly lower in a semantic region of the left hemisphere (comprised of that part pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus and the temporal gyri medium and angular) in schizophrenic patients compared with controls matched for age, sex, level of education and handedness. Investigators wish to test the hypothesis that functional modification of the hemispherical specialization is specific language and also specific for schizophrenia.</brief_summary>
