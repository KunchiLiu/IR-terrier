	<brief_title>Resveratrol and Exercise to Treat Functional Limitations in Late Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigation is a pilot study to investigate the potential of resveratrol, a commercially-available nutritional product, to enhance the efficacy of physical exercise in improving physical function among older adults with functional limitations. The overarching objective of this project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intervention combining resveratrol supplementation and physical exercise among sedentary persons aged &gt; 65 years objectively-measured functional impairments. A total of 60 participants will be recruited to participate in this three month intervention study. All participants will engage in a center-based exercise program 3/days per week and will be randomly assigned to consume 1) placebo, 2) 250 mg/day resveratrol, or 3) 1000 mg/day resveratrol. This study will provide critical information regarding the influence of the combination of resveratrol and exercise on objectively-measured and self-assessed indices of physical function. The study will also provide novel biologic information regarding the relative effects of the interventions on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function.</detailed_description>
