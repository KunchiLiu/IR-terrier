	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to define the safety and tolerability of this drug combination. The study will also define the response rate of patients with advanced and unresectable NSCLC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ALT-803 Plus Nivolumab in Patients With Pretreated, Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has a dose escalation (Ib) and dose expansion phase (II). The ALT-803 treatment in the Phase Ib portion of the study will escalate until a recommended dose level is decided. This dose level will be used in the phase II portion of the study. The Phase II potion of the study will include two groups: Nivolumab naive and Nivolumab progressing. Patients will be enrolled to one of the arms based on their previous treatment with Nivolumab.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC who present with Stage IIIB/Stage IV disease, or recurrent disease following radiation therapy or surgical resection. Patient must be eligible for treatment with nivolumab. Patients previously treated with nivolumab, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab and who have progressed are eligible. Subjects with EGFR or ALK mutations are eligible after disease recurrence or progression after at least one targeted therapy for advanced or metastatic disease. Measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Age ≥ 18 years Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤1 Adequate organ system function within 14 days of registration: absolute neutrophil count ≥ 750/μL (≥0.75 X 109/L) platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL (≥ 30 X 109/L) hemoglobin &gt; 8g/dL Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 x ULN AST &lt; 3.0 X ULN ALT&lt; 3.0 X ULN eGFR &gt; 45mL/min Adequate pulmonary function without any clinical sign of severe pulmonary dysfunction. Negative serum pregnancy test if a woman of child bearing potential. Female participants of childbearing potential must adhere to using a medically accepted method of birth control prior to screening and agree to continue its use during the study or be surgically sterilized (e.g., hysterectomy or tubal ligation) and males must agree to use barrier methods of birth control while on study. prior treatment with other antiPD1, antiPDL1, antiPDL2, antiCD137 or antiCTLA4 antibody is not allowed. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrollable supraventricular arrhythmias, any history of a ventricular arrhythmia, or other clinical signs of severe cardiac dysfunction. Symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of registration. Marked baseline prolongation of QT/corrected QT interval (e.g. demonstration of a QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds). Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases are excluded, unless patient meets the conditions outlined in the protocol. Known autoimmune disease requiring active treatment. Symptomatic interstitial lung disease (patients with a history of pneumonitis are not excluded). Prior therapy with antiPD1, antiPDL1, antiPDL2, antiCD137, or antiCTLA4 antibody Known HIVpositive. Active systemic infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy. All prior infections must have resolved following optimal therapy. Positive hepatitis C serology or active hepatitis B infection. Chronic asymptomatic viral hepatitis is allowed. Women who are pregnant or nursing. Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Any ongoing toxicity from prior anticancer treatment that, in the judgment of the investigator, may interfere with study treatment. Anticancer treatment including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, other immunotherapy, or investigational therapy within 14 days of registration. Other illness that in the opinion of the investigator would exclude the patient from participating in this study, including uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease</criteria>
