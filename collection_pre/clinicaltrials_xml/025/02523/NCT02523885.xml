	<brief_summary>To investigate exposure to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during outpatient management at the early stage of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring hospital consultation. Non-interventional observational study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs in Patients With Community Acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent data suggests that such exposure to NSAIDs is associated with delay in CAP diagnosis and antibiotic prescription that influence CAP presention and outcome. The investigators' working hypothesis is that NSAIDs use may mask initial symptoms and delay antimicrobial therapy, thus predisposing to worse outcomes. All patients presenting at one of the three following locations (emergency department, ICU or pneumology ward) with a suspicion of community-acquired pneumonia will be screened for eligibility. Exposure or not to NSAIDs will be investigated. Clinical, biological and radioloigcal features and outcome of CAP will be compared with respect to NSAIDs exposure.</detailed_description>
