	<brief_summary>The purpose of this observational study is to find the best measures to define how well a person with eosinophilic disorder is doing. People with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), eosinophilic gastritis (EG), and eosinophilic colitis (EC) normally undergo endoscopy and/or colonoscopy (scope down the throat or up the bottom) where tissue specimens are collected for microscopic analysis. Treatments are then decided based on how the tissue looks. We are aiming to compare different tissue components such as inflammatory cell types with clinical symptoms. We want to see if scores on standard questionnaires can give us an idea how well the person is doing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OMEGA: Outcome Measures in Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disorders Across the Ages</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a longitudinal observational study in which individuals (males and females between the ages of 3-65 years) with EoE, EG, and EC will be followed over the course of time to see if standard questionnaires can give us an idea of how well the person is doing. Participants undergoing standard of care (normal, routine care) endoscopies and/or colonoscopies will have biopsies (small pieces of tissue from the GI tract normally collected during these procedures) collected and used for the research study. Participants will also complete questionnaires related to their symptoms and quality of life. Participants will be followed over the course of time and asked to complete the questionnaires at various time points throughout the study.</detailed_description>
