	<brief_title>Pilot Study of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in the Evaluation of Men With an Elevated PSA Following Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>18F-DCFPyL is a novel low-molecular weight PSMA imaging agent. A recent study of patients with metastatic prostate cancer found that PSMA PET/CT identified more sites of disease than conventional imaging with CT, MRI and bone scan. In this study we aim to investigate 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in patients with an elevated PSA following radical prostatectomy. During the course of this study, patients will undergo two 18F-DCPyL PET/CT scans. The first scan will take place within 45 days of staging imaging and the second will take place following six months of standard of care therapy.</detailed_description>
