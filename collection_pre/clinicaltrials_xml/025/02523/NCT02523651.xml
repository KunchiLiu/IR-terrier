	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of clinical injection of allogeneic human dental pulp stem cell(DPSC) in local infected periodontal tissue and determine whether injection of allogeneic DPSC is a effective way in the treatment of chronic periodontal disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Periodontal Regeneration of Chronic Periodontal Disease Patients Receiving Stem Cells Injection Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will involve 40 patients who were diagnosed as chronic periodontitis will receive periodontal scaling and root planing. Patients will randomly be divided at the base line into two groups.In test group, 20 chronic periodontitis patients will be treated using local DPSC injection. Whereas, a control group will contain 20 patients who will be treated using placebo. Clinical examination including Quigley-Hein plaque index (QHI), bleeding on probing (BoP), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and gingival recession (GR) will be perform in different time points during the study. Radiographic and clinical examination will be carried out during the late healing phase up to 12 months post operation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of periodontal disease will be based on clinical assessment of: QuigleyHein index (QHI) Bleeding on Probing (BoP) Pocket Probing Depth (PD) gingival recession (GR) Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) furcation involvement,and radiographical assessment. All patients at the base line of this study should have been received the initial treatment and reached the qualified level of oral hygiene to be included in the next stage. Pregnant, smokers, immunosuppressed or diabetes patients, patients exhibit gingival hypertrophy, require premedication, and who have been taking systemic antiinflammatory medications, or have taken antibiotics or received periodontal instrumentation within 6 months prior to the study, will be excluded.</criteria>
