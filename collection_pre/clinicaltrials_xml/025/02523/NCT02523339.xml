	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to test if oxygen saturation in retinal vessels is correlated with clinical parameters, such as visual acuity, central retinal thickness and presence of neovascularization. Retinal oximetry is performed with fundus camera based oximeters. The study will not entail change in treatment of the disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Retinal Vein Occlusion</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Suspected central retinal vein occlusion. Informed consent for participation. No treatment before the first oximetry measurement. History of other retinal disease. Glaucoma and diabetes without retinopathy are not exclusion criteria but should be registered. History of cardiovascular or respiratory diseases that can be expected to influence systemic or retinal oxygen saturation. Examples: Known COPD or carotid stenosis. Subjects with high blood pressure will not be excluded but blood pressure should be registered. Poor quality images will be excluded based on the images themselves. Therefore, grading of cataract or other media opacities is not strictly necessary for the purpose of the study.</criteria>
