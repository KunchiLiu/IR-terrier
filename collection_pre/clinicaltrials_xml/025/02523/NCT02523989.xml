	<brief_title>The Relationship Between Arsenic Methylation Capability and Blood Metals in Children With Developmental Delays</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators recruited children with developmental delays and children with normal development from Shin-Kong Ho-Su Memorial Hospital as controls. Information obtained from the interview included socioeconomic and basic demographic characteristics as well as children function, health condition, and quality of life. On the other hand, blood and urine samples of the participants were collected for the analysis of arsenic methylation related enzymes using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. 2 ml blood were digested for the determination of mercury, lead and arsenic. The relationship between arsenic methylation and blood metals in children with developmental delays and its correlation with health related quality of were analyzed.</detailed_description>
