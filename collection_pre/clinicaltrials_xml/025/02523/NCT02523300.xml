	<brief_summary>To explore the potential prognostic effect of glucocorticoid on the postoperative aorta-related adverse events after aortic dissections patients underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), glucocorticoid (30mg/kg) will be intravenously given within 2h after TEVAR.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glucocorticoid on the Prognosis of TEVAR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, open, single-center, randomized controlled trial. Number of patients: 240 patients will be included and undertaken TEVAR.About 120 patients will be given glucocorticoid within 2h after TEVAR as experimental group, and the other 120 patients will be given saline as control group. Follow-up: 1. aortic computed tomographic angiography (CTA) examination 6, 12 and 24 months after TEVAR; 2. telephone or clinical follow-up at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Primary outcome measure: aorta-related adverse events. Second outcome measure: 30-day mortality after TEVAR, success rate of endovascular repair, drug-related adverse events.</detailed_description>
