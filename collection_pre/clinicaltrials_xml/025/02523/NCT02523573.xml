	<brief_summary>Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is at risk for worsening hypoxemia in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). High-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC) improves hypoxemia in ARF patients . We investigated its efficacy and tolerance in intensive care unit patients admitted for ARF requiring BAL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen for Bronchoscopy With Bronchoalveolar Lavage in ICU Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, observational, multicenter study in ARF patients (minimal pulse oximetry -SpO2- of 92% with an minimal oxygen flow of 6 L/min , respiratory rate &gt; 25/min (20/min if use of accessory respiratory muscles) with a compatible etiology. Primary outcome measure is increase in ventilatory support (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) or endotracheal intubation (ETI)) within the first 24h following BAL.</detailed_description>

	<mesh_term>Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency</mesh_term>
	<criteria>presence of acute respiratory failure: defined as respiratory rate greater than 25/min, (or greater than 20/min if use of accessory respiratory muscles was present), in patients requiring oxygen greater than or equal to 6 L/min to obtain a pulse oximetry greater than 92% need for bronchoalveolar lavage (decision to perform BAL was left at the physician's discretion) at least one contraindication to the bronchoscopy with BAL: acute coronary syndrome within 6 weeks; neurologic failure; thrombocytopenia less than 30 000/mm3; respiratory acidosis with a pH lower than 7.30 or hypercapnia higher than 60 mmHg; pneumothorax undrained.</criteria>
