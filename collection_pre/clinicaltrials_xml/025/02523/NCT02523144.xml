	<criteria>Outpatients scheduled to receive sedation for transthoracic echocardiography Subject must be a candidate for both types of anesthetic and both doses of dexmedetomidine Must be 3 months to 36 months of age The subject has a history of cardiac conduction system disease (e.g. 1st or 2nd degree AV block) or channelopathy (e.g. long QT). The subject is taking digoxin, alphaadrenergic or betaadrenergic agonist or antagonist (e.g., clonidine, propranolol, albuterol), antiarrhythmic medications, or vasodilators (e.g. ACE inhibitors) The subject has received a dose of any other sedative within 48 hours. The subject has lifethreatening, medical conditions (American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status 4, 5). The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification scale is a measure of physical status or how healthy the patient is. For our study, we will focus on children which are defined as ASA I, II or III which means a healthy child (ASA I), a child with a systemic disease that is mild and well controlled (ASA II) or a child with systemic disease that is severe and controlled (ASA III). The subject is allergic to or has a contraindication to any of the drugs used in the study. The subject has previously been treated under this protocol. The subject has severe coarctation of the aorta (risk of exaggerated vasoconstriction) The subject has Moyamoya disease (risk of recurrent stroke)</criteria>
