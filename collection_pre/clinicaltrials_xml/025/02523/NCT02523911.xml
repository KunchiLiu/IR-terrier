	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerability of Suprep With and Without Simethicone for Routine Colonoscopy for Colorectal Cancer Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will investigate sodium sulfate/potassium sulfate/magnesium sulfate (Suprep), with and without simethicone, in terms of efficacy and patient tolerability in the preparation of patients undergoing routine colonoscopy. Adult ambulatory outpatients who are scheduled for elective routine colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening will be recruited to participate in the trial. Patients will be randomized to receive either simethicone or placebo in addition to oral sodium sulfate/potassium sulfate/magnesium sulfate solution (Suprep) and will receive verbal and written instruction on administration of solutions. During colonoscopy, three areas of the colon (right colon, transverse colon, and left colon) will be assessed during removal of the colonoscope for overall colon cleansing, presence of bubbles, and degree of haziness; this will be scored by a blinded endoscopist. A separate written patient questionnaire will be used to assess acceptability and tolerability of the preparation, as well as any adverse events.</detailed_description>
