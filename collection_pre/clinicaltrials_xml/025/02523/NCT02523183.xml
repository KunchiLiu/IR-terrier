	<brief_summary>Many families of children with medically refractory epilepsy are choosing to use medicinal cannabinoids (MCBD) as an adjunctive alternative treatment option. The safety, tolerability and efficacy of these products are not known. The primary objective of this study is to determine how the use of MCBD affects children with medically refractory epilepsy in an observational study. Measures of evaluation to be used will include: laboratory values, developmental measures, seizure diaries and serial electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Medicinal Cannabinoids as Adjunctive Treatment for Medically Refractory Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an observational study of a family's choice to use MCBD and the effect of this substance on medically refractory epilepsy in children. The risks associated with this use are not well known. There have recently been reports of stroke, liver dysfunction and altered anticonvulsant levels. In addition, there have been long term risks reported of decreased memory function, cognitive problems and executive function abnormalities. This study does not condone or advocate the use of the substance but merely seeks to document the short term effects of the use in this population. It should be noted that providers at Children's Hospital Colorado are not registered providers for medicinal cannabis; therefore, this will be an observational study of effects of this substance as prescribed by other physicians outside of our institution.</detailed_description>
