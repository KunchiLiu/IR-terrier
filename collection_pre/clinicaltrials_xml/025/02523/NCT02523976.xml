	<brief_summary>In this single-center, open-label, no control,prospective clinical trial, a total of 30 Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) patients will be enrolled. Dasatinib 100 mg per day will be given orally along with combination chemotherapy starting day 8 of induction chemotherapy. Dasatinib will be given continuously (if it's tolerable) for 2 years since achievement of complete remission (CR) as part of consolidation chemotherapy and maintenance therapy.Patients can receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or autologous HSCT whenever possible during their first CR. Otherwise, they will finish the consolidation chemotherapy. The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy of Dasatinib with multi-agent chemotherapy in newly-diagnosed Ph+ ALL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib Combined With Chemotherapy in Philadelphia Chromosome-positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this single-center, open-label, Phase II study, nonrandomized,no control,prospective clinical trial,a total of 30 Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) patients will be enrolled.Patients will be diagnosed according to morphologic,immunologic, cytogenetic and molecular(MICM) criteria, including bone marrow morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetic and molecular genetic (BCR/ABL gene, qualitative and quantitative analysis) examination. Dasatinib 100 mg per day will be given orally along with combination chemotherapy starting day 8 of induction chemotherapy. Dasatinib will be given continuously (if it's tolerable) for 2 years since achievement of complete remission (CR) as part of consolidation chemotherapy and maintenance therapy.Patients can receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT),or patients who keep BCR/ABL negative can receive autologous HSCT whenever possible during their first CR. Otherwise, they will finish the consolidation chemotherapy. Total duration of follow-up will be 2 year after last enrollment. Pre-treatment evaluation will include complete blood count (CBC) with reticulocyte count, chemistry, electrolytes, coagulation, hepatitis profile, chest X-ray.Evaluation during treatment will include: CBC every two days during myelosuppression, chemistry, electrolytes, coagulation before each cycles of chemotherapy. Quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) for Bcr-Abl will be done from bone marrow mononuclear cells at diagnosis, at CR, and before each cycles of consolidation chemotherapy,then every 3 months during maintenance therapy. For patients who undergo allogeneic HSCT, quantitative PCR for Bcr-Abl will be done from bone marrow mononuclear cells at the initiation of conditioning, and then every 3 months. PCR will be done in IS standardized lab. Side effects of combination therapy will be monitored and described according to Common Toxicity Criteria, version 4.0 (National Cancer Institute, USA). The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy of Dasatinib with multi-agent chemotherapy in newly-diagnosed Ph+ ALL.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients aged 18 to 60 years with De novo Philadelphia chromosome positive (Philadelphia chromosome positive or BCR/ABL transcript positive) acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status 2. 3. Adequate end organ function as defined by: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal（ULN）; serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase(SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN; Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN; Serum amylase and lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN; Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN unless considered tumor related; Patients must have adequate cardiac function (ejection fraction ≥ 45 % on Multiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scan). 4. Patients must have the following laboratory values (≥ lower limit of normal (LLN) or corrected to within normal limits with supplements prior to the first dose of study medication.): Potassium ≥ LLN; Magnesium ≥ LLN; Phosphorus ≥ LLN 5. Patients should sign informed consent form. 1. Impaired cardiac function: Long QT syndrome or a known family history of long QT syndrome; clinically significant resting brachycardia (&lt;50 beats per minute); ejection fraction &lt; 45 % on MUGA scan. QTc interval &gt; 450 msec on baseline ECG (using the QTcF formula). If QTcF interval&gt;450 msec and electrolytes are not within normal ranges, electrolytes should be corrected and then the patient rescreened for QTc. Myocardial infarction within 12 months prior to starting study; other clinically significant heart disease (e.g. unstable angina, congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled arrhythmias). Patients who are currently receiving treatment with any medications that have the potential to prolong the QT interval and the treatment cannot be either discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drug. 2. Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions: Patients with another primary malignant disease, except those that do not currently require treatment; acute or chronic liver, pancreatic or severe renal disease; another severe and/or lifethreatening medical disease. 3. Patients who are: (a) pregnant, (b) breast feeding, (c) of childbearing potential without a negative pregnancy test prior to baseline and (d) male or female of childbearing potential unwilling to use contraceptive precautions throughout the trial (postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing potential). 4. Who is known human deficiency virus (HIV) positive. 5. Use of any other investigational agent in the last 30 days.</criteria>
