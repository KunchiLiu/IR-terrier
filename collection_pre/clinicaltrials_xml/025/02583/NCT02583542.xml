	<brief_summary>Selumetinib (AZD6244) and AZD2014 are two new anti-cancer treatments that AstraZeneca are developing; they are both not yet approved for clinical use. Selumetinib (AZD6244) is a drug that acts by blocking a protein called MEK, which has been linked to the development and growth of multiple cancers. AZD2014 is a drug that blocks a protein called mTOR that is involved in the growth and spread of cancer. Blocking the action of either MEK or mTOR alone may slow down or stop the cancer growing. Combining both drugs may make the cancer more sensitive than if Selumetinib (AZD6244) or AZD2014 are used alone and therefore this dual treatment may lead to increased anti-tumour effects. Although Selumetinib (AZD6244) and AZD2014 given alone and in combination with other anti-cancer drugs have been tested in people with advanced cancer, the specific combination of Selumetinib (AZD6244) and AZD2014 has not been used in people before. Therefore Phase 1b (Dose Escalation Phase) will determine what the recommended dose to use in Phase IIa (Dose Expansion Phase) will be. Efficacy, progression free survival, duration of response, and overall survival, will then be assessed in patients with triple-negative breast cancer, and Non small cell lung cancer within Phase IIa.</brief_summary>
