	<brief_summary>One of the important complications of pregnancy is preterm labor (PTL) and delivery. There are different tocolytic agents to enhance the time of delivery. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of transdermal nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate, GTN) and oral nifedipine for managing preterm labor. This was a randomized clinical trial in women admitted with diagnosis of PTL. Group one have received transdermal GTN whereas group two have received oral nifedipine, vital signs, FHR, contractions, dilation and effacement as well as gestation age at the time of delivery have been monitored and evaluated in both groups of patient. Our main goal has been delay of delivery to have the most beneficial effect of primary corticosteroid administration for fetus.</brief_summary>
