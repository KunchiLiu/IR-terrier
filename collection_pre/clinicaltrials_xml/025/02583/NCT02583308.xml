	<brief_summary>Meta-analysis provide evidence for the benefit of the subglottic secretions drainage (SSD) to reduce the occurrence of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP). Nevertheless, the diagnosis of VAP is widely considered as subjective and prone to both false-positive and false negative assignments. In ths way, the impact of SSD remains controversial and its use limited in Intensive Care Units. The DEMETER study assessing the medico-economical impact of the the subglottic secretions drainage (NCT02515617) provides the opportunity to evaluate the dynamics of tracheal colonisation with and without the realisation of SSD. This evaluation would reinforce the results observed during the DEMETER study in considering the adjudicated VAP incidence. This ancillary study will be performed in 14 centers participating to the DEMETER study</brief_summary>
