	<brief_title>Comprehensive Fall Prevention and Detection in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will recruit 94 people with Multiple Sclerosis, who report having fallen at least twice in the previous 2 months. Participants will be randomized to be placed in either a group that receives classroom training during the study, or into a wait-listed control group that will be offered the classroom training after their participation in the study is completed. All participants will receive mobility and quality of life assessments at baseline, 9 weeks, 5 months, and 8 months. All participants will be asked to record any falls they have on falls calendars. In addition, 30 participants will be randomized to wear electronic fall detectors on their bodies for the duration of the study. These detectors will record when and where falls occur, and this data will be compared with the participants' self-reported falls as recorded on the falls calendars.</detailed_description>
