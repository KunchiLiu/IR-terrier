	<brief_summary>Recent meta-analysis have suggested that the safety of oral care with chlorhexidine in patients under mechanical ventilation could be questionable. Whatever the hypothetical mechanisms involved (direct cellular toxicity, underdiagnosis of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia), presence of chlorhexidine in tracheal secretions after routine oral care is the cornerstone of this potential side effect of the routine oral care with chlorhexidine gluconate. The DEMETER study assessing the medico-economical impact of the subglottic secretions drainage study (NCT02515617) provides the opportunity to perform this proof of concept study (detection of chlorhexidine in tracheal secretions after routine oral care with chlorhexidine gluconate) and to evaluate the impact of the subglottic secretion drainage on this potential detection of chlorhexidine. This ancillary study will be performed in one of the centers participating to the DEMETER study.</brief_summary>
