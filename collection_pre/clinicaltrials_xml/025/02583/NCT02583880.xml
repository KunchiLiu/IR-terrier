	<brief_summary>This is a survey which will be performed on a specific day (the "Screening Day") in Latin American ICUs. In eligible patients who receive enteral or parenteral nutrition a retrospective calculation of the "caloric deficit" will be performed. The caloric deficit is the difference between energy target of each patient and actually administered calories.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening Day Latin America</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Screening Day Latin America is a non-interventional, cross-sectional and retrospective study. The study focusses on patients receiving enteral (tube feeding, EN) and/or parenteral nutrition (PN). All patients hospitalized on the defined Screening Day in participating ICUs will be checked for eligibility. In eligible patients the patient charts will be reviewed and the following parameters will be documented: - Caloric deficit (daily target energy - actually administered energy via EN and PN). The caloric deficit will be calculated for 1 to up to 5 days before the Screening Day. The analysis will be done for each day and for the complete documentation period up to 5 days. Primary focus will be the caloric deficit on Day -1. - Nutritional status of the patient based on information from the patient charts. For this, three tools will be applied independently: Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), NUTRIC Score, ESPEN diagnosis of malnutrition The study will be performed in 8 Latin American countries. Data will be recorded anonymously in an electronic case report form. The study data of this explorative study will be analyzed using descriptive statistical methods.</detailed_description>
