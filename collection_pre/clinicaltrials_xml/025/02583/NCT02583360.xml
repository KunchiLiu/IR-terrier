	<brief_summary>The purpose of the investigator's study is to evaluate the causes of feeding difficulty in infants. New treatments can be possible only if the cause is known. In this study, the investigator plans to evaluate the movement of the muscles in an infant's mouth, throat (pharynx) and food pipe (esophagus) that are responsible for moving the food down into the stomach and that help protect an infants airway.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms and Management of Infant Dysphagia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants with chronic feeding difficulties exhibit inadequacy of suck-swallow and breathe coordination, regurgitation or vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and airway aspiration. Often these infants must rely on feeding tubes, either inserted through the nose or surgically placed, to meet their nutrition and hydration needs until they are able to orally feed safely, effectively, and efficiently. The process of assessment and treatment of swallowing disorders is often stressful for the infants and their providers, including parents. The goal of this study is to combine two commonly used diagnostic techniques (video fluoroscopy swallow studies and esophageal manometry) to more comprehensively evaluate feeding from the mouth to the stomach in infants. The hope is that by doing so treatment strategies can be improved.</detailed_description>
