	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Effect of Lemborexant Versus Placebo on Driving Performance in Healthy Adult and Elderly Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will have 2 phases, Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase will consist of 2 periods that will last up to a maximum of 21 days: Screening and Baseline. The Randomization Phase will comprise of four, 9-day treatment periods (Treatment Period 1 - Treatment Period 4) with a minimum 14-day washout between treatment periods, and a follow-up interval of at least 14 days after Treatment Period 4 before the end-of-study (EOS) visit. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 12 sequences in an incomplete blocks design.</detailed_description>

Habitually naps more than 3 times per week 3. Females who are breastfeeding or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by a positive betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [BhCG] test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of BhCG). A separate baseline assessment is required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first dose of study drug. 4. Females of childbearing potential who: Had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days before study entry and who do not agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (eg, total abstinence, an intrauterine device, a doublebarrier method [such as condom plus diaphragm with spermicide], a contraceptive implant, an oral contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout the entire study period or for 28 days after study drug discontinuation. Are currently abstinent, and do not agree to use a doublebarrier method (as described above) or refrain from sexually active during the study period or for 28 days after study drug discontinuation. Are using hormonal contraceptives but are not on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before dosing and who do not agree to use the same contraceptive during the study or for 28 days after study drug discontinuation. (NOTE: All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal [amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause] or have been sterilized surgically [ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing]). 5. Males who have not had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and their female partners must meet the criteria above (ie, not of childbearing potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period or for 28 days after study drug discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed during the study period or for 28 days after study drug discontinuation. 6.
