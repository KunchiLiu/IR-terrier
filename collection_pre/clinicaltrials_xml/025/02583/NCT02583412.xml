	<brief_summary>The overall aim of this study is to determine if an accelerated "BexseroÂ® (Multicomponent meningococcal B vaccine)" schedule compared to a standard schedule is immunogenic, safe, and tolerable, in order to increase capacity for rapid outbreak control. In this pilot study no formal hypothesis is tested.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of the Immunogenicity, Reactogenicity and Tolerability of Two Schedules of a 4CmenB Vaccine in Adolescents and Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a rapid clinical trial at the time of a meningococcal B outbreak, comparing an accelerated schedule of 4CMen B (0, 3 weeks) to the 0, 2 months schedule, to determine if the more compressed schedule is immunogenic, safe and tolerable. A shorter schedule offers the potential benefit of more rapid direct and indirect protection, and use of fewer public health resources for implementation.</detailed_description>
