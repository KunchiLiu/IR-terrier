	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Bedaquiline and Delamanid, Alone and in Combination, For Drug-Resistant Pulmonary Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bedaquiline (BDQ) and delamanid (DLM) are two newly approved anti-TB drugs and are both well tolerated. However, the combined effects of these two drugs have not been studied. Combining these two drugs, together with other anti-TB drugs, may improve outcomes for people with MDR-TB. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of BDQ and DLM, alone and in combination, among participants (with or without HIV co-infection) taking multidrug treatment for MDR-TB. Researchers will specifically evaluate the effect of these drugs on the heart. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three arms: participants in Arm 1 will receive BDQ, participants in Arm 2 will receive DLM, and participants in Arm 3 will receive BDQ and DLM. All participants will receive their assigned study drugs for 24 weeks together with multidrug background treatment (MBT) for MDR-TB (not provided by the study). HIV-infected participants will also receive dolutegravir, to be used in combination with two NRTIs until study completion. NRTIs will not be provided by the study. Participants will be in the hospital for at least the first 2 months of the study, and they may remain in the hospital longer. Study visits will occur at entry, each week for 8 weeks after study entry, every other week until week 24, and 8 additional visits between weeks 25 and 128. Visits may include physical examinations, blood collection, urine collection, sputum sample collection, hair sample collection, chest x-rays, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and adherence questionnaires.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men and women 18 years of age and older Documented pulmonary infection due to strains of MTB with resistance to isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF) from a sputum sample collected within 60 days prior to entry. Must be lab confirmed by either genotypic (eg, Hain GenoType MTBDRplus) or phenotypic (susceptibility testing on liquid or solid culture) methods. NOTE: MDRTB diagnosis for purposes of meeting inclusion criterion can be from a study testing laboratory or from an outside laboratory, as long as it is from a sputum sample collected within 60 days prior to entry. Laboratory confirmation of infection with an MTB strain that is susceptible to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides by either genotypic testing (such as Hain GenoType MTBDRsl) or phenotypic testing (susceptibility testing on liquid or solid culture) within 60 days prior to entry HIV1 infection status must be documented as either absent or present, as defined below: Absence of HIV1 infection, as documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV1 enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit, within 60 days prior to entry. OR HIV1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV1 E/CIA test kit at any time prior to entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV1 antigen or plasma HIV1 RNA viral load. NOTE: The term "licensed" refers to a U.S. FDAapproved kit, which is recommended. For sites that are unable to obtain an FDAapproved kit, a kit that has been certified or licensed by an oversight body within the country and validated internally is acceptable. WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV1 RNA viral load. For HIVpositive participants only: CD4+ count greater than or equal to 100 cells/mm^3 within 60 days prior to entry. CD4+ count must be obtained from a laboratory certified for protocol testing by the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Immunology Quality Assurance (IQA) Program For HIVpositive participants only: for those who have been on ART for greater than or equal to 6 months and have an HIV1 viral load greater than 500 copies/mL within 60 days prior to entry, an HIV1 genotype within 60 days prior to entry must show that at least one fully active NRTI is available to the participant within the country program. For females of reproductive potential, negative serum pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to entry Female and male participants of reproductive potential who are participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy must agree to use one of the following forms of birth control while receiving TB study medications and for 6 months after stopping TB study medications: male or female condoms diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, if available intrauterine device (IUD) oral contraceptives or DepoProvera NOTE A: Female participants who are not of reproductive potential are eligible without requiring the use of contraceptives. Participantreported history is acceptable documentation of menopause (i.e., at least one year amenorrheic), hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation; these participants are all considered not of reproductive potential. NOTE B: Male participants who are not of reproductive potential (i.e., documented azoospermia) or whose female partner/s are not of reproductive potential (as defined above) are eligible without requiring the use of contraceptives. Chest xray performed within 60 days prior to entry to classify participant as having cavitary or noncavitary disease Documentation of Karnofsky performance score greater than or equal to 50 within 14 days prior to study entry Ability and willingness of participant or legally authorized representative to provide informed consent Willingness to be hospitalized for at least 2 months Taking MBT for a minimum of 7 days within the 10 days prior to entry History of clinically relevant, currently active or underlying gastrointestinal, hepatic, cardiovascular, nervous system, psychiatric, metabolic (e.g., untreated hypothyroidism), renal, respiratory (other than due to TB), inflammatory, neoplastic, skin, immunological or infectious disease, which is not stable and controlled, that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude safe participation in the trial Current clinically relevant extrapulmonary TB, in the opinion of the site investigator, including but not limited to central nervous system (CNS) TB or TB osteoarthritis Previous treatment for MDRTB, other than for the qualifying episode, at any time in the past Receipt of BDQ or DLM at any time in the past Breastfeeding QTcF interval greater than 450 ms within 72 hours prior to entry Clinically significant ECG abnormality in the opinion of the site investigator within 60 days prior to entry, including but not limited to second or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block, prolongation of the QRS complex over 120 ms (in both male and female participants), or clinically important arrhythmia Current clinically relevant cardiovascular disorder in the opinion of the site investigator, including but not limited to heart failure, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, or tachyarrhythmia Known family history of Long QT Syndrome in a firstdegree relative (i.e., parent, offspring, or sibling) Requirement or expected requirement for protease inhibitors (PIs), efavirenz (EFV), or any other medication that is a moderate to strong inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A and CYP3A4 over the 24 weeks of study treatment. Drug information may be found on the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Drug Interactions Database, located at: http://tprc.pharm.buffalo.edu/home/di_search/. NOTE: Participants taking a PI or EFV can be switched to a treatment that is allowed in the study, but the PI must be stopped at least 2 days prior to starting study MDRTB drugs and EFV must be stopped at least 7 days prior to starting study MDRTB drugs.
