	<brief_summary>This project investigated how glucose metabolism differs due to sleep deprivation for three consecutive nights as compared to sufficient sleep for three nights by examining concentrations of glucose, insulin, and other factors involved in glucose metabolism.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>16 participants were enrolled in the study (8 females, 8 males) aged 18-25 years. In order for the participants to qualify for the study, each had to wear a pedometer for a week before the study began to determine eligibility. Each participant came to the lab for an oral glucose tolerance test on a morning, following three nights when they were sleep deprived, and on another morning when they had three nights' sufficient sleep. The sequence of the oral glucose tolerance tests were randomly assigned. The sleep duration for participants was monitored by the readings of the sleep monitors that each participant wore. The oral glucose tolerance tests were performed after an overnight fast. A 20-gauge polyethylene catheter was placed in the antecubital vein for blood sampling. Blood samples were drawn once (0 min) before and 4 times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) after a 75g glucose drink was consumed for the determination of plasma glucose, insulin, and concentrations of other factors. Each participant was told to continue their regular routine during the study period, including diet, caffeine usage, and exercise.</detailed_description>
