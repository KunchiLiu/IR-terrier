	<brief_title>Toronto Gestational Glucose Tolerance Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this prospective observational cohort study, women reflecting the full spectrum of glucose tolerance in pregnancy (from gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) to lesser degrees of gestational glucose intolerance to those with completely normal glucose tolerance) are being recruited in late 2nd trimester. This cohort of women thus carries a broad range of risk for the future development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. At regular intervals in the years after the index pregnancy, this cohort of women is undergoing serial cardiometabolic characterization, including assessment of glucose tolerance, beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity. The longitudinal changes over time in this cohort should provide insight into the early pathophysiology and natural history of T2DM and cardiovascular disease.</detailed_description>
