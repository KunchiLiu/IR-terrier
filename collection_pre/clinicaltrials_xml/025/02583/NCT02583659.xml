	<brief_title>The First-line Combined Chemotherapy for Advanced Gastric Cancer: A Prospective Observational Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Establish a clinical database for the advanced gastric cancer patients treated with first-line combined chemotherapy in Tongji hospital. 1.1.Data including age, gender, smoking state, karnofsky performance score（KPS）, disease history, clinical stage, primary tumor site, metastasis site, surgery, first-line chemotherapy, therapy after failure of first-line treatment, radiotherapy, toxicity, survival time, the time of free of progress, response were collected. 1.2.The peripheral blood samples were collected for further biomarker reserch. 2. Kaplan-Meier and Cox model will be used to analyze the overall survival(OS) and progression-free survival(PFS) of advanced gastric cancer. 3. Extract Deoxyribonucleic acid（DNA） from the the peripheral blood and research biomarkers related to the first-line combined chemotherapy for AGC.</detailed_description>
