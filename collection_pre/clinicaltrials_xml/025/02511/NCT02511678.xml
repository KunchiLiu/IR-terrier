	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy of cryoablation for palliation of painful metastases in patients with metastatic lesions involving bone who have failed, are not candidates for, or are not experiencing adequate pain relief from current pain therapies (e.g. radiation, analgesics).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter Study of Cryoablation for Palliation of Painful Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with painful metastatic lesions involving bone who meet the eligibility criteria and who have been determined to be an appropriate candidate for cryoablation therapy will be offered enrollment into the study. Patients agreeing to participate will read and sign an informed consent form and thus become subjects in the study. Treatment will be performed using a Galil Medical cryoablation system and Galil Medical cryoablation needles. Subjects will have one cryoablation procedure and will be followed for up to 6 months for palliation of pain, quality of life and analgesic usage. Baseline and follow-up data will be collected for each subject via a web-based electronic data collection tool.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Neoplasm Metastasis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>18 years of age or older Metastatic disease involving bone with metastatic disease previously confirmed by prior biopsy; or Metastatic disease involving bone previously confirmed on imaging (e.g. CT or MRI) with known (biopsied) primary disease (primary bone cancer is excluded) Current analgesic therapies have failed, the subject is not a candidate for, OR the subject is not experiencing adequate pain relief from current pain therapies (e.g. radiation, analgesics) The 'worst pain' in the last 24 hours must be reported to be 4 or above on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as subject can imagine) Pain must be from one painful metastatic lesion involving the bone that is amenable to cryoablation with CT (additional less painful metastatic sites may be present) Cryoablation should be performed within 14 days of screening visit If taking hormonal therapy, use should be stable (no changes within 4 weeks prior to the cryoablation procedure) Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score ≥60 Life expectancy ≥ 3 months No debilitating medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude giving informed consent or receiving optimal treatment and followup Known coagulopathy or bleeding disorders are controlled Primary cancer is leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma Tumor involves a weightbearing long bone of the lower extremity with the tumor causing &gt; 50% loss of cortical bone Has undergone prior surgery at the tumor site or the index tumor has undergone previous surgery or ablation treatment Prior radiation therapy of the index tumor &lt;3 weeks prior to the screening visit Index tumor causing clinical or radiographic evidence of spinal cord or cauda equina compression/effacement Anticipated treatment of the index tumor that would require iceball formation within 0.5 cm of the spinal cord, brain, other critical nerve structure, large abdominal vessel (possibly achieved with additional maneuvers such as hydrodissection) Index tumor involves the skull Currently pregnant, nursing, or wishing to become pregnant during the study Serious medical illness, including any of the following: uncontrolled congestive heart failure, uncontrolled angina, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event within 6 months prior to the screening visit Concurrent participation in other studies that could affect the primary endpoint</criteria>
