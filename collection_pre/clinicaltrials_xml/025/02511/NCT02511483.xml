	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial. The main purpose of this study is to determine if postsurgical pain ratings are improved with treatment with oral Propranolol, and if the effectiveness of treatment can be modified by the presence or absence of SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) associated with Cathecol-O-MethylTransferase (COMT) and mu-opioid receptor (MOR1) activity. The treatment period will last for three days and the observation period will last for six months. Effectiveness of treatment will be assessed by means of morphine consumption through quantitative evaluation of IV-PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia) morphine as primary outcome measure.</brief_summary>
