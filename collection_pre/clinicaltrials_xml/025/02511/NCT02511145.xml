	<brief_title>Comparison of Mechanical Penetration Enhancers on Metvixia Skin Penetration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At baseline, each mini-zone was selected and randomly assigned to a pretreatment: 3 zones with microneedling DermarollerÂ®, 3 zones with ablative fractional CO2 Laser, and 3 zones with no pretreatment. After performing pretreatment, MAL cream was applied on the 6 assigned mini-zones for 3 hours incubation. Each condition was tested with and without occlusion. The three mini-zones with no product applied were used to perform biophysics measures.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female of non childbearing potential, who is at least 18 years of age or older at screening visit. The subject has a skin phototype of I to III on Fitzpatrick's scale (Fitzpatrick et al., 1993) at screening visit. Subject should have 9 mini zone areas on the back that will be able to receive pretreatments according to protocol. (checked at Screening visit, and assigned at Baseline visit) Female of non childbearing potential (postmenopausal [absence of menstrual bleeding for 1 year prior to screening visit, without any other medical reason], hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy). Subject with porphyria, Subject with past history of skin cancer, or current clinical diagnosis of other skin disease (including nonmelanoma skin cancer), or tattoos, or cheloid and hypertrophic scars on the test zones, which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the interpretation of the clinical results, Any uncontrolled or serious disease, or any medical or surgical condition, that may either interfere with the interpretation of the clinical trial results, and/or put the subject at significant risk (according to Investigator's judgment) if he/she participates in the clinical trial. Known or suspected allergies or sensitivities to any components of any of the study drugs (see Product label). The subject has received, applied or taken some specific treatments within specified time frame prior to the baseline visit</criteria>
