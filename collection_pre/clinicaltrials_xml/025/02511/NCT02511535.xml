	<brief_title>TBE Vaccination in Allergic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allergic patients generally have an altered immunologic profile (Th2 bias), and allergic individuals undergoing de-sensitization treatment display an increased production of immune supressive cytokines. The investigators measure humoral and cellular immune responses to routine vaccination (TBE booster) in allergic patients with and without de-sensitization treatment to determine whether allergy negatively influences vaccine induced immune responses and protection.</detailed_description>
