	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to investigate the anti-angiogenic effect of bevacizumab measured by CTP as a predictive marker for efficacy measured by progression-free survival (PFS) in mCRC patients under first-line bevacizumab-containing, fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Visualization of Anti-angiogenic Effects With Perfusion Computed Tomography (CTP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>So far, CTP has provided non-invasive imaging of tumor biological response to anti-angiogenic and vascular targeting agents in a number of clinical trials with increasing clinical application. CTP can be examined with a variety of commercially available CE-certified CT scanners and imaging post-processing is possible with commercially available CE-certified software from different vendors, too. In several studies, anti-angiogenic effects have been detected with CTP but further evidence for its clinical validation has to be proven in clinical trials. Changes in tumor vasculature measured by CTP will be correlated to the clinical efficacy parameters progression-free survival, overall survival and response rate, thus identifying a group of patients who profit most from the anti-angiogenic treatment.</detailed_description>
