	<criteria>1. First or second progression of Glioblastoma; 2. Measurable disease by RANO criteria at progression; 3. Patients ≥18 years of age; 4. Patient may have been operated for recurrence. If operated: residual and measurable disease after surgery is required; 5. Surgery completed at least 28 days before randomization; 6. An interval of at least 12 weeks between prior radiotherapy or at least 23 days from prior chemotherapy, 42 days from nitrosoureas and enrollment in this study; 7. Adequate performance, i.e."Karnofsky Performance Score" of at least 70%; 8. Adequate renal, liver, and bone marrow function according to the following criteria: Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500 cells/ml, Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/ml, Total bilirubin within upper limit of normal (ULN), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.0 X ULN, Serum creatinine level ≤ ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min for patients with creatinine levels above normal limits (creatinine clearance calculated by the CockcroftGault formula, see Appendix II), PT, PTT (in seconds) not to be prolonged beyond &gt;20% of the upper limits of normal. 1. Prior antiangiogenic therapy including VEGF sequestering agents (i.e. bevacizumab, aflibercept, etc.) or VEGFR inhibitors (cedirinib, pazopanib, sunitinib, sorafenib, etc.); 2. Prior stereotactic radiotherapy; 3. Pregnant or breastfeeding patients; 4. Concomitant medication that may interfere with study results; e.g. immunosuppressive agents other than corticosteroids; 5. Active infection; 6. Evidence of significant CNS haemorrhage i.e. CTCAE grade 2 or above; 7. Expected to have surgery during study period; 8. Patients with active vascular disease, either myocardial or peripheral (i.e. acute coronary syndrome, cerebral stroke, transient ischemic attack or arterial thrombosis or symptomatic peripheral vascular disease within the past 3 months); 9. Patients with known proliferative and/or vascular retinopathy; 10. Patients with known liver disease (alcoholic, drug/toxin induced, genetic, or autoimmune); 11. Patients with known active second malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancers, nonmetastatic prostate cancer, in situ cervical cancer, and ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast. Patients are not considered to have a currently active malignancy if they have completed anticancer therapy and have been disease free for greater than 2 years prior to screening; 12. Patients testing positive to one of the following viruses: HIV, HBV and HCV within the last 6 months; 13. Patients that have undergone major surgery within the last 4 weeks before enrollment; 14. Patients who have received treatment with any other investigational agent within 4 weeks before enrollment.</criteria>
