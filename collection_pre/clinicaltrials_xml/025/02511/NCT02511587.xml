	<brief_title>Comparison of Vaccination Routes: Subcutaneous Versus Intramuscular Application of FSME-Immun®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine (FSME-Immun®) is registered for intra-muscular application. Due to medical reasons (e.g. anticoagulant therapy, adipositas) intra-muscular application is not always possible. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate whether a comparably good immunogenicity can be achieved via the subcutaneous vaccination route. Thus humoral and cellular immune responses after intramuscular and subcutaneous TBE vaccination in healthy volunteers will be compared.</detailed_description>
