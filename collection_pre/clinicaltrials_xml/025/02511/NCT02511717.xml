	<brief_summary>Overactive bladder causes urinary frequency, urgency and in some cases urgency incontinence. This study is testing the efficacy of transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (using skin patch electrodes via a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machine) for the treatment of women with clinical symptoms of overactive bladder.</brief_summary>
