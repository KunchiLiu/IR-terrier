	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and the antiretroviral effects of the highly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibody 10-1074 in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Antiretroviral Activity of 10-1074</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In preclinical studies carried out in humanized mice and non-human primates, 10-1074 alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies led to protection from HIV or simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection and also to sustained suppression of HIV plasma viremia. The aims of this protocol are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics profile of 10-1074 in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals, and its antiretroviral activity in HIV-infected individuals.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Group 1 (HIVinfected) Males and females, age 18 to 65 HIV1 infection confirmed by two independent assays. Group (1A1C): HIVinfected individuals off ART for at least 8 weeks with HIV1 plasma RNA levels &lt; 100,000 copies/ml by standard assays, or on ART with HIV1 plasma RNA levels &lt; 500 copies/ml. HIV1 RNA levels should be measured on 2 occasions, at least 1 week apart and one measurement must be performed within 49 days prior to enrollment. Group (1D): HIVinfected individuals off ART for at least 8 weeks with HIV1 plasma RNA levels &lt; 100,000 copies/ml by standard assays, measured on 2 occasions, at least 1 week apart. At least one measurement must be performed within 49 days prior to enrollment. Current CD4 count &gt; 300 cells/μl. If sexually active male or female, and participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, agrees to use two effective methods of contraception from 10 days prior to the 101074 infusion until the end of the study. Group 2 (HIVuninfected): Males and females, age 18 to 65. Amenable to HIV risk reduction counseling and agrees to maintain behavior consistent with low risk of HIV exposure. If sexually active male or female, and participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, agrees to use two effective methods of contraception throughout the study period, as described for the HIVinfected groups above. Group 1 (HIVinfected): Have a history of AIDSdefining illness within 1 year prior to enrollment. History of systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive anticancer, or other medications considered significant by the trial physician within the last 6 months. Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition other than HIV infection, that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation. Chronic Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection. Laboratory abnormalities in the parameters listed below: Absolute neutrophil count ≤ 1,000; Hemoglobin ≤10 gm/dL; Platelet count ≤100,000; ALT ≥ 2.0 x ULN; AST ≥ 2.0 x ULN; Total bilirubin ≥ 1.25 x ULN; Creatinine ≥ 1.1 x ULN; Coagulation parameters (PT, PTT or INR) ≥ 1.25 x ULN. Pregnancy or lactation. Any vaccination within 14 days prior to 101074 administration. History of severe reaction to a vaccine or drug infusion or history of severe allergic reactions. Participation in another clinical study of an investigational product currently or within past 12 weeks, or expected participation during this study. Group 2 (HIVuninfected): Confirmed HIV1 or HIV2 infection. History of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease; use of systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive anticancer, or other medications considered significant by the trial physician within the last 6 months. Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition (such as autoimmune diseases) that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation. Within the 12 months prior to enrollment, the volunteer has a history of sexually transmitted infection. Chronic Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection. Laboratory abnormalities in the parameters listed: Absolute neutrophil count ≤ 1,500; Hemoglobin ≤ 12 gm/dL if female; ≤ 13.5 gm/dL if male; Platelet count ≤ 140,000; Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≥ 1.25 x upper limit of normal (ULN); aspartate transaminase (AST) ≥ 1.25 x ULN; Total bilirubin ≥ 1.25 x ULN; Creatinine ≥ 1.1 x ULN; Coagulation parameters (prothrombin time PT, partial thromboplastin time PTT or INR) ≥ 1.25 x ULN. Pregnancy or lactation. Any vaccination within 14 days prior to 101074 administration. Receipt of any experimental HIV vaccine in the past. History of severe reaction to a vaccine or drug infusion or history of severe allergic reactions. Participation in another clinical study of an investigational product currently or within past 12 weeks, or expected participation during this study.</criteria>
