	<brief_title>A Dose-Escalation Study to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of Arbaclofen Placarbil in Subjects With Alcohol Use Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study to determine the MTD of AP in subjects with AUD. Eighteen (18) subjects will be randomized to receive either AP or placebo in a 2:1 ratio; ie, 12 subjects will be assigned to AP and 6 will be assigned to placebo. Efforts will be made to enroll all subjects in the same period of time at one clinical center. The expected maximum duration of participation for each subject is 11 weeks and will consist of up to a 3-week screening period, up to a 30-day residential (inpatient) treatment period, up to a 4-week non-residential (outpatient) treatment period, and an end of study / early termination clinic visit.</detailed_description>
