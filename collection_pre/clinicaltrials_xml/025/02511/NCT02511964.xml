	<brief_summary>The objective was to determine the effect of six running sessions of high intensity interval training (HIIT) at 1% and 10% incline on VO2max, peak of velocity (VPeak), and time limit of 1% (TLim1%) and 10% (TLim10%) of inclination, as well as the influence of the specificity of training on performance in the different inclines.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Intensity Interval Training in 1% or 10% Slope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our study is assuming greater activation / muscle overload coming from the uphill running. Accordingly, we believe that in a parallel-group design (1% or 10% gradient) established in controlled and randomized way we could answer the hypothesis that muscle overload provide superior gains to VO2max and aerobic performance. Moreover, considering the first hyphotesis, such developments on the running at 10% slope also promote significant gains in climb performance and also in the plan. Unlike the speculate that the gains from the 1% training does not help performance a 10% incline.</detailed_description>
