	<brief_summary>Post marketing surveillance (PMS) study. 200 patients will be enrolled in a prospective, multi center, randomized, two-arm, open label, and controlled, enrolling patients with multi vessel atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, scheduled to undergo Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with arterial grafting of IMA to LAD, one saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the right territory and one or more SVGs to the left territory. Of all vein grafts, one will be selected randomly to receive treatment with VEST and another designated Control.</brief_summary>
