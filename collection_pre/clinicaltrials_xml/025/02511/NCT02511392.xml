	<brief_summary>Objectives.-Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive stimulation methods that became widely used as therapeutic tools in neuropsychiatric research. The aim of this study is to Evaluate the therapeutic impact of different frequencies of repetitive transcranial stimulation (1HZ, 10HZ) in OCD patients. Material and Methods; Forty five patients of OCD were participated in the study. All patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV-TR. The mean age of the patients was 27.1+4.5 years. Each patient was subjected to the following: Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale (Y-BOCS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S). The patients were randomly classified into three equal groups using closed envelop: 1st group received 1 Hz rTMS at 100% of the RMT, 2nd group received 10 Hz rTMS with intensity of 100% of the RMT and 3rd group was sham group received the sham stimulation with a total 2000 pulses every day for each group for 10 sessions. Follow up of the patients using the same previous scales after the end of sessions and 3 months later.</brief_summary>
