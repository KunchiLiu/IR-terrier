	<brief_title>Status of Chronic Liver Disease in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Patients Coinfected With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in Andalusia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In subjects co-infected with HIV, treatment of chronic HCV infection is particularly complex and requires considerable resources, including a very high cost is likely to increase with new antivirals. A precise knowledge of the situation in each hospital would facilitate adequate provision of personal and material resources needed to adequately address this disease in each center and in the Community as a whole. Because all or the vast majority of patients coinfected HIV / HCV are staffed by specialists who are part of Hepavir group and / or Sociedad Andaluza de Enfermedades Infecciosas (SAEI), they are ideal for carrying out this study.</detailed_description>
