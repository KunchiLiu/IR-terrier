	<brief_summary>Phase II gene therapy study, involving a total of 6 male patients with choroideremia. The study will be conducted at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami. Patients will be required to attend a total of 11 study visits over a 24 month period with an additional 3 year follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Choroideremia Gene Therapy Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II, open label study involving patients with a clinical phenotype of choroideremia and a confirmed CHM genotype. Following consent, patients will be required to attend an initial screening visit (Visit 1). Within 2 weeks of the screening visit patients will undergo a surgical procedure (Visit 2) under general anesthesia which will include a standard vitrectomy, retinal detachment and administration of a subretinal injection of AAV2-REP1 (1x1011 genome particles). Patients will be required to attend a further 9 study visits (Visits 3-11) over a 24 month period for functional, and anatomical assessments as well as monitoring of adverse events. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in visual acuity in the study eye, compared to control eye. Secondary study endpoints are, change from baseline in autofluorescence evaluation, microperimetry readings and other anatomic and functional outcomes (all in the study eye compared to control eye). Secondary endpoints also include safety assessments to be conducted throughout the study. The fellow eyes of these patients will be utilized as controls in this study and will receive no study treatment.</detailed_description>
