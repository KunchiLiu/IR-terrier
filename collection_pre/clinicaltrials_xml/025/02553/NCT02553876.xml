	<brief_summary>There are no studies as yet specifically investigating the application of DRG stimulation in the treatment of chronic pain affecting the upper limbs. The investigators propose to investigate the effect of dorsal root stimulation in patients with chrionic hand or upper limb pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulation for Hand and Upper Limb Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) stimulation is a form of Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS), which has been available and used for the treatment of chronic pain in Europe since late 2011. Clinical practice and pre/post market studies have shown that stimulation of the DRG can significantly reduce chronic intractable pain of various aetiologies. However, there are no studies as yet specifically investigating the application of DRG stimulation in the treatment of chronic pain affecting the upper limbs. Furthermore, there are very few studies of SCS generally, in an upper limb pain population, despite this being a group often referred for and treated with SCS in tertiary, interventional pain practices. Due to several limitations of traditional SCS systems, chiefly concerning the stability of stimulation induced paraesthesia, DRG stimulation is being increasingly utilised in its place for this condition.</detailed_description>
