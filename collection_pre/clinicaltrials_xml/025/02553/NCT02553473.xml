	<brief_summary>Comparison of Doxycycline 200 mg once daily for six weeks versus Doxycycline 200 mg once daily for two weeks + placebo for four weeks. Primary objective is to answer the question "is two weeks doxycycline treatment (currently suggested treatment) at least as effective as six weeks doxycycline treatment in Lyme Neuroborreliosis?".Key secondary objectives are to provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis and long‐term complaints, and to search for new biomarkers in Lyme Neuroborreliosis (LNB) by collecting clinical data, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a biobank for future research Endpoints: Primary endpoint: Composite clinical score at six months after end of treatment.Secondary endpoints: Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS),Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15), Short Form 36 (SF-36) and blood and CSF findings at inclusion, after 6 and 12 months. The study design is a multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized, penta-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 250 patients will be included from Sørlandet Hospital and 5-10 other Norwegian hospitals. Main inclusion criteria are neurological symptoms suggestive of LNB without other obvious reasons, one or both of a) Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis (&gt;5 leukocytes/mm3) b) intrathecal Bb antibody Production and signed informed consent. Safety assessments during the trial: Comparison of clinical outcome six months after end of treatment between the two treatment groups. Subjective experiences and blood tests including hematology and biochemistry for four weeks after ended treatment.</brief_summary>
