	<brief_title>Aqua Therapy in Deep Venous Thrombosis and Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) develops in approximately 25-60% of patients with acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) depending on severity, chronicity, anatomic level of involvement and efficacy of anticoagulation.The frequency increases with occlusive iliac venous thrombosis. PTS results in significant morbidity and a staggering toll on health careresources . PTS is reduced by early percutaneous endovenous intervention and administration of new oral anticoagulants. There are conflicting results on the efficacy of compression stockings . In general, exercise has been useful in activation of the muscle pump and improvement of symptoms. There are no data about exercise in a swimming pool. Both walking or swimming reduce the effect of joint contact and therefore pain which is particularly useful in patients with arthritis or heavyweight. Furthermore with less effect of gravity, absorption of edema would be faster. There are no data on the role of water activity in the reduction of measures of venous insufficiency.The purpose of this study is to assess whether the encouragement of patients to perform aqua activity above and beyond the recommended treatment would positively impact chronic venous insufficiency.</detailed_description>
