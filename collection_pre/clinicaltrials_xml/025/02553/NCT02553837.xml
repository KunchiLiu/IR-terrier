Also, after the completion of booster vaccination for antibody retention duration observed for subjects with antibody to conduct a five-year follow-up survey was conducted, and the antibody test every year. In conclusion, sampling was conducted 12 months(T7), 24 months(T8), 36months(T9), 48 months(T10), 60 months(T11) after the booster vaccination. However, follow-up survey was terminated when the antibody titer was determined as a negative by neutralizing antibody test and fluorescent antibody technique.</detailed_description>
