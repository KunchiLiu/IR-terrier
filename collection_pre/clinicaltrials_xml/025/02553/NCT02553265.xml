	<brief_summary>The overall study objectives are to determine whether carbidopa (LodosynÂ®) is safe and well tolerated and to assess whether it can inhibit catecholamine-induced paroxysmal hypertension and normalize or reduce the exaggerated blood pressure variability in patients with familial dysautonomia (FD, also called hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type III or Riley-Day syndrome). Funding Source- FDA OOPD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carbidopa for the Treatment of Excessive Blood Pressure Variability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to perform a double-blind randomized trial with a cross over design to compare high dose (600 mg/day) and low dose (300 mg per day) carbidopa blockade with placebo. Patients will be randomly assigned to a high-dose/low-dose/placebo sequence, lowdose/placebo/high-dose sequence or placebo/high-dose/low-dose sequence. Participants will remain on each treatment period for 28-days. Aim 1: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of carbidopa in FD patients with particular emphasis on the orthostatic fall in blood pressure. Aim 2: As proof of concept, examine the hemodynamic effects of carbidopa and determine its effects on norepinephrine production, BP variability and paroxysmal hypertension. Aim 3: In a dose finding study, compare the effects of low (300 mg/day) and high (600 mg/day) dose carbidopa blockade vs. placebo on BP variability and paroxysmal hypertension.</detailed_description>
