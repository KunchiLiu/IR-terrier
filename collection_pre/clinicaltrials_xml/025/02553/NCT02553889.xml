	<criteria>End stage renal disease maintained on outpatient hemodialysis at a healthcare center for &gt; 3 months from screening with hemodialysis using heparin (unfractionated heparin or lowmolecular weight heparin) 3 times per week for a minimum of 3 hours per dialysis session and plan to continue this throughout the study. Documented thrombotic event (acute coronary syndrome, stroke or transient ischemic attack, venous thromboembolic event) in the past 3 months. Active bleeding within the past 3 months from screening or documented bleeding diathesis (history of bleeding disorder) or Screening values of: Platelet count &lt; 150,000 cells/mm3 INR &gt; 1.4 aPTT &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN) Abnormal liver function at Screening: ALT or AST &gt; 2 x ULN Total bilirubin &gt; ULN Concomitant medication restrictions: Concomitant use of anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents (e.g., dabigatran, rivaroxaban, clopidogrel) that may affect coagulation (except low dose aspirin (â‰¤ 100 mg/day) during Treatment and Posttreatment Evaluation Periods is not allowed. Uncontrolled hypertension as judged by the Investigator. Patients with a pre or postdialysis blood pressure (BP) that is &gt; 160 mmHg on at least 3 of last 5 dialysis treatments. Planned major surgery in the next 6 months (e.g. renal transplant surgery)</criteria>
