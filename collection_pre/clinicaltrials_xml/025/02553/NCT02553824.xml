	<brief_title>FDA Approved Medication to Reduce Binge Eating and/or Purging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) are serious mental disorders associated with adverse psychological and physical consequences. Treatment options to date offer limited success, leaving at least 50-70% of patients still symptomatic after treatment. The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia), a medication currently FDA approved for the treatment of obesity, will demonstrate efficacyâ€”compared to placebo- when re-purposed for patients with bulimia and binge eating. Participants will be randomized into one of two conditions: qsymia or Placebo. One condition will receive 3 months of phentermine-topiramate, a 2 week washout, then 3 months of placebo. The other condition will receive 3 months of Placebo, a 2 week washout, then 3 months of phentermine-topiramate. Participants will receive a total of 6 months of treatment and then have a 2 month follow-up off of medications.</detailed_description>
