	<brief_summary>In this study, participants with advanced solid tumors will be assigned to receive either MK-1248 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475). This study will use an adaptive design to find and confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD, or maximum administered dose [MAD]) for MK-1248 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab.</brief_summary>
