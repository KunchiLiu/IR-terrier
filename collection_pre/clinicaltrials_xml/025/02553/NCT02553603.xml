	<brief_title>The Effect of Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone on Cognitive Function in Individuals With Mild Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with MCI as well as healthy controls will be given GHRH at a dose of 1mg/day for 10 weeks. This study is designed to investigate the effects of GHRH on the following things: 1) cognitive function as measured by our neuropsychologist with a series of short tests; 2) brain activity as measured by fMRI and brain electrical activity as measured by EEG; 3) lean and fat mass of your body as measured by DEXA; 4) physical function as measured by a walking test.</detailed_description>
