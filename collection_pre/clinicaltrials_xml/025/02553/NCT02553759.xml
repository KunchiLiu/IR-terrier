	<brief_summary>The aim of the present protocol is to prove if the observed actions (AOb) will improve the cervical range of motion (CROM) in patients with non-specific chronic neck pain (CNP). This study is a parallel-group double blind randomized clinical. Outcome measures were CROM, and pressure pain detection thresholds (PPDT) with a digital algometer. The follow-up will consist of three evaluations: pre- treatment, post-treatment and 10 minutes after second measurement (motor imagery).</brief_summary>
