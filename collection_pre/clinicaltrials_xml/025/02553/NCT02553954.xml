	<brief_summary>Epidemiological data show that the incidence of carcinoma, the most common cancer, is strongly linked to the age. Non Melanoma Skin Carcinomas (NMSCs) (the most frequent cancers in the elderly population) derive from keratinocytes of the basal layer of the epidermis, from differentiated keratinocytes of the more superficial layers or from stem cells of hair follicles. Unlike NMSCs, soft-tissue sarcomas, including those deriving from dermal fibroblasts, are very rare (less than 1% of all cancers). Our overall purpose is to decipher the molecular pathways activated during the aging of these tissues that may explain why they have a so different propensity to undergo a malignant transformation. Given that senescent cells accumulate in the dermis and epidermis with age, we will constitute two groups : "young skin" that we arbitrarily limit to the range ≥ 18 and ≤ 40 and "aged skin" ≥ 55. Thus the main objective of our study is to search within 2 age groups (≥ 18 and ≤ 40 years and ≥ 55 years) the expression of senescence markers on healthy skin tissue.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Information and obtaining informed consent. - Collection of clinical data. - Collection of two samples of healthy skin tissue, without disfigurement, during an intervention under general anesthesia for the treatment of a sarcoma. - Freezing samples of healthy skin tissue in liquid nitrogen within 10 minutes after collection. - Transfer of the samples to the laboratory of anatomopathology. - Preparation of the healthy skin samples by the laboratory of anatomopathology. - Transfer of the conditioned samples to the Institut de Biologie de Lille for analysis. - Control of the aesthetic appearance during the postoperative consultation. - Destruction of the samples at the end of analysis.</detailed_description>
