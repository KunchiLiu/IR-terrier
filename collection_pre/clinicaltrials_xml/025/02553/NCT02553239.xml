	<brief_summary>This clinical investigation evaluates the safety of cryoablation (sclerotherapy of muscle tissue of the heart by freezing) in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with the newly developed CoolLoop® cryoablation catheter. A further aim of the investigation is the evaluation of the efficacy and average duration of the applied procedure.</brief_summary>
