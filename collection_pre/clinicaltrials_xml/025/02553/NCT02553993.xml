	<brief_title>Comparing the Cognitive Effects of Two Exergame Training and Traditional Training in Patients With Chronic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study was to: compare the training and maintenance effects of 3 balance training programs (2 kinds of exergame systems and 1 conventional weight-shifting training program) on cognitive function of subjects with chronic stroke. We hypothesized that the exergaming program using weight shifting as game controller is better than the weight shifting only program. The investigators further hypothesized that exergames designed for entertainment (such as Wii Fit) are more beneficial than exergames for rehabilitation purpose (such as Tetrax biofeedback) in gain of cognition function for patients with chronic stroke.</detailed_description>
