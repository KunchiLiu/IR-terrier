	<brief_title>Application of MR-PET in Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research expect that the image techniques and experience in this cancer group may be valuable and helpful for others. With advantage of MR-PET in better soft tissue delineation/functional information and less radiation dose than PET-CT, the ultimate goal in both research and clinical application is to establish new diagnostic standard and management guideline by MR-PET, which can further improve clinical outcome and disease prognosis in patients colorectal cancer.</detailed_description>
