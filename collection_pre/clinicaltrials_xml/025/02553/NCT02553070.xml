Inaccurate perceptions about the severity of an exposure can result in delays in proper evaluation and treatment resulting in harm or in some cases death of the patient.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Health Professions Students and Faculty Perceptions of Poisoning Severity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consumers and health professionals are often surprised about the toxicity (or lack of toxicity) after exposure to a number of pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical agents. Past experience with the survey used in this study has indicated that consumers and health professional perform about the same. Most individuals answer less than 50% of questions incorrectly. Pharmacy students will be asked to participate in a short (5-7 minutes) survey (see below) that contains 21-short cases involving an exposure to a pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical agent. All cases involve children less than 19 years of age. Participants will be asked to indicate their year in pharmacy school (1st or 2nd) and their gender (f/m). The survey will be given after a scheduled examination or other classroom activity and will not involve class time. Students will be provided a link to an online version of the survey. Conclusions will be derived through the analysis of the data. At a later date, all students in the class (whether they participated in the survey or not)students will be provided a link to video that describes the correct answers to each of the cases and an explanation.</detailed_description>
