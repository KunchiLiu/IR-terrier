	<brief_summary>Prospective, 2-arm, clinical study for the evaluation of the VelaShape device and Contour I V3 device for non-invasive fat reduction vs. control. All study subjects, who are scheduled for abdominoplasty, will undergo one treatment with VelaShape or Contour I V3 device. Each arm will be treated with a different device: Arm 1: subject will treated with VelaShape device Arm 2: subject will treated with Contour I V3 device</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VelaShape and Contour I V3 for Abdominal Fat Reduction vs. Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible subjects will undergo one treatment on one abdominal subarea. Another abdominal subarea will remain without treatment and will serve as a control. Biopsies from treated and untreated areas will be harvested during abdominoplasty and cultured.. Treatment with VelaShape will be performed to arm 1, and treatment with Contour I V3 will be performed to arm 2, according to the study protocol. Each arm will be divided into 6 sub-groups, according to the following time interval between VelaShape or UltraShape treatment to surgery: Sub-group 1: Surgery immediately after treatment Sub-group 2: Surgery 10 days after treatment Sub-group 3: Surgery 20 days after treatment Sub-group 4: Surgery 30 days after treatment Sub-group 5: Surgery 60 days after treatment Sub-group 6: Surgery 90 days after treatment Each Sub-group contains up to 2 subjects.</detailed_description>
