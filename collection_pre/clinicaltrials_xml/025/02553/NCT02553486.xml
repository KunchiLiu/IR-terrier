	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the global quality of life of foreign born adopted children, one to seven years following their arrival in France.

	<brief_title>Internationally Adopted Children Quality of Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators will use a known and official quality of life score: the PedsQL®. This score has never been used in this population so investigators will first have to test its internal validity, so that investigators cannot use it in their global evaluation. The second stage will consist of identifying variables associated with a lower quality of life, as previously determined. Investigators will send letters to each family through the adoption department of each area enrolled in our study, to ensure data. Parents and children will be required to login to a safe, anonymous, controlled website in order to input their data. The data will be recorded on the internal server of Nantes University Hospital. This study has been accepted by both the Computing and Liberties Commission (CNIL) and Nantes University Hospital's Ethics group in the field of Health (GNEDS) comities.</detailed_description>
