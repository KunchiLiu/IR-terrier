	<brief_title>Remote Ischemic Limb Preconditioning In Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to determine if remote ischemic leg preconditioning improves short and long term cerebral vasomotor reactivity in healthy volunteers as measured by breath holding and transcranial doppler vasomotor reactivity. Previous studies on brachial vasomotor reactivity have shown a beneficial effect of remote ischemic preconditioning. It remains uncertain if a similar beneficial effect can be reproduced with cerebral vasomotor testing. Many biological mechanisms and effector pathways triggered by preconditioning have demonstrated endothelial protection and beneficial vascular effects.</detailed_description>
