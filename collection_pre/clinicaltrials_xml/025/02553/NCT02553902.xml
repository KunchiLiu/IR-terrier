	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect and cost-utility of positional therapy comparing the sleep position trainer (SPT) with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), mandibular repositioning appliance (MRA) and the combination SPT and MRA in patients with moderate positional obstructive sleep apnea (POSA). HYPOTHESIS: The SPT is more cost-effective and effective, in means of reduction of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), quality of life and compliance, compared with CPAP and MRA. STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be performed with a follow-up of 12 months per patient. Patients will be randomized for CPAP, MRA, SPT or the combination SPT and MRA. All outcomes will be measured at baseline, month 3, 6 and 12. STUDY POPULATION: Patients diagnosed with moderate POSA according to polysomnography (PSG) results. INTERVENTION / STANDARD INTERVENTION TO BE COMPARED TO: The SPT trains POSA patients to sleep in non-supine positions, CPAP uses positive airway pressure to open the airway; MRA is an intra-oral prosthesis, which holds the mandible in a protrusive position, all to prevent effectively apneic events. OUTCOME MEASURES: AHI, compliance, quality-adjusted life year (QALY), direct and indirect costs, cardiovascular parameters, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) SAMPLE SIZE / DATA ANALYSIS: 100 subjects in each treatment group, total of 400 patients. COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS / BUDGET IMPACT ANALYSIS: The SPT is expected to improve the cost-effectiveness of overall treatment of POSA patients, and will save annually approximately 35-150 million euros.</brief_summary>
