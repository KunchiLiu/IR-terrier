	<brief_summary>Patient navigation (PN) has been shown to improve rates of cancer screening in vulnerable populations. Most cancer PN programs are located in community health centers and focus on a single cancer. We will evaluate the impact of PN program on breast, cervical, and/or colorectal cancer screening in vulnerable patients receiving care in a large, academic, primary care network using a population-based IT system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Comprehensive Cancer Screening Among Vulnerable Patients Using Patient Navigation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is important to note that the TopCare system is currently the standard of care in the MGPC-PBRN. As such, this proposal does not involve evaluating the TopCare system or the patients and providers using it. Rather, the study evaluates the part of the TopCare system that involves the automated identification and referral to PN of patients at increased risk of screening non-adherence. All eligible patients overdue for cancer screening tests will receive usual care that includes a reminder letter and referral to a scheduling delegate for follow-up. Since the TopCare system represents usual care for patients with the MGH primary care network, no patient contact will occur solely for research purposes. The study will involve randomly assigning patients overdue for screening and identified as high risk for not completing screening to early or delayed PN. We believe this random assignment is ethical because PN is an extremely limited resource, and all patients in our network identified as high risk for not completing screening could not be contacted by our navigators in a short period of time. Thus we will randomly assign access to PN during the study period, and then allow all patients to be navigated after the study period is over. As a result, all overdue, high risk patients will be referred for PN, but the timing of the referral will be randomly assigned. In this study, our objectives are to improve our algorithm to automatically identify patients who are more likely to benefit from PN (Specific Aim 1), and to evaluate the clinical impact of PN in a randomized controlled trial within our MGPC-PBRN (Specific Aim 2). We will also survey all patients identified by the TopCare algorithm to assess their overall satisfaction with healthcare to determine whether PN impacts satisfaction with healthcare (Specific Aim 3). Revising and improving our current 'high risk' algorithm to automatically identify patients who may be helped by PN in Specific Aim 1 will help us to most effectively utilize our limited PN resources. The current algorithm utilizes information about patient age, number of overdue tests, primary language, and no-show visit history. We will investigate adding patient registration information about insurance and education status to better identify patients at high risk for not completing screening. In Specific Aim 2, we will randomize eligible patients from our MGPC-PBRN primary care practices to either Arm 1 - TopCare with PN: Patients identified as at high risk for not completing screening by our automated algorithm will be assigned to a PN list for contact to help schedule and complete screening (breast, cervical, and colon), or Arm 2 - TopCare without PN: These patients will benefit from the standard features of the TopCare system, including automated identification of overdue patients, patient reminder letters, and referral to a scheduling delegate. All high risk patients in this arm will be eligible for PN after the study period is over.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult patients ages 2175 seen in MGPC practices in the past 3 years, and 1) linked to a specific PCP, or 2) linked to a specific practice (for patients who are not linked to a specific PCP) Patients who are 1) subsequently identified as having died prior to the study intervention using the Social Security Death Index, or 2) listed in the MGH registration system as having a PCP outside of the MGPCPBRN network. Patients 76 years of age or older are excluded because cancer screening may not be appropriate due to other medical problems that are more prevalent with increasing age and because less information is available on the benefits of routine screening in older individuals. Additionally, patients that receive care at MGH Chelsea HC will be excluded since they already have PN onsite for comprehensive cancer screening.</criteria>
