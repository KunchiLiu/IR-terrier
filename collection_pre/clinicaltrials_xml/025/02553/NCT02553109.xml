	<brief_summary>The optimal consensus concerning treatment of incidental small paraclinoid unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) remains controversial. The aim of this prospective study is to reveal the natural history of small paraclinoid UIAs with the goal of informing the treatment plan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paraclinoid ANeurysm Prospectively Driven ObseRvational Analysis (PANDORA) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective observational study will be conducted in 13 Korean centers enrolling a consecutive series of 645 patients with small paraclinoid unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) from 2015 to 2017. The investigators defined the cohort population as adults(20 years old or more) with small (less than 5mm) unruptured paraclinoid aneurysm. To determine the growth rate and risk factors, the angiographic features based on MRA or CTA(ex) size, arterial relationship, multiplicity)and the clinical characteristics (ex) age, hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus(DM), Hyperlipidemia, smoking) are recorded at initial visit, 1 year, 2years, 3years, and 5years. The cumulative risk and the risk factors of aneurysmal rupture and growth will be analysed.</detailed_description>
