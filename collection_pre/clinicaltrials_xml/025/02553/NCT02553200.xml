	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Breathing Exercise With BreatheMAX Device on Airway Secretion Clearance and Lung Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effective strategies to increase mucus clearance rate has been suggested to depend on 4 factors. 1. Oscillation at proper frequency. 2. Lung volume and airway opening. 3. Expiratory flow rate or expiratory bias. 4. Humidifying of inspired air. Multifunctional breathing device, the BreatheMAX, is the only breathing device made in Thailand. The BreatheMAX device possess many properties or techniques that benefit for respiratory care particularly 3 in 4 mechanisms for secretion clearance. The unique important aspect is the simultaneously providing several beneficial effects in one breath which are 1) Oscillation in the range of ciliary beat frequency 2) Biofeedback of respiratory effort that could encourage the deeper breathing performance, 3) Humidifier of inspired air, 4) Loaded breathing for inspiratory muscle training and generate PEP. These 4 functions would be very useful for increase secretion clearance particularly in more peripheral airway which are the most difficult to be cleared and be a risk of atelectasis and infection in patients with MV whose natural secretion clearance mechanisms are compromised, respiratory muscle weakness weak and low immunity. Therefore, the combination of inspiratory and expiratory breathing exercise through the BreatheMAX breathing device may increase or promote more secretion clearance and improve lung function than expiratory breathing exercise alone in intubated patients, both with and without mechanical ventilation dependence</detailed_description>
