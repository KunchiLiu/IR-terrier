	<brief_summary>Mechanical ventilation of patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery may induce lung injury. Since lung protective ventilation has been recommended during anesthesia to prevent ongoing lung injury, so in our study the investigators will compare three different lung protective strategies regarding their lung protective effect measured by the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications, perioperative oxygenation and postoperative inflammatory mediator release.</brief_summary>
