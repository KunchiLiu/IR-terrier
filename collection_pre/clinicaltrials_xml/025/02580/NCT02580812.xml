	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether perinatal listeriosis is associated with long-term neurological consequences, and to evaluate the respective contribution of perinatal sepsis, of prematurity and of the known neurological tropism of the involved pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Perinatal listeriosis is defined by the occurrence of maternal listeriosis at birth and/or of early-onset listeriosis in the neonate (defined by the positive culture of any sample of maternal or neonatal origin). Neurological involvement is defined by the presence of inflammation of the cerebrospinal fluid of positive culture or the cerebro-spinal fluid. Evaluation is performed at the age of 5 years, and includes WPPSI evaluation of the Intelligence Quotient (IQ), NEPSY evaluation of the executive functions and clinical evaluation checking for any motor, sensorial or other focal deficiency among 90 cases and 270 controls matched for gestational age.</detailed_description>
