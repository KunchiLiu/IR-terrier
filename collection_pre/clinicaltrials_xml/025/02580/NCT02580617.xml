	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety of ALLO-ASC-CD for Treatment of Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adipose-derived stem cells are directed to injured tissue, and reduce inflammation. Furthermore, their immunomodulatory effects are significant for treating immune-related diseases, such as crohn's disease. Finally, ALLO-ASC-CD may provide a new option in treating a crohn's disease.</detailed_description>
