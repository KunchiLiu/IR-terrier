	<brief_summary>Knee-osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and disabling problem, that represents a global health issue since none of the current therapies are truly disease modifying. The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in OA-preclinical models has been associated with a reduction in cartilage degradation, the attenuation of bone sclerosis and an effective anti-inflammatory response. Investigators have designed a randomized phase I/II placebo controlled trial of UC-MSCs in knee OA. Outcomes will be evaluated at 12 months, comparing monodosis versus double intra-articular injection, re-randomized at 6 months.</brief_summary>
