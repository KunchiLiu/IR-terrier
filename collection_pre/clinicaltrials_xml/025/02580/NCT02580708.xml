	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2 Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Rociletinib When Administered in Combination With Trametinib in Patients With Activating EGFR Mutation-positive Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, non randomized, multicenter study evaluating the safety and efficacy of rociletinib administered in combination with trametinib. This study will be conducted in 2 phases: Phase 1: This will be the dose escalation phase of the study. Phase 1 will determine the MAD or MTD and RP2D of the combination of rociletinib and trametinib, and evaluate its safety and tolerability and PK profile in EGFRm NSCLC patients who have failed at least one prior EGFR TKI. Phase 2: This will be the dose expansion phase. Phase 2 will evaluate the preliminary efficacy and pharmacodynamics of the combination of rociletinib and trametinib at the RP2D in two subsets of EGFRm NSCLC patients.</detailed_description>
