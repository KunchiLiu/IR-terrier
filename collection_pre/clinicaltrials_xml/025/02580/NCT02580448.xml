	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and activity of VT-464, a lyase-selective inhibitor of CYP17, in patients with advanced breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CYP17 Lyase and Androgen Receptor Inhibitor Treatment With Seviteronel Trial (INO-VT-464-006; NCT02580448)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized, open-label, Phase 1/2 trial of VT-464 in patients with AR (+) TNBC or ER (+)/HER2 normal unresectable locally advanced MBC. There will be a dose confirmation Phase 1 portion of the study to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose. Phase 2 will be an open-label, multi-center study and divided into parallel cohorts: AR (+) TNBC and ER (+) BC patients at the RP2D confirmed/established in Phase 1.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have documented histological or cytological evidence of invasive cancer of the breast. Measureable disease is not required. 2. Phase 1 patients must have TNBC or ER(+) HER2 normal breast cancer and Phase 2 patients must have AR(+) TNBC or ER(+) HER2 normal breast cancer ER positive is defined as positive if ≥1% by IHC ER/PgR() is defined as negative if 0% by IHC HER2 normal is defined as IHC 01+ or IHC 2+(and FISH less than 2), or FISH less than 2.0 AR(+) is defined as ≥1% by IHC. The assessment of AR expression may have been performed any time in the past. Enrollment may be based on local pathology findings with subsequent review of AR expression by central pathology to determine if the patient will be considered evaluable for Phase 2. For patients without known AR status in Phase 2, AR assessment will be performed as a prescreening test following the signing of a separate nontherapeutic informed consent. 3. Female patients with ER(+)/HER2 normal tumors must be postmenopausal defined as cessation of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or physiological cause, and have a serum FSH level within the laboratory's reference range for postmenopausal females that are ≥ 60 years old. Ovarian suppression with a LHRH agonist or antagonists to achieve cessation of regular menses is allowed on study. Male patients with ER(+)/HER2 normal tumors must be undergoing gonadal suppression using LHRH agonists or antagonists prior to dosing with VT464 and continue with the LHRH agonist or antagonist for the duration of the study. 4. Patients with ER(+)/HER2 normal tumors must have progression of disease following at least 1 prior line of endocrine therapy. Progression of disease within 6 months of adjuvant endocrine therapy will be considered a line of prior endocrine therapy. Patients in the TNBC Enzalutamide Treated Cohort (Cohort 2) must have received prior enzalutamide for breast cancer. 5. Availability of a representative, formalinfixed, paraffinembedded, tumor specimen that enables the definitive diagnosis of breast cancer with adequate viable tumor cells in a tissue block (preferred) or ≥ 10 (20 preferred) freshly cut, unstained, serial slides and the associated pathology report are required prior to enrollment (All Phase 2 patients and Phase 1 patients to be considered part of the Phase 2 evaluable population). 6. Patients must ≥ 18 years of age 7. ECOG PS of 0 or 1 8. Patients must have adequate hematopoietic function as evidenced by: WBC ≥ 3,000/μl ANC ≥ 1,500/μl Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μl HGB ≥ 10 g/dl and not transfusion dependent 9. Patients must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by: AST/ALT levels ≤ 3X the ULN Bilirubin levels of ≤ 2.0 mg/dl 10. Patients must have adequate renal function as evidenced by a serum creatinine of ≤ 2.0 mg/dl. 11. Patients must have K+ &gt;3.5 mEq/l. 12. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours of Cycle 1 Day 1. Female patients who are not of childbearing potential meet at least one of the following criteria: Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, Have medically confirmed ovarian failure, or Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as cessation of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or physiological cause, and have a serum FSH level within the laboratory's reference range for postmenopausal females that are &lt; 60 years old. Ovarian suppression with a LHRH agonist to achieve cessation of regular menses is allowed on study. 13. Women of childbearing potential and men who have partners of childbearing potential must agree to use two highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study and for at least 30 days after the last dose of VT464 for women and 90 days after the last dose of VT464 for men. Men must also agree to not donate sperm through 90 days following the last dose of VT464. For men, one form must be a male condom. Highly effective methods of contraception are: Established use of oral, inserted, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception is allowed provided the patient plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness. Correctly placed coppercontaining intrauterine device (IUD) Male condom or female condom used WITH a spermicide (ie, foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository). Bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral tubal occlusive procedure (provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the device's label). Vasectomy 14. Patients or their legal representatives must be willing and able to provide written informed consent 1. Patients who require pharmacological or replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids or who have received systemic corticosteroids within 7 days of study drug initiation. 2. Patients who have received any investigational agent within 5 halflives of the agent in question; if the halflife is not known, within 28 days of study entry. 3. Patients who have received antiandrogens within 4 weeks of study entry. 4. Patients who have received palliative radiotherapy within 4 weeks of study entry. 5. Patients who have received any other therapeutic treatment for breast cancer within 2 weeks of study entry, except for LHRH agonists or antagonists in patients undergoing ovarian suppression enrolled in the Female ER(+) BC cohort and patients undergoing gonadal suppression enrolled in the Male ER(+) BC cohort. 6. Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases from breast cancer 7. Patients with a history of adrenal insufficiency. Patients receiving systemic corticosteroids greater than 2weeks in duration within 6 months of study entry must have a lack of adrenal insufficiency as evidenced by a morning plasma cortisol concentration of ≥ 500 nmol/l or a plasma cortisol response to an ACTH stimulation test that is deemed clinical normal. 8. Patients with a history of another invasive malignancy within the last 3 years. 9. Patients with a QTcF interval of &gt;470 msec on the first of the triplicate Screening ECGs; if the first ECG QTcF interval is &gt;470 msec, then the mean QTcF of the triplicate Screening ECGs can be used and if the mean is &lt;470 msec, the patient may be enrolled. 10. History of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, torsades de pointes, second degree orthird degree atrioventricular heart block without a permanent pacemaker in place). 11. Class III, or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system. 12. Patients with bone metastases who have initiated denosumab or bisphosphonate therapy within 28 days of Cycle 1 Day 1. 13. Patients with any intercurrent conditions that could preclude their participation in the study, pose an undue medical hazard, or which could interfere with the interpretation of the study results 14. Patients with a history of seizure within the past 2 years or those who require prophylactic antiseizure medications are excluded. 15. History of loss of consciousness or transient ischemic attack within 12 months before study drug initiation. 16. Patients who have known active HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C infections. 17. Patients with any other condition which in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation in the study.</criteria>
