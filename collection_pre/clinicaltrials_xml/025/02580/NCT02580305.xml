	<brief_title>SUVN-502 With Donepezil and Memantine for the Treatment of Moderate Alzheimer's Disease- Phase 2a Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 2a, proof-of-concept, 26-week, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled study to compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with SUVN-502 to placebo treatment in subjects with moderate Alzheimer's disease receiving donepezil HCl (10 mg qd) and either memantine HCl (10 mg twice daily [bid]) or Namenda XR® (28 mg qd) or the combination therapy, Namzaric™ The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a serotonin receptor subtype 6 (5-HT6) antagonist, SUVN-502, compared to placebo, as adjunct treatment in subjects with moderate Alzheimer's disease (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score of 12 to 20) currently treated with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil hydrochloride (HCl), and the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist, memantine HCl. Efficacy will be assessed by the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale for Cognitive Behavior (ADAScog-11) after 26 weeks of treatment.</detailed_description>
