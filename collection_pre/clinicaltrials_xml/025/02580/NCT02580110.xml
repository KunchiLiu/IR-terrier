	<brief_title>On the Impact of Common Sweetening Agents on Glucose Regulation, Cognitive Functioning and Gut Microbiota</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy subjects will be included in a crossover study with the purpose to investigate effects of 3 commonly used sweeteners on cardiometabolic risk markers, cognitive functions, and influences on gut microbiota composition. The subjects will consume each test product for 14 days in a random order, separated by at least a two-week washout period. On the last day in each intervention period, i.e. at day fifteen, the last test portion will be consumed together with a standardized evening meal at 9.00 pm. Thereafter the subjects are fasting until arriving to the experimental unit. Upon arrival, test variables in blood will be determined at fasting and repeatedly for 3h postprandial a standardised breakfast served approximately at 8.00 am. Cognitive performance will be determined in the postprandial period with tests evaluating working memory capacity, selective attention, psychomotor reaction time, and executive functions. After each intervention period, faecal samples will be collected for characterization of gut microflora.</detailed_description>
