	<brief_summary>This study is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of the study is to validate two measures for growth hormone deficiency in children, the Treatment Related Impact Measure of Childhood Growth Hormone Deficiency (TRIM-CGHD) and the Treatment Burden Measure of Childhood Growth Hormone Deficiency (TB-CGHD).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Informed consent obtained Child population treatment näive: Confirmed diagnosis of Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) prior to enrolment as determined by a Growth Hormone (GH) stimulation test, defined as a peak GH level of 7.0 ng/ml or less. The GH stimulation test will be according to local clinical standards Pre pubertal children age 9 to less than 13 years at enrolment No prior exposure to GH therapy (GHtreatment naïve) Annualized height velocity (HV) below the 25th percentile for Chronological Age (CA) (HV less than 0.7 SD scores) and sex according to the standards of Prader et al (1989) Body Mass Index (BMI) percentile greater than 5th and below 95th percentile according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) BMIforage growth charts Child population maintenance patients: Confirmed diagnosis of GHD prior to enrolment as determined by a GH stimulation test, defined as a peak GH level of 10.0 ng/ml or less. The GH stimulation test will be according to local clinical standards Pre pubertal children age 9 to less than 13 years at enrolment Body Mass Index (BMI) percentile greater than 5th and nelow 95th percentile according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) BMIforage growth charts Parent/Guardian population treatment näive: Parent/Guardian of child with a confirmed diagnosis of GHD prior to enrolment as determined by a GH stimulation test, defined as a peak GH level of 7.0 ng/ml or less. The GH stimulation test will be according to local clinical standards Parent/Guardian of pre pubertal child age 4 to less than 9 years at enrolment Parent/Guardian of child with no prior exposure to GH therapy (GHtreatment naïve) Parent/Guardian of child with annualized height velocity (HV) below the 25th percentile for CA (HV less than 0.7 SD scores) and sex according to the standards of Prader et al (1989) Parent/Guardian of child with Body Mass Index (BMI) percentile greater than 5th and below 95th percentile according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) BMIforage growth charts Parent/Guardian living in the same residence as the child at least 50% of the time Parent/Guardian population maintenance patients: Parent/Guardian of child with confirmed diagnosis of GHD prior to enrolment as determined by a GH stimulation test, defined as a peak GH level of 10.0 ng/ml or less. The GH stimulation test will be according to local clinical standards Parent/Guardian of pre pubertal child age 4 to less than 9 years at enrolment Parent/Guardian of child with Body Mass Index (BMI) percentile greater than 5th and below 95th percentile according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) BMIforage growth charts Parent/Guardian living in the same residence as the child at least 50% of the time Child population treatment näive and maintenance patients: Any clinically significant abnormality likely to affect growth or the ability to evaluate growth: a) Chromosomal abnormalities and medical "syndromes", e.g. but not limited to Turner's syndrome, Laron syndrome, Noonan syndrome, or absence of GH receptors b) Congenital abnormalities (causing skeletal abnormalities), e.g. but not limited to RussellSilver Syndrome, skeletal dysplasia's c) Significant spinal abnormalities including scoliosis, kyphosis and spina bifida variants Children born small for gestational age (SGA birth weight and/or birth length less than 2 SD for gestational age) Children diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or fasting blood glucose greater than or equal to 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L), or HbA1c greater than or equal to 6.5% at enrolment Current inflammatory diseases (e.g. but not limited to arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases) requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment or glucocorticoids treatment for longer than 2 weeks within the last 3 months prior to enrolment Children requiring glucocorticoid therapy (e.g. asthma) who are taking a dose of greater than 400 µg/day of inhaled budesonide or equivalents for longer than 1 month the year prior to enrolment Concomitant administration of other treatments that may have an effect on growth, e.g. but not limited to anabolic steroids and methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Hormone replacement therapies (thyroxin, hydrocortisone, desmopressin) are allowed for inclusion Any disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardise subject's safety or compliance with the protocol The subject and/or the parent/Legally Acceptable Representative (LAR) are likely to be noncompliant in respect to trial conduct, as judged by the investigator Parent/Guardian population treatment näive and maintenance patients: Parent/Guardian of child with any clinically significant abnormality likely to affect growth or the ability to evaluate growth: a) Chromosomal abnormalities and medical "syndromes", e.g. but not limited to Turner's syndrome, Laron syndrome, Noonan syndrome, or absence of GH receptors b) Congenital abnormalities (causing skeletal abnormalities), e.g. but not limited to RussellSilver Syndrome, skeletal dysplasia's c) Significant spinal abnormalities including scoliosis, kyphosis and spina bifida variants Parent/Guardian of child born small for gestational age (SGA birth weight and/or birth length less than 2 SD for gestational age) Parent/Guardian of child diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or fasting blood glucose greater than or equal to 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L), or HbA1c greater than or equal to 6.5% at enrolment Parent/Guardian of child with current inflammatory diseases (e.g. but not limited to arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases) requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment or glucocorticoids treatment for longer than 2 weeks within the last 3 months prior to enrolment Parent/Guardian of children requiring glucocorticoid therapy (e.g. asthma) who are taking a dose of greater than 400 µg/day of inhaled budesonide or equivalents for longer than 1 month the year prior to enrolment Parent/Guardian of child with concomitant administration of other treatments that may have an effect on growth, e.g. but not limited to anabolic steroids and methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
