	<brief_summary>This study will document treatment effects, changes in quality of life, procedure complications, adverse events, healthcare resource utilization, and further needed intervention(s) following treatment with nSTRIDE autologous protein solution. This study will also allow for the documentation of the same parameters following multiple injections of autologous protein solution to treat knee osteoarthritis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Post-Market Data Collection on Patients With Knee OA and Treated With nSTRIDE APS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical trials have, in general, formally demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of various autologous therapies for the treatment of knee OA. Differences in the processing of autologous therapies can yield substantial differences in the resulting output. It appears that the safety of autologous therapies is roughly equivalent across different processing methods. However, making generalizations regarding the effectiveness across these autologous therapies is more complicated. Thus, each autologous therapy requires independent efficacy evaluation. nSTRIDE APS has been shown to decrease pain, increase function and have a favorable safety profile in a small pilot trial. However, demonstration of the treatment effects in a more heterogeneous population is lacking. Further, neither the effect time course nor the utility of multiple injections has been documented. This study will allow for low burden, efficient data collection in a larger heterogeneous population of persons suffering from knee OA. The study will document the treatment effects and timeline of treatment effects for nSTRIDE APS following single or repeated injections.</detailed_description>
