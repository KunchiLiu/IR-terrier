	<brief_summary>The Copper intrauterine device is the most common method of reversible contraception worldwide. Abnormal uterine bleeding and pain are the most common medical indications for the discontinuation of the intrauterine device. Excessive prostaglandin release in the endometrial cavity appears to play an important role in both bleeding and pain related to copper intrauterine devices.There are many types of prostaglandin metabolites that present in the endometrium one of them is prostacyclin which causes vasodilatation and inhibits platelet aggregation. Another one is thromboxane which has two types; A2 which is active and rapidly converted into B2, which is inactive. Thromboxane causes vasoconstriction and blood clotting. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors acting by decreasing production of endometrial prostaglandins; they can improve both heavy uterine bleeding and pain. Since its discovery; several drugs in NSAIDs class have been used to treat heavy uterine bleeding and pain associated with copper intrauterine device use such as mefenamic acid, ibuprofen and naproxen. The most recent systematic review found NSAIDs is the most widely studied drugs for reduction of the menstrual blood and pain associated with copper intrauterine device. The Cochrane Review also found that NSAIDs are the most effective treatment to reduce the bleeding with copper intrauterine device use.</brief_summary>
