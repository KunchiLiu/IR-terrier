	<brief_summary>A physician initiated trial investigating the LEGFLOW Paclitaxel-Eluting Peripheral Balloon dilatation catheter for the treatment of femoropopliteal lesions longer than 15cm. Objective: to evaluate the short-term outcome of the treatment by means of the LEGFLOW Paclitaxel-Eluting Peripheral BAlloon Dilattaion for the treatment of long femoropopliteal lesions (TASC C&amp;D).</brief_summary>

Male, infertile female or female of child bearing potential practicing an acceptable method of birth control with a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study procedure 9. De novo lesion located in the femoropopliteal arteries suitable for endovascular therapy 10. The target lesion is located within the native femoropopliteal artery 11. The length of the target lesion is &gt; 150mm and considered as TASC C or D lesion according to the TASC II classification. 12. The target lesion has angiographic evidence of stenosis &gt; 50% or occlusion which can be passed with standard guidewire manipulation 13. Target vessel diameter visually estimated is &gt;4mm and &lt;6.5 mm 14. There is angiographic evidence of at least onevesselrunoff to the foot, irrespective of whether or not outflow was reestablished by means of previous endovascular intervention 1. Patient refusing treatment 2. Presence of a stent in the target lesion that was placed during a previous procedure 3. Untreated flowlimiting inflow lesions 4. Any previous surgery in the target vessel (including prior ipsilateral crural bypass) 5. Presence of an aortic thrombosis or significant common femoral ipsilateral stenosis 6. Previous bypass surgery in the same limb 7. Patients for whom antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulants or thrombolytic drugs are contraindicated 8. Patients who exhibit persistent acute intraluminal thrombus of the proposed lesion site 9. Perforation at the angioplasty site evidenced by extravasation of contrast medium 10. Patients with known hypersensitivity to heparin, including those patients who have had a previous incidence of heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II 11. Patients with uncorrected bleeding disorders 12. Aneurysm located at the level of the SFA 13. Nonatherosclerotic disease resulting in occlusion (e.g. embolism, Buerger's disease, vasculitis) 14. Severe medical comorbidities (untreated CAD/CHF, sever COPD, metastatic malignancy, dementia, etc.) or other medical condition that would preclude compliance with the study protocol or 1year life expectancy 15. Major distal amputation (above the transmetatarsal) in the study limb or nonstudy limb 16. Septicemia or bacteremia 17. Ipsilateral iliac treatment before the target lesion procedure with a residual stenosis &gt;30% or ipsilateral iliac treatment conducted after the target lesion procedure 18. Use of thrombectomy, atherectomy or laser devices during procedure 19. Any patient considered to be hemodynamically unstable at onset of procedure 20. Known allergy to contrast media that cannot be adequately premedicated prior to the study procedure 21. Patient is currently participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not completed the entire follow up period</criteria>
