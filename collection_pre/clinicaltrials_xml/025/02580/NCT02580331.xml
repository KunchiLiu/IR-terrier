	<brief_summary>Metformin (MF), a biguanide group of anti-diabetic drug has been shown to enhance osteoblasts differentiation and inhibit osteoclast differentiation in vitro, thus may exhibit a favourable effect on alveolar bone. The present study aims to explore the efficacy of 1% MF gel as a local drug delivery system in adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) for the treatment of Class II furcation defects in comparison with placebo gel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>1% Metformin Gel in the Treatment of Class II Furcation Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Metformin (MF), a biguanide group of anti-diabetic drug has been shown to enhance osteoblasts differentiation and inhibit osteoclast differentiation in vitro, thus may exhibit a favourable effect on alveolar bone. The present study aims to explore the efficacy of 1% MF gel as a local drug delivery system in adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) for the treatment of Class II furcation defects in comparison with placebo gel. Methods: Sixty four patients with single mandibular buccal class II furcation defects were categorized into two treatment groups: SRP plus 1% MF (group 1) and SRP plus placebo (group 2). Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months, and radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline, 6 months, and 9 months. Defect fill at baseline, 6 months, and 9 months was calculated on standardized radiographs using image analysis software.</detailed_description>
