	<brief_summary>Declines in serum calcium during exercise may cause increases in markers of bone resorption. This study will determine if preventing the decline serum ionized calcium experienced at the onset of exercise through the use of a "calcium clamp" also prevents increases in blood biomarkers associated with bone resorption.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PTH And Calcium Responses to Exercise in Older Adults Experiment 2 (PACE Sr. 2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will undergo two identical walking exercise sessions on a treadmill. One session will occur until continuous calcium infusion and the other will be under continuous saline infusion. C-telopeptide, parathyroid hormone, total calcium, and serum ionized calcium will be monitored to distinguish differences in bone activity under the two conditions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy adults aged 6080 y Use of medications in the past 6 months known to affect bone metabolism (e.g., bisphosphonates, thiazide diuretics, oral glucocorticoids) Bone Mineral Density (BMD) t score &lt; 2.5 at the total hip or lumbar spine Known disease or condition associated with intestinal malabsorption Moderate or severe renal impairment defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2 based on the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation Chronic hepatobiliary disease, defined as liver function tests (AST, ALT) &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal; if such values are obtained on initial screening and thought to be transient in nature, repeated testing will be allowed Thyroid dysfunction, defined as an ultrasensitive TSH &lt;0.5 or &gt;5.0 mU/L; volunteers with abnormal TSH values will be reconsidered for participation in the study after followup evaluation by the PCP with initiation or adjustment of thyroid hormone replacement Serum calcium &lt;8.5 or &gt;10.3 mg/dL Serum 25(OH)D &lt;20 ng/mL; volunteers with abnormal serum 25(OH)D values may be reconsidered for participation in the study if serum 25(OH)D is &gt;20 ng/mL after vitamin D supplementation Uncontrolled hypertension defined as resting systolic BP &gt;150 mmHg or diastolic BP&gt;90 mmHg; participants who do not meet these criteria at first screening will be reevaluated, including after followup evaluation by the PCP with initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medications History of type 1 or type 2 diabetes Cardiovascular disease; subjective or objective indicators of ischemic heart disease (e.g., angina, ST segment depression) or serious arrhythmias at rest or during the graded exercise test (GXT) without followup evaluation will be cause for exclusion; followup evaluation must include diagnostic testing (e.g., stress echocardiogram or thallium stress test) with interpretation by a cardiologist Diagnosis or history of asthma</criteria>
