	<brief_summary>To investigate if treatment with ticagrelor can mitigate the transient loss of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation of the resistance vasculature following a short period of ischemia, compared with clopidogrel at standard clinical doses. The effect of ticagrelor or clopidogrel will be studied after a loading dose and after a two weeks period of regular intake on FBF in response to the vasodilators acetylcholine or nitroglycerin before and 10 min after a 20 min forearm ischemia, respectively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Ticagrelor or Clopidogrel on Endothelial Function During Acute and Chronic Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) causes tissue injury. Preclinical animal data suggest that ticagrelor but not clopidogrel protects against IR injury due to inhibition of cellular adenosine uptake and NO-synthase stimulation. It is unclear if this action is part of the beneficial clinical effect of ticagrelor in patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome. The preventive action of ticagrelor on IR injury may also be of interest for the peripheral vasculature, where IR injury is known to result in endothelial dysfunction. This study aims to investigate if treatment with ticagrelor can mitigate the transient loss of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation of the resistance vasculature following a short period of ischemia, compared with clopidogrel at standard clinical doses. We will study the effect of ticagrelor or clopidogrel after a loading dose and after a two weeks period of regular intake on forearm blood flow (FBF) reactivity in response to the vasodilators acetylcholine (ACh; endothelium-dependent agonist) or nitroglycerin (GTN; endothelium-independent vasodilator) before and 10 min after a 20 min forearm ischemia, respectively</detailed_description>
