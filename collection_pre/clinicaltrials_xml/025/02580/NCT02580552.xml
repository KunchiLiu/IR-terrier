	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational drug, MRG-106, in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), mycosis fungoides subtype. MRG-106 is an inhibitor of a molecule called miR-155 that is found at high levels in the malignant T-cells of many mycosis fungoides patients. miR-155 may be important in promoting the growth and survival of these cancer cells. In Part A of the study, MRG-106 will be tested by injection directly into CTCL lesions in the skin. In Part B of the study, MRG-106 will be given by subcutaneous injection or by intravenous infusion. Other objectives of the study are to measure the absorption and clearance of MRG-106 from the blood, and to understand how cells in CTCL skin lesions respond when exposed to MRG-106.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic Study of MRG-106 in Patients With Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma (CTCL), MF Subtype</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design: - Part A: Cohorts of 3-6 patients will receive up to five intratumoral injections of MRG-106 over a period of up to 15 days with follow-up for an additional 20 days, beginning with the maximum deliverable intratumoral dose. Doses may be decreased in subsequent cohorts to determine the minimum pharmacodynamically active dose. - Part B: Cohorts of 3-6 patients will receive six subcutaneous or intravenous doses of MRG-106 over 26 days, with follow-up through 56 days. The starting dose will be selected based on the tolerability of MRG-106 determined in Part A. Doses may be escalated in subsequent cohorts to determine the maximum tolerated dose. - Patients in Part B for whom MRG-106 is well tolerated may continue on their assigned dose in an extension period of the study at the discretion of the investigator and the sponsor. - Any cohort in Part A or Part B may be expanded to further elucidate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of MRG-106.</detailed_description>
