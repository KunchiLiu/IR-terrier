	<brief_summary>The investigators conduct this phase II study of EGCG therapy protection of the skin from damage induced by radiotherapy in breast cancer. In order to observe the effectiveness of EGCG, investigators will utilize both clinician assessments and patient self-assessments. Physician's skin assessments will be scored utilizing the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) score. Patient reported symptom scores are adapted from the Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool (STAT) as pain, burning, itching, pulling, and tenderness in the treatment area. The scales are translated into Chinese and guides in Chinese are developed instructing how to use the scales and perform the assessments.</brief_summary>
