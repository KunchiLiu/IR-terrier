	<brief_title>Clinical Study of the Aorta-femoral Bypass and Hybrid Intervention and the Iliac Arteries With Stenting and Plasty of the Common Femoral Artery Effectiveness in Patients With the Iliac Segment and Femoral Artery Occlusive Disease (TASC C, D)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, according to the TASC II consensus document (2007) and the Russian guidelines for limb ischemia treatment (2010), aorta-iliac C and D type segment lesions the open surgery is suggested. According to different studies, 76% occlusive aorta-iliac article course patients indicate femoral-popliteal segment lesions. Due to the lack of inflow and outflow ways of correction needed for adequate limb revascularization surgery treatment of multistorey atherosclerotic lesions patients is still one of the most complex problems of vascular surgery. Perioperational mortality of critical limb ischemia patients reaches 5-10% in retrograde aorta-iliac segment reconstruction. Due to its high efficiency hybrid operative invasion is one of the most perspective directions in reconstructive vascular surgery development (92-98% of the cases with the small number of post-operative complications). Furthermore, hybrid surgery is possible with the critical iliac segment and femoral artery lesions, since stenting in the field of physiological bends (femoral artery) may lead to its breaking and artery thrombosis. Arterial segments blood flow reconstruction is possible with hybrid innervations meaning iliac segment stenting and common femoral artery patch. All reports of iliac arteries stenosis percutaneous angioplasty indicate that the primary technical and clinical success rate exceeds 90%. The technical success of iliac arteries long occlusions recanalization reaches 80-85%. Improvement of endovascular equipment designed for the total occlusions treatment increases technical success of recanalization. The TASC II materials summarize the several large studies results which present the data on the operated segment artery patency at the level of 70-81% within 5-8 years of follow up. A large number of authors note the actuality of aortic-iliac type C and D segment lesions endovascular treatment recommendations revision according to the TASC II, together with hybrid technics implementation in this category of patients.</detailed_description>
