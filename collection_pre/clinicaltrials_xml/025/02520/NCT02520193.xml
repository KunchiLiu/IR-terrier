	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present study is to compare usual care in terms of mobilization performed to intubated ICU patients to a standardized program designed to deliver early mobilization at least 5 days a week. This study has a before / after design with a control group during the experimental phase. The first phase of the study corresponds to an observational phase during which every act of mobilization performed to the included patients is going to be documented. During this first study period, total duration of mechanical ventilation is going to be recorded for all the patients included. At the end of this first study period, the participating ICU are going to be randomized (Cluster randomization) in two groups either observational or experimental. The corresponding strategy is going to be applied to all the patients included during the second study period. During this second period, total duration of mechanical ventilation is also going to be recorded for all the patients included. The study hypothesis is that applying a protocolized early mobilization strategy increases the number of ventilator free-days during the 28 days after intubation in ICU patients.</brief_summary>
