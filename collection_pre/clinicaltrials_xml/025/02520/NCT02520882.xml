	<brief_summary>This is an open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study to investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluation efficacy of 68Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14) in glioma patients. A single dose of 111-148 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 68Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14) will be injected intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Non-invasive imaging evaluation of GRPR expression would be of great help in drug development, patient stratification and therapeutic response monitoring. Various GRPR targeting imaging probes have been develop to meet the purpose. Bombesin (BBN) is an amphibian homolog of mammalian gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). BBN(7-14), with the amino acid sequence of Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2, has been extensively used for the development of molecular probes for the imaging of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), after being labeled with various radionuclides. Multiple preclinical studies have demonstrated receptor-specific accumulation of the tracers in GRPR positive tumors. For interests in clinical translation of 68Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14), an open-label dynamic whole-body PET/ CT study was designed to investigate the safety and diagnostic performance of 68Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14) in patients with glioma.</detailed_description>
