	<brief_summary>This research study is evaluating the use of specialized testing of solid tumors including sequencing. The process of performing these specialized tests is called tumor profiling. The tumor profiling may result in identifying changes in genes of the tumor that indicate that a particular therapy may have activity. This is called an individualized cancer therapy (iCat) recommendation. The results of the tumor profiling and, if applicable, the iCat recommendation will be returned.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The iCat2, GAIN Consortium Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with solid tumors that are at high risk for recurrence or that has already recurred or become refractory to standard treatment are eligible to participate in this study. All enrolled patients will have targeted sequencing of tumor performed. Sequencing results will be reviewed for clinically significant findings including determination of whether any mutations exist that suggest potential for activity of a targeted therapy (iCat recommendation). Results will be returned to the patient's oncologist and follow-up data will be collected. In this prospective multi-center cohort study, the primary objective is to describe the outcomes of pediatric patients with advanced solid tumors according to whether or not they received of targeted therapy matched to an iCat recommendation. The primary clinical outcome of interest is the endpoint of overall survival (OS), with progression-free survival and response rate (RR) as key secondary clinical outcome measures. To address this hypothesis, 825 patients will enroll from an anticipated 11 participating institutions over 3 years.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age Age ≤ 30 years at time of initial qualifying solid tumor diagnosis Diagnosis Histologic diagnosis of solid malignancy (excluding brain tumors and lymphoma) that meets at least one of the following criteria: Refractory, defined as tumor progression after initiation of standard first line therapy without having achieved a prior partial or complete remission OR Biopsy proven residual disease at the completion of planned standard initial frontline therapy. Recurrent, defined as tumor progression after achieving a prior partial or complete remission Newly diagnosed high risk disease, defined as having an expected event free survival of &lt; 50% at 2 years. Specimen Samples Sufficient tumor specimen available to meet the minimum requirements for profiling from diagnosis or progression / recurrence OR Surgery / biopsy planned as part of clinical care that is anticipated to yield sufficient material to meet the minimum requirements for profiling; OR Patient has already had molecular profiling demonstrating a potentially targetable variant in a laboratory certified to generate a clinical report, but the patient has not yet started therapy matched to the variant AND sufficient tumor specimen is available to meet the minimum requirement for profiling from the same procedure and tissue from which the prior testing was performed. No Therapy Planned Patients who have declined further anticancer therapy will be excluded. Performance Status Patients with Lansky (age &lt; 16 years) or Karnofsky (age ≥16 years) score &lt; 50 will be excluded. Life Expectancy Patients with anticipated life expectancy &lt; 3 months will be excluded.</criteria>
