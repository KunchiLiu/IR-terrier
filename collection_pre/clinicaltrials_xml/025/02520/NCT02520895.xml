	<brief_summary>RIPAL is a prospective cohort study, which main goal is to define T and B immune repertoire diversity and magnitude in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma of high and low grade and chronic lymphocytic leukemia before and after treatment, and to evaluate the association of these parameters with clinical patient data and outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunological Repertoire in Patients With Lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Constitution of a prospective cohort of 128 patients with 8 different groups of patients. This protocol is designed to evaluate a new tool for detecting the diversity of the repertoire T and B in patients with hematological disease. This in vitro diagnostic device is consisting of molecular biology kits Human ImmunTraCkeR® and Human Immun'IgH® and the analysis tool NDL®</detailed_description>
