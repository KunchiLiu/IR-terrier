	<brief_summary>The purpose of this First-in-Human Phase 1 study is to determine if AMG 330 given as a continuous IV infusion is safe and tolerable in adult subjects that have relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or a biologically active dose. The study will be conducted in multiple sites and test increasing doses of AMG 330. The safety of subjects will be monitored by intensive assessment of vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical examinations, and laboratory tests.</brief_summary>
