	<brief_summary>The purpose of this two-stage Phase 2 study is to assess the clinical response (Complete Remission) to FLAM compared to AM treatment in refractory or relapsed AML patients with demonstrated NOXA BH3 priming of ≥ 40% by mitochondrial profiling in bone marrow.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alvocidib Biomarker-driven Phase 2 AML Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Stage 1 of the study, all eligible AML patients with demonstrated NOXA BH3 priming of ≥ 40% by mitochondrial profiling in bone marrow will receive treatment with alvocidib, cytarabine and mitoxantrone [ACM ('FLAM') regimen]. In Stage 2, all eligible AML patients with demonstrated NOXA BH3 priming of ≥ 40% by mitochondrial profiling in bone marrow will be randomized 1:1 to receive either treatment with ACM or CM (cytarabine and mitoxantrone). In the exploratory arm, all eligible patients with newly diagnosed high-risk AML with NOXA BH3 priming ≥40% by mitochondrial profiling in bone marrow will receive treatment with ACM.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Be between the ages of ≥18 and ≤65 years 2. Have an established, pathologically confirmed diagnoses of AML by World Health Organization (WHO) criteria excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia (APLM3) with a bone marrow of &gt;5% blasts based on histology or flow cytometry 3. Be in first relapse (within 24 months of CR) or have primary refractory AML (refractory to initial induction therapy using 1 or 2 cycles of intensive anthracycline/cytarabine ± etoposide or cladribine induction) or have newly diagnosed highrisk AML as defined in this protocol. 4. Demonstrate NOXA BH3 priming of ≥40% by mitochondrial profiling in bone marrow 5. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) ≤2 6. Have a serum creatinine level ≤1.8 mg/dL 7. Have an alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level ≤5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) 8. Have a total bilirubin level ≤2.0 mg/dL (unless secondary to Gilbert syndrome, hemolysis, or leukemia) 9. Have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;45% by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan 10. Be nonfertile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception. Sexually active patients and their partners must use an effective method of contraception associated with a low failure rate during and for 6 months after completion of study therapy. 11. Be able to comply with the requirements of the entire study. 12. Provide written informed consent prior to any study related procedure. 1. Received more than 2 cycles of induction therapy for AML. Investigational agents as part of frontline therapy for AML may by acceptable following discussion with the Medical Monitor. Hydroxyurea is permitted (see #5 below). 2. Received any previous treatment with alvocidib or any other CDK inhibitor 3. Received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant within the previous 2 months 4. Have clinically significant graft versus host disease (GVHD), or GVHD requiring initiation or escalation of treatment within the last 21 days 5. Require concomitant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Hydroxyurea is allowed up to the evening before starting (but not within 12 hours) of starting treatment on either arm. 6. Received &gt;360 mg/m2 equivalents of daunorubicin 7. Have a peripheral blast count of &gt;30,000/mm3 (may use hydroxyurea as in #5 above) 8. Received antileukemic therapy within the last 3 weeks (with the exception of hydroxyurea or if the patient has definite refractory disease). Refractory patients who received therapy within the last 3 weeks may be eligible with prior approval of the Medical Monitor. 9. Diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL, M3) 10. Have active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia 11. Have evidence of uncontrolled disseminated intravascular coagulation 12. Have an active, uncontrolled infection 13. Have other lifethreatening illness 14. Have other active malignancies or diagnosed with other malignancies within the last 6 months, except nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 15. Have mental deficits and/or psychiatric history that may compromise the ability to give written informed consent or to comply with the study protocol. 16. Are pregnant and/or nursing</criteria>
