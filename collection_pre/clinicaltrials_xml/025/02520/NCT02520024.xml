	<brief_summary>This project proposed to demonstrate the effectiveness, costs, and benefits to participation and community living self-directed care programming within a financially sustainable Medicaid managed care environment. The study examined outcomes associated with the implementation of a novel self-directed care (SDC) approach being implemented in Delaware County, Pennsylvania in which consumers were able to access a set amount of renewable funds per year and direct how they were spent, both to purchase the types and amounts of rehabilitation and treatment services they desire (and from whom they choose) and to purchase a broad-range of individualized resources and services that are generally outside of Medicaid funding (e.g., health club memberships, yoga classes, support in taking care of bills).</brief_summary>
