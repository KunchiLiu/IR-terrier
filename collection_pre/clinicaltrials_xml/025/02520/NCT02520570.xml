	<brief_summary>1. Investigate the application of ulinastatin in real practice clinic.(eg:population character, usage and dosage, course of treatment,etc ) 2. Analysis the incidence of adverse drug reactions /adverse events of ulinastatin, collect the main clinical manifestations, treatment, outcome, influence factors; provide evidence for improving the recommended medication plan of ulinastatin. 3. Evaluate the safety of ulinastatin , obtain scientific conclusion , and provide evidence for appropriate medication to administration department of health authority.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order to find out the application of ulinastatin in real practice clinic , identify the high risk group for adverse event/adverse drug reaction and calculate the adverse event/adverse drug reaction incidence rate, a large sample size clinical trial has been designed. This trial is an observational study. The investigators would screen several hospitals from different provinces and prospectively collect the main clinical manifestations,treatment, outcome, influence factors about patients using ulinastatin either in general clinical departments or in ICU. This study would be expected to provide evidence for appropriate medication to administration department of health authority.</detailed_description>
