	<brief_title>Companion Study for Patients Who Completed Participation in a REGN2810 (Anti-PD-1) Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>The target population for this study is patients who have participated in any REGN2810 clinical study. Inclusion Criteria for Patients Receiving Retreatment: 1. Tolerated prior treatment with REGN2810 with no unacceptable toxicity (except select reversible irAEs) requiring discontinuation of REGN2810 2. Developed documented progressive disease after first demonstrating clinical benefit from their initial treatment 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1 4. ≥18 years old 5. Hepatic function: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN; if liver metastases ≤ 3 x ULN) Transaminases ≤ 3 x ULN (or ≤ 5.0 x ULN, if liver metastases) Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (or ≤ 5.0 x ULN, if liver metastases) For patients with hepatic metastases or hepatic malignancies, exclude patients with concomitant 3 x ULN ≤ aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5 x ULN and 1.5 x ULN ≤ total bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN 6. Renal function: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 7. Bone marrow function: Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelet count ≥ 75 x 10^9/L Inclusion Criteria for Patients who Will not Receive Retreatment: Patients must have completed participation in any REGN2810 clinical study. A patient who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from receiving retreatment with REGN2810: 1. Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk for irAEs. 2. Patients who experienced an irAE in while participating in another REGN2810 protocol who were unable to have their corticosteroid dose reduced to &lt;10 mg per day prednisone equivalent within 12 weeks of toxicity. 3. Patients who developed ≥ Grade 2 uveitis in a prior REGN2810 protocol 4. Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (&gt; 10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of REGN2810 5. Active infection requiring therapy, including known infection with human immunodeficiency virus, or active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus. 6. History of pneumonitis within the last 5 years. 7. Any investigational or antitumor treatment within 30 days prior to the initial administration of REGN2810. 8. History of documented allergic reactions or acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed of Grade ≥ 3 severity during or directly following an REGN2810 infusion 9. Known allergy to doxycycline or tetracycline. (precaution due to presence of trace components in REGN2810) 10. Breastfeeding 11. Positive serum pregnancy test 12. History within the last 5 years of an invasive malignancy other than the one treated in this study, with the exception of resected/ablated basal or squamouscell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other local tumors considered cured by local treatment. 13. Acute or chronic psychiatric problems that, under the evaluation of the investigator, make the patient ineligible for participation 14. Unwilling to practice adequate contraception during the study until 6 months after the last dose of study drug</criteria>
