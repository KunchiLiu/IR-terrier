	<brief_summary>This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of osimertinib and navitoclax when given together and to see how well they work in treating patients with previously treated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body or has not responded to previous treatment with initial EGFR kinase inhibitor. Osimertinib and navitoclax may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving with osimertinib together with navitoclax may work better in treating EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Osimertinib and Navitoclax in Treating Patients With EGFR-Positive Previously Treated Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and tolerability of AZD9291 (osimertinib) in combination with navitoclax in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following resistance to prior EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI). II. To evaluate the feasibility of treatment with AZD9291 plus navitoclax for patients with T790M-mediated acquired resistance to EGFR TKI. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To study the pharmacokinetic profile of the combination of AZD9291 plus navitoclax. II. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To study plasma genotype levels as a response biomarker in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer. II. To explore tissue biomarkers of apoptosis and their association with treatment response. OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study followed by a dose-expansion study. Patients receive navitoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and osimertinib PO QD on days 4-28 (days 1-28 during dose-expansion). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed nonsquamous NSCLC, with incurable advanced or metastatic disease Prior genotyping positive for an EGFR activating mutation (L858R, exon 19 deletion, G719X, L861Q) Progression after prior treatment with an EGFR TKI; in addition to this one prior line of therapy, any additional prior lines of therapy are permitted; prior treatment with a thirdgeneration EGFR TKI is allowed for the dose escalation phase, but is not permitted for the expansion cohort Adequate archival tissue from a biopsy performed after progression of disease on previous EGFR TKI; or willing to undergo a new tumor biopsy prior to registration (for the dose escalation portion only this requirement can be waived if T790M status has already been determined using a local assay) For the dose expansion portion only, patient must: 1) have a tumor which is EGFRT790M positive using central genotyping (if EGFRT790M status is unknown, patients may consent for central EGFR T790M testing as part of screening for the trial; patients who test negative for EGFR T790M by central genotyping will be ineligible), and 2) be treatment naive to T790Mdirected EGFR TKI (e.g. AZD9291, rociletinib, etc) Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) Any number of prior therapies are allowed Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt;

if the subject is currently using a hormonal contraceptive, she should also use a barrier method during this study and for 1 month after study completion Intrauterine device (IUD) Doublebarrier method: male condom plus diaphragm or vaginal cap with spermicide (contraceptive sponge, jellies or creams) Additionally, male subjects (including those who are vasectomized) whose partners are pregnant or might be pregnant must agree to use condoms for the duration of the study and for 90 days following completion of therapy Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to initiation of treatment;
