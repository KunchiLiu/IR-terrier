	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to conduct a translational study on the regulation of S-adenosylmethionine synthesis and cellular methylation reactions during chronic inflammation. Development of in vitro cell models may reveal the regulatory mechanisms by which specific inflammatory mediators cause metabolic changes and alter DNA methylation status. Metabolic and pharmacological studies in the in vivo models will enable us to better understand the regulation of inter-organ homeostasis of S-adenosyl methionine and help identify tissue specific biomarkers for methylation and epigenetic modifications in different stage of chronic inflammation. The clinical study in human subjects will help distinguish the impacts of autoimmune rheumatic disease, degenerated joint disease, or specific medication use on significant clinical and biochemical markers in folate and vitamin B6 metabolic pathways.The Investigators hope the present study can identify specific clinical markers for potential epigenetic changes in patients suffering from chronic inflammation, which will contribute to better clinical management of these diseases in humans.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The significance of epigenetic alterations in autoimmune rheumatic diseases and degenerated joint diseases has drawn great attention among clinicians and researchers. Aberrant methylation status has been demonstrated in human chronic inflammation yet more efforts have focused on global and sequence-specific hypomethylation and overexpression of specific genes. Few studies investigated the regulation of S-adenosylmethionine homeostasis and regulation during inflammation. At present the relevance and regulation of the complex epigenetic profiles and their modifications among different tissues and organs during inflammation remain largely unknown.</detailed_description>
