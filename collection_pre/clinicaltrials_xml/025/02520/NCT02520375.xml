	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to determine the impact of a prebiotic toothpaste and mouthrinse in periodontitis patients as an adjunct to scaling and rootplaning. Study design: this study will be a single centre (Department of Oral Health Sciences, University Hospitals Leuven), double blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial. The randomization (by means of a computer program) and double blind design are thought to minimize the bias of the investigator and patients. Study population: adults, who consult at the department of Periodontology at the University Hospital Leuven and who fit the inclusion criteria will be asked to participate in this study.</detailed_description>
