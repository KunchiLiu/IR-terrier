	<brief_title>ATX Register Accolade Stem &amp; Trident/Tritanium Cup With X3 Insert</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective international multicentre surveillance register. The aim of this register is to determine the Accolade/Accolade II stem and Trident/Tritanium cup survivorship over years. All institutions willing to participate to the register, able to recruit at least 20 patients (up to 100 patients)</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Male and nonpregnant female patients between 1875 years of age. 2. Patients requiring uncemented primary THA (Total Hip Arthroplasty), suitable for the use of the Accolade stem and Trident/Tritanium cup. 3. Patients with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA). 4. Patients who understand the conditions of the study and are willing and able to comply with the postoperative scheduled clinical and radiographic evaluations and the prescribed rehabilitation. 5. Patients who signed the Ethics Committee approved Informed Consent Form prior to surgery. 1. Patients who require revision of a previously implanted hip prosthesis. 2. Patients who had a THA on contralateral side within the last 6 months. 3. Patients who had a THA on contralateral side more than 6 months ago and the rehabilitation period outcome was considered unsatisfactory or not good (Harris Hip Score &lt; 85). 4. Patients who will need lower limb joint replacement for another joint within one year. 5. Patients requiring bilateral hip replacement. 6. Patients who have had a prior procedure of acetabular osteotomy. 7. Patients with acute femoral fractures 8. Obese patients where obesity is severe enough to affect subject's ability to perform activities of daily living (body mass index, kg/m2: BMI 35). 9. Patients with active or suspected infection. 10. Patients with malignancy active malignancy. 11. Patients with severe osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Paget's disease or renal osteodystrophy. 12. Patients immunologically suppressed, or receiving steroids in excess of physiologic dose requirements. 13. The patient has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficit which would limit the ability to assess the performance of the device or the patient has a neurological deficit which interferes with the patient's ability to limit weight bearing or places an extreme load on the implant during the healing period. 14. Female patients planning a pregnancy during the course of the study. 15. Patients with systemic or metabolic disorders leading to progressive bone deterioration. 16. Patients, who as judged by the surgeon, are mentally incompetent or are unlikely to be compliant with the prescribed postoperative routine and followup evaluation schedule. 17. Patients with other severe concurrent joint involvements, which can affect their outcome. 18. Patients with other concurrent illnesses, which are likely to affect their outcome such as sickle cell anaemia, systemic lupus erythematosus or renal disease requiring dialysis. 19. Patient with a known sensitivity to device materials. 20. Patients under the protection of law (e.g. guardianship).</criteria>
