	<brief_summary>High blood pressure in pregnancy affects around 10% of pregnancies, and is associated with serious adverse outcomes for both mother and baby. Treatment options for the management of high blood pressure in pregnancy are currently limited. Studies in non-pregnant individuals have shown that supplementation with dietary nitrate, using beetroot juice, can significantly lower blood pressure and improve blood flow. This study aims to investigate whether supplementation with dietary nitrate (via beetroot juice) can improve blood pressure regulation in pregnant women with chronic high blood pressure, and will also determine whether this can improve blood flow across the placenta.</brief_summary>
