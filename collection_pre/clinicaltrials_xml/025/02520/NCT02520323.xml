	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the presence of bacterial species, and the immunologic and molecular mechanisms of granuloma formation that might be involved in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. The investigators will collect peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples to isolate bacterial DNA and blood monocytes and lymphocytes. Specimens will be obtained from patients with sarcoidosis, with non-sarcoid lung disease, and healthy volunteers to directly compare the bacterial species present and the characteristics of cells thought to be involved in granuloma formation.</brief_summary>
