	<brief_summary>Diets rich in fruits and vegetables have been linked to favorable cardiovascular outcomes in epidemiological studies. Dietary intervention studies with certain micronutrients have shown promising effects on surrogate parameters of vascular risk including blood pressure, endothelial function and cholesterol levels. Wild blueberries have gained attention due to their high content of phytochemicals and particularly anthocyanins. Whether wild blueberries can improve vascular function and health when given over relevant time periods and in relevant populations is not known. Therefore, it is the overall hypothesis of the study proposal that chronic consumption of wild blueberries can improve endothelial function, a prognostically validated surrogate of cardiovascular risk.</brief_summary>
