	<brief_title>Evaluation of ColdZyme® Mouth Spray on Prevention and Alleviation of Rhinovirus Induced Common Cold</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Common colds can be caused by a number of viruses, e.g. rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza viruses and others. The majority of colds are however caused by rhinovirus infection, which is responsible for up to 80% of all common colds. This study evaluates the effect of creating a physical barrier on the pharyngeal mucosal membrane to prevent or reduce virus cell entry during common cold infection to reduce total virus load and common cold symptoms in vivo in relation to placebo.</detailed_description>
