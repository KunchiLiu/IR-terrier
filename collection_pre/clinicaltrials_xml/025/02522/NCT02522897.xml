	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if additional panretinal photocoagulation of ischemic areas following retinal vein occlusion (RVO) may reduce the rate of recurrence and allow longer treatment intervals in anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) treatment following the "trea-and-extend" scheme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the "Treat-and-extend" Scheme in Patients With Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) With and Without LASER Treatment of Ischaemic Retinal Areas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with macular edema following RVO receive an anti-VEGF treatment by injection of Ranibizumab for 12 months in the "treat-and-extend" scheme. Following this scheme, all patients receive a series of three injections at the interval of 4 weeks. Thereafter, the retreatment interval is determined by results of certain examinations. The next control including a reinjection is scheduled with an extension of one week until the patient presents signs of recurrence. Assuming that by the time of recurrence the interval is too long, the next control (following a retreatment) is then scheduled one week sooner than the last control. Following this treatment schedule, the individualized retreatment interval is thereafter kept steady. Half the patients receive an additional panretinal photocoagulation on visit 3 and / or 4. Aim of this study is to investigate if this additional panretinal photocoagulation may result in a longer individualized retreatment interval corresponding to a reduced rate of recurrence of macular edema.</detailed_description>
