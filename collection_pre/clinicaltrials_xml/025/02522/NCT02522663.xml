	<brief_summary>Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR) surgery for aortic valve disease continues to increase in numbers. With better surgical techniques and equipment, also older patients can be operated on, resulting in an growth of the older population. AVR is characterized by high rates of hospital readmissions, resulting in suboptimal care planning and higher health care costs. Hence, it is important to develop strategies to reduce hospital readmissions following AVR. The purpose if this study is to develop and test the efficacy of a 24/7-phone support in the reduction of readmissions after AVR treatment. Secondary outcomes are a reduced level of anxiety, less depressive symptoms and a better health related quality of life.</brief_summary>
