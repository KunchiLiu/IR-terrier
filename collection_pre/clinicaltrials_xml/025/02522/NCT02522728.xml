	<detailed_description>The objective is to investigate the Clinical, Radiographic, Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric behaviour and patient outcome when using the Triathlon total knee prosthesis in a prospective randomized clinical trial. The evaluation is carried out by a prospective randomised RSA-study with Triathlon CR vs. Triathlon PS.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Patients suffering exclusively from osteo arthritis, Stage IIV [Ahlb√§ck, 1968 391] will be operated. 2. Patients requiring knee prosthesis, suitable for the use of Duracon and Triathlon knee system 3. Patients who understand the conditions of the study and are willing and able to comply with the postoperative scheduled clinical and radiographical evaluations and the prescribed rehabilitation. 4. Patients who signed the Ethics Committee approved Informed Consent Form prior to surgery. 1. Previous major knee surgery 2. Other significant disabling problems from the muscularskeletal system than in the knees 3. Obese patients where obesity is severe enough to affect subject's ability to perform activities of daily living (body mass index, kg/m2: BMI above 35). 4. Patients with active or suspected infection. 5. Patients with malignancy active malignancy. 6. Patients with severe osteoporosis, Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy. 7. Patients immunologically suppressed, or receiving steroids in excess of physiologic dose requirements. 8. The patient has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficit which would limit the ability to assess the performance of the device or the patient has a neurological deficit which interferes with the patient's ability to limit weight bearing or places an extreme load on the implant during the healing period. 9. Female patients planning a pregnancy during the course of the study. 10. Patients with systemic or metabolic disorders leading to progressive bone deterioration. 11. Patients, who as judged by the surgeon, are mentally incompetent or are unlikely to be compliant with the prescribed postoperative routine and followup evaluation schedule. 12. Patients with other severe concurrent joint involvements, which can affect their outcome. 13. Patients with other concurrent illnesses, which are likely to affect their outcome such as sickle cell anaemia, systemic lupus erythematosus or renal disease requiring dialysis. 14. Patients under the protection of law (e.g. guardianship).</criteria>
