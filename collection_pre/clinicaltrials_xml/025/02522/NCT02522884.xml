Willing to comply with all required followup visits 6. Rutherford Classification 2, 3 or 4 7. Estimated life expectancy &gt;1 year 8. Eligible for standard surgical repair, if necessary 9. Subject is ambulatory (assistive devices such as a cane or walker is acceptable) Subject must NOT meet any of the following exclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment: 1. Rutherford Classification 0, 1, 5 or 6 2. Is pregnant or refuses to use contraception through the duration of the study 3. Previous infrainguinal bypass graft in the target limb 4. Planned amputation on the target limb 5. Systemic infection or Infection within the target limb and/or immunocompromised 6. Endovascular or surgical procedure (not including diagnostic procedures) on the target limb within 30 days prior to or within 30 days after the index procedure 7. Endovascular or surgical procedure (not including diagnostic procedures) on the nontarget limb within 14 days prior to the index procedure or planned procedure within 30 days after the index procedure 8. Prior coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure within 30 days prior to the index procedure or planned CABG/PCI within 30 days after the index procedure 9. Any other previous or planned surgical or endovascular procedure (not including diagnostic procedures) within 14 days prior to or 30 days post index procedure 10. Planned atherectomy, cryoplasty, stenting or any other treatment (with the exception of a crossing device) of the target lesion other than PTA during the index procedure 11. Known coagulopathy, hypercoagulable state, bleeding diathesis, other blood disorder, or a platelet count less than 80,000/microliter or greater than 500,000/microliter 12. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy 13. Myocardial infarction within 30 days prior to enrollment 14. History of stroke within 90 days prior to enrollment 15. Serum creatinine of &gt;2.5 mg/dL 16. Requires treatment of tibial or outflow vessels at the index procedure, which include the P2 and P3 segments of the popliteal artery and the tibioperoneal vessels 17. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to nickeltitanium alloy (Nitinol) 18. Participating in another ongoing investigational clinical trial that has not completed its primary endpoint 19. Has other comorbidities that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude them from receiving this treatment and/or participating in studyrequired followup assessments 20. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to contrast agents that cannot be medically managed 21. Thrombolysis of the target vessel within 72 hours prior to the index procedure, where complete resolution of the thrombus was not achieved</criteria>
