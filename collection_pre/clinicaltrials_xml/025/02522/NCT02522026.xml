	<brief_summary>Between 2012 and 2014, a cohort of 90 COPD subjects of disease severity grades GOLD I-IV as well as 60 healthy control subjects (30 smokers and 30 non-smokers) have been examined regarding different clinical and blood/ sputum derived biomarkers at the investigators' research center. This observation study will follow-up/re-examine all available subjects regarding disease course and treatment changes after 3 years (+/-6 months) for the investigation of ncRNA/ transcriptome biomarkers for their potential to indicate disease progression. In addition, biobanking of respective biosamples for potential future COPD biomarker research will be conducted.</brief_summary>
