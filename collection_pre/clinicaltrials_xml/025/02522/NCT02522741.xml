	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an evidence-based post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) intervention adapted to focus on parenting-related impairment for mothers receiving preventive services. The study intervention is adapted from Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR). The investigators expect that the adaption (Parenting STAIR) has the potential to prevent child maltreatment as well as improve maternal and child well-being by reducing the effects of maternal PTSD and depression on parenting. The investigators plan to recruit mothers with high levels of trauma-related symptoms from preventive service agencies, and invite them to participate in the study. This study is a single group design, and data will be collected pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 12-week follow-up.</brief_summary>
