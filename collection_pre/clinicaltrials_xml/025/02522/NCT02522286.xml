	<brief_title>Creating a Zone of Openness to Increase Patient-Centered Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) using a 2x2 factorial design to compare two interventions, "Ask 3 Questions" and "Open Communication" alone and in combination to a usual care control condition. These data will inform a potential future large scale evaluation of the interventions in clinical practice. Consistent with a patient-centered approach, outcome measures are selected in collaboration with a group of patient stakeholders and will include measures of patient satisfaction. The study aims to collect 75 post-visit surveys and 10 appointment audio-recordings from patients at each of 4 participating sites (a total of 300 post-visit surveys and 40 audio-recordings).</detailed_description>
