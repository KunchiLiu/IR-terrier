	<brief_summary>Cystatin C, a protease inhibitor produced by most nucleated cells, is freely filtered by the kidneys, and its plasma assay reflects the GFR. Compare, in HIV patients, the predictive performance of 11 formula to estimate GFR based on assay plasma cystatin C with that of the MDRD formulas.</brief_summary>
