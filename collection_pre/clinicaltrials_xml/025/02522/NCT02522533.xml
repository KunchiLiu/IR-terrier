	<brief_summary>Frailty has been associated with poor acute and long-term outcomes after major surgery. We recently determined that nearly 70% of patients undergoing major thoracic surgery are pre-frail or frail. We are interested in assessing whether a strength training intervention for frail or pre-frail patients has an impact on surgical decision making and on surgical outcomes.</brief_summary>
