	<detailed_description>Study Aims/Objectives: This projects' Primary Aim is development of a Condensed DBT Stepped Care Model tailored to the unique requirements of students meeting sub-clinical diagnostic criteria for BPD with its associated high rate of self-harm and suicide. The investigator previously implemented a 4-mth condensed-DBT regimen with success in an adult clinical population. This study will evaluate an intensive 8 week intervention formulated for students to reduce the high prevalence of self-harm and dysfunctional behavior in this population and reduce the need for extended treatment in later years. It will include rigorous screening for collateral disorders, including Substance Use Disorders exacerbating BPD symptoms and suicide risk.</detailed_description>
