	<brief_summary>Corneal topography allows the measure of the radii of curvature and of the thickness of the cornea. It is essential for diagnosis in ophthalmology and allows to highlight corneal irregularities such as a keratoconus, or too thin corneas which are a contra-indication for laser refractive surgery. Several types of corneal topographers are commercially available. Some as the Orbscan(r), operate by analyzing the image of the patterns of a Placido disk associated with a light slit, allowing the collection of thousands of points of the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea. More recent systems such as the Pentacam(r) are based on automatic rotary cameras which capture images of the whole anterior segment of the eye. The aim of this study is to compare two topographs, the Pentacam(r) and the Orbscan(r) and, more specifically, the central corneal pachymetry measurements measured pre- and postoperatively.</brief_summary>
