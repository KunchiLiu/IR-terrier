	<brief_title>Development of an Intranasal Proteosome Influenza Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Proteosome-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (P-TIV) administered intra-nasally was shown to be effective, safe, well tolerated, immunogenic - in both systemic and mucosal compartments - and effective at preventing influenza illness. In two separate studies using the Human Viral Challenge Model, subjects were selected for susceptibility to A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) virus and then dosed with one of three regimens: (A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1), A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2), B/Victoria/504/2000 or B/Shangdong/7/1997) or placebo via a nasal spray. One or two doses were given, 14 days apart, before subjects were challenged with ~8.5 x 105 EID¬50 of A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) virus. Immune responses to the vaccine antigens were measured, namely serum IgG (via the aemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI)) and nasal wash secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies (via ELISA). Viral titres in nasal washes and symptoms of influenza illness were assessed after viral challenge and compared.</detailed_description>
