	<brief_title>Dry vs Wet Misoprostol for Cervical Dilation in First Trimester Abortion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Misoprostol is the most widely used drug for abortion due to its low cost, stability and easy to use regimen. Nevertheless, there is a debate whether the administration of dry misoprostol has similar effects compared to wet pill. It would be necessary to undertake a clinical trial to evaluate which regimen (dry or wet) offers a better cervical dilation pre uterine evacuation. The primary objective of this study is to compare the degree of cervical dilatation pre-uterine evacuation in subject that received 400 µg of dry or wet misoprostol 3 or more hours before the procedure. Secondary objective is to verify whether there is a correlation between vaginal pH (&lt;5 / ≥5) and the degree of cervical dilation (≥8mm / &lt;8mm) with the use of wet or dry misoprostol. Women will be randomized to one of the two groups: dry or wet misoprostol.</detailed_description>
