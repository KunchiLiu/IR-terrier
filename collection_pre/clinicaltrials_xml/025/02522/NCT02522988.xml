	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized-controlled, crossover pilot trial is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and effects of a non-deceptive (open-label) administration of placebo pills for treating cancer related fatigue (CRF). If significant effects are found, the investigators will later determine if the presence of a COMT Val18Met genotype variant predicts placebo responses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of an Open Label Placebo to Treat Cancer Related Fatigue in Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will conduct a pilot randomized-controlled, crossover trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and effect of the open-label administration of placebo pills on CRF and associated psychosocial factors (e.g., emotional health, social health, quality of life, etc.) for cancer survivors (CSs) who have completed all cancer treatments yet continue to experience CRF. Additionally, in an exploratory manner, the investigators will collect DNA saliva specimens that will be analyzed for potential biomarkers that may predict placebo responses. To do this, investigators will use a 7-week, single site, two-parallel arm, randomized controlled crossover pilot study to determine the feasibility, acceptability and effects of an Open Label Placebo Intervention (OLPI) on CSs who completed cancer treatments at least 6 months prior to enrollment in the study and report a fatigue score of 4 or greater on a 0-10 scale. Investigators will enroll 80 eligible CS participants who will be randomized into two groups of 40 (Group1 and Group2 ). In this crossover study, participants in Group1, will receive an OLP (placebo pill) for 21-days (Period 1)and Group2 (Observational Controls) will not. After a 1-week washout period, Group2 will receive the OLP for 21-days (Period 2) and Group1 (Observational Controls) will not.</detailed_description>
