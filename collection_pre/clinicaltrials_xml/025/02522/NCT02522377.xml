	<brief_title>Administration of Subanesthetic Dose of Ketamine and Electroconvulsive Treatment for Treatment Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will compare the effects of standard ketamine dosing with an active placebo arm. Hypothesis 1: The investigators hypothesize that interleaved Electroconvulsive Treatment and active ketamine treatment will lead to a meaningful clinical improvement compared to Electroconvulsive Treatment and placebo treatment arm. Hypothesis 2: The investigators hypothesize that interleaved Electroconvulsive Treatment and active ketamine treatment will attenuate cognitive side effects. Methods and Design: Patients with treatment resistant depression who are deemed to be eligible for Electroconvulsive Treatment will randomly be assigned to either ketamine or active placebo Electroconvulsive Treatments: All patients (independent of their depression scores) will receive the same Electroconvulsive Treatment parameters: Bi-frontal brief pulse (0.5 miliseconds) Electroconvulsive Treatment administered by using Thymatron Electroconvulsive Treatment machine. Study blinding: Neither the patients, nor the treating psychiatrist or the nurse will be aware of the patient's assigned arm. The success of blinding will be tested after each ketamine treatment with a questionnaire given to the subject, raters, and treating physician.</detailed_description>
