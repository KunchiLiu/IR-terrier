	<brief_summary>TACT is a "real world" randomized controlled trial of tecarfarin, a novel vitamin K antagonist, vs. warfarin. The quality of anticoagulation control will be compared for the two groups of subjects who require chronic oral anticoagulation for a broad panel of indications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tecarfarin Anti-Coagulation Trial (TACT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3000 subjects with indications for chronic anticoagulation will be randomized to either tecarfarin or warfarin for at least one year (6 months for some VTE subjects). The study will be fully enriched with at least 1200 of the subjects having a mechanical heart valve as the primary indication for chronic anticoagulation. The remaining 1800 subjects will be required to be taking a chronic medication concomitantly which is known to interact with CYP2C9. The primary endpoint will be a comparison of Time in the Therapeutic Range (TTR) for a nested, blinded population of all subjects who are taking a chronic medication which is known to interact with CYP2C9 and who have a CYP2C9 genetic variant allele.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Age &gt; 18. 2. Meets at least one of the following criteria: has a MHV is taking a CYP2C9interacting medication chronically at the time of randomization. 3. Requires chronic anticoagulation therapy. 4. Has one or more of the following indications for chronic oral anticoagulation: Atrial fibrillation/flutter Aortic and/or mitral prosthetic HV History of chronic venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease or acute VTE History of myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy Any other indication, with Sponsor approval 1. Is pregnant, nursing, or a woman of childbearing potential who cannot assure that they will not become pregnant for the duration of the study. 2. Has been treated with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 halflives prior to randomization, whichever is longer. 3. Has a life expectancy &lt;1 year. 4. Is &gt;85 years old. 5. Has severe endorgan disease, such as: Estimated GFR (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min at Screening per the central laboratory Advanced pulmonary disease requiring home oxygen NYHA class IV heart failure Severe psychiatric disorder such as advanced dementia 6. Has a history of nondisabling ischemic stroke or any history of intracranial bleeding. 7. Alcohol or substance abuse within 1 year 8. Has anemia (screening hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL). 9. Has thrombocytopenia (screening platelet count &lt;90,000/microL). 10. Has a history of or presence of any illness or condition, which, in the judgment of the Investigator, may compromise the safety of the subject during Study Drug administration. 11. Has known active bleeding or known history of lesions at risk of bleeding such as gastric ulceration, colonic or cerebral arteriovenous malformations, cerebral or aortic aneurysms, pericarditis, or endocarditis. 12. Except for MHV replacement surgery and related or concurrent procedures, has recently (&lt;14 days from Screening) undergone nonthromboembolic surgery or other invasive procedures such as lumbar puncture. 13. Has a history of blood dyscrasias or inherited disorders of hemostasis. 14. Has a history of hemorrhagic tendencies or prior serious hemorrhagic events such as hemorrhage within the cranium, eye, spinal cord, retroperitoneum. 15. Has active gross hematuria or gastrointestinal bleeding or a history of these conditions within the past 6 months prior to Screening. 16. Has received concomitant therapy with other anticoagulant, antiplatelet agents, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that cannot be discontinued prior to initiating tecarfarin/warfarin dosing, unless use of such drugs is necessary as part of bridging/transitioning during the first several days of Study Drug administration. Daily use of 81 100 mg aspirin and intermittent or chronic use of the selective COX2 inhibitors is allowed. 17. Has known congenital or acquired coagulation factor inhibitors present which would interfere with the use of the INR (e.g., antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or positive lupus anticoagulant). 18. Has abnormally prolonged prothrombin time, in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation, due to an endogenous inhibitor.</criteria>
