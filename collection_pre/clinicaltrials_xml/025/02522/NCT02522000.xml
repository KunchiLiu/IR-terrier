	<brief_summary>Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a heterogeneous disorder with multifactorial pathophysiology. Patients with FD have visceral hypersensitivity to mechanical and chemical stimuli. Several previous studies have described an increased chemosensitivity to oral capsaicin ingestion. Capsaicin is a natural agonist of TRPV-1 receptors present on afferent sensory neurons. Activation of the TRPV-1 receptor by capsaicin or other agonists results in the release of several neuropeptides (i.e. substance P, somatostatin). Besides, increased duodenal permeability and disruption of tight junction structure in FD patients compared to healthy volunteers has been reported in a recent study. In this observational study investigators will evaluate the role of the TRPV-1 neuropeptide pathway in patients with functional dyspepsia and healthy controls.</brief_summary>
