	<brief_summary>Changes in mood and cognition are common in older adulthood. Some studies have suggested that transcranial application of near-infrared (NIR) light may have enhancing effects on cognitive and mood status in young adults and individuals with traumatic brain injury. This effect has not been examined in older adults. This study will involve a randomized sham-controlled trial to learn whether NIR stimulation improves cognition and mood in older adults, relative to sham treated controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Revitalize Cognition: Near Infrared Stimulation in Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a dearth of clinically meaningful treatment options at this point in time for individuals who are at increased risk for transitioning to dementia, particularly those with the amnestic variant of mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). While waiting for causative cures and preventive approaches, investigators are faced with the task of identifying modifying therapies that might alter the course or slow down the transition from normal cognition to MCI to dementia. The proposed study hopes to contribute to this mission by testing the viability of a different type of intervention, one involving transcranial delivery of near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (808-904nm). Near-infrared stimulation is safe, non-invasive and appears to improve mitochondrial function by promoting increased production of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and possibly improved blood flow. Perhaps most compelling are recent findings of reduced beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles in transgenic Alzheimer's mouse models after exposure to real vs sham transcranial NIR stimulation. Preliminary human involving traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, and young adult populations have also been promising in terms of positive effects of NIR on cognition. The overall goal of the present study is to learn whether this unconventional NIR stimulation approach has potential for improving cognition in older adults. To do so, investigators will conduct a randomized sham controlled pilot trial. The intervention will involve six sessions, over a 2-week period in which real or sham stimulation is transcranially applied using a delivery system that has been FDA-approved as a nonsignificant risk since 2003. Researchers hope to learn whether NIR stimulation, relative to sham, has positive effects on cognition and mood in older adults.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age 65 years or above Able to provide informed consent and perform cognitive and mood measures on a computer Can devote 2 weeks to the intervention, and additional time for pre and post testing. Lives independently with no evidence of dementia, based on a score of at least 20 on a cognitive screening measure, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), or evidence of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) based on score that falls 1.5 standard deviation below the mean on delayed recall from Hopkins Verbal Learning TestRevised (HVLTR) or Logical Memory (Weschler Memory Scale), relative to age, education, gender based norms Willingness to be randomized to Sham or Real intervention 8th grade education and ability to read on 8th grade level based on scores on the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading; or a reading test at 14 pt. text On stable doses of major medications No impairment in social or occupational function Exclusion criteria Sensory loss (vision, hearing) or motor deficits that would preclude participation in the experimental cognitive tasks or neuropsychological assessment Unstable and uncontrolled medical conditions (metabolic encephalopathy, HIV, moderate to severe kidney or liver disease) Previous major strokes or other known significant brain abnormalities or diseases affecting cognition (i.e., Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, seizure disorder, brain surgery, moderate head injury, etc.) Current or past history of major psychiatric disturbance including schizophrenia, or active psychosis, bipolar disorder, current major depressive episode, current alcohol or substance abuse or history thereof within the past six months. This will be assessed using the Mental Health Screen v.3 (Carroll &amp; McGinley), a modification of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical ManualIV (SCIDIV) psychiatric disorders. Investigators are not excluding individuals who are taking antidepressants or antianxiety medications, however, use of antidepressants and anxiolytics will be recorded and data will be analyzed in posthoc analyses Use of antipsychotics, sedatives, or other medications with significant anticholinergic properties (due to potential influence on memory) Use of photosensitive medications such as steroids or retinA within 15 days of the study intervention Diagnosis of cancer Previous participation in a cognitive training study within the last 3 months or current involvement in another study at VITAL or ReVITALIZE, or another study involving cognitive training or intervention at the time of participation</criteria>
