	<brief_title>Accelerated v's Standard BEP Chemotherapy for Patients With Intermediate and Poor-risk Metastatic Germ Cell Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bleomycin, Etoposide, Cisplatin (BEP) administered 3-weekly x 4 remains standard 1st line chemotherapy for intermediate- and poor-risk metastatic germ cell tumours (GCTs). Cure rates are over 90% for good-risk disease, 85% with intermediate-risk, and about 70% for poor-risk disease. Previous strategies to improve first-line chemotherapy have failed to improve cure rates and were more toxic than BEP. New strategies are needed for patients with intermediate and poor-risk disease. BEP is accelerated by cycling Cisplatin and etoposide 2-weekly instead of 3-weekly. The Australian and New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate Cancer Trials Group (ANZUP) is conducting a trial comparing accelerated BEP with standard BEP. The aim of this study is to determine if accelerated BEP is superior to standard BEP as first-line chemotherapy for intermediate and poor risk metastatic GCTs.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male gender 2. Age ≥ 16 years and ≤ 45 years on the date of randomisation 3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed germ cell tumour (nonseminoma or seminoma); or Exceptionally raised tumour markers (AFP ≥ 1000ng/mL and/or HCG ≥ 5000 IU/L) without histologic or cytologic confirmation in the rare case where pattern of metastases consistent with GCT, high tumour burden, and a need to start therapy urgently 4. Primary arising in testis, retroperitoneum, or mediastinum 5. Metastatic disease or mediastinal primary 6. Intermediate or poor prognosis as defined by IGCCC classification3 (modified with different LDH criteria for intermediate risk nonseminoma). (See protocol for more information). 7. Adequate bone marrow function with ANC ≥1.0 x 109/L, Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L 8. Adequate liver function where bilirubin must be ≤1.5 x ULN, except participants with Gilbert's Syndrome where bilirubin must be ≤2.0 x ULN; ALT and AST must be ≤2.5 x ULN, except if the elevations are due to hepatic metastases, in which case ALT and AST must be ≤ 5 x ULN 9. Adequate renal function with estimated creatinine clearance of ≥60 ml/min according to the CockcroftGault formula (see Appendix 5), unless calculated to be &lt; 60 ml/min or borderline in which case GFR should be formally measured, eg. with EDTA scan 10. ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (see Appendix 4) 11. Study treatment both planned and able to start within 14 days of randomisation. 12. Willing and able to comply with all study requirements, including treatment, timing and nature of required assessments 13. Able to provide signed, written informed consent 1. Other primary malignancy (EXCEPT adequately treated nonmelanomatous carcinoma of the skin, germ cell tumour, or other malignancy treated at least 5 years previously with no evidence of recurrence) 2. Previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, except if patient has pure seminoma relapsing after adjuvant radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy with 12 doses of single agent carboplatin or if patient has nonseminoma and poor prognosis by IGCCC criteria in the rare case where lowdose induction chemotherapy is given prior to registration because patient is not fit enough to receive protocol chemotherapy (eg. organ failure, vena cava obstruction, overwhelming burden of disease). In these instances acceptable regimens include cisplatin 20 mg/m2 days 12 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 days 12; carboplatin AUC 3 days 12 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 days 12; or babyBOP.37 Patients must meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria at the time of registration. Additionally participants who need to start therapy urgently prior to completing studyspecific baseline investigations may commence study chemotherapy prior to registration and randomisation. Such patients must be discussed with the coordinating centre prior to registration, and must be registered within 10 days of commencing study chemotherapy. 3. Significant cardiac disease resulting in inability to tolerate IV fluid hydration for cisplatin 4. Significant comorbid respiratory disease that contraindicates the use of bleomycin 5. Peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 2 or clinically significant sensorineural hearing loss or tinnitus 6. Concurrent illness, including severe infection that may jeopardize the ability of the participant to undergo the procedures outlined in this protocol with reasonable safety 7. Inadequate contraception. Men must use 2 effective methods of contraception, including use of a condom, during chemotherapy and for a year after completing chemotherapy. 8. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs 9. Presence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition that in the opinion of the investigator would hamper compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule, including alcohol dependence or drug abuse</criteria>
