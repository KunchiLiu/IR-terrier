	<brief_summary>This study will enroll eligible subjects into a long-term safety study (Part B). Japanese male and female patients with T1DM and age 18 to 75 years, with inadequate glycemic control on insulin defined as HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 10.5% at screening visit. As a condition of enrollment, subjects must be on a total daily insulin dose of ≥ 0.3 U/kg/day for at least 3 months prior to the screening visit. The study design of Part B is a randomized, open-label, 2 arm, parallel-group design. 140 Japanese subjects in total will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of the two treatment arms; dapagliflozin 5 mg or dapagliflozin 10 mg.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed Written Informed Consent Subjects or their legally responsible representatives must be willing and able to give signed and dated written informed consent. Target Population Diagnosis of T1DM. In addition, the following criteria also needs to be met; Central laboratory test of Cpeptide &lt; 0.7 ng/mL Insulin use for at least 12 months prior to the enrolment per subject report or medical records and Method of insulin administration (MDI or CSII) must have been unchanged for at least 3 months prior to the enrolment per subject report or medical records. Subjects must be taking a total daily insulin dose of ≥ 0.3 U/kg/day for at least 3 months prior to the enrolment. If on MDI insulin administration subject must be on ≥ 3x injections per day. Gender and reproductive Status Japanese men and women. HbA1c eligibility criteria include: Screening Visit: Central laboratory HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 10.5% (One repeat HbA1c test for subjects in screening if their initial test result was an HbA1c ± 0.2% of the cut off values) BMI ≥ 20.0 kg/m² at visit 1 Age 18 to 75 years, inclusive ≥ 18 years old and &lt; 20 years old must have assent forms signed and dated by their parents or guardians Target Disease Exceptions History of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) In cases where the subject has a history of T2DM and has a documented history of being autoantibody positive for GAD65, tyrosine phosphatase IA2/IA2β, or Zinc Transporter 8 (ZnT8), or fasting cpeptide value below the lower limit of detection performed by local or central laboratory, the subject will be eligible for screening Maturity onset diabetes of young (MODY) Pancreatic surgery, chronic pancreatitis, or other pancreatic disorders that could result in decreased βcell capacity (eg, pancreatogenous diabetes) Any antihyperglycemic agent use, other than αGI or insulin, within 1 month prior to the enrolment. αGI users at the enrolment or within 1 month prior to the enrolment are permitted to enter this study, if subjects can conduct washout of the drug. Use of thiazolidinediones within 6 months prior to the enrolment History of Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) requiring medical intervention (eg, emergency room visit and/or hospitalization) within 1 month prior to the enrolment History of hospital admission for glycemic control (either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia) within 1 month prior to the enrolment Malignancy within 5 years of the enrolment (with the exception of treated basal cell or treated squamous cell carcinoma) History of bladder cancer History of radiation therapy to the lower abdomen or pelvis at any time Physical and Laboratory Test Findings Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 3x upper limit of normal (ULN) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 3x ULN Serum total bilirubin (TB) &gt; 2.0 mg/dL (34.2 µmol/L) Estimated GFR (eGFR) by the Japanese Society of Nephrology formula ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73m2 Hemoglobin ≤ 11.0 g/dL (110 g/L) for men; hemoglobin ≤ 10.0 g/dL (100 g/L) for women.
