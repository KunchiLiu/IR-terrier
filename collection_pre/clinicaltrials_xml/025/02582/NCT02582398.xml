	<detailed_description>This study aims to assess differences in monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) distribution in the brain between seasonal affective disorder patients and healthy controls using positron emission tomography. In addition, the investigators aim to demonstrate the impact of light therapy on MAO-A distribution by investigating patients and controls in the winter before bright light therapy, in the winter after bright-light therapy, and in the summer. Bright light therapy will be placebo controlled, randomized, and double blinded.</detailed_description>
