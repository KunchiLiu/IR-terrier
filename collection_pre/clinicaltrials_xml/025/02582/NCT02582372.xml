	<brief_summary>Dexmedetomidine, highly selective agonist for alpha-2 receptors, enhances the sensory and motor block with prolonged postoperative analgesia without hemodynamic compromise. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effects of dexmedetomidine vs fentanyl with hyperbaric bupivacaine spinal anesthesia for lower abdominal surgeries. METHODS: double-blind, randomized, American Society Anesthesiologist classification (ASA) : I - II, 18-65 years. F group (23 patients) received 25 mcg fentanyl, Group D (27 patients), 10 mcg dexmedetomidine with 12.5 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine . 0,02mgrs morphine / kg intravenously if EVAâ‰¥4was administered in postoperative period. Hemodynamic variables and O2 saturation intraoperatively was recorded, EVA every 4 hours, side effects, sensory block, motor, sedation and peripheral neurological manifestations of toxicity.</brief_summary>
