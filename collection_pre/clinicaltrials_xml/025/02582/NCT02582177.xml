	<brief_summary>To evaluate the superiority of the ketoconazole20mg/g and betamethasone dipropionate 0.64 mg/g association (Candicort®) cream or ointment versus clotrimazole 10mg and dexamethasone acetate 0.443 mg/g association (Baycuten N®) cream, general relief of signs and symptoms (erythema, maceration, peeling, blistering / papules / pustules, itching and burning / stinging) 06 (± 1) days after onset treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Study of Ketoconazole and Betamethasone to Treat Fungal Infection and Dermatophytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Candicort® presents formulation with agents that act both etiological agent of superficial mycosis, with coverage for dermatophytes and more frequent yeast; as inflammation generated by the infectious process or prior to it, in cases of secondary fungal infection in wet or potentially infected eczema fungal dermatitis (atopic dermatitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, intertrigo, dyshidrosis, contact dermatitis). The active ingredients ketoconazole and betamethasone act, respectively, on the etiologic agent of the infection and the inflammation generated by the process, and the association of both showed a positive therapeutic response in dermatitis with confirmed secondary infections or potential yeast (analysis carried out in association with sulfate neomycin, aimed to cover bacterial infections together). 218 participants that meet all the inclusion criteria and are not classified in any of the exclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups(Candicort® or Baycuten N®) of the study.</detailed_description>
