	<brief_summary>A previous trial performed by our research team, in order to reduce the pain associated with intrauterine device insertion, compared the novel technique of IUD insertion under the guidance of the trans-abdominal sonography to the traditional method of IUD insertion. It came up with the conclusion that the TAS guided IUD insertion is significantly lower in pain score and time taken for insertion, when compared with the traditional method. In this study our researchers aim to abolish the distracting effect of the technician and the TAS probe (which might have interfered with previous results).</brief_summary>
