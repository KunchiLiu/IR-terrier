	<brief_summary>This is a single-institution, phase II study to determine the event-free survival at 1 year post allogeneic transplant and serial mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusions from a related donor (HLA identical, mismatched or haploidentical) or matched unrelated donor for the biochemical correction of severe epidermolysis bullosa (EB).</brief_summary>
