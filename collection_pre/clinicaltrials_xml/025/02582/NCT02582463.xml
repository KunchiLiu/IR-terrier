	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop a prediction-tool, the Medicines Optimisation Assessment Tool (MOAT), to assist hospital pharmacists identify patients at highest risk of preventable medication related problems (MRPs). This has the potential to permit pharmacists to identify and focus on the small number of patients (approximately 6%) who are likely to experience a significant MRP while in hospital.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to develop a prediction-tool, the Medicines Optimisation Assessment Tool (MOAT), to assist hospital pharmacists identify patients at highest risk of preventable medication related problems (MRPs). A prospective cohort study of 2,000 patients will be used to develop the MOAT. Data will be collected on prognostic factors (selected based on a review of published literature and expert opinion) for each patient, together with details of MRPs that occur. All MRPs will be reviewed by an expert panel who will grade for severity and preventability using recognised criteria. Univariate analysis will be used to determine the strength of association between each prognostic factor and the outcome (patients who experience preventable, moderate to severe MRPs), followed by regression analysis to develop the prediction-tool. The objective will be to find the combination of prognostic factors (predictors for the regression calculations) that provide the greatest sensitivity for detecting moderate-severe MRPs (outcomes for the regression calculations) while achieving the maximum possible specificity. In order to make the MOAT simple and quick to apply it is proposed that it will contain as few variables as possible, and be presented in a way that does not require healthcare staff to use computerised or statistical aids. Internal validation will be performed to assess the predictive performance of the MOAT (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). In addition a bootstrapping technique will be used to predict performance in an independent dataset. The intention of this research is to develop a prediction-tool (the MOAT), which has the potential to be adopted widely into clinical practice. If the initial research is successful in producing a prediction-tool with good predictive performance further research will be carried out to assess how feasible it would be to use the MOAT in practice, the potential efficiency savings, and an assessment of clinical risk to patients through use of the MOAT.</detailed_description>
