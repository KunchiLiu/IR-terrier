	<brief_summary>The investigators aim at exploring the differential/topographical in-situ expression of cytokines in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients who died with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), using archived histopathology slides and residual paraffin blocks from autopsied cases. Previous studies from the investigators and other groups showed that inflammatory cytokines are implicated in several neurological affections, particularly neurodegenerative conditions. However, in-situ cytokine expression has never been studied so far in ALS. The investigators wanted to see if these neuro-mediators are involved in the neuromolecular chain/cascade underlying ALS.</brief_summary>
