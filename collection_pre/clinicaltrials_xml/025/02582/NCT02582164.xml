	<brief_summary>Young children age 6 month to 6 years are often not able to cooperate for advanced OCT eye imaging. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of a novel long-working distance swept source (SS) optical coherence tomography imaging system with fixation alignment for use first in young adults, older children, and then young children ages 6 months to 6 years. The investigator's future goal is to obtain important retinal and optic nerve information from OCT in clinic in these young children.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective of this study is to examine the utility of a long-working distance high speed SSOCT system along with technology to identify and use movies, etc. to aid with fixation. This study would be the first testing of such a system, first in adults and then moving to older children who could provide feedback, and then to young children. This imaging data will be compared to other clinical tests and images collected during regular health care and eye examinations.</detailed_description>
