	<brief_summary>The main objective of this project is to assess the effects of a novel and supervised exercise intervention in overweight pregnant and their newborn. Methods/Design: The present study is a Randomized Controlled Trial. Sixty overweight pregnant interested in participate in the intervention program will be randomly assigned to either exercise (3 sessions/week), or to usual care (control) group (30 pregnant per group). The primary outcome measures are maternal weight gain, and maternal and neonatal glycaemic profile. Secondary outcomes measure are: i) body composition; ii) dietary patterns; iii) physical fitness; iv) objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour; v) sleep quality; vi) mental health, quality of life and positive health; vii) haematology and biochemical analysis; viii) oxidative stress; ix) pro- and anti-inflammatory markers; x) bone health biomarkers; xi) adiposity-related proteins expression. The data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol.</brief_summary>
