	<brief_summary>Nail surface abnormalities is any conditions that affect the nail matrix or nail bed which cause nail plates grow defectively. Common nail surface abnormalities are pitting nails, longitudinal ridging, and transverse ridging/Beau's line. Aging nails usually have nail surface abnormalities as well. Nail gels are artificial nails used widely for aesthetic purposes. Although, their cosmetic use is increasing with day by day, their usefulness in conditions such as nail biting, brittle nails, and ingrown toe nails has been reported. Moreover, a previous study reported the benefits of nail gels in terms of improving nail surface abnormalities like pitting nails, trachyonychia, and onychoschizia. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of nail gel containing Glycerin which has humectant effect and Artemisia Abrotanum extract which has anti-fungal/bacterial activities in finger nail surface abnormalities.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evaluation of nail surface abnormality can be done by using VisiometerÂ® (bioengineering measurement) and dermoscope. Both techniques are non-invasive. Artemisia Abrotanum extract has been used as ingredient in cosmetic products and its safety has been declared. Undesirable events from external using products containing this substance have never been reported yet. Nail gel product in this study has been approved as a cosmetic product by Food and Drug Administration of Thailand (Thai FDA).</detailed_description>
