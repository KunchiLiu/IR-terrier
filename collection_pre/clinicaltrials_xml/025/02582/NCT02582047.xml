	<brief_summary>Previous studies have demonstrated the immunogenicity and safety of the co-administration of the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) with the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PPV) or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). However, there is no direct comparison study that evaluates the immunogenicity and safety of IIV3 given concomitantly with PCV13 or PPV23 in the elderly. This study is intended to compare the immunogenicity and safety of concomitant administration in the elderly subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influenza Vaccine and Pneumococcal Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the influenza vaccination period, 224 healthy elderly volunteers randomly received IIV3 given concomitantly with either PCV13 (PCV13+IIV3) or PPV23 (PPV23+IIV3) in a 1:1 ratio. Serum hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibodies for IIV3 were measured at the time of vaccination and 1 month after vaccination. Adverse events were recorded prospectively in a clinical diary during a 7-day period.</detailed_description>
