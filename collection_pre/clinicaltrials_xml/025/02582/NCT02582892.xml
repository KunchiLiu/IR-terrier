	<brief_title>Systemic Vitamin D Supplementation in Dental Implants Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence has demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency plays an important role in dental implants outcomes. Low serum levels of Vitamin D is considered as a risk factor, not only for low mineral bone density but also in other metabolic pathways such as those involved in immune response and chronic inflammatory diseases. There are few studies demonstrating the role that vitamin D deficiency in the etiopathogenesis of oral diseases and the consequences in Dental Implants. Dentists have not yet well understood the importance of a good bone metabolism response for a successful bone regeneration and osseointegration of implants. An insufficient bone response can not guarantee the necessary stability of the implants placed in it, has been one of the biggest problems of implantology. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Systemic vitamin D supplementation in menopausal women cadidates for dental implants.</detailed_description>
