	<brief_summary>This study has two objectives. First, to introduce a new virtual reality method that incorporates the mechanisms used in mirror visual feedback through a three-dimensional (3D) augmented virtual reality system. Second, to evaluate the efficiency of this new method on a convenience sample of patients presenting with unresolved neuropathic pain (CRPS, PLP, plexopathy, stroke) who were not responding adequately to both pharmaceutical management and traditional mirror therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3D Augmented Reality Mirror Visual Feedback Applied to the Treatment of Unilateral Upper Extremity Neuropathic Pain.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each patient receives 5 treatment periods over a total period of 1 week, where each treatment period lasts a total of 20 minutes.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Neuralgia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Neuropathic pain in the unilateral upper extremity scored by DN4 questionnaire At least 3 months symptom duration following injury Minimum pain of 40 on a visual analogue scale (VAS); A drug treatment regimen that was stable for at least 2 weeks. Subjects were allowed to participate if they presented with any of the following: (1) A CRPS diagnosis, in accordance with the International Association for the Study of Pain criteria, Phantom Limb Pain (PLP), or spinal cord injury or plexopathy; and (2) an history of being treated before by conventional mirror therapy but, in their case, the mirror therapy failed. Bilateral injury, Patients with epilepsy Side effects known to 3D (such as nausea, cephalalgia) Cognitive disorder Poor knowledge of the French language.</criteria>
