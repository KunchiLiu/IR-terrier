	<brief_summary>The current clinical guidelines for management of atopic dermatitis now recommend bleach baths. This requires simply the addition of regular household bleach to twice-weekly baths. At the Mayo Clinic, dilute acetic acid (vinegar) has been recommended for decades in wet wraps to treat patients hospitalized for their atopic dermatitis. However, this practice has not been widely adopted in the pediatric dermatology community. Will the use of dilute acetic acid (vinegar) in twice weekly baths help manage atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients as well as, or better than, the current accepted guidelines?</brief_summary>
