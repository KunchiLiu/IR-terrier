	<brief_summary>This randomized, single-blind, 3 arm, parallel group, placebo controlled PK/PD study will enrol 30 Japanese male and female patients with T1DM and age 18 to 65 years, with inadequate glycemic control on insulin defined as HbA1c ≥ 7.0% and ≤ 10.0% at screening visit. lacebo-controlled design. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into one of the 3 single-blinded treatment arms; dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. CSII user are excluded.</brief_summary>

Target Population Diagnosis of T1DM. In addition, the following criteria also needs to be met; Central laboratory test of Cpeptide &lt; 0.7 ng/mL Subject reenrolment: This study does not permit the reenrolment of a subject who has discontinued the study as a screen failure Insulin use for at least 12 months prior to the enrolment per subject report or medical records and Method of insulin administration (MDI) must have been unchanged for at least 3 months prior to the enrolment per subject report or medical records. Subjects must be taking a total daily insulin dose of ≥ 0.3 U/kg/day for at least 3 months prior to the enrolment. CSII users are excluded. MDI insulin administration subject must be on ≥ 3x injections per day. Gender and reproductive Status Japanese men and women. HbA1c eligibility criteria include: Screening Visit: Central laboratory HbA1c ≥ 7.0 % and ≤ 10.0 % (One repeat HbA1c test for subjects in screening if their initial test result was an HbA1c ± 0.2% of the cut off values) BMI ≥ 20.0 kg/m², ≤ 35.0 kg/m² at visit 1 Ages 18 to 65 years, inclusive ≥ 18 years old and &lt; 20 years old must have assent forms signed and dated by their parents or guardians Target Disease Exceptions History of T2DM In cases where the subject has a history of T2DM and has a documented history of being autoantibody positive for GAD65, tyrosine phosphatase IA2/IA2β, or Zinc Transporter 8 (ZnT8), or fasting cpeptide value below the lower limit of detection performed by local or central laborator, the subject will be eligible for screening Maturity onset diabetes of young (MODY), Pancreatic surgery, chronic pancreatitis, or other pancreatic disorders that could result in decreased βcell capacity (eg, pancreatogenous diabetes) Any antihyperglycemic agent use, other than thiazolidinediones, or insulin, within 1 month prior to the screening visit. Use of thiazolidinediones within 6 months prior to the screening visit. History of DKA requiring medical intervention (eg, emergency room visit and/or hospitalization) within 1 month prior to the enrolment History of hospital admission for glycemic control (either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia) within 1 month prior to the enrolment Malignancy within 5 years of the enrolment (with the exception of treated basal cell or treated squamous cell carcinoma) History of bladder cancer History of radiation therapy to the lower abdomen or pelvis at any time Unstable preproliferative and proliferative retinopathy (untreated or under treatment).
