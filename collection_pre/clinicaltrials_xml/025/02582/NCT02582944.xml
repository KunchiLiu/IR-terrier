	<brief_summary>Despite technological advancements directed towards the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions, an optimal approach has yet to be designed. The potential advantages of catheter based techniques include the ability to utilize instruments smaller than the diameter of a conventional bronchoscope, thereby allowing better access to the lung periphery. The drawbacks of a catheter based approach include the relative inability to steer a conventional catheter, and the inability to perform direct visualization and airway inspection through a conventional catheter. This study will evaluate a novel steerable catheter system with optical capabilities and pair this with electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy to biopsy peripheral pulmonary lesions.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with peripheral lung lesions 17cm in size identified on chest CT with the intention to undergo bronchoscopic evaluation and biopsy. The decision to pursue biopsy will be made by the treating physician and agreed upon by the patient. Are at least 18 years old Are able to provide informed consent Patients who refuse to participate Are less than 18 years of age Are pregnant Are physically unable to tolerate flexible bronchoscopy or moderate sedation as determined by the bronchoscopist Are unable to provide informed consent</criteria>
