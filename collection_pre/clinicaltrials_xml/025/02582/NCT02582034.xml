	<brief_title>Internal Radiation Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinomas With Therasphere: Optimized Dosimetry Versus Standard Dosimetry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma, a palliative treatment can be proposed if tumor expansion is limited to the liver. One of palliative treatment is the the Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) with Therasphere®. This treatment is made secure by performing a diagnostic angiogram coupled with a hepatic perfusion scintigraph with which patients at risk of complications are identified and excluded. The treatment objective, with the standard dosimetric approach, is to deliver an absorbed dose of 120 ± 20 Gy to the treated hepatic volume, most often one lobe. Recent retrospective trials show that an optimized dosimetric approach, considering the dose absorbed by the tumor, is technically achievable and would probably make it possible to obtain a better effectiveness. In our experience, treatment personalisation have been described to be used for 60% of the patients with a tumor larger than 7 cm underlying the clinical impact of this new approach.</detailed_description>
