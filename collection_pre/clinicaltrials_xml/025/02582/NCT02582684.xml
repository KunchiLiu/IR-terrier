	<brief_summary>This study is being done to see if the combination of two anti-HIV medicines, dolutegravir (DTG, Tivicay) and lamivudine (3TC, Epivir) taken once a day, will provide a safe, effective, and well-tolerated treatment for HIV. DTG is a type of HIV medicine called an integrase inhibitor; 3TC is a type of HIV medicine called a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. DTG works by blocking integrase and 3TC works by blocking reverse transcriptase, two HIV proteins (enzymes). This prevents HIV from multiplying and lowers the viral load (amount of HIV in the blood). Both DTG and 3TC are currently part of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended regimens along with a third active drug. Since some HIV medicines have side effects and are costly, there is interest in whether HIV can be successfully controlled with fewer than three HIV drugs.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIV1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV1 antigen, plasma HIV1 RNA viral load. NOTE: The term "licensed" refers to a US FDAapproved kit, which is required for all IND studies. WHO and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV1 RNA viral load. Plasma HIV1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL and &lt;500,000 copies/mL obtained within 90 days prior to study entry using any FDAapproved assay by any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent. No evidence of any RT, any integrase, or major protease resistance mutation (according to the 2014 IASUSA drug resistance mutations list, available at https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/223642.pdf) based on preARV treatment genotype performed any time prior to study entry. NOTE: Integrase genotyping must be performed at screening and is provided by the study. RT and PR genotyping should be performed at screening as part of routine clinical care if not previously performed. ARV treatment drugnaive (defined as no previous ARV treatment at any time prior to study entry, with the exception of successful postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) or preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). NOTE: Participants who were diagnosed with HIV while on PrEP or within a year of PrEP (unless documented seronegative in the interim) are not eligible. The following laboratory values obtained within 45 days prior to study entry by any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent: ANC ≥750/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥10.0 g/dL Platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3 Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥50 mL/min, as estimated by the CockcroftGault equation AST &lt;5 x ULN (upper limit of normal) ALT &lt;5x ULN Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 x ULN Hepatitis B surface antigen negative within 45 days prior to study entry performed by a CLIAcertified laboratory. For women with reproductive potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening and within 48 hours prior to study entry (by any US clinic or laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or is using a point of care (POC)/CLIAwaived test). Reproductive potential is defined as women who have not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 24 months, or have not undergone surgical sterilization (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, salpingectomy, tubal ligation or tubal microinserts). The urine test must have a sensitivity of ≤50 mIU/mL. NOTE: Women who report 12 months of amenorrhea and have a folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) level in the menopausal range should be considered as NOT having reproductive potential. If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, female participants with reproductive potential must use one form of contraceptive as listed below while receiving protocolspecified medications and for 30 days after stopping the medications. At least one of the following methods must be used appropriately: 1. Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent. Condoms are recommended because their appropriate use is the only contraception method effective for preventing HIV transmission. NOTE: In the setting of condom failure, emergency contraception (plan B) is an appropriate backup method of contraception. 2. Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide. 3. Intrauterine device. 4. Hormonebased contraceptive. Ability and willingness of participant or legal representative to provide informed consent. Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization NOTE: Participant is eligible if the participant completes therapy 7 days prior to study entry or is clinically stable on therapy in the opinion of the site investigator for 7 days prior to study entry. NOTE: Participants with oral candidiasis, vaginal candidiasis, mucocutaneous herpes simplex, and other minor illnesses (as judged by the site investigator) are eligible. Treatment within 30 days prior to study entry with immune modulators such as systemic steroids, interleukins, interferons, granulocyte colonystimulating factor (GCSF), erythropoietin, or any investigational therapy. NOTE: Participants receiving stable physiologic glucocorticoid doses (defined as prednisone ≤15 mg/day or equivalent as a stable or tapering dose) are eligible. Participants receiving corticosteroids for acute therapy for PCP or asthma exacerbation, or receiving a short course (defined as ≤2 weeks of pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy) are eligible. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. The following are prohibited while the participant is on study drugs: Systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy NOTE: Topical 5FU and treatments for human papilloma virus disease are allowed. Dofetilide is prohibited with DTG as DTG may inhibit its renal tubular secretion resulting in increased dofetilide concentrations and potential for toxicity. There are no prohibited medications with 3TC Known allergy/sensitivity to any of the study drugs or their formulations. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that may interfere with adherence to study requirements, in the opinion of the site investigator. Active hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment or anticipated need for treatment within study period. NOTE: HCV infection alone is not exclusionary. Unstable liver disease (as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices, or persistent jaundice), known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). Severe hepatic impairment (Class C) as determined by ChildPugh classification.</criteria>
