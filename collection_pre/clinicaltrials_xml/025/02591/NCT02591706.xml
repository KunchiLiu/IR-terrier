	<brief_summary>Primary Endpoints : The implant survival and success rate of V3 and C1 implants will be compared. Implant success rate will be evaluated by measuring the peri-implant bone remodeling from baseline to 1 year post insertion. The hypothesis is those implant survival rates of the test (V3) and control group (C1) are similar and that test V3 implant allows less peri-implant bone loss. Secondary Endpoints : The thickness of hard tissue in the buccal aspect of the V3 and C1 implants will be compared. The bone thickness will be measured in cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT) on the day of implantation, 4 and at one year after the final restoration. The hypothesis is that V3 implant allows thicker bone dimension in the cervical area.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject must have voluntarily signed the informed consent form before any study related action Age: 18 with one or more missing teeth in the maxillary area, seeking for implant therapy. Men/Women In good systemic health (ASA I/ II) Present with no contra indication against oral surgical interventions Patients required replacement of a single missing tooth. The tooth at the implant site(s) must have been extracted or lost at least 12 weeks before the date of implantation. At least 10 mm of bone in the vertical dimension At least 6 mm of bone in the buccolingual dimension. No need for bone augmentation procedure in any of the dimensions Full mouth plaque score (FMPI) lower or equal than 25% Autoimmune disease require medical treatment Medical conditions requiring prolonged use of steroids Use of Bisphosphonate intravenously or more then Infection (local or systemic) patient with gingivitis or active local infection will undergo a medical treatment prior to his entrance to the study, each individual will be evaluated prior to study procedure for suitability, in case of systemic infection the evaluation will be based on medical anamneses, and if necessary will be referred to relevant medical tests.
