	<brief_summary>Platelet rich plasma (PRP) therapy is a novel therapeutic modality that has seen broad applications for a number of medical indications including those in orthopedics, dentistry, and dermatology. In dermatology, its uses have included treatment of chronic wounds and facial rejuvenation. More recently, anecdotal reports have suggested some efficacy in the treatment of hair loss, but to the best of our knowledge, there has been only one published case series documenting its use for this indication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate the Clinical Effectiveness of RegenKit Platelet-rich Plasma (PRP) in Androgenetic Alopecia Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was designed to better assess the efficacy of PRP in hair loss, we therefore propose to study interval intralesional PRP injections for patients with androgenetic alopecia (AGA). Androgenetic alopecia is the most common form of hair loss world-wide. Although there are currently numerous treatment options for this indication including minoxidil, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and follicular unit transplant, many of the medical treatment options have undesirable side effects, particularly in women of child bearing age. These well-documented adverse reactions include impotency, hypertrichosis, and birth defects.</detailed_description>
