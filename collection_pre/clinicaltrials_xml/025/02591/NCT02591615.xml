	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter randomized phase II to determine if the administration of standard platinum-based chemotherapy before MK-3475 in with Chemotherapy naive stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) will improve the overall response rate (ORR) compared to MK-3475 administered before chemotherapy. Patients will be given Pembrolizumab as maintenance up to 1 year: Carboplatin and paclitaxel or pemetrexed every 3 weeks x 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to 1 year. Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks x 4 cycles followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel or pemetrexed every 3 weeks x 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to 1 year.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While a genotype-directed strategy has been established as effective in treatment selection for patients with advanced NSCLC, only a minority of patients at this time will have a readily identifiable actionable molecular target. Furthermore, genotype-directed therapy has not been validated for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Therefore, the majority of patients with advanced NSCLC will continue to rely on standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Given the plateau in effectiveness of this approach, novel treatment strategies are clearly warranted.</detailed_description>
