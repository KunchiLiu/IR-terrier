	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, prospective controlled trial in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, specifically on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, comparing level of administered oxygen and partial pressure of arterial oxygen in the operating room and its impact on a widely-used and validated neurocognitive score, the telephonic Montreal Cognitive Assessment (t-MoCA), throughout the hospital stay and at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 postoperatively. It is hypothesized that cardiac surgical patients who undergo normoxic conditions throughout the intraoperative period will have better neurocognitive function than those with maintenance of hyperoxia.</brief_summary>
