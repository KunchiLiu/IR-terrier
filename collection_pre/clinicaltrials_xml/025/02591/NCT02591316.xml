	<brief_title>Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Cognition in Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study will examine the potential relationships between physical activity, dietary intake, body composition and cognition in breast cancer cancer survivors and age-matched women without a previous cancer diagnosis. Additionally, we will measure blood inflammatory markers to explore the relationship between lifestyle factors and inflammation. The study involves two, 1hr appointments at Texas State University. The first visit will include cognitive testing and body composition assessment. Participants will be given an activity monitor to wear for one week and a packet of questionnaires to complete at home. At the second visit, a fasted blood sample will be collected, and participants will complete a food frequency questionnaire.</detailed_description>
