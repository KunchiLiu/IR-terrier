	<brief_summary>Insomnia is characterized by rumination and worry over stressful events affecting nighttime sleep. Emotional reactions while stressful events are ongoing have not often been investigated in insomnia. In the current study stress reactions will be measured during a real-life simulation experiment with stressful events and investigate not only how previous sleep patterns affect emotional reactivity to the event but also how the emotional events affect sleep patterns the following night. Thirty-six female subjects (age 25-45 years) without sleep complaints (n=18) or with insomnia (n=18) will enroll in a interventional study measuring the reaction to and effects of either neutral or stressful events during driving. Through questionaires and intake polysomnography, clinical levels of depression and anxiety will be excluded as well as sleep medication use and alternative sleep disorders than insomnia. Stress levels will be measured through skin conductance and heart rate variability during events and through nighttime polysomnography (PSG). Effects on sleep architecture and arousal levels will be measured through nighttime PSG. Investigators hypothesize that subjects with insomnia, compared to subjects without sleep complaints, show stronger emotional reactions to stressful events and stronger effects of stress on sleep quality the following night. Results will facilitate a model for emotional reactivity in chronic sleep disruption which may aid to prevent short term sleep disruption converting into chronic insomnia and aid in developing customized insomnia treatment.</brief_summary>
