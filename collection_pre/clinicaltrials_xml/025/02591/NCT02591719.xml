	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the safety and clinical efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) based on hemodynamic brain activity pattern with functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in early poststroke nonfluent aphasia patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of rTMS Based on Hemodynamic Activity for Language Recovery in Early Poststroke Aphasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most conventional rTMS studies employed an inhibitory low frequency protocol for the contralesional homologs of Broca's area. In the present randomized controlled trial, investigators will perform fNIRS prior to rTMS treatment to select the stimulation method. Stimulation site (perilesional or contralesional) and frequency (excitatory high or inhibitory low) will be determined by activation pattern from the fNIRS with language task in individual patients. The patient who shows a dominant neural activity at perilesional Broca's area on fNIRS scanning will be randomly allocated into two groups: high frequency stimulation group and sham stimulation group. If a patient shows a dominant neural activity at contralesional homologs of Broca's area on fNIRS scanning, the patient will be allocated to a low frequency stimulation group.</detailed_description>
