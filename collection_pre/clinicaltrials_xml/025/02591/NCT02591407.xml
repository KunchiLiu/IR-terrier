	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Transversus Abdominis Plane Block Versus Epidural Anesthesia for Pain Management in Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adequate peri-operative analgesia is a vital component of post-operative management for patients undergoing colon and rectal surgery, affecting hospital length of stay, quality of life, and patient outcomes. There are many options for the peri-operative management of pain after elective colorectal surgery. This is a randomized clinical trial comparing the transversus abdominis plane block using ExparelÂ® to epidural anesthesia for the enhanced recovery pathway perioperative management of pain for elective colorectal surgery.</detailed_description>
