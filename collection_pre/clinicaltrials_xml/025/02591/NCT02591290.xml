	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to collect further information regarding an increase immune response of SP284 after an additional dose in Japanese subjects. Primary Objective: - To evaluate and describe the immune responses to meningococcal antigens (serogroups A,C, Y and W-135) at 28 days following each vaccination with SP284 vaccine in subjects 20 through 55 years of age. Other Pre-specified objective: - To describe the safety in terms of immediate systemic adverse events, solicited reactions, unsolicited non-serious adverse events, and serious adverse events (SAEs) following receipt of each dose of SP284 vaccine in persons 20 through 55 years of age.</brief_summary>
