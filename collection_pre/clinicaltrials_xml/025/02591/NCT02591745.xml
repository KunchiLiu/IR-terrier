	<brief_title>International Fetal Anesthesia Database</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advances in technology have allowed for an increase in procedures performed on the fetus in utero; these procedures involve the administration of different anesthetics (sedative- hypnotic agents and or volatile agents) to the mother and sometimes directly to the fetus in order for succesful completion of the procedure. Very few instiututions in the world perform these procedures in any significant number. The establishment of this database will serve to consolidate information regarding anesthetic drugs administered for these procedures, thereby helping to establish best practice guidelines, determine medium and short term outcomes or complications and also facilitate long term neurodevelopmental assessment of children that have undergone these procedures in utero with 5 and 10 year neurodevelopmental assessment.</detailed_description>
