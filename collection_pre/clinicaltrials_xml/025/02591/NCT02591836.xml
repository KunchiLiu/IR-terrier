	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) efficacy and dose‐response of gemcabene 300, 600 and 900 mg/day administered as monotherapy or in combination with atorvastatin 10, 40, and 80 mg/day to hypercholesterolemic patients. Secondary purposes include evaluating the effects of high‐sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C), triglycerides (TG) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and safety and efficacy of gemcabene monotherapy and gemcabene/atorvastatin combination.</brief_summary>
