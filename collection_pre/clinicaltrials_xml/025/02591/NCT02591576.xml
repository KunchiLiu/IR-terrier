	<brief_summary>Diabetes is key risk factor for death following acute myocardial infarction. However, the long-term excess risk of death associated with diabetes following acute myocardial infarction not known. Investigators aimed to determine the long-term excess risk of death associated with diabetes among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI) after adjustment for multimorbidity, risk factors and cardiac treatments.</brief_summary>
