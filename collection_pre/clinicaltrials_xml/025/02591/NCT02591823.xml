	<brief_summary>Low dose methotrexate used in rheumatoid arthritis is considered very safe and has a side effect profile very different from that seen with high dose methotrexate used in oncology. Hair fall has been found to occur in high dose methotrexate but there is no data regarding the same when methotrexate is used in low dose.Thus this observational case control study is being undertaken to determine whether rheumatoid arthritis patients really need to be concerned about hair fall when on low dose methotrexate.</brief_summary>
