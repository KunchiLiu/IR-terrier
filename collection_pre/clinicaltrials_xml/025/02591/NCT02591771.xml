	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of i.v. adrenaline infusion as an early and fast haemodynamic stabilizer, associated with a tight tissue perfusion monitoring, in the context of a stepwise progression in the treatment of cardiogenic shock, including ventricular mechanical support.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Multistep Pharmacological and Invasive Management for Cardiogenic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiogenic shock is characterized by a decrease in cardiac output and increased ventricular pressures, with subsequent symptoms and signs of systemic hypoperfusion. In spite of the multiple pharmacological chances the in-hospital mortality rate is still very high (around 60% of patients) and nowadays there is not a therapeutic "reference standard" associated with an improved survival at short and midterm. Adrenaline is a mainstay of resuscitation therapy during cardiopulmonary arrest, however, it is not clear whether this inotrope actually facilitates an improvement in patients affected by cardiogenic shock. In a small local evidence-based experience, contrary to current opinion, it has been shown that adrenaline may still have a role in the treatment of patients with low output state. This phase II study tests the hypothesis that adrenaline infusion, integrated in a multistep approach at increasing intensity, can be a valid support with limited side effects.</detailed_description>
