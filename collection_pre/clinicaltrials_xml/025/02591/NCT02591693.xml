	<brief_title>Individualised Informal Caregiver Training for Palliative Care at Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many patients with terminal illnesses rely on friends and family for much of their practical day to day care. These friends and family members often lack the skills and confidence to carry out these tasks and studies have shown that many would want more support. Studies have also shown that many patients feel they are a burden. This study involves carers receiving training to learn the skills they need to care for their loved one. Adult patients with terminal illnesses, currently receiving care from a specified hospice in the South East of England, who have a friend or family member caring for them at home are eligible to be referred for this study. The training of the carer will be carried out over three sessions by an Occupational Therapist in the patient's own home.The training will focus on goals that the patient and carer have chosen together. The carer will be asked to complete before and after questionnaires and some will be asked to take part in interviews to see how they felt about the study. The potential benefits of this study are to increase carer confidence in caring for their loved one. The overall aim of this study is to test out the research method to see if patients and carers find this training and the outcome measures acceptable. If they do then the investigators plan to learn from this study to design a larger randomised control trial which would be the best way of knowing for sure whether and in what ways this training is helpful.</detailed_description>
