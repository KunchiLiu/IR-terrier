	<brief_title>Safety and Virologic Effect of a Human Monoclonal Antibody (VRC01) Administered Intravenously to Adults During Early Acute HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) may have the potential to treat HIV infection by preventing the spread of the virus. This study will evaluate an experimental mAB known as VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and virologic effect of VRC01, alone or in combination with ART, in adults with early acute HIV infection. Researchers will also evaluate the effect of VRC01 on the establishment of an HIV reservoir during early acute HIV infection. This study will enroll participants from the RV 217 study who are diagnosed with early acute HIV infection. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 will begin ART and receive a single infusion of placebo at Day 0. Group 2 will begin ART and receive a single infusion of VRC01 at Day 0. Group 3 will receive a single infusion of VRC01 on Day 0 and begin ART on Day 7. ART will vary by country and will consist of country guideline-recommended first line combination therapy: either efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg or efavirenz 600 mg/lamivudine 300 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg. This initial ART regimen may be adjusted or switched to an alternate regimen as clinically indicated for regimen intolerance or failure. Study visits will occur at Days 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 18, 21, 25, 28, 42, 56, 84, 112, 168, and 175. Visits will include a physical examination, medical history review, and blood collection. Neurocognitive testing will take place on Day 168. Some participants may take part in optional study procedures at various time points during the study including mucosal secretion collection, rectosigmoid biopsy, lymph node biopsy, leukapheresis, and lumbar puncture.</detailed_description>
