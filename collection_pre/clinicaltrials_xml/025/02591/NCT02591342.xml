	<brief_summary>Postoperative periprosthetic femoral fracture after hip arthroplasty is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Recent cohort studies have demonstrated a high incidence of PPF in elderly patients treated with two commonly used polished, tapered, collarless stems in elderly patients. The aim of this study was to compare the rate and characteristics of PPF in a consecutive cohort of patients treated either the polished tapered CTP stem or the matte anatomic SP2 stem in an elderly population above 80 years of age with femoral neck fracture.</brief_summary>
