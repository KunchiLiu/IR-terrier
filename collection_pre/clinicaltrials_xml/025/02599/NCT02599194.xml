	<brief_summary>The goal of this Phase II clinical trial is to further evaluate the ability of 18F-FSPG to diagnose, prognosticate, and evaluate response to therapy in patients with a wide variety of metastatic cancers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18F-FSPG PET/CT for Cancer Patients on Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: Correlate the uptake of 18F-FSPG in patients with biopsy proven cancer, before and during therapy, to evaluate the ability of 18F-FSPG to identify and assess response to therapy, correlating to patient outcomes. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Comparison of 18F-FSPG accumulation with other available imaging such as PET/CT (including but not limited to 18F-FDG, MRI, and diagnostic CT. II. Safety and tolerability of 18F-FSPG. OUTLINE: Patients receive 18F-FSPG and 60 minutes after injection, undergo 18F-FSPG PET/CT once before and again once after the start of therapy.</detailed_description>
