	<brief_summary>- Multifactorial pathogenesis is involved in anemia of cancer patients and defining the causes of anemia is not always simple. - Currently, treatment options available for anemia in cancer patients include red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, erythropoietin stimulating agent (ESA), and iron supplementation, accompanying considerable pros and cons for each treatment. - Previous studies have demonstrated benefit when treating with IV iron in combination with ESA and, more recently, evidence is emerging to suggest a role for IV iron alone. - In this study, investigator will assess the efficacy of intravenous iron for the treatment of anemia in cancer patients.</brief_summary>
