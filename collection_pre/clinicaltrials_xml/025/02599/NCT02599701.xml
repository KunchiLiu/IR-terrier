	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of gabapentin in sleep polysomnography parameters and in nocturnal secretion of endogenous hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA), hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) and somatotropic axes hormones and basal IGF-1 in older men.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Effects of Gabapentin in Sleep Parameters and Hormonal Release During Sleep in Older Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The influence of sleep variables on muscle protein anabolism is little studied, but data on the effects of slow-wave sleep and the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis indicate that interventions in the sleep structure and disorders impact on the age-related muscle loss. Thus, we propose to assess the acute effects of a drug potentially capable of increasing slow wave sleep, and consequently growth hormone release during sleep, on the physiological release of growth hormone, testosterone and IGF-1 during the night in older healthy men.</detailed_description>
