	<brief_summary>This study is designed to test bioequivalence of a assumed key active compound vs. natural fruit extract as judged from the Incremental area under the curve (+iAUC0-2h) for blood glucose: i.e. the 90% confidence interval of the ratio +iAUC0-2h for blood glucose for assumed key active compound vs. natural extract falls between 0.8 - 1.25.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The basic study design for this Williams design consists of six distinct treatment sequences; within each of the treatment sequences the treatments are duplicated.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 25.0 kg/m2. Apparently healthy males and females: no medical conditions which might affect the study measurements, absorption, metabolism and distribution (including diabetes type 1 and type 2, gastrointestinal dysfunction, gastrointestinal surgery [with exception of cholecystectomy and appendectomy] and inflammatory diseases). Fasting blood glucose value of subjects is ≥ 3.4 and &lt;6.1 mmol/litre (i.e. 62 110 mg/dl) at screening. Use of antibiotics within 3 months before day 1; use of any other medication within 14 days before day 1 except for both paracetamol and hormonal contraception.</criteria>
