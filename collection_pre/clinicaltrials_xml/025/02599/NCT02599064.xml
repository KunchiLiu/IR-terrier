	<brief_title>Evaluating RXI-109 to Reduce the Progression of Subretinal Fibrosis in Subjects With NVAMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple doses of RXI-109 when administered by intravitreal injection. Evaluate the clinical activity of single and multiple doses of RXI-109 when administered by intravitreal injection. Study participation is intended to be seven months from time of initial treatment with RXI-109.</detailed_description>
