	<brief_summary>Sepsis is the most common cause of childhood death worldwide. Millions of children survive, but are left with impaired health. Sepsis-related Acute Kidney Injury (sAKI) is increasingly recognized as a significant factor associated with long-term mortality among different patient populations. Renal dysfunction and subsequent chronic kidney disease is implicated in the development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The investigators overall hypothesis is that, in the pediatric population, sepsis-related AKI will have unrecognized, long-term consequences with regard to kidney function, endothelial function, blood pressure control, and overall health.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This will be a two-arm cross-sectional control-cohort outpatient evaluation. Subjects with sAKI and a random selection of non-sAKI subjects who agree to participate in another study of quality of life survey will be asked to participate in the outpatient study. Subjects will be asked to come in to the Clinical Research Center for 24-hour monitoring and participate in the outpatient study where urinary and serum studies to measure glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow followed by blood pressure monitoring, peripheral arterial and applanation tonometry.</detailed_description>
