	<brief_title>Transobturator Verus Single Incision Slings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transobturator slings are one type of sling that has become standard treatment for stress urinary incontinence. However, this procedure involves a total of 3 incisions to perform. In contrast, single incision slings have been developed to treat stress urinary incontinence by using only one incision. However, to date the success and complications of these two procedures have not been compared or studied.</detailed_description>
