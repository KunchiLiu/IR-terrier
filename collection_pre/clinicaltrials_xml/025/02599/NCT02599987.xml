	<brief_summary>Background: Patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis may have reduced diffusion capacity, lung function and gas exchange due to mechanical and hemodynamic changes in the respiratory system, and decreased respiratory muscle strength resulting from uremic myopathy. The inspiratory muscle training (IMT) appears as an instrument to improve the inspiratory muscle strength, with positive effects on functional capacity and quality of life of kidney patients, however, the effects of IMT were not addressed in the specific variables of the respiratory system and to date there are no studies on the use of daily training in this population. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of daily inspiratory muscle training on respiratory muscle strength, chest wall volume, diaphragm thickness and mobility of end-stage renal disease patients. Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial to be developed in Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy Laboratory of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE) during the period from November 2015 to December 2016. The sample is composed of 24 individuals aged 18 and 65, having CKD, to perform hemodialysis for at least twelve months and provide inspiratory muscle weakness. Patients will be divided into two groups, the training group will be IMT with POWER-breatheÂ®, load of 50% of MIP, duration of three sets of 30 inspirations, frequency of two sessions per day, 7 days a week for 8 weeks, since the sham group will be subjected to the same procedure (duration and frequency), but without load. Participants will be assessed before and after intervention through a global assessment form, questionnaire Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument Short Form - KDQOL-SF, diaphragmatic ultrasound, opto-electronic plethysmography, spirometry, manometer and six-minute walk test.</brief_summary>
