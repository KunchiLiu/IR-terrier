To asses the incidence of neuropathic type pain (DN4 Questionnaire) at 3 months post intervention. C. To study the potential links between pain trajectories and the presence or absence of PSCP. D. To study the potential links between the presence or absence of PSCP and known risk factors for PSCP (patient-related data, data on the surgery, anesthesia data).</detailed_description>
