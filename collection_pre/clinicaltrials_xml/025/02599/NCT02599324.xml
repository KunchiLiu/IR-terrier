	<criteria>RCC (clear cell), urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell), gastric or gastroesophageal junctional (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, or KRAS or NRAS wildtype EGFR expressing CRC For RCC: previously received at least 1 but no more than 4 lines of therapy, one therapy must have included a VEGF TKI ECOG performance status of 01 (score of 2 may be acceptable) For urothelial carcinoma: previously received at least 1 but no more than 2 lines of therapy, one therapy must have included a platinum based regimen ECOG performance status of 01 For gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma: previously received at least 1 but no more than 3 lines of therapy, one therapy must have included a fluoropyrimidine based regimen ECOG performance status of 01 For CRC: previously received at least 2 but no more than 4 lines of therapy, which must have included both an irinotecan and an oxaliplatin based regimen ECOG performance status of 01 (score of 2 may be acceptable) For all cohorts: Adequate hematologic function: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1500 cells/mm3 For RCC, platelet count ≥80,000 cells/mm3 For urothelial carcinoma, gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, and CRC, platelet count ≥100,000 cells/mm3 For RCC, urothelial carcinoma, and gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL For CRC, hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL Adequate hepatic and renal function defined as: AST and/or ALT ≤5.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) if liver metastases, or ≤3 x ULN without liver metastases Alkaline phosphatase &lt;3.0 x ULN or ≤5.0 x ULN if liver or bone metastases present Bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN (unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert's syndrome or of nonhepatic origin, such as hemolysis) Estimated Creatinine Clearance ≥30 mL/min For RCC, prior treatment with everolimus or temsirolimus For urothelial carcinoma, prior treatment with any taxane For gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, prior treatment with any taxane For CRC, prior treatment with cetuximab or panitumumab For all cohorts: concomitant use of warfarin or other Vitamin K antagonists history of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to enrollment major surgery within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug requires treatment with strong CYP3A inhibitors known bleeding disorders or hemophilia</criteria>
