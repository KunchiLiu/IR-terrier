Positive pregnancy test at screening. 6. Any reason which, in the opinion of the Qualified Investigator, would prevent the subject from participating in the study. 7. Clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (QTc &gt;450) or vital sign abnormalities (systolic blood pressure lower than 90 or over 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure lower than 50 or over 90 mmHg, or heart rate less than 50 or over 100 bpm) at screening. 8. History of significant alcohol abuse within one year prior to screening or regular use of alcohol within six months prior to the screening visit (more than fourteen units of alcohol per week [1 unit = 150 mL of wine, 360 mL of beer, or 45 mL of 40% alcohol]). 9.
