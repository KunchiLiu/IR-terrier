	<brief_summary>The nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia, and patients with nephrotic syndrome are known to be hypercoaguable with increased incidence of venous thromboembolism necessitating anticoagulation. While classically warfarin has been used as an anticoagulant in NS, newer oral anticoagulants, such as apixaban, are increasingly used to treat venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the general population. It is unknown how hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of apixaban. This study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of apixaban in nephrotic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Apixaban in Nephrotic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a parallel arm, single-dose pilot study of the pharmacokinetics of apixaban in adults with nephrotic syndrome. Goal enrollment of twenty subjects with non-diabetic nephropathy and albumin ≤ 2.8 g/dl and ten healthy control subjects without nephrotic syndrome. Each subject will be administered a single dose of apixaban 10 mg. Plasma drug concentration level and plasma anti-Xa activity levels will be measured at 3, 6, and 24 hours after drug administration in order to determine the maximum plasma concentration of apixaban, area under the curve, and half-life of apixaban in the setting of hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria due to nephrotic syndrome. Apixaban levels will be measured via liquid-chromatography spectrometry mass. Additionally, thrombin generation will be measured at 0, 3, 6, and 24 hours.</detailed_description>
