	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized trial will evaluate whether providing clinicians with daily reports from a well-validated, standardized, patient-centered electronic symptom survey tool (PRO-CTCAE) improves symptom burden in patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy. Adult inpatients at UNC undergoing high-dose chemotherapy for preparative chemotherapy prior to stem cell infusion. Participants will be randomized into one of two arms: (1) a control arm with standard of care daily clinician interviews or (2) standard of care plus daily electronic symptom surveys, the results of which will be sent to clinicians electronically.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Ability of Electronic Patient Symptom Reporting to Reduce Symptom Burden During Hospitalization for Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is to compare peak symptom burden between the two study arms (autologous transplant vs. allogeneic transplant). Peak symptom burden will also be compared between the two study arms within both subgroups of patients (myeloablative vs. reduced intensity conditioning). Secondary outcomes that will also be compared between the two arms include: changes in patient-reported quality of life, time to supportive care treatment changes, length of hospital stay, thirty day readmission rate after discharge, days alive and out of the hospital in the 100 days since admission, and overall survival. Additionally, measures of physical activity will be captured through physiological monitoring in order to explore associations with patient-reported symptom measures. Patient and clinician satisfaction will also be evaluated. In this study, the investigators will use an electronic survey to assess 16 patient-reported symptoms to calculate a symptom score that may range from 0-61 each day. This symptom score represents the symptom burden for the patient on that particular day. Symptom burden is anticipated to peak between days 7 and 14, so the investigators will define peak symptom burden as the average of the symptom scores on days 7, 10 and 14. In both arms, symptoms will be assessed on these days in order to compare peak burden.</detailed_description>
