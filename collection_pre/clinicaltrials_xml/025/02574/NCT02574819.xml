	<brief_title>Study of Methylnaltrexone in Opioid-Induced Constipation Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methylnaltrexone is a quaternary derivative of the pure opioid antagonists naltrexone. It is fairly lipid soluble and readily cross the blood-brain barrier. This property provides methylnaltrexone with the potential to block the undesired side-effects of opioid pain medications predominantly mediated by receptors located peripherally while sparing opioid effects mediated at receptors in the central nervous system, most importantly analgesia. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind , placebo-controlled trail to investigate the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous methylnaltrexone for treating opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness. The randomization schedule was used to assign patients in a 2:1 ratio to multicenter or an equal volume of placebo administered subcutaneously on alternate days for 2 weeks. The clinical trail was estimated to enroll 180 patients totally.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A life expectancy of 3 month or more Qualifying patients received opioids for analgesia for 1 week or more and a stable regimen of opioids and laxatives for 3 or more days before study entry Patients had opioidinduced constipation with either fewer than three laxation during the preceding week and no clinically meaningful laxation (as determined by the in investigator ) within 24h before the first study dose or no clinically meaningful laxation within 48h before the first study dose During the twoweek trail , patients would keep their life habits (dietary fiber , fluid intake and physical activity) Patients volunteered for the trail Women of childbearing potential had negative pregnancy tests. Both male and female patients need to take effective contraceptives to avoid pregnancy. Constipation that was not primarily caused by opioids ( as determined by the investigator) Mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction, an indwelling peritoneal catheter, clinically active diverticular disease , fecal impaction , acute surgical abdomen , and fecal ostomy Patients had the surgery plan which would effect the results of pain assessment Patients had hypersensitivity to methylnaltrexone , naltrexone or naloxone or if any investigational drug or experimental product</criteria>
