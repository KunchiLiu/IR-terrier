	<brief_summary>The stage and lymphedema size can be detrimental to the quality of life and health of women, because the increase in circumference and member of the weight causes limitations in activities. Previous studies have shown that patients with lymphedema should not perform high intensity exercises, these exercises would cause the increase of lymphedema. Already, in current studies show that muscle strength exercises when properly applied, with controlled intensity and time, can help to reduce lymphedema. Thus, the main objective of this study is to compare the standard treatment of lymphedema through complex physical therapy versus the application of strengthening exercises for upper limbs together with complex physical therapy. The study design is a randomized controlled clinical trial. Participate in the study 50 patients, who will be allocated into two groups, group 1 (n = 25): Complex Physical Therapy; Group 2 (n = 25): Complex physical therapy in an exercise protocol, which will receive treatment twice a week for eight weeks. All patients will receive treatment and will be informed of the free and informed consent form at the beginning of the research. They will be met: the report cards, dynamometer testing and filling out questionnaires at the beginning and end of the study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in Onco Mastology clinic of the Department of Mastology the Department of Gynecology, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) - Paulista School of Medicine (EPM), in which patients will be recruited, selected and informed about the study objectives , its relevance, activities to be developed and the possibility of improvement and remedy your questions and concerns about the disease.The study design is a randomized controlled clinical trial. To define the treatment, 50 patients are allocated to two groups, group 1 (n = 25) Group 2 (n = 25) that receive treatment twice a week for eight weeks. Physical examination will be performed, completing the consent form, evaluation form, and questionnaires. Group 1 standard treatment : 25 women with lymphedema , perform complex physical therapy with manual lymphatic drainage, compression bandaging and exercises linfomiocinéticos . Treatment was given twice a week , 8 consecutive weeks , 6 sessions.Group 2 standard treatment + muscle strength : 25 women with lymphedema , perform complex physical therapy, manual lymphatic drainage, compression bandaging and linfomiocinéticos exercises and strengthening exercises with load.Treatment was given twice a week , 8 consecutive weeks , 16 sessions.</detailed_description>
