	<brief_summary>The ability to encode the speech signal is determined by ascending and descending auditory processing. Difficulties in processing these speech signals are well described at the behavioral level in a specific language disorder. However, little is known about the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The assumption is that we should observe a degradation of the signal provided by the ear in the deaf subject while in case of specific language impairment it would be a phonemic disorder (possibly linked to a processing disorder auditory). The two population groups should therefore have different abnormalities of their central auditory process - which could be modified by the target remediation for each group.</brief_summary>
