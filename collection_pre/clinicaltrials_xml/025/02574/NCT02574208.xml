	<brief_summary>CDC recommends universal HIV testing in all adults, at least once during life, to reduce the pool of infected patients unaware of their status. Routine universal HIV testing can use "classical" ELISA tests from serum, or rapid tests, ideally from finger-stick whole blood (FSB), which have shown close predictive values from classical tests. The investigators will compare the acceptability and feasibility of the two methods.</brief_summary>
