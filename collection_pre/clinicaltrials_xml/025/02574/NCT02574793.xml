	<brief_summary>Glucose fluctuations present not only in patients with diabetes mellitus but also in subjects with normal glucose tolerance or impaired glucose regulation. People with Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma and Cushing Syndrome are at risk of impaired glucose metabolism. Glycemic variability is poorly studied in the nondiabetic individuals. The aim of the study is to investigate the characteristics of glucose fluctuations in the newly diagnosed Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma and Cushing Syndrome individuals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glycemic Fluctuations in Newly Diagnosed Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma and Cushing Syndrome Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glucose fluctuations present not only in patients with diabetes mellitus but also in subjects with normal glucose tolerance or impaired glucose regulation. Compared with traditional monitoring methods, continuous glucose monitoring system(CGMS) techniques provides a much more detailed understanding of shifting blood glucose levels throughout the day.It is considered reliable to evaluate glucose variability not only in patients with diabetes but also in nondiabetic individuals. People with Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma and Cushing Syndrome are at risk of impaired glucose metabolism and developing diabetes mellitus.Some researchers have shown that 15-30% Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma are suffering from diabetes, 15-36% impaired glucose regulation. The rate of Cushing Syndrome individuals is 10-30% and 40-45% separately. Glycemic variability is poorly studied in the nondiabetic individuals and has not been studied in the newly diagnosed Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma and Cushing Syndrome individuals. In this study CGM was used to dynamically monitor patients being newly diagnosed with Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma and Cushing Syndrome.</detailed_description>
