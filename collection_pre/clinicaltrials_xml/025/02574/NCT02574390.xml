	<brief_summary>Creation of a large repository of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), bio-fluid samples (blood and spinal fluid (optional)), and cell lines for ALS gene identification. This will be combined carefully with collected measures of the pattern of the symptoms people with ALS have and how these change over time.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will have 5 study visits; screening, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. There will be a one year post-participation follow-up period, during which they will receive an email or phone call interview once every 3 months. During the first year, samples will be collected, breathing, muscle strength, spasticity, general function and cognitive behavior will be assessed</detailed_description>
