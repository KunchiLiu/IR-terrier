	<detailed_description>Traditional open appendicectomy have many drawbacks, such as false-positive, cut infection, scar, extended cut, slower rehabilitation and return to work. In the past few years, in order to improve diagnostic accuracy, the abdomen CT is been general applied before appendicectomy, in addition to, a modified incision (MI) was designed based on it. Using a MI compare traditional incision (TI) to the patient including cut extended, operating time, cut infection, false-positive rate, rehabilitation and return to work. It seems that MI would prove superior to TI in terms of hospital day (primary terminus), with operating time, postoperative complication, scar and time to resume normal activity and work as secondary terminus.</detailed_description>
