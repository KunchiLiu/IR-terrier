	<brief_summary>This research is being done to learn more about the risk of developing breast cancer by studying cells from both normal breast tissue and breast cancer tumor tissue. The goal is to study cells, genes, and gene products to help us to learn how to detect cancer in its earliest stages, and if this information may differ in patients with different ethnic backgrounds.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Markers for Predicting Risk of Breast Cancer in Women of Different Races</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence suggests that, besides reduced access to care, the increase in breast cancer incidence and mortality in AA (African American) compared to EA (European American or Caucasian) women is influenced by the biology of the tumor. Gene methylation changes caused by environmental factors starting at birth is one mechanism through which genetic and non-genetic factors could affect development of breast cancer and which could underlie disparities in aggressiveness. The investigators were the first to show that a panel of genes was hypermethylated specifically in AA-ER-negative tumors in young women in comparison to EA-tumors in women of the same age. Gene promoter methylation is found at low levels in healthy breast tissues from women without cancer. Race and family history of cancer increase the likelihood of these early events. Thus, epigenetic changes may be early events in transformation of breast cells and tumor formation. This study will enroll women from different ethnic backgrounds undergoing mastectomy in order to collect normal and tumor tissue to study these genetic changes and breast cancer risk.</detailed_description>
