	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to study the epidemiology of non-CF bronchiectasis (NCFB) and to provide an estimate of the distribution (prevalence) of NCFB etiologies across all different levels of health care as well as real-life data regarding the current management of NCFB in Germany.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- To study the epidemiology of non-CF bronchiectasis (NCFB) and to provide an estimate of the distribution (prevalence) of NCFB etiologies across all different levels of health care as well as real-life data regarding the current management of NCFB in Germany - To establish feasible investigational strategies in order to establish the etiology of NCFB - To perform observational research into bronchiectasis, particularly in areas where single center datasets are underpowered, such as in rare etiologies or determining markers of prognosis - To promote collaborative clinical, basic and translational research in NCFB between German (and European) centers - To provide a registry of well phenotyped patients with NCFB in clinical centers potentially eligible for enrolment into clinical trials - To track access to healthcare and cost of caring for patients with NCFB over time</detailed_description>
