	<brief_title>Cervical Ripening: A Comparison Between Intravaginal Misoprostol Tablet and Intracervical Foley's Catheter in a Low Resource Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized clinical which will be made up of two arms or groups. The first arm or group - 1 will have cervical ripening with intracervical extraamniotic Foley's catheter while group - 2 will have cervical ripening with intravaginal misoprostol. The parturients will be randomly selected by simple lottery and recruited into the two arms of the study. Each parturient will pick by simple lucky dip from a pool of folded papers with inscription group 1 or group 2 in a bag in a double blinded manner and will be recruited into the group picked among the two arms of the study. The Bishop's score of the cervix will be accurately determined and documented before cervical ripening. Bishop's score of ≥6 will be considered ripe.</detailed_description>
