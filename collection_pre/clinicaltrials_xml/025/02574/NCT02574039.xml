	<brief_summary>A diet rich in whole grain is inversely associated with cardiovascular disease risk and this benefit could be partly attributed to the phenolic acid content of whole grains. The exact absorption, metabolism and excretion of whole grain phenolic acids, however, is not fully understood. In a small human intervention trial, the investigators will investigate to what extent phenolic acids from whole grain oats are absorbed, excreted in urine and how they are metabolised.</brief_summary>
