	<brief_summary>Bronchial asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease. Patients usually manifest variable symptoms (such as short of breath, chest tightness, cough, etc.) and variable airflow limitation and often associated with airway hyper-responsiveness and airway inflammation. About 1-18% of the global population suffered from the disease, causing huge economic burden for patients and countries. Airway reactivity measurement is an important way of diagnosis of asthma. Methacholine (Mch) bronchial provocation test(BPT) is the "gold standard" for the determination of airway reactivity, and other measuring methods(like adenosine monophosphate(AMP)-BPT, leukotriene D4(LTD4)-BPT, Astograph-BPT, etc.) were also brought into hot research fields. The investigators' purposes were to compare different kinds of methodologies(Mch,AMP,LTD4-BPT, Astograph-BPT) assessing airway responsiveness and to investigate treatment efficacy of budesonide /formoterol in asthmatics.</brief_summary>
