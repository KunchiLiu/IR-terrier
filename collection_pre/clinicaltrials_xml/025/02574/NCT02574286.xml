	<criteria>1. The patient has a documented diagnosis of type 1 Gaucher disease, as documented by deficient glucocerebrosidase (GCB) activity in leukocytes (whole blood only) or cultured skin fibroblasts. Diagnosis by dry blood spot test is not sufficient. Diagnosis may be based on results obtained prior to Screening if documented in the patient's medical history. 2. Patients must have a LS BMD Zscore &lt;1 as measured by DXA during the screening phase. 3. Patient is treatmentnaïve, ie, should not have received ERT or SRT in the 12 months prior to enrollment. 4. The patient is ≥18 and ≤65 years of age. 5. Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception at all times during the study. 6. The patient, and the patient's parent(s) or legal guardian(s), if applicable, understands the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study and has provided written informed consent that has been approved by the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC). 7. The patient must be sufficiently cooperative to participate in this clinical study as judged by the investigator. Exclusion criteria 1. Neurological symptoms indicating that the patient has type 3 Gaucher disease. 2. A significant comorbidity, which, as determined by the investigator, might compromise study assessment, affect study data or confound the study results (eg, malignancies, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune liver disease, etc). 3. Any osteoporosisspecific treatment (eg, bisphosphonates) or treatment with erythropoietin (or erythropoietinlike substances) during the past year. 4. Structural, jointassociated bone damage of such extent and severity that the investigator deems it could impact participation in the study and assessment of relevant study endpoints (eg, pain). 5. The patient is pregnant or lactating. 6. The patient has had a splenectomy. 7. The patient is enrolled in another clinical study that involves clinical investigations or use of any investigational product (drug or device) within 30 days prior to study enrollment or at any time during the study. 8. Severe vitamin D deficiency to the level that would be expected to result in osteomalacia (25hydroxyvitamin D &lt; 10 ng/mL [25 nmol/L]). If there is mild vitamin D insufficiency at screening (25hydroxyvitamin D &gt; 10 and &lt; 30 ng/mL) treat with 4000 IU 25 hydroxyvitamin D per day for 1 month and rescreen. 9. The patient has previously interrupted ERT for safety reasons. 10. The patient has had hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.</criteria>
