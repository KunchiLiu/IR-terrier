	<brief_summary>This is an interventional study to test the immunogenicity of combined adjuvant myDC and pDC vaccination versus adjuvant myDC or pDC vaccination alone in stage III melanoma patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>myDC/pDC in Stage III Melanoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stage lll melanoma patients will receive pDC (arm A, n=10), myDC (arm B, n=10) or combined pDC/myDC (arm C, n=10). Subsequent vaccinations will be performed according to the protocol: 2 biweekly vaccinations of intranodal injections with pDC, myDC or the combination with pDC and myDC. After each vaccination the investigators will examine peripheral blood for proliferative and humoral KLH immune responses. After the vaccinations, a DTH with peptide loaded blood DC is performed from which biopsies are taken for T cell analysis. lf patients remain disease free, the investigators will repeat this cycle with a 6 months interval up to a total of three cycles. lf a tumor recurrence occurs a biopsy will be taken for laboratory evaluation.</detailed_description>
