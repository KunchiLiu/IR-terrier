	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of three different treatment methods which consists spinal decompression, deep friction massage and exercise. The patients were separated three groups Group one received non-surgical spinal decompression therapy, group two received non-surgical spinal decompression, lumbar stabilization exercises and manual therapy, group three received manual therapy and lumbar stabilization exercises. All groups completed 15 sessions of therapy. In each session, pain severity was assessed with numeric analog scale, straight leg raise test applied and the degree of the hip flexion where the patient reported pain were recorded, respectively. Static, dynamic muscle strength-endurance tests were applied before the treatment sessions started, after the treatment sessions ended, six weeks after and three months after the study. Oswestry Disability Scale (ODI), Back Performance Scale (BPS), Lanss Neuropathic pain Questionnaire, Fear-Avoidance-Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) and McGill Pain Questionnaire were applied before the treatment sessions started, after the treatment sessions ended and three months after the study. Gradient of disc height and thickness of the herniation were assessed segmentally with magnetic resonance imagination (MRI) before the study and three months after the study.</brief_summary>
