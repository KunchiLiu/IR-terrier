	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well AT13387 works in treating patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has not responded to previous treatment or that has returned after a period of improvement. AT13387 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AT13387 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma, or Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Overall response rate (ORR) to single agent AT13387 (onalespib) as measured by the proportion of partial and complete responses (PR + CR) in patients with relapsed/refractory anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive (+) anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and B-cell lymphoma 6 protein positive (BCL6+) diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), as well as duration of response (DOR) of single agent AT13387 (onalespib) in patients with ALK+ ALCL, MCL, and BCL6+ DLBCL. II. Safety and tolerability of single agent AT13387 (onalespib) in patients with ALK+ ALCL, MCL, and BCL6+ DLBCL. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Measurement of on-target activity of AT13387 (onalespib) in ALK+ ALCL, MCL, and BCL6+ DLBCL through immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry of pre-treatment, on-treatment, and time of progression tumor biopsies for HSP90 clients. II. Determination of genetic and transcriptional markers for response and resistance to AT13387 (onalespib) in patients with ALK+ ALCL, MCL, and BCL6+ DLBCL. OUTLINE: Patients receive onalespib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically confirmed, relapsed/refractory ALK+ ALCL (with ALK positivity defined by immunohistochemistry and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]/cytogenetics), MCL, or BCL6+ DLBCL (with BCL6 positivity defined by immunohistochemistry) and meet the following criteria: Patients must have measurable disease that has not been previously irradiated, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;= 20 mm (&gt;= 2 cm) with conventional imaging or &gt;= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan; if the patient has been previously irradiated, there must be evidence of progression since the radiation Please note, this trial includes mandatory tumor biopsies pretreatment, during cycle 1 and at the time of disease progression of accessible tumor; having accessible tumor for biopsy is not required for eligibility; we expect that at least 80% of patients will have accessible tumor for these biopsies, however ALK+ ALCL: patients must have disease that has relapsed and or is refractory to prior therapy, which must have included a multiagent chemotherapy regimen including an anthracycline, if not contraindicated, and prior brentuximab; prior crizotinib or other ALK inhibitor therapy, while recommended, is not mandatory; patients must have relapsed following or be ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant MCL: patients must have disease that has relapsed and or is refractory to prior therapy, which must have included a multiagent chemotherapy regimen and prior ibrutinib or other BTK inhibitor therapy; patients must have relapsed following or be ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant BCL6+ DLBCL: patients must have disease that has relapsed and or is refractory to prior therapy, which must have included an anthracycline, if not contraindicated; patients must have relapsed following or be ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%) Life expectancy of greater than 3 months Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,000/mcL Platelets &gt;= 75,000/mcL, unless due to marrow involvement by lymphoma in which case a platelet count of &gt;= 30,000/mcL will be used Total bilirubin =&lt;

abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of AT13387 administration Patients must be willing to not take St. John wort or grapefruit juice while participating in this trial and should avoid drugs that are strong inducers of Pgp, and to switch to alternative drugs when available Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier;
