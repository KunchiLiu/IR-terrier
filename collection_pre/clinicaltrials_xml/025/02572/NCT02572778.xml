	<brief_summary>The investigators want to have a collection of fresh primary or recurrent tumor tissue for establishment of patients-derived xenografts in order to: generate a biobank of in vivo patient xenografts representing the different subgroups of tumors for head and neck cancer - perform genetic and transcriptional profiling of the primary, metastatic tumors and xenograft tumors - evaluate the efficacy of new targeted agents, whether or not in combination with standard treatment options - evaluate biomarkers of drug sensitivity - study primary and secondary (acquired) resistance in these models</brief_summary>
