	<brief_title>A Study of Brentuximab Vedotin Combined With Nivolumab for Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will examine the safety profile and antitumor activity when brentuximab vedotin is combined with nivolumab. Patients will be treated for up to four 21-day cycles with brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg and nivolumab 3 mg/kg. There will be 2 parts to this study. In Part 1, the safety of combination treatment will be evaluated by a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) prior to expansion of enrollment to evaluate treatment effect in Part 2. Part 2 of the study will further characterize safety and evaluate the antitumor activity of brentuximab vedotin combined with nivolumab by enrolling patients at the recommended dose schedule determined in Part 1.</detailed_description>
