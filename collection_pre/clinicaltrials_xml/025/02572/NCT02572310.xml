	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators propose to monitor subjects who have received Triathlon total knee components inserted with HV cement. The primary outcome will be fixation of the tibial implant component as assessed with RSA and to determine the functionality of patients after surgery using self-reported questionnaires. This is a historical control study, comparing the study cohort to a previous group with Triathlon implants and the long-standing Simplex T cement. The secondary outcomes are inducible displacements of the implants as well as a qualitative evaluation of the cement handling characteristics performed by the operating room staff.</brief_summary>
