	<brief_summary>Scabies is an infestation of the skin by the human itch mite (Sarcoptes scabiei). Diagnosis of scabies is made based on clinical symptoms, such as nocturnal itching, and appearance and distribution of the rash. Definitive diagnosis includes the microscopic identification of the mite, mite eggs, or mite fecal matter in the skin. Topical permethrin is considered the drug of choice for the treatment of scabies. It is a synthetic pyrethroid that is safe for use in adults and children 2 months and older. This study will evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of a generic permethrin cream 5% to Elimite® in the Treatment of Scabies.</brief_summary>

Family members of employees of the clinic or Investigator. 8. Patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, would be noncompliant with the requirements of the study protocol. 9.

Patients or guardians of patients, who are unable or unwilling to give informed consent or assent respectively. 12. Receipt of any drug as part of a research study within 30 days before screening. 13. History of seizures. 14.
