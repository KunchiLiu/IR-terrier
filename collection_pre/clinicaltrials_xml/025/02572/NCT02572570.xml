	<brief_summary>Polymerization shrinkage remains one of the primary disadvantages of composite resin restorative materials (tooth-colored fillings). To minimize the effects of polymerization shrinkage in the restorative treatment, the 3M ESPE company has developed a composite resin called Filtek Bulk Fill Posterior Restorative. Its decreased polymerization shrinkage and properties allow the material to be inserted in one single increment, expediting treatment. This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the performance of the new bulk fill composite resin in Class II (two-surface posterior) fillings.</brief_summary>
