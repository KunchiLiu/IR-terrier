	<brief_summary>This is a study of an investigational surgical procedure for the treatment of achalasia the inability of smooth muscle to move food down the esophagus. A new procedure, called the POEM procedure (per oral endoscopic myotomy) has been developed for achalasia. This study is being performed to determine if patients can go home on the same day as their procedure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a study of an investigational surgical procedure for the treatment of achalasia the inability of smooth muscle to move food down the esophagus. Standard care for participants includes Heller Myotomy, a laparoscopic procedure that includes cutting the muscle layers in the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) the valve at the bottom of your esophagus. A second procedure is then required to prevent reflux (acid entering the esophagus from the stomach) called fundoplication. Patients with the Heller myotomy will typically stay overnight in hospital. A new procedure, called the POEM procedure (per oral endoscopic myotomy) has been developed for achalasia. This procedure uses endoscopy and no incisions to cut one muscle layer. A fundoplication is not required with this method. This study treatment works by entering the surgical area through the mouth and then making an incision (cut) through the esophagus and placing flexible instruments along the outside of the esophagus and down to the LES through a tunnel. The instruments used in this procedure are standard endoscopic instruments that will be provided by one of the leading endoscopic instrument manufacturers, Olympus. The investigators have recently completed a small study showing this procedure is safe and feasible. One observation from this pilot study was that most patients had no pain and didn't need any pain medications. Due to this reason, the investigators think patient's may go home on the same day as their procedure.</detailed_description>
