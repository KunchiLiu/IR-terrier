Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, complete physical examination including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests. 2. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 32 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 pounds). 3. Chest X ray with no evidence of current, active TB or previous (inactive) TB, fungal or general infections, heart failure, malignancy, or other clinically significant abnormalities taken at Screening or within 24 weeks prior to Day 1 and read by a qualified radiologist. 4. Female subjects of non childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following criteria: a. Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or physiological cause; status may be confirmed by having a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level confirming the post menopausal state; b. Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy; c. Have medically confirmed ovarian failure. All other female subjects (including females with tubal ligations) will be considered to be of childbearing potential. 1.
