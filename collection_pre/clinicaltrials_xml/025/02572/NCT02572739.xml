	<brief_summary>Thermodilution cardiac output measurement is a reliable method, but it is an invasive one. PiCCO device requires cannulation of central vein and peripheral artery. Impedance method requires only attachment of special electrodes. Non-invasive methods are less accurate. Aim of study is to assess accuracy and reliability of impedance method ( using NICCOMO device) in comparison of thermodilution method ( using PiCCO device) at different PEEP levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac Output Measurement With NICCOMO and PiCCO Devices at Different PEEP Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Echocardiography is performed prior to measurement to exclude patients with heart valve abnormalities. Patients without spontaneous ventilation ( deeply unconscious, sedated or sedated and paralysed), ventilated with controlled mechanical ventilation mode with tidal volume 6-8 ml/ideal body weight, resulting in EtCO2 35-45 mmHg, with PiCCO catheters implemented have additionally NICCOMO device attached. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set to achieve saturation &gt;96% at positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 0 cmH2O. Measurement of cardiac output are performed on expiration at PEEP 0, 5, 10, 15 20 cmH2O and at optimal PEEP (obtained from P-V curve). Simultaneously CO value from impedance device is noted. Other haemodynamic parameters, calculated by both devices are also noted - stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), Cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI).</detailed_description>
