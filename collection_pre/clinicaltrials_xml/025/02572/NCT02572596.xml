	<brief_summary>Comparing intermediate-dose CTX (ID-CTX)and G-CSF with rhTPO or without for peripheral blood stem cell mobilization in patients with multiple myeloma, try to find out whether rhTPO combined to ID-CTX + G-CSF could improve the results of peripheral blood stem cell mobilization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Intermediate-dose CTX+ G-CSF Plus or Not rhTPO for PB CD34+ Cells Mobilization in MM Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to try to find out whether rhTPO combined to ID-CTX + G-CSF could improve the results of peripheral blood stem cell mobilization. Comparing ID-CTX and G-CSF plus rhTPO or not for peripheral blood stem cell mobilization in patients with multiple myeloma. rhTPO15000U/d were given from day 5~7 after chemotherapy until the stem cell collection .</detailed_description>
