	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the splenic activation in hypertensive patients, as compared to normotensives, using FDG-PET/CT imaging. Moreover, the investigators will investigate whether the splenic metabolic activity relates to the expression of circulating inflammatory proteins (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) or to immune profiles of activated T cells.</brief_summary>
