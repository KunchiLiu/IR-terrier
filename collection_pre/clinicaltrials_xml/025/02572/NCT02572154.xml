	<brief_summary>In human, 2% of couples experimented Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Currently, while etiological investigations were performed, 40 to 50 % of RPL were unexplained. In animals' studies, several studies have underlined the importance of sperm quality for a normal embryo development. In human, epidemiological studies have demonstrated that several male risk factors have effects on development (male mediated development toxicology). However, few studies have explored sperm DNA fragmentation on embryo development but after in vitro fertilization. In natural pregnancy only rare studies have been performed but with different populations definitions and different methods of sperm exploration. In this context sperm DNA fragmentation exploration appears justified. The present study purpose to conduct a case - control study in order to research paternal role in RPL.</brief_summary>
