	<brief_summary>Purpose of this study is to compare the ocular functional changes including pupil size, visual acuity, depth of focus, accommodative amplitude, visual field, contrast sensitivity, and stereopsis induced by multiple and single pinhole glasses, in addition, to check reading speed and survey for ocular discomfort after using both pinhole glasses.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. age between 20 and 45 years; 2. spherical equivalents (SE) within Â± 6.0 diopters (D); 3. correctable distant and near visual acuity by glasses up to 20/20; 4. normal intraocular pressure with normal optic disc appearance; 5. normal ocular alignment. 1. disturbance of accommodation due to any reasons such as an Adie's pupil, Parkinson's disease, a history of previous ocular surgery or trauma, and a history of systemic or topical medication that might affect accommodation; 2. corneal pathologic features; 3. glaucoma; 4. cataracts of grade II or greater by the Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III); 5. vitreous and retinal abnormalities that might limit the accuracy of testing.</criteria>
