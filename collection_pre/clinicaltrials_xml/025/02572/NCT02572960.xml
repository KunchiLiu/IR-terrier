	<brief_title>Physiologic Interactions Between the Adrenal- and the Parathyroid Glands</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In primary hyperparathyroidism, chronic-elevated PTH levels seem to stimulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) which may explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition to increased PTH levels, vitamin D has been shown to inhibit the RAAS. However, a possible physiologic interaction needs further investigation. The purpose of the study is to investigate changes in the RAAS in otherwise healthy postmenopausal women with secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency when p-PTH is normalized. Furthermore, we will evaluate whether an angiotensin 2 receptor blocker can lower PTH in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.</detailed_description>
