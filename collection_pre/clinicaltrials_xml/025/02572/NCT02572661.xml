	<brief_summary>This study aims to explore the feasibility, safety and outcome of a non‐invasive sentinel node mapping (SNM) to individually tailor the elective nodal irradiation (ENI) to the ipsilateral neck only and to exclude the contralateral negative neck from the irradiation fields when there is no draining sentinel node. Subsequently the dose to the salivary glands, mucosal area and the swallowing and chewing muscles and structures involved in voicing and articulation will significantly be reduced</brief_summary>
