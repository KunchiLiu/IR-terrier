	<brief_summary>Retrospective study comparing dose distribution of 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to estimate secondary cancer risk for patients having had radiation therapy for rectal cancer. Twenty-five patients are included in this study. Planning CT scans are used for comparison of dose distribution and calculation of second cancer risk.</brief_summary>
