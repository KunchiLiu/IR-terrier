	<brief_summary>Primary Objective - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of co-administered single dose Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHA-PQP), Ivermectin (IVM), Primaquine (PQ), and Albendazole (ABZ) in healthy subjects. Secondary Objectives - To characterize the potential pharmacokinetic interactions between DHA-PQP, IVM, PQ, and ABZ in healthy adult subjects. - To characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of PQ (and its major metabolite), DHA-PQP, IVM, and ABZ (and its major metabolite) when given alone and in combination. - To investigate pharmacogenetic polymorphisms affecting drug levels of PQ, DHA-PQP, IVM, ABZ and their metabolites. - To determine mosquito lethal efficacy of IVM, PQ, ABZ, and DHA-PQP combinations against Anopheles dirus and Anopheles minimus. - To determine if IVM concentrations in venous blood differs from capillary blood.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, sequential pharmacokinetic study in 16 healthy glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) normal Thai subjects. These 16 subjects have previously participated in either study: 1. Open-Label Study to Evaluate Potential Pharmacokinetic Interaction of Orally Administered Primaquine (PQ) and Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHA-PQP) in Healthy Adult Subjects (TMEC 12-004 (OxTREC ref. 58-11)) or study 2. Comparison of the electrocardiographic effects in relation to Pharmacokinetic profile of chloroquine (CQ) and piperaquine (PQ) in healthy Thai subjects (TMEC 14-022 (OxTREC ref. 39-14)) or 3. subjects who not previously participated in study "TMEC 12-004 (OxTREC ref. 58-11)" and study "TMEC 14-022 (OxTREC ref. 39-14)". The study team will use the results of DHA-PQP regimen of the subjects from the above mentioned studies to compare with combination regimens in this study. This is to avoid unnecessary exposure of Subjects from (TMEC 12-004 (OxTREC ref. 58-11)) and (TMEC 14-022 (OxTREC ref. 39-14)) to the subjects. In addition, subjects have previously been tested for G6PD deficiency during screening process from the above mentioned study with result showed as normal. Therefore, a G6PD deficiency test is not needed. A G6PD deficiency test is needed for subjects who not previously participated in study subjects who not previously participated in study "TMEC 12-004 (OxTREC ref. 58-11)" and study "TMEC 14-022 (OxTREC ref. 39-14)" for this study. Subjects will be admitted in the inpatient ward to receive single dose of 6 regimens (regimens 1-4 and 8-9) described below. Every subject will have at least 6 admissions in the hospital. 1: IVM (400 μg/kg) via 6 mg tabs, w-o** &gt;4wks; 2: IVM (400 μg/kg)+PQ (15 mg): 2 tabs), w-o &gt;4wks; 3: IVM (400 μg/kg)+DHA-PQP (40mg/320 mg): 3 tabs), w-o &gt;8wks; 4: IVM (400 μg/kg)+DHA-PQP+PQ, w-o &gt;8wks; 5*#: PQ (15 mg): 2 tabs, w-o &gt; 2wks; 6#: DHA-PQP (40mg/320 mg): 3 tabs, w-o &gt;8wks; 7*#: DHA-PQP (40mg/320 mg): 3 tabs +PQ (15 mg): 2 tabs, w-o &gt;8wks; 8: ABZ (200 mg) 2 tabs, w-o &gt;2wks; 9: IVM (400 μg/kg)+DHA-PQP (40mg/320 mg): 3 tabs+PQ (15 mg): 2 tabs +ABZ (400 mg): 1 tab, w-o &gt;8wks * The subjects from TMEC-14-022 (OxTREC ref. 39-14) will have two additional admissions to receive two additional regimen PQ, and DHA-PQP with PQ # Subjects who not previously participated in study "TMEC 12-004 (OxTREC ref. 58-11)" and study "TMEC 14-022 (OxTREC ref. 39-14)" will have three additional admissions to receive three additional regimens PQ, DHA-PQP, and DHA-PQP with PQ. **w-o = washout period</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Healthy as judged by a responsible physician with no abnormality identified on a medical evaluation including medical history and physical examination. 2. Males and Females nonsmoker aged between 18 years to 60 years. 3. Males and Females weight between 3675 kilograms. 4. A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is: of nonchildbearing potential including premenopausal females with documented (medical report verification) hysterectomy or double oophorectomy or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum follicle stimulating hormone levels &gt;40 milliInternational unit (mIU/mL) or 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy or of childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and prior to start the study drug in each period, and abstain from sexual intercourse or agrees to using effective contraceptive methods (e.g., intrauterine device, hormonal contraceptive drug, tubal ligation or female barrier method with spermicide) during the study until completion of the followup procedures 5.
