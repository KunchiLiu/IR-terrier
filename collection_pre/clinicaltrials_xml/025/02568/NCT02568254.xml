	<brief_summary>This is a single-site, 8-visit, double-masked, cross-over study involving three marketed products as study lenses. Participants will be randomly assigned each lens type, which will be worn for approximately two weeks (12 +/- 2 days) each. Participants will undergo a minimum washout period of 3 days before entering the study and undergo a minimum 7 day washout period between dispensing each lens type.</brief_summary>

Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens wear (at the investigator's discretion); Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may interfere with contact lens wear (at the investigator's discretion); Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will be discontinued); Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or a contagious immunosuppressive disease; Any active ocular infection; Is using any topical medications (excluding artificial tears (ATS)) up to two weeks prior to the screening visit; Any participants whose habitual contact lenses are used as an extended wear regimen; Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, or moderate or above corneal distortion by keratometry; Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laserassisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), etc.); Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal staining, or any other abnormalities of the cornea which would contraindicate contact lens wear; or clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) tarsal abnormalities or bulbar injection which might interfere with contact lens wear; Any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to the study products; Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 7 days prior to study enrollment; Employee or family member of the Centre for Contact Lens Research (e.g., Investigator, Coordinator, Technician).</criteria>
