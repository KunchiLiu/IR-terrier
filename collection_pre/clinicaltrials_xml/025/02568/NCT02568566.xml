	<brief_summary>This phase IIA trial studies how well a recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent works in preventing human papilloma virus (HPV) in younger healthy participants. HPV is a common virus which usually causes infections that last only a few months, but sometimes can last a long time and cause cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus or oropharynx over many years among adults. Recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine is a type of nonavalent vaccine (a vaccine that works against nine different viruses or other microorganisms) and may protect against HPV infection and the health problems that HPV infection can cause.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the persistence and stability of serologic geometric mean titer (GMT) of HPV 16/18 between 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the prime dose and prior to the administration of the second dose. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the persistence and stability of serologic GMT of HPV types 6/11/31/33/45/52/58 between 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after prime dose and prior to the administration of the second dose. II. To assess safety and reactogenicity to each vaccine dose. OUTLINE: Participants receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at baseline (priming injection) and at 24 and 30 months (booster injections). After completion of study, patients are followed up for 2 weeks.</detailed_description>
