	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the minimum effective dose of sugammadex, an antagonist of neuromuscular blockade used during anesthesia practice, in obese patients, considering that sugammadex is indicated in adults with normal weight at a dose of 2 mg/kg but no studies were found with obese patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sugammadex ED90 Dose in the Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective study with the sequential design method up-and-down of the biased coin aimed to determine the minimum effective dose in 90% of patients (ED90). The following doses were chosen: 2.0 mg.kg-1, 2.2 mg.kg-1, 2.4 mg.kg-1, 2.6 mg.kg-1, 2.8 mg.kg-1. The complete reversal of moderate rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade (NMB) considered a T4/T1 ratio ≥ 0.9 with the peripheral nerve stimulator and accelerometer (monitor of sequential electric stimuli) "train-of-four" (TOF). After induction of general anesthesia and the calibration of the peripheral nerve stimulator and accelerometer, rocuronium 0.6 mg.kg-1 was injected. Continuous intravenous infusion of the anesthetics propofol and remifentanil, and intermittent bolus of rocuronium were offered throughout the procedure.</detailed_description>
