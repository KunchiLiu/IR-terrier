	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare balloon angioplasty plus SBCV against balloon angioplasty alone for treatment of stenosis within the femoropopliteal artery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Angioplasty + SBCV vs. Angioplasty Alone for Femoropopliteal Artery Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first-in-human study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a novel adjunctive therapy, SBCV, used with balloon angioplasty as compared to balloon angioplasty plus a control agent (saline) when used for the treatment of stenosis within the femoropopliteal artery. Effectiveness will be measured by late lumen loss at 24 weeks post treatment as evaluated by an independent, blinded core lab.</detailed_description>
