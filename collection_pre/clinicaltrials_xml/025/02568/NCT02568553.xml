	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide and blinatumomab when given together in treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide and blinatumomab, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide and Blinatumomab in Treating Patients With Relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide when given in combination with blinatumomab in the proposed regimen. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity anti-tumor response (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR] as per International workshop lymphoma response criteria). II. To investigate the immune response to blinatumomab alone and in combination with lenalidomide. III. To document the infection rate with a 96-hour bag change schedule for blinatumomab. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. INDUCTION: Patients receive blinatumomab intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-56 and lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 29-49 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CONSOLIDATION: Patients achieving response receive blinatumomab IV continuously on days 1-7 and lenalidomide PO on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MAINTENANCE: Patients receiving response after completion of Consolidation receive lenalidomide PO on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.</detailed_description>

steroids alone and local radiation do not count as regimens Any prior therapy must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to entry into the study Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10 14 days prior to and again within 24 hours of starting lenalidomide and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide;

20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan; lesions in previously irradiated anatomic areas (external beam radiation) cannot be considered target lesions unless there has been documented growth of those lesions after radiotherapy Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients are eligible provided they meet all the other eligibility criteria of the study in addition to the following: No history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)defining conditions other than lymphoma or history of CD4+ Tcells below 200/mm^3 prior to beginning combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) After HIV diagnosis and during treatment with cART, patients should have maintained CD4+ Tcells &gt;= 350/mm^3 prior to lymphoma diagnosis;
