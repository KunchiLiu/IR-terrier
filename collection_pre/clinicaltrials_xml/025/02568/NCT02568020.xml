	<brief_summary>To investigate the effects of different dietary regimens on muscle wasting, insulin/IGF-1 resistance. Further, to explore whether LPD+KA decrease the activation of autophagy associate with insulin/IGF-1 pathway.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Dietary assessment: The composition of the diet will be evaluated through questionnaire, and analyzed a computer-based nutritional evaluation with Dieta software. 2. Biochemical data: blood samples will be collected at baseline and every 3 months of routine examination, such as blood routine, biochemistry, HbA1c, Serum IGF-1, CRP, will be measured. Homeostatic model assessment score (HOMA-IR) was recorded. 3. Skeletal muscle assessment: the parameters of skeletal muscle will be assessed before and after dietary intervention for 12 months. Body weight, height, Body mass index, skeletal muscle mass will be measured by Body composition analyzer. Quadriceps strength will be assessed with a seated leg press exercise instrument (Keiser Sport, Fresno, CA, USA) using the five repetition maximum technique. Knee and hip extension power (rate of generating force) will be assessed with a validated leg power instrument (University ofNottingham Medical College, Nottingham, UK). Fatigability will be assessed with the same bilateral leg press exercise used in strength testing.</detailed_description>
