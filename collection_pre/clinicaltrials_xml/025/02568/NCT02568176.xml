	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the induction potential of repeated administration of intranasal esketamine on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and CYP2B6 activity in healthy participants using orally administered midazolam and bupropion as probes, respectively and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of esketamine after a single dose and repeated administration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study of Intranasal Esketamine and Its Effects on the Pharmacokinetics of Orally-Administered Midazolam and Bupropion in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a parallel group, single-center, repeat-dose, fixed-sequence, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), study. The effects of repeated administration of intranasal esketamine on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and bupropion will be evaluated in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively. Participants in Cohort 1 will receive a single oral dose of midazolam in the morning of Day 1 and Day 17. Participants in Cohort 2 will receive a single oral dose of bupropion in the morning of Day 1 and Day 19. In Cohort 1 and 2 participants will self-administer 5 doses of intranasal esketamine over a 15-day period. The duration of study, from the Screening Phase through Follow-up, is up to 51 days and 54 days for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively. Blood samples for participants in Cohort 1 will be collected for up to 24 hours after dosing on Days 1 and 17 (midazolam) and for up to 24 hours on Days 2 and 16 (esketamine); For participants in Cohort 2, blood and urine samples for assessment of bupropion pharmacokinetics will be collected for up to 72 hours after dosing on Day 1 and Day 19. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
