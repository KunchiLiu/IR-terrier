	<brief_summary>Alcohol leads to a leaky gut and translocation of bacterial products. This may lead to inflammation and immune dysfunction as well as the typical hangover symptoms. Probiotics are able to restore gut permeability and decrease bacterial translocation. A multispecies probiotic may be able to restore gut permeability and decrease bacterial translocation as well as inflammation, immune dysfunction and hangover symptoms after alcohol consumption. Specifically, gut permeability, bacterial translocation, inflammation, immune dysfunction and hangover symptoms in patients after alcohol ingestion +/- ingestion of a multispecies probiotic</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alcohol binge drinking, defined as 5 or more drinks for men and 4 or more drinks for women at one time, is the most frequent form of alcohol consumption worldwide, especially in younger people. This drinking pattern is popular and leads to increased mortality and morbidity. Therefore binge drinking is a major public health issue. The behavioural and neurological consequences of binge drinking are well characterized. Less is known about the systemic effects on the gut as the first organ in contact with alcohol. Chronic alcohol intake can lead to increased gut permeability, bacterial translocation and alterations in the gut microbiome in animal models. Recently bacterial translocation has been shown in healthy volunteers after a single alcohol binge. On immune cells, acute alcohol intake seems to have dichotomous effects. On the one hand immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects have been described, however, alcohol induced liver injury is driven by pro-inflammatory reactions. These immune effects seem to be driven by endotoxin or other bacterial products via Toll-like receptors that are translocated to the circulation via a defective gut barrier. Immune effects of alcohol have also been linked to hangover symptoms after an alcohol binge. Furthermore there is evidence that endotoxemia might also contributes to alcohol dependence by promoting prolonged and increased voluntary alcohol intake in mice. On the other hand mutant mice lacking important genes for immune responses exhibit decreased alcohol consumption. This indicates that immune signaling promotes alcohol consumption. Therefore it is tempting to speculate that increased gut permeability leading to increased bacterial translocation after an acute alcohol binge could promote the desire for further alcohol consumption. Based on these findings methods to decrease bacterial translocation and restore gut barrier function would be of interest to prevent the harmful effects of binge drinking. The use of living microorganisms (probiotics) as a balancing agent in the intestine is said to restore the intestinal barrier function by increasing the epithelial resistance, inhibiting mast-cell activation, tight junction opening, pro-inflammatory cytokine release and inducing the secretion of (anti-inflammatory) interleukin (IL)10. Furthermore probiotics can increase the activation of alkaline phosphatase in the gut and thereby directly decrease the endotoxin-load. The investigators therefore hypothesize that the concomitant use of a probiotic during binge drinking is able to restore the gut barrier, decrease bacterial translocation and immune dysfunction and decreases hangover symptoms. Such a strategy might also decrease the desire to drink more alcohol. The investigators aim to test this hypothesis in a double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over clinical trial where healthy volunteers undergo an episode of binge drinking with or without probiotic supplementation study.</detailed_description>
