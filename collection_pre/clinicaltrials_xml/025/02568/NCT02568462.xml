	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of a new version of a coronary artery stent for treating blockages in the arteries supplying blood to the heart muscle. The Amaranth Medical APTITUDE scaffold releases a drug (sirolimus) to reduce the likelihood of the treated blood vessel developing a new blockage. In addition, the scaffold dissolves away over time, leaving no permanent implant after the blood vessel has healed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of the Amaranth Medical APTITUDE Bioresorbable Drug-Eluting Coronary Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the AmM APTITUDE Bioresorbable Drug-Eluting Coronary Scaffold for use in the treatment of single, de novo, stenotic native coronary artery lesions in patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention. The scaffold is a single-use device comprised of a balloon-expandable, intracoronary drug coated scaffold pre-mounted on a rapid-exchange delivery catheter. The scaffold is made of Poly-L-Lactide (PLLA) and is coated with a polymer-antiproliferative drug (sirolimus) matrix. The scaffold provides mechanical support similar to a metallic stent to the vessel while it is healing, and then gradually breaks down over time leaving no permanent implant in the treated vessel. Compared to prior versions of the scaffold, the new device has a thinner strut design (a wall thickness of 120 µm rather than 150 µm), but is otherwise identical. The study design is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, non-inferiority trial. It will enroll a maximum of 60 patients from up to 12 investigational centers in Colombia and the European Union. Eligible patients who are at least 18 years of age diagnosed with symptomatic ischemic disease due to a discrete, single, de novo, stenotic lesion in native coronary artery will be asked to participate in this study. After treatment with the investigational device, subjects will be followed for five years. Safety of the device will be evaluated using the incidence of target vessel failure during the follow-up period. Performance (efficacy) will be assessed using the in-scaffold late lumen loss measured by quantitative coronary angiography at nine months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General 1. Subject is ≥ 18 years of age and &lt; 85 years of age. 2. Subject agrees not to participate in any other investigational device or drug study for a period of two years following the index procedure. Questionnairebased studies, or other studies that are noninvasive and do not require investigational devices or medications are allowed. 3. Subject (or their legally authorized representative) provides written informed consent prior to any studyrelated procedure, using the form approved by the local Ethics Committee. 4. Subject has: 1. evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable angina [Canadian Cardiovascular Society 1, 2, 3, or 4] or unstable angina [Braunwald Class 13, BC], or silent ischemia with supporting imaging studies [ETT, SPECT, stress echocardiography, or Cardiac CT]), or 2. low or intermediate risk NSTEMI, or 3. evidence of myocardial ischemia in a coronary territory previously affected by STEMI as long as the lesion fulfills the angiographic inclusion criteria and the intervention performed ≥ 3 months following the STEMI. 5. Subject is an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. 6. Patient agrees to complete all protocol required followup visits, including angiograms. 7. Elective percutaneous interventions for nontarget lesions are allowed if performed ≥ 30 days prior to or following the index procedure. Angiographic 1. Patient indicated for elective stenting of a single, de novo, stenotic lesion in a native coronary artery. 2. Target lesion must measure ≤ 14 mm in length by online QCA. 3. Lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with a diameter (average of distal and proximal to lesion by IVUS) of 2.5 mm to 3.7 mm. 4. Target lesion must be in a major artery or branch with a visually estimated diameter stenosis of ≥ 50% and &lt; 100% with a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow of ≥ 1. General 1. Patient has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, both heparin and bivalirudin, antiplatelet medication specified for use in the study (clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor), sirolimus or its derivatives, poly (Llactide), poly (D,Llactide), platinumiridium, or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated. 2. Patient has evolving ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). 3. Patient has current unstable arrhythmias. 4. Patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 30%. 5. Patient has received a heart transplant or any other organ transplant, or is on a waiting list for any organ transplant. 6. Patient has any previous stent placements ≤ 15 mm (proximal or distal) of the target lesion. 7. Patient is receiving or scheduled to receive chemotherapy for malignancy ≤ 30 days prior to or after the index procedure. 8. Patient is receiving immunosuppressant therapy and/or has known immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, severe asthma requiring immunosuppressive medication, etc.). 9. Patient is receiving or scheduled to receive chronic anticoagulation therapy (e.g., heparin, Coumadin) that cannot be stopped and restarted according to local hospital standard procedures. 10. Elective surgery is planned ≤ 9 months after the index procedure that will require discontinuation of antiplatelet medications. 11. Patient has a platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm^3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm^3, a WBC of &lt; 3,000 cells/mm^3, or documented or suspected liver disease (including laboratory evidence of hepatitis). 12. Patient has known renal insufficiency (e.g., eGFR &lt; 60 ml/kg/m^2 or serum creatinine level of &gt; 2.5 mg/dL, or subject on dialysis). 13. Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions. 14. Patient has had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic neurological attack (TIA) ≤ 6 months prior to the index procedure. 15. Patient has had a significant GI or urinary bleed ≤ 6 months prior to the index procedure. 16. Patient has extensive peripheral vessel disease that precludes safe introducer sheath insertion. 17.

Patient has other medical illness (e.g., cancer or congestive heart failure) or known history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc.) that per physician judgment that may cause noncompliance with the protocol or confound the data interpretation or is associated with a limited life expectancy (i.e., ≤ 1 year). 20.
