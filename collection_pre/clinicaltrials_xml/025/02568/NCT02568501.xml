	<brief_title>Behavioral Economic Incentives to Improve Glycemic Control Among Adolescents and Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be given daily glucose monitoring goals of ≥4 glucose checks per day with ≥1 readings within goal range (70-180 mg/dL) and provided with iHealth wireless glucometers. Half of the study participants will be randomized to the 3-month intervention arm on Way to Health. The intervention includes daily financial incentives ($60 in an account at beginning of each month with $2 daily loss if non-adherent) and a 2-level tiered sponsor network (youth select 2 people who will be notified of non-adherence after 2 and 5 consecutive days). The primary outcome will be HbA1c at 3 months compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes will include HbA1c at 6 months and the proportion of participants adherent to daily glucose monitoring goals. Exit interviews will elicit intervention feasibility and feedback from a youth perspective.</detailed_description>
