	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes in older (60-80 years) advanced heart failure (HF) patients who undergo heart transplantation (HT) or mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as a permanent implant (i.e., destination therapy [DT]) and their caregivers. Our study will contribute to better patient-centered care of older advanced HF patients and their caregivers, by informing decision making and guiding strategies to enhance post-operative HRQOL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SUSTAIN-IT: Sustaining Quality of Life of the Aged: Heart Transplant or Mechanical Support?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes in older (60-80 years) advanced heart failure (HF) patients who undergo heart transplantation (HT) or mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as a permanent implant (i.e., destination therapy [DT]) and their caregivers, risk factors for poor HRQOL, adverse event and symptom burden, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Advanced HF patients, 60-80 years of age, are an appropriate target group for this study because they are receiving HTs and MCS devices more frequently, and despite a greater risk for poor clinical outcomes, they have acceptable rates of survival. Using a prospective, longitudinal design, our multi-site comparative effectiveness research will compare HRQOL outcomes in patients who receive HT or DT MCS and their caregivers, from baseline to 2 years post-operatively. The primary aim of this proposed study is to determine whether older advanced HF patients who undergo DT MCS, as compared to patients who undergo HT, experience non-inferior change in overall HRQOL (primary), and domains of HRQOL (physical, mental, and social) from baseline through 2 years after surgery. Secondary Aims are (1.) to determine whether caregivers of older advanced HF patients who undergo DT MCS, compared to caregivers of older advanced HF patients who undergo HT, experience non-inferior change in overall HRQOL and domains from baseline through 2 years after surgery; (2.-3.) to identify risk factors related to poorer overall HRQOL in older DT MCS patients and their caregivers, as compared to older HT patients and their caregivers, at 2 years after surgery; (4.) to determine whether older advanced HF patients who undergo DT MCS, as compared to patients who undergo HT, have non-inferior rates of freedom from adverse events &amp; symptoms at 1 and 2 years after surgery; and (5) to evaluate the distribution of QALYs in older advanced HF patients who undergo DT MCS, as compared to patients who undergo HT at 2 years after surgery. Our proposed study will contribute to better patient-centered care of older advanced HF patients and their caregivers, by informing decision making and guiding strategies to enhance post-operative HRQOL.</detailed_description>
