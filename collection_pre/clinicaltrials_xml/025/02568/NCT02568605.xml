	<brief_summary>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition where accumulation of fat in the liver leads to metabolic dysfunction. Currently there are no approved treatments for NAFLD. Part of the metabolic dysfunction may arise through changes in the gut microbiota. Prebiotic fibres have beneficial effects on glucose tolerance, body weight, and gut microbiota; therefore they may have potential as part of a dietary strategy for NAFLD treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prebiotic Fibre Supplementation and Gut Microbiota in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of this study is to assess the effect of prebiotic fibre supplementation, in conjunction with diet-induced weight loss, on reduction in liver fat and injury. Primary Objective - determine the change in hepatic injury (fibrosis and inflammation) and hepatic fat (percent fat) over 6 months in NAFLD patients treated with prebiotic or placebo during weight loss. Secondary Objectives - determine the changes in appetite, body composition, glycemic and insulinemic responses, quality of life with prebiotic or placebo during weight loss, and examine mechanisms related to prebiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota and lipogenesis.</detailed_description>
