	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotic yoghurt on the development of gingival inflammation. Fifty-one periodontally healthy individuals were given standard oral hygiene instructions and randomly divided into two groups. The test group subjects (n=26) consumed probiotic yoghurt containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and the control subjects (n=25) natural yoghurt for 28 days. Following yoghurt consumption, mechanical plaque control was interrupted for the next 5 days in both groups. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples and clinical data (consisted of plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, bleeding on probing) were collected at baseline, after 28 and 33 days. Interleukin-1β levels were determined in GCF by ELISA.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Probiotics are viable bacteria with scientifically confirmed health benefits for gastrointestinal system. However, there is paucity of information on its impact in periodontal disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotic yoghurt on the development of gingival inflammation. Fifty-one periodontally healthy individuals were given standard oral hygiene instructions and randomly divided into two groups. The test group subjects (n=26) consumed probiotic yoghurt containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and the control subjects (n=25) natural yoghurt for 28 days. Following yoghurt consumption, mechanical plaque control was interrupted for the next 5 days in both groups. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples and clinical data (consisted of plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, bleeding on probing) were collected at baseline, after 28 and 33 days. Interleukin-1β levels were determined in GCF by ELISA.</detailed_description>
