	<brief_summary>This is an open label safety and feasibility trial using Acthar® in addition to the investigators center-specific standard therapy, which could include increase in maintenance immunosuppression, high dose IVIG (2 g/Kg), and/or Rituximab, in patients with CAMR.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Chronic Antibody-mediated Rejection in Kidney Transplant With Acthar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will receive Acthar® 40 units twice a week subcutaneously for 2 weeks. If the drug is well tolerated the dose will be increased to 80 units twice a week for another 22 weeks. The patients will be maintained on their center-specific standard maintenance regimen, typically consisting of Tacrolimus, mycephenolate mofetil/Sodium, and prednisone. After screening for the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the patients will be consented and enrolled in the study. The initial visit and subsequent study-related visits at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks will include routine evaluation and physical examination and laboratory studies including CBC, electrolyte panel, eGFR, albumin, liver enzymes, and CNI/sirulimus drug level, according to the center's standard of care. DSA will be tested at week 24, and 52 and patients will undergo a biopsy at week 52, as a part of the investigators standard of care. The biopsies will be evaluated by light and electron microscopy using standard histological Banff criteria, and staining for CD68.</detailed_description>
