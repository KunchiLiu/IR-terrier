	<brief_summary>Preoperative radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer increases the possibility of complete resection and anal sphincter preservation. However, a treatment period of from 5 to 6 weeks is an obstacle of proper surgical intervention. Also, radiotherapy itself is confronting challenges for maximizing the therapeutic effect and minimizing the side effects. Electro-hyperthermia is appropriate treatment method to solve these kinds of problems. In this clinical trial, therapeutic effect of the high-frequency electro-hyperthermia is to be verified during preoperative radiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer. The ultimate goal is to establish a safe and effective treatment protocol.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preoperative radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer increases the possibility of complete resection and anal sphincter preservation. However, a treatment period of from 5 to 6 weeks is an obstacle of proper surgical intervention. Also, radiotherapy itself is confronting challenges for maximizing the therapeutic effect and minimizing the side effects. Electro-hyperthermia is appropriate treatment method to solve these kinds of problems. In this clinical trial, therapeutic effect of the high-frequency electro-hyperthermia is to be verified during preoperative radiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer. The endpoint of the trial is treatment safety and non-inferiority of tumor regression to conventional schedule of preoperative radiotherapy.</detailed_description>
