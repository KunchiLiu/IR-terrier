	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability of different doses of JNJ-63871860 (ExPEC4V) in participants greater than or equal to (&gt;=)18 years of age and to evaluate the dose-dependent immunogenicity of ExPEC as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study in Healthy Adults to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Different Doses of JNJ-63871860</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving), randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect), parallel group, multicenter (when more than one hospital work on a medical research study) study, with a single-blind, long-term follow-up to Year 4. The study will be split into 2 phases, a double-blind phase with screening (Day -12 to Day 1), Vaccination (Day 1) and Safety and Immunogenicity Follow-up (Day 1 up to Day 360), and a single-blind long-term follow-up phase thereafter until Year 4 for placebo participants and ExPEC4V participants in the dose group selected based on the primary (Day 30) analysis. Participants will be stratified in 2 age groups (&gt;=18 to less than [&lt;] 50 years and &gt;=50 years) and in each dosing group in each stratum randomized to a single vaccination with 1 of 5 doses of ExPEC4V or placebo. The duration of the double-blind phase (from randomization/vaccination) will be approximately 360 days for placebo participants and participants in the dose group selected based on the primary analysis, and approximately 180 days for the participants in the other groups. The duration of the single-blind long-term follow-up phase will be approximately 3 years after the double-blind phase for placebo participants and participants in the selected dose group. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant must be in stable health. Participants may have underlying illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, hyperlipoproteinemia, or hypothyroidism, as long as their symptoms/signs are medically controlled. If they are on medication for a condition, the medication dose must have been stable for at least 12 weeks preceding vaccination and is expected to remain stable for the duration of the study Participant must meet the protocol defined laboratory criteria within 12 days before Day 1 Participant must be able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all study procedures Participant must have a body mass index (BMI) of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 35 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2) A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1 before vaccination Participant is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or has a positive urine pregnancy test on Day 1 before vaccination, or is planning to become pregnant 3 months after study vaccine administration or within 3 months after study vaccine administration, or subject is a man who plans to father a child while enrolled in this study or within 3 months after study vaccine administration Participant has an acute illness, acute infection, or fever (body temperature greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 38 degree Celsius) Participant has a serious chronic disorder, including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or clinically significant congestive heart failure, requirement for supplemental oxygen, end stage renal disease with or without dialysis, clinically unstable cardiac disease, or has any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the subject (example compromise the wellbeing) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocolspecified assessments Participant has a history of neoplastic disease (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer that was successfully treated) within the past 5 years or a history of any hematological malignancy Participant has known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (including leukemia, HIV seropositivity), has received immunosuppressive therapy (such as anticancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy or cytotoxic drugs), within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy [prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months]), or has chronic active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, documented by hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody, respectively</criteria>
