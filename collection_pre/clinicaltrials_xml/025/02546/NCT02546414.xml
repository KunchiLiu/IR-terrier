	<brief_title>Platelet Count（PC）/Spleen Diameter(SD) Ratio to Predict the Variceal Haemorrhage in HBV Cirrhotic Patients in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal variceal bleeding remains the leading cause of acute mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Using noninvasive parameters for high-risk variceal haemorrhage may reduce the need for endoscopies. The ratio of platelet count/diameter of the spleen (PC/SD ratio) is the principal noninvasive predictor of esophageal varices. This was an analytical cross-sectional study to validate the diagnostic test for HBV hepatic cirrhosis and was performed between January 2013 and August 2015. This study is to validate the PC/SD ratio to identification of those patients with high bleeding risk and selection for prophylactic treatment.</detailed_description>
