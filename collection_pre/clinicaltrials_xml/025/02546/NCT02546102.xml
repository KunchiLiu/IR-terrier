	<brief_summary>ICT-107 consists of dendritic cells, prepared from autologous mononuclear cells that are pulsed with six synthetic peptides that were derived from tumor associated antigens (TAA) present on glioblastoma tumor cells. This is a Phase 3 study to evaluate ICT-107 in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Subjects will be randomized to receive standard of care chemoradiation (temozolomide (TMZ) with either ICT-107 or a blinded control. Reinfusion with the pulsed dendritic cells should stimulate cytotoxic T cells to specifically target glioblastoma tumour cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled Study of ICT-107 in Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double blind Phase III study where eligible subjects are randomized into two treatment arms following the SOC primary treatment with chemoradiation: Arm 1 will receive ICT-107 in combination with the standard of care, temozolomide (TMZ), Arm 2 will receive TMZ with a blinded control. A 1:1 randomization will be employed, where ARM 1 will receive ICT-107 and Arm 2 will receive placebo control. All subjects must be HLA-A2+. All subjects must have glioblastoma tissue that has tumor assessment for MGMT methylation status prior to randomization (for stratification). Subjects will have had tumor resection and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to enrollment into the study. After signing of written informed consent and any required privacy compliance forms and screening, enrolled subjects will undergo large volume apheresis at the study site for collection of PBMCs. Apheresis product will be sent to the manufacturing site where both active therapy (ICT-107) and control will be prepared for each subject prior to randomization The study period consists of 4 time periods; a 6-week Post-Surgery Standard of Care Treatment Phase where subjects receive radiotherapy and TMZ; TMZ and radiation to be initiated no more than 8 weeks after surgical resection of glioblastoma; a Rest Period of no more than 14 days where subjects are reassessed for eligibility, and then randomized; a 4 week Induction Phase where study therapy (ICT-107 or Control) is given weekly; followed by a Maintenance Phase where study therapy is given monthly for 11 months, and then every 6 months until either progression, withdrawal from the study, death, or the supply of autologous study therapy is exhausted. Randomized subjects will receive 4 weekly administrations of subject-specific study therapy (ICT-107 or Control) during the Induction Phase. No TMZ will be given during the 4 week Induction Phase. Each study therapy injection will be delivered intradermally (axilla). The Maintenance Phase will consist of administration of subject-specific study therapy monthly for 11 months after the Induction Phase (for a total of 15 injections over 12 months during the Induction and Maintenance Phases), and then every 6 mos. thereafter until depletion or confirmation of progressive disease (PD). During the Maintenance Phase (where ICT-107 or control are given monthly), the administration of TMZ and subject specific study therapy or control will be separated in time by approximately 2 weeks (see Section 9.1.4). Pre-treatment, treatment and assessment schedules will be the same for all subjects.</detailed_description>
