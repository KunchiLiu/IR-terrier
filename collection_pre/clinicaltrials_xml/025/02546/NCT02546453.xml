	<brief_summary>The search for genetic alterations in primary tumor by NGS techniques followed by the detection of these alterations in circulating tumor DNA and/or CTC/DTC present in peripheral samples (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, bone marrow, possibly urine) collected during several steps and after the treatment could be a tool to monitor the response during and after the treatment.</brief_summary>
