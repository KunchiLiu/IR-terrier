	<brief_summary>The current study focuses on terms of use of Insulin Aspart, fast analogue of human insulin and commonly used in the treatment of type 1 diabetes, where it obtained the marketing authorization for this indication. In the patient who have an insulin pump, insulin Aspart is given daily like a pre-prandial bolus (just before the meal). However, many patients perform their bolus after the meal. However this insulin administration modality is not clearly studied in the literature.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Insulin's Injection Before or After the Meal in Type 1 Diabetic Patients Treated With Insulin Pump</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The functional insulin therapy is a method for adjusting insulin doses which tends to mimic the physiology, especially when food intake with proportional dose calculation to the amount of carbohydrates ingested by the use of ratios. This method of adaptation, increasingly used in France, is an extension in the use of subcutaneous insulin pump with a more precise determination of bolus doses with meals, and use of aids dose calculations (assistant wizard for instance). In practice every day, some patients perform their bolus immediately after eating, not just before, allowing them to know exactly the amount of ingested carbohydrates and not the one provided in advance. This study is very interesting because it allows to compare the injection of an analogous bolus of fast insulin before and after the meal.</detailed_description>
