	<brief_title>A Registry of Participants With Prostate Cancer in Asia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), prospective (observation of a population for a sufficient number of persons over a sufficient number of years to generate incidence or mortality rates subsequent to the selection of the study group), longitudinal, observational registry (clinical study in which participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions, but the investigator does not assign participants to specific interventions [as in an interventional study])of PC participants. The following 3 participant cohorts will be enrolled: high-risk localized PC, non-metastatic biochemically recurrent PC, and metastatic PC. This is an observational study and treatment decisions and clinical management of participants will follow routine clinical practice. Medical care given to participants will not be influenced by participation in the study. Enrolled participants will be prospectively followed throughout their course of treatment, during which data on PC treatment, clinical progression, and outcomes (including death) will be collected. At the end of registry medical resource utilization (MRU) will also be collected. The maximum observational period will be 5 years. Safety will be monitored throughout the study for participants being treated with JNJ products.</detailed_description>
