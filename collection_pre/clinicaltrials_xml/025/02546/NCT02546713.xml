	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of abutment macro-design on soft and hard tissue responses. This trial is designed as a randomized controlled clinical study in which two groups of fourteen partially edentulous patients will have as part of their treatment one implant placed in the maxillary premolar region.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abutment Macro Design and Peri-implant Tissues</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Implant placement and abutment design will be planned with a computer software for guided implant treatment (SIMPLANT). The surgical implant placement will be performed under manufacturer's protocol by placing the implant platform 1mm below the buccal aspect of the osteotomy (Koutouzis et al 2013). Virtually designed, permanent CAD-CAM fabricated abutments (ATLANTIS, DENTSPLY) with different configuration of the subcritical contour (emergence shape) will be connected to the implants and temporary crowns will be delivered. Implants of the Group 1 will have permanent abutments with a concave configuration of the subcritical contour (emergence shape). Implants of the Group 2 will have permanent abutments with a convex configuration of the subcritical contour (emergence shape). The patients will be restored with single crowns 3 months following implant installation. A randomization protocol will be produced from a computer-generated list for the distribution of subjects in the two treatment groups.</detailed_description>
