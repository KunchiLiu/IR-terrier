	<criteria>Individuals aged 18 or older Documentation of biopsyproven sarcoidosis in the lungs and/or lymph nodes Clinical suspicion of cardiac involvement defined as the presence of any of the following: highdegree AV nodal block, complete bundle branch block, reduced left or right ventricular systolic function, any cardiac arrhythmia, and/or unexplained chest pain, dyspnea or syncope PET/CT imaging demonstrating abnormal myocardial FDG uptake consistent with active inflammatory myocardium. Current use of oral steroids or any other immunosuppressive medication, as they may, in theory, suppress OctreoScan uptake in the heart. Patients with history of neuroendocrine tumors (specially insulinomas) Patients taking the medication Octreotide Patients on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding</criteria>
