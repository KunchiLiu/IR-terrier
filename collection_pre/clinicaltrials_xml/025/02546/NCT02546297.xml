	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine which treatment is more effective and safer for the patients in COPD C group with bronchiectasis.The research results will help guide physicians to select appropriate individualized treatment and hopefully provide some evidence-based medicine proofs for revising guide.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparisons of Inhaled LAMA or ICS+LABA for COPD With Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diagnosis and treatment of COPD and bronchiectasis together seems to be more complicated than the diagnosis and treatment of either condition alone. According to the GOLDï¼Œthere are two treatments for patients with COPD in group C: ICS combined with LABA or LAMA alone. However, it has not yet been demonstrated about which method is more effective for the patients with COPD in group C and bronchiectasis. This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, case-control trial. Patients are divided into two groups, one group inhaled with ICS and LABA (Symbicort), another group inhaled with LAMA (Tiotropium Bromide).The course of treatment is 12 months. The treatment will be exchanged in the 7th month. The investigators will also assess other relevant outcomes, including the quality of life (QOL) score, pulmonary function test and the incidence of adverse event.</detailed_description>
