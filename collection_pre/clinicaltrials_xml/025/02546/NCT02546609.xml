	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine if NS-0200 can reduce the amount of liver fat in patients diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study will compare two doses of NS-0200 to placebo in NAFLD patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Of NS-0200 Versus Placebo On Hepatic Fat Content In Patients With Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, 16-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the effect of two fixed-dose combinations of leucine, metformin and sildenafil, NS-0200 compared to placebo, on the reduction of liver fat in patients diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Subjects meeting all the inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of three study arms. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the change in hepatic fat content assessed by proton-density-fat-fraction (PDFF) employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in subjects from : Screening/Visit 2 (Day-7/Week-1) to Study Termination/Visit 8 (Day 112/Week 16) receiving two fixed-dose combinations of leucine, metformin and sildenafil compared to placebo. Secondary objectives will also assess changes in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, change in circulating cytokeratin 18, a surrogate marker of necro-inflammation, change in HbA1c, change in fasting glucose, insulin and insulin sensitivity, change in blood lipids such as cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and changes in in C-reactive protein. In addition this study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of NS-0200. Patients will have two screening visits, the first to determine their eligibility based on lab tests and the second based on the percentage of hepatic fat assessed by MRI imaging. Once qualified, patients will be randomly assigned to either one of the treatment groups or the placebo control group and monitored for a total of 16 weeks. Patients will return to the clinic each month for lab tests, and routine examinations. At the conclusion of the treatment period patients will again undergo an MRI scan to examine the percentage of hepatic fat.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 1875 at study entry. 2. Is male, or female and, if female, meets all of the following criteria: 1. Not breastfeeding 2. Postmenopausal or negative serum pregnancy test result (human chorionic gonadotropin, beta subunit [βhCG]) at Screening /Visit 1 (Day14/Week2) (not required for hysterectomized females) 3. If of childbearing potential (including perimenopausal women who have had a menstrual period within one year) must practice and be willing to continue to practice appropriate birth control (defined as a method which results in a low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year, when used consistently and correctly, such as double barrier methods [male condom with spermicide, with or without cervical cap or diaphragm], implants, injectables, oral contraceptives [must have been using for at least the last 3 months], some intrauterine contraceptive devices, tubal ligation, or in an established relationship with a vasectomized partner) during the entire duration of the study. 3. Has been diagnosed with NAFLD via CT (positive for excess liver fat), ultrasound (positive for excess liver fat), MRI (PDFF showing &gt; 15% liver fat) or via biopsy (showing &gt;33% fat) within the past six months. If diagnosis was between 3 and 6 months prior to Screening, an ultrasound (positive for excess liver fat) is required prior to the Screening /Visit 1 (Day14/Week2) MRI. 4. Has liver fat (as measured by PDFF via MRI) greater than 15% at Screening/Visit 2 (Day7/Week1) 5. Has had ALT levels &gt;30 U/L for men, &gt;19 U/L for women measured within 8 weeks of enrollment 6. Has an HbA1c equal to or less than 9% at Screening /Visit 1 (Day14/Week2) 7. Has a BMI between 25kg/m2 and 40 kg/m2 8. Otherwise stable health for preceding twelve weeks 9. Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis) either normal or with abnormalities consistent with NAFLD. 10. Is able to read, understand, and sign the informed consent forms (ICF) and, when applicable, an authorization to use and disclose protected health information form (consistent with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 [HIPAA] legislation), communicate with the investigator, and understand and comply with protocol requirements. 1. Clinically significant renal dysfunction defined as a serum creatinine concentration &gt;1.4 mg/dL (females) or &gt;1.6 mg/dL (males) or a blood urea nitrogen concentration &gt;45 mg/dL at screening. 2.

OCT2/MATE inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine, quinidine, and pyrimethamine) Methotrexate Tamoxifen Corticosteroids (Nasal steroids are allowed if the subject has been on a stable dose for the past 12 weeks and the dose employed does not exceed the maximal recommended dose.) Estrogens Amiodarone Valproic acid Coumadin Isoniazide Nucleoside analogues used for the treatment of HIV infections 14. Any dietary supplement other than multivitamins 3. Evidence of significant alcohol consumption (defined as &gt;7 drinks/week for females and &gt;14 drinks/week for males) within 6 months prior to randomization or presence or suspicion of other forms of chronic liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis (&gt;1:160 ANA), Wilson's disease, Hemochromatosis (Ferritin &gt;1000 ug/L and percent iron saturation &gt;45%), hepatitis A, B or C) 4.
