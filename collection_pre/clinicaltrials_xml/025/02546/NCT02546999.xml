	<brief_summary>In Norway, about 60% of all children with cerebral palsy (CP) are being treated with botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) at 6 years of age, mainly in the legs. Despite this widespread use of the drug, the evidence for a positive effect on walking is insufficient. Moreover, large variation in effect is seen by clinicians. The main objective of the present study is to investigate whether injections with BoNT-A in the calf muscles make walking easier in children with spastic CP within 6 months, reflected by reduced energy cost during walking.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Botulinum Toxin A Make Walking Easier in Children With Cerebral Palsy?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an industry independent multicentre clinical trial. The randomization will be done by a computer number random generator and will be carried out and held by the unit of Applied Clinical Research at NTNU. Two strata: age and center. The study will be conducted according to Consort guidelines and guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. It is approved by the local Ethical committee (REK Nord) and the Norwegian Drug Agency. Primary research question is: Do BoNT-A injections in the calf muscles make walking easier in children with CP? Secondary research questions: 1) Is improved ease of walking associated with increased activity? 2) Is ease of walking associated with perceived benefit of BoNT-A? 3) Do BoNT-A injections in the calf muscles reduce recurrent musculoskeletal pain? The participants will receive the treatment with both local anaesthesia and conscious sedation with oral or nasal benzodiazepines.Outcome measures are made at baseline and 4, 12 and 24 weeks after treatment, with primary endpoint at 12 weeks. Data will be analyzed using a linear mixed model (LMM). Difference in time effect of the primary outcome measure (energy cost during walking) between the treated and placebo groups, with a post hoc test comparing group differences between baseline and of the primary outcome measure at 12 weeks post injections. Secondary, the same model will be used to test for an effect also at 4 and 24 weeks post injection. Subgroup analysis will be made according to age, use of ankle foot orthosis, prior treatment with botulinum toxin and center. A substudy will be conducted within the frames of this RCT, aiming to identify characteristics of those who respond to the treatment compared to those who do not respond (outcome measures 7,8 and 9).</detailed_description>
