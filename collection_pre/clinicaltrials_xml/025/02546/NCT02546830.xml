	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the use feasibility of the FreeO2 system so as to deliver automatically oxygen in the post anesthesia care unit in a patient population admitted for major abdominal and thoracic surgery. The investigators' hypothesis is that FreeO2 system will provide a better control of the oxygen saturation and reduce postoperative hypoxaemia.</brief_summary>
