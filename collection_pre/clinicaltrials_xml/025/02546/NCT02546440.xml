	<brief_summary>The main objective of the trial is to investigate whether oral treatment of patients suffering from cutaneous T cell lymphoma with dimethylfumarate is leading to a significant improvement of modified severity assessment tool (mSWAT) values in the skin after 24 weeks of treatment (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints will be CTCL severity index, dermatologic life quality index, itching measured by a VAS and the blood involvement if applicable. Primary: safety and efficacy of DMF treatment in CTCL Secondary: CTCL severity index, Dermatologic Life Quality index, VAS for itching, blood involvement if appl.</brief_summary>
