	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is evaluation of deep molecular response (MR4.5; BCR-ABL IS &lt; 0.0032%) after 24 months of therapy with nilotinib in newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase CML. Via the use of MR4.5 EUTOS ('European Treatment and Outcome Study for CML') laboratories adequate and reliable molecular monitoring as a key parameter for assessing molecular milestones is fostered. Furthermore this trial aims to investigate early prediction of outcome in newly diagnosed patients with nilotinib by assessing the individual decline of BCR-ABL transcripts. Quality of life will bemeasured via use of the EORTC CML-24 questionnaire.</brief_summary>
