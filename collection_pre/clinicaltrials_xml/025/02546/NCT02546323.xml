	<brief_title>A phase3 Study Measuring the Effect of Rosuvastatin 20 mg on Carotid Intima-Media Thickness in Chinese Subjects With Subclinical Atherosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter parallel group study assessing the effects of rosuvastatin 20 mg treatment for 104 weeks on the change in intimamedia thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery (CCA), carotid bulb, and internal carotid artery (ICA) in adult Chinese subjects with subclinical atherosclerosis.</detailed_description>
