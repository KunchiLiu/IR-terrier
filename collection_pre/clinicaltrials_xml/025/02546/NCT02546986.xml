	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-486 With MK-3475 to Treat Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, multicenter, international, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind study to assess the safety and efficacy of CC-486 and pembrolizumab combination therapy versus pembrolizumab plus placebo in previously treated subjects with locally advanced or metastatic Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Approximately 90 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive CC-486 plus pembrolizumab or placebo plus pembrolizumab as follows: - Arm A: CC-486 300 mg administered orally daily on days 1-14 plus pembrolizumab 200 mg administered as a 30-minute IV infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle - Arm B: Placebo administered orally daily on days 1-14 plus pembrolizumab 200 mg administered as a 30-minute IV infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle Safety will be evaluated by an independent data monitoring committee (DMC). A safety analysis will be performed in the first 10 subjects in each arm after the last enrolled subject has completed 1 cycle of treatment. Randomization will be stratified between treatment arms by: - Histology (non-squamous versus squamous) The decision to discontinue a subject, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor, remains the responsibility of the treating physician. However, prior to discontinuing a subject, the Investigator may contact the medical monitor and forward appropriate supporting documents for review and discussion. The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements. Primary analysis will be conducted when 70 PFS events have occurred.</detailed_description>

Female of childbearing potential (FCBP) (defined as a sexually mature woman who 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral oophorectomy (the surgical removal of both ovaries) or, 2) if ≥ 45 years old has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time during the preceding 24 consecutive months)) must: 1. Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator prior to starting study therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study, and after end of study treatment. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence* from heterosexual contact. 2. Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use, and be able to comply with two effective methods of contraception without interruption, 28 days prior to starting IP, during the study therapy (including dose interruptions), and for 120 days after discontinuation (or longer if required by local requirements) of study therapy. The two methods of contraception can either be two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. 10. Male subjects must practice true abstinence* (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to the use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for at least 3 months following investigational product discontinuation (or longer if required by local requirements), even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. * True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Note: Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 11. Subject is willing to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. 12. Subject understands and voluntarily signs an informed consent document prior to any study related assessments/procedures are conducted. 1.
