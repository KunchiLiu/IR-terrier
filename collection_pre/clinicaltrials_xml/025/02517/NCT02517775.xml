	<brief_summary>Accumulating evidence from epidemiological and human intervention studies indicates that the cardiovascular health benefits of diets rich in fruits and vegetables are (in part) related to their (poly)phenol content. Cranberries are rich in (poly)phenols compounds, in particular anthocyanins, but also phenolic acids. At present, a small number of randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of berry (poly)phenols on validated surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease risk has shown promising results. However, to date, very few human studies have specifically investigated the effects of cranberry (poly)phenols on cardiovascular function in healthy subjects. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the time and intake-dependent effect of cranberry consumption on vascular function in healthy subjects. This information is necessary for the planning of long-term studies aiming to assess the potential beneficial effects of cranberries, using optimal amounts at optimal time points. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the potential role of cranberry (poly)phenols in the modulation of vascular function by monitoring changes in vascular function together with the major (poly)phenol derivatives/metabolites in plasma and urine.</brief_summary>
