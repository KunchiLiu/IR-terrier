	<brief_title>Community Point Distribution of Insecticide Treated Bed Nets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Households were asked to attend a community point distribution of ITNs in one of three zones in Zambia's Eastern Province. Households that had been registered to receive ITNs were then randomized to one of five groups that received a CHW visit at different intervals. Group 1 was visited 1-3 days after distribution, group 2 was visited 5-7 days after, group 3 was visited 10-12 days after, group 4 was visited 15-17 days after, and group 5 did not receive a hang-up visit. Groups 1-4 were categorized as having received a hang-up visit and group 5 was categorized as not having received a hang-up visit. All households in all five groups were visited at 7-11 weeks after the distribution and again at 5-6 months after the distribution to assess short- and medium-term ITN retention and usage.</detailed_description>
