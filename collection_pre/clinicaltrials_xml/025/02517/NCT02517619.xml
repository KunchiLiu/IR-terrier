	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ocular iontophoresis with dexamethasone phosphate ophthalmic solution EGP-437 using the EyeGate® II Drug Delivery System (EGDS) compared to prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension (1%) in patients with non-infectious anterior segment uveitis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This will be a Phase 3, randomized, double-masked, parallel arm, positive-controlled non-inferiority study, in which up to 250 subjects (approximately 125 subjects per treatment arm) will be enrolled at up to 60 clinical sites. Patients with non-infectious anterior segment uveitis who are interested in participating in the study will be provided an informed consent form prior to screening. Screening/Baseline procedures which include BCVA, slit lamp examination, fundus exam, IOP by tonometry will be used to determine eligibility.</detailed_description>
