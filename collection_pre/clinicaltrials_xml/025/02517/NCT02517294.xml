	<brief_summary>Comparison is made between standard nasotracheal tubes and a specially designed nasotracheal tube during nasotracheal intubation in children undergoing general anesthesia for dental surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>, "Mucosal Injury During Nasotracheal Intubation for Dental Procedures in Children-does the Tube Design Matter?"</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Parker flex-tip, midline-beveled nasotracheal tube theoretically slides past obstruction in the nasopharynx causing less mucosal damage than standard nasotracheal tubes. The investigators aim to test whether mucosal injury during nasotracheal intubation in children undergoing general anesthesia for dental procedures can thus be minimized taking into consideration adenoid size, and differences in nasopharyngeal diameter.</detailed_description>
