	<brief_summary>As a direct consequence of exposure to microgravity, astronauts experience a number of physiological changes which can lead to serious medical implications. Most immediate and significant is the headward shift of body fluids and the removal of gravitational loading from bone and muscles, resulting in progressive changes of the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems. The cardiovascular systems is subject to rapid changes which has been demonstrated in studies of short term (shuttle) and long term missions to Skylab and MIR. Our main hypothesis is that there is a linear relationship between the gravity level (0G, 0.16G, 0.38G, 1G, 1.8G) and the cardiovascular parameters (heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure and blood pressure variability (BPV) as well the spectral analysis of HRV and BPV.</brief_summary>
