	<brief_summary>A phase 2, randomized, placebo controlled trial evaluating the effects of n intravenous iron supplementation on chronic fatigue in IBD patients with controlled disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iron Supplementation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Patients With Chronic Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will evaluate a 6 months therapy with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose. Patients will undergo a 2-5 days screening period and then will be treated every 4 weeks with iron supplementation/placebo. At every visit, hematology and blood iron levels will be evaluated. Treatment will be temporarily stopped in case of either Hemoglobin levels above 16 g/dl or ferritin above 800 ng/ml (level decreased to 500 ng/ml in case of Transferrin-Iron Saturation Percentage above 50%). Study team will be composed of blinded and unblinded personnel and dedicated infusion devices will be used to ensure the double blinding.</detailed_description>
