	<brief_summary>This is a prospective open-labeled phase I trial based on a dose escalating study design assessing two dose levels of sirolimus when prescribed in combination with metronomic cyclophosphamide (CP), methotrexate (MT) and zoledronic acid (ZA) followed by an expansion cohort once the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is established.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metronomic Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor With Bone Metastasis and Advanced Pretreated Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dose escalation part of the trial will be concerned on adults with advanced solid tumor with bone metastasis and young and adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic osteosarcoma. The Expansion cohort will be conducted on young and adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic osteosarcoma.</detailed_description>
