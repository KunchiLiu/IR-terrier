	<brief_summary>This is a prospective study to identify molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies in patients with unresectable or metastatic cancer. This is a protocol to study clinical characteristics and biopsy tissue of patients with oncogene-driven cancer who have had previous clinical response to targeted therapy and subsequently experience progression of disease. The tissues and other specimens will be used to carry out laboratory studies to explore the molecular basis of acquired resistance to targeted therapies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Trial to Study the Evolution of Clonal Architecture of Tumors From Patients Treated With Molecular Targeted Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patients diagnosed with unresectable or metastatic cancer and who fulfill the following eligibility criteria will be considered eligible for this study: 1. Patient affiliated to a social security regimen 2. Therapy with a targeted agent (as defined in appendix 1). 3. Tumor lesion accessible to core biopsies (malignant effusions can represent an alternative) 4. Patient who is fully informed, able to comply with the protocol and who signed the informed consent. 5. Availability of initial tumor material (ideally frozen, or nonBouin fixed paraffin embedded material) acquired before exposure to the targeted therapy Note: Patients may have received other treatments since treatment with targeted therapies including radiation or chemotherapy, before undergoing the study biopsy. 1. Coagulation abnormality prohibiting a biopsy</criteria>
