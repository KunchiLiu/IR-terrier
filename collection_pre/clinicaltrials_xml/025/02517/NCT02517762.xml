	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate acute low back pain, its origin, mechanisms, the cause of pain, evaluation of treatments and development. Employees from a large local manufacturing company are sent for a complete orthopedic and pain evaluation immediately after onset of acute low back pain. The patients go through x-ray examinations, physical examinations, they complete a battery of questionnaires covering history of acute low back pain, lifestyle characteristics, work place factors, psychosocial factors, and indicate pain intensity and pain locations. Thereafter the patients are randomly allocated to one of two treatment advices: stay active as much as possible in spite of pain or adjust the activity to the pain. During seven days after the medical examination the patients wear a pedometer attached to the waist and annotate the number of steps and pain intensity, pain location and pain-related disability in a diary. A numeric graphic scale is used for pain intensity. Work absenteeism and sick leave due to the current acute back pain is collected from the company records. Immediate inclusion after pain onset is facilitated with continuous communication with the manufactory company. Physical activity and pain development over the seven days is investigated statistically using linear mixed models for repeated measures.</detailed_description>
