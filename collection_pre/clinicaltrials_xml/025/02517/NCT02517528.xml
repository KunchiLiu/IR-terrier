	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 3, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABT 450/r/ ABT 267 and ABT-333 coadministered with ribavirin (RBV) for 12 weeks in HCV genotype 1b, treatment naïve and Interferon (IFN) (alpha, beta or pegIFN) plus RBV treatment-experienced Asian adults with compensated cirrhosis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Chinese, South Korean, and Taiwanese descent with full Chinese, South Korean, and Taiwanese parentage. 2. Chronic HCVinfection prior to study enrollment. 3. Screening laboratory result indicating HCV genotype 1binfection. 4. Compensated cirrhosis defined as a ChildPugh Score of less than or equal to 6 at Screening. 5. Per local standard practice, documentation of cirrhosis by one of the following methods: Diagnosis on previous liver biopsy or liver biopsy conducted during screening e.g., Metavir Score of &gt; 3 (including 3/4 or 3 4), Ishak score of &gt; 4 or, FibroScan score ≥ 14.6 kPa within 6 months of Screening or during the Screening Period. 1. HCV genotype performed during screening indicating unable to genotype or infection with any other HCV genotype. 2. Positive test result at Screening for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or HBV DNA &gt; Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) if HBsAg negative, or antiHuman Immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab). 3. Use of known strong inducers of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) or strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 within 2 weeks or within 10 halflives, whichever is longer, of the respective medication/supplement prior to study drug administration. 4. Any current or past clinical evidence of ChildPugh B or C classification or clinical history of liver decompensation including ascites (noted on physical exam), variceal bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy. 5. Serum AlphaFetoprotein (sAFP) &gt; 100 ng/mL at Screening. 6. Confirmed presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) indicated on imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3 months prior to Screening or on an ultrasound performed at Screening (a positive ultrasound result should be confirmed with CT scan or MRI.) 7. Any primary cause of liver disease other than chronic HCVinfection, including but not limited to the following: Hemochromatosis Alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency Wilson's disease Autoimmune hepatitis Alcoholic liver disease Drugrelated liver disease Steatosis and steatohepatitis on a liver biopsy coincident with HCVrelated changes would not be considered exclusionary unless the steatohepatitis is considered to be the primary cause of the liver disease. 8. Screening laboratory analyses showing abnormal kidney, hepatic, or hematologic function.</criteria>
