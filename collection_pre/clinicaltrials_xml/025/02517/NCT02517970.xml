	<brief_summary>The objective of the proposed research is to conduct a within-subject experimental study that will assess the effect of environmental distractions on a mothers' ability to recognize and feed in response to infants' feeding cues. Investigators hypothesize that mothers will spend significantly more time looking at their technology compared to looking at their infant, which will be negatively associated with the mothers' responsiveness to her infant. This will have a positive association with infant intake during the feeding. Investigators also hypothesize that mothers will show less sensitivity when distracted when compared to when they are not distracted.</brief_summary>
