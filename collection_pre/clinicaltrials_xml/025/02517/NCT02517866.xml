	<brief_title>Azilsartan Medoxomil in the Treatment of Essential Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes in Asia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called azilsartan medoxomil. Azilsartan medoxomil is being tested to treat people who have essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study will look at the blood pressure of people who take azilsartan medoxomil in addition to standard care for T2DM. The study will enroll approximately 363 patients. All participants will receive azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg tablets to be administered orally, once a day, for 12 weeks. If a participant's blood pressure (BP) has not reached BP goal of &lt;140/85 mmHg at week 6, azilsartan medoxomil dose will be up-titrated to 80 mg daily. All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the study. This multi-center trial will be conducted in Asia. The overall time to participate in this study is 14 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

Female participants must be either of nonchildbearing potential, ie, surgically sterilized (defined as having undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy and/or bilateral salpingectomy; tubal ligation alone is not considered sufficient) or one year after the last menstrual period; or, if of childbearing potential and participant is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner, must agree to use routinely adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of study. 1.
