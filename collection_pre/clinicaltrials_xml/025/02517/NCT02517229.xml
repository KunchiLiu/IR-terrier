	<brief_summary>The scientific goal of this experiment is to evaluate changes in balance control in response to microgravity during reactive balance tasks. For that purpose, kinematic and neuromuscular parameters under microgravity are compared to normal gravity conditions. To induce postural responses among the test subjects, an electromagnetic maneuverable postural platform will be used in order to randomly elicit perturbations. Postural reactions will be quantified by means of mechanical and electromyographic data. In Addition, peripheral nerve stimulation will be used to assess the spinal excitability by means of H-reflex recordings. H-reflex measurements were chosen as they allow reliable information about inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms taking place at the spinal level.</brief_summary>
