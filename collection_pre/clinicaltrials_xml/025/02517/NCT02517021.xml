	<brief_summary>NEPA-15-18 is a clinical study assessing safety of pro-netupitant and palonosetron, two antiemetic drugs, given with oral dexamethasone. The objective of the study is to evaluate if pro-netupitant and palonosetron are safe when administered to prevent nausea and vomiting after administration of repeated cycles of chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Cycle 1 Signed written informed consent Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy. Naïve to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous biological or hormonal therapy will be permitted. Scheduled to receive at least 4 repeated consecutive cycles of the following highly emetogenic reference chemotherapies (HEC), alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents on Day 1: cisplatin administered as a single IV dose of ≥ 70 mg/m2; cyclophosphamide ≥1500 mg/m2; carmustine (BCNU) &gt;250mg/m2; dacarbazine (DTIC); mechloretamine (nitrogen mustard) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2 . If a patient is female, she shall be of nonchildbearing potential or of childbearing potential using reliable contraceptive measures and having a negative urine pregnancy test. Hematologic and metabolic status adequate for receiving an highly emetogenic regimen based on laboratory criteria (Total Neutrophils,Platelets, Bilirubin, Liver enzymes, Serum Creatinine or Creatinine Clearance) Able to read, understand, follow the study procedure and complete patient diary. Cycles 2 to 4: The following inclusion criteria must be checked prior to inclusion at each repeated cycle: Participation in the study during the next cycle of chemotherapy is considered appropriate by the Investigator and does not pose unwarranted risk to the patient. Scheduled to receive the same chemotherapy regimen as Cycle 1 or one of the reference chemotherapies as defined in Inclusion criterion 5 for Cycle 1. If a patient is female, she shall be of nonchildbearing potential or of childbearing potential using reliable contraceptive measures and having a negative urine pregnancy test. Adequate hematologic and metabolic status according to the Investigator's opinion. Cycle 1 Lactating woman. Active infection or uncontrolled disease except for malignancy that may pose unwarranted risks in administering the study drugs to the patient. Current use of illicit drugs or current evidence of alcohol abuse. Scheduled to receive moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapies from Day 2 to Day 5. Received or is scheduled to receive radiation therapy to the abdomen or the pelvis within 1 week prior to the start of the reference chemotherapy administration on Day 1 or between Days 1 to 5. Any vomiting, retching, or nausea (grade ≥ 1 as defined by National Cancer Institute) within 24 hours prior to the start of the reference chemotherapy administration on Day 1. Symptomatic primary or metastatic CNS malignancy. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to 5HT3 receptor antagonists, to dexamethasone or to NK1 receptor antagonists. Known contraindication to the IV administration of 50 mL 5% glucose solution. Previously received an NK1 receptor antagonist. Participation in a previous clinical trial involving IV pronetupitant or oral netupitant administered alone or in combination with palonosetron. Any investigational drugs (other than those given in this study) taken within 4 weeks prior to Day 1, and/or is scheduled to receive any investigational drug during the present study. Systemic corticosteroid therapy at any dose within 72 hours prior to the start of reference chemotherapy administration on Day 1. Topical and inhaled corticosteroids are permitted. Scheduled to receive bone marrow transplantation and/or stem cell rescue therapy. Scheduled to receive any strong or moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 or its intake within 1 week prior to Day 1. Scheduled to receive any of the following CYP3A4 substrates within 1 week prior to Day 1: terfenadine, cisapride, astemizole, pimozide. Received within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 or scheduled to receive any CYP3A4 inducer. Any medication with known or potential antiemetic activity within 24 hours prior to the start of reference chemotherapy administration on Day 1 of Cycle 1, including but not limited to 5HT3 receptor antagonists and NK1 receptor antagonists History or predisposition to cardiac conduction abnormalities, except for incomplete right bundle branch block History of Torsade de Point or known history of risk factors for Torsade de Point (heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome).

Any illness or condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may confound the results of the study or pose unwarranted risks in administering the investigational product to the patient.
