	<brief_summary>Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) at high cardiovascular risk may suffer from silent micro-infarctions (MI) before clinical coronary heart disease manifestations because of the lifetime exposure to elevated serum LDL-cholesterol levels. The study aims to demonstrate the higher prevalence of silent myocardial infarction in a population of asymptomatic patients with familial hypercholesterolemia at high cardiovascular risk in comparison to control patients using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance sequences of delayed gadolinium enhancement.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To demonstrate the higher prevalence of silent myocardial infarction in a population of asymptomatic patients with familial hypercholesterolemia at high cardiovascular risk in comparison to control patients, the protocol is the following: - to enroll 75 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) - to enroll 35 subjects without FH (control group) - for each subject, to collect data from his medical file (blood test results) and to perform a cardiac and aortic MRI in order to evaluate the micro-infarction proportion. The study will be performed according to GCPs and with respect with french laws.</detailed_description>
