	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a lung disease that is characterized by incompletely reversible airflow obstruction. It is projected to be the fifth leading burden of disease worldwide by the year 2020. Pulmonary dysfunction reduces exercise capacity in COPD patients, and it has been previously shown that COPD patients suffer deterioration in their quality of life. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of a physical therapy intervention in stable patients with COPD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading diseases causing mortality and morbidity, despite advanced pharmacotherapy and therapeutic management. Although COPD primarily affects the lungs, it also implies extrapulmonary manifestations, such as nutritional depletion, skeletal muscle dysfunction, and abnormal respiratory muscles. Pulmonary rehabilitation is widely used to treat COPD patients and it has been shown that pulmonary rehabilitation should be implemented at all COPD stages, bringing them benefits in terms of improved exercise capacity, symptoms, and quality of life.</detailed_description>
