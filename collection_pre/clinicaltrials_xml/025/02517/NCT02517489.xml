	<brief_summary>Mortality of severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) has not declined over time and is between 25 and 30% in sub-groups of patients. Corticosteroids (CTx) could down-regulate pulmonary and systemic inflammation, accelerate clinical resolution and decrease the rate of inflammation-associated systemic complications. Two recent meta-analyses suggest a positive effect on severe CAP day 28 survival when CTx are added to standard therapy. However they are based on only four trials gathering less than 300 patients, of which only one was positive. Recently published guidelines do not recommend CTx as part of CAP treatment. Therefore a well-powered trial appears necessary to test the hypothesis that CTx - and more specifically hydrocortisone - could improve day 28 survival of critically-ill patients with severe CAP, severity being assessed either on a Pulmonary Severity Index ≥ 130 (Fine class V) or by the use of mechanical ventilation or high-FiO2 high-flow oxygen therapy. A phase-III multicenter add-on randomized controlled double-blind superiority trial assessing the efficacy of hydrocortisone vs. placebo on Day 28 all-causes mortality, in addition to antibiotics and supportive care, including the correction of hypoxemia. Randomization will be stratified on: (i) centers; (ii) use of mechanical ventilation at the time of inclusion.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will receive state-of-the-art standard therapy for severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), including antibiotics and supportive care. Correction of hypoxemia will use standard low-flow oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive-ventilation or invasive ventilation with endotracheal tube, as required. Patients in the treatment group will receive intra-venous hydrocortisone. Patients of the control group will receive an intravenous placebo by intravenous route at the same frequency. Hydrocortisone or placebo will be given in a double-blind fashion for 8 or 14 full days. The intravenous route will be used. The treatment course will include 4 or 7 days of full dose (200 mg/day by continuous infusion), 2 or 4 days of half dose (100 mg/day by continuous infusion), and 2 or 3 days of tapering dose (50 mg/day by continuous infusion). Duration of treatment is chosen upon patient initial improvement.</detailed_description>
