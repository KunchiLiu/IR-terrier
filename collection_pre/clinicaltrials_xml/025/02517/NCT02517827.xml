	<brief_summary>The endovascular therapy prevailed in nearly all regions of peripheral artery disease over open surgery techniques. However, in treatment of the common femoral artery vascular surgery is still the gold standard of therapy. One-year patency rates are between 90% and 95%. Today, only in selected cases an endovascular procedure for common femoral artery diseases is recommended. The primary objective of this study is to compare the performance of directional atherectomy and drug-coated balloon angioplasty over vascular surgery in common femoral artery lesions in a prospective, multi-center, randomized clinical trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Percutaneous Intervention Versus Surgery in the Treatment of Common Femoral Artery Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter, prospective, randomized study to be conducted in centers in Europe. A total of 260 subjects will be entered into the study and will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either directional atherectomy and drug coated balloon angioplasty (optional with stentimplantation), and surgical endarterectomy for treatment in symptomatic (Rutherford-Becker class 2 to 4) common femoral artery disease. All subjects will undergo repeat duplex-ultrasound measurements 6, 12, and 24 months to assess the primary endpoint of Binary Restenosis. Follow-up visits are scheduled 6, 12, and 24 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject must be between 21 and 85 years old; 2. Female of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 10 days prior to index procedure and utilize reliable birth control until completion of the 12month angiographic evaluation; 3. Clinical diagnosis of symptomatic peripheral artery disease defined by Rutherford 2, 3, or 4; 4. Common femoral artery stenosis is &gt;70% diameter stenosis (visual estimate); Additional nontarget lesion(s) in remaining nontarget vessel(s), except ipsilateral iliac arteries, can be treated at the physician´s discretion; 5. At least one vessel outflow (infrapopliteal arteries) to the foot (without stenosis &gt;50%). 6. Endovascular Procedure: Guidewire must be across the target lesion and located intraluminally within the distal vessel before study randomization; 7. Interventions in TASC A and B lesions to restore adequate blood flow, in the same index procedure are allowed. This intervention must be prior to the treatment of the study lesion and successful; 8. Willing to comply with the specified followup evaluation; 9. Written informed consent prior to any study procedures. 1. Ipsilateral significant (&gt;50%) stenosis of the iliac arteries. 2. Significant (&gt;50%) stenosis of all infrapopliteal arteries, no patent artery to the foot. 3. Angiographic evidence of thrombus within target vessel; 4. Thrombolysis within 72 hours prior to the index procedure; 5. InStent restenosis or restenosis of the native common femoral artery. 6. Aneurysm in the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries; 7. Concomitant hepatic insufficiency, thrombophlebitis, deep venous thrombus, coagulation disorder or receiving immunosuppressant therapy; 8. Recent MI or stroke &lt; 30 days prior to the index procedure; 9. Life expectancy less than 24 months; 10. Known or suspected active infection at the time of the index procedure; 11. Known or suspected allergies or contraindications to aspirin, clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) and ticlopidine (Ticlid), heparin, or contrast agent; 12. Any significant medical condition which, in the investigator´s opinion, may interfere with the subject´s optimal participation in the study; 13. The subject is currently participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the endpoints of this study.</criteria>
