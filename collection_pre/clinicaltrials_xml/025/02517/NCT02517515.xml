	<criteria>1. Chinese, South Korean, and Taiwanese descent with full Chinese, South Korean, and Taiwanese parentage 2. Chronic HCVinfection prior to study enrollment. 3. Screening laboratory result indicating HCV GT 1b infection. 4. Per local standard practice, documented results of one of the following: Liver biopsy within 24 months prior to or during screening demonstrating the absence of cirrhosis, e.g., a Metavir Score of ≤ 3 or an Ishak score of ≤ 4; or A screening FibroTest score of ≤ 0.72 and Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) ≤ 2; or A screening FibroScan result of &lt; 9.6 kPa. (Participants with a nonqualifying FibroTest/APRI or FibroScan result may only be enrolled if they have a qualifying liver biopsy performed within 24 months prior to or during screening.) 5. Participant has never received antiviral treatment (including IFNbased therapy [IFN (alpha, beta or pegIFN) with or without RBV]) for hepatitis C infection (treatmentnaïve participant) or participant must have documentation that they met the definition of one of the following categories (treatment experienced participant): Nonresponder or Relapser 6. Participant has plasma HCV RNA level &gt; 10,000 IU/mL at Screening. 1. HCV genotype performed during screening indicating unable to genotype or infection with any other HCV genotype. 2. Positive test result at Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or HBVDNA &gt; Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) if HBsAg negative, or antihuman immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab). 3. Any current or past clinical evidence of cirrhosis such as ascites or esophageal varices, or prior biopsy showing cirrhosis, e.g., a Metavir score of &gt; 3 or Ishak score of &gt; 4. 4. Any primary cause of liver disease other than chronic HCV infection, including but not limited to the following: Hemochromatosis Alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency Wilson's disease Autoimmune hepatitis Alcoholic liver disease Drugrelated liver disease Steatosis and steatohepatitis on a liver biopsy coincident with HCVrelated changes would not be considered exclusionary unless the steatohepatitis is considered to be the primary cause of the liver disease. 5. Screening laboratory analyses showing abnormal kidney, hepatic, or hematologic function. 6. Use of known strong inducers of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) or strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 within 2 weeks or within 10 halflives, whichever is longer, of the respective medication/supplement prior to study drug administration.</criteria>
