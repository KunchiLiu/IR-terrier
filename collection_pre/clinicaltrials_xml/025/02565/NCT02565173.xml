	<brief_summary>Phase III trial involving topical application, in both eyes, of trabodenoson ophthalmic formulation 3.0% or 6.0% once per day or 4.5% twice per day, placebo twice per day, or timolol 0.5% twice per day for 12 weeks in adult subjects with Ocular Hypertension or Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma. All subjects who meet the study's enrollment criteria following Screening will undergo washout of all prohibited medications, including their routine glaucoma medications. During the Placebo Run-In Period, placebo is administered twice daily to both eyes in all subjects. During the Treatment Period, study drug is applied to both eyes for a total of 12 weeks followed by an Observation Period of approximately 7 days wherein no study eye drops are instilled. The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of binocular topical application of trabodenoson ophthalmic formulation 3.0% or 6.0% QD or 4.5% BID for 12 weeks. Timolol is being included in the trial in order to have an active control to ensure the integrity of the trial from an efficacy perspective; the primary comparator for all statistical purposes is the placebo arm.</brief_summary>
