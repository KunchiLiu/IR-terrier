	<brief_summary>A single randomized clinical trial (called a central randomization, random number table, sealed), blind (investigator and statistician do not know the intervention of each patient) is proposed; in adult patients admitted to health facilities with surgical or medical purposes, with high and very high risk of developing pressure ulcers (UPP) according to Braden scale, but with healthy skin at hospital entrance. Using a design of parallel groups, the efficacy of the administration of skin dressing protection versus conventional care (lubricant or moisturizer cream), will be evaluated in the prevention of pressure ulcers in hospitalized patients in two institutions fourth level of care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. The intervention group A, will receive the application of protective skin on the areas of greatest risk according to the position of patient care (for example Shoulders, trochanters, sacrum, malleolus, heels, elbows, and occipital region). Skin protectors shall be prescribed by the doctor of the service, or the patient's physician, or the physician group skin care as is usually done in the two institutions so far. Guard application done by a professional research group. 2. Usual care group Group B, will receive the application of moisturizer or lubricant standardized in the institutions in the same areas of risk in the intervention group. The two groups (A and B) will receive general care measures such as using anti bedsore mattress, changing position every two hours, and reduction of friction or shear. 3. Follow up It will be conducted by nurses trained on aspects of health and hospitalization reported in the medical record. Monitoring is completed by the research staff at the time that the patient start ambulation, develop a pressure ulcer, die or discharge from the hospital. If the patients gets a pressure ulcer will be forwarded to the Institutional wound care group. 4. Results Primary outcome: incidence of pressure ulcers from grade I to grade IV group (difference in risk of pressure ulcer-Hazard Ratio). Secondary outcome: length of hospital stay, time to event for pressure ulcer, the event time for the beginning of ambulation at hospital, and cost difference between the groups.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria will include patients: Adults over 18 years, with intact skin at hospital entrance. Braden high (points 1020) and very high risk (â‰¤9): Patients with immobility or inability to move by themselves, altered skin, overweight, unconscious (for sedation, by clinical status as trauma, coma), patients admitted to more prolonged surgery 4 6 hours, and/or requiring hospitalization in intensive care units for more than 24 hours. Patients who have had a history of pressure ulcers but with intact skin prior to admission may be included. From surgery and medical services From two centers of high complexity. Exclusion Criteria of these patients: Having active pressure ulcer. Low risk by Braden Those that the physician does not consider the inclusion in the study. With lesion on skin or chronic use of diapers at entrance.</criteria>
