	<brief_summary>The investigators aimed to evaluate by the Sniffin' Sticks test the effects on olfactory functions of nasal steroids and leukotriene antagonists used for allergic rhinitis.Thirty patients with seasonal were included in this study. Patients were randomly divided into three groups of 10 patients; group 1 received montelukast sodium and mometasone furoate therapy, group 2 received only montelukast, and group 3 only mometasone furoate. Patients' olfactory functions were determined using the Sniffin' Sticks olfactory test before and after a month treatments. Threshold, discrimination, identification, and TDI values were not significantly different among the groups before treatment. For Group 1 and Group 3 patients, there were statistically significant differences in threshold, discrimination, identification, and TDI values before and after treatment (p &lt; 0.05) (Wilcoxon signed ranks analysis) For Group 2 patients, the before and after treatment values of threshold, discrimination, identification, and TDI showed no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05). According to the findings of our study, MF is superior to montelukast in improving olfactory function. Although montelukast has been shown to be effective against AR symptoms, its effect on olfactory function was not demonstrated in this study.</brief_summary>
