	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to better define the potential molecular and anti-inflammatory changes induced by the modified Atkins diet in the brains of patients with treatment resistant epilepsy. The investigators plan to enroll 30 subjects overall in this study to compare serologic and brain tissue specimens. At NYU, investigators plan to enroll 20 subjects; an estimated ten (10) subjects will consume a modified Atkins diet for 3-4 weeks prior to surgery and an estimated ten (10) subjects will consume a non-modified, higher carbohydrate diet. Investigators at Saint Barnabas Medical Center plan to enroll 10 subjects in this study to compare serologic and brain tissue specimens. Approximately five (5) subjects will consume a modified Atkins diet for 3-4 weeks prior to surgery and five (5) subjects will consume a non-modified, higher carbohydrate diet. Blood and brain tissue specimens will be obtained at the time of surgery and will be compared. The goal of this study is to identify whether or not there are changes in neuroinflammation or neuroexcitability in the human brain induced by the modified Atkins diet.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients scheduled for epilepsy surgery at New York Langone Medical Center or St Barnabas Medical Center will be eligible for enrollment. Patient is at least 18 years of age Patient is willing to participate by complying with the modified Atkins diet 3 4 weeks prior to surgery and maintain a thorough food diary (Intervention study group) or to continue their usual diet and maintain a thorough food diary (Nonintervention study group) Patient/ his/her parent, caregiver, or health care proxy is willing and able to provide consent or assent Patients under the age of 18 will be excluded Patients in whom a twostage surgery is planned without any resection of brain tissue during the initial craniotomy Patients unwilling to comply with modified Atkins diet 3 4 weeks prior to surgery or unwilling to maintain a thorough food diary will be excluded. Patients who are currently on an Atkins or Low Glycemic Index Diet will not be eligible for inclusion in the nonintervention group.</criteria>
