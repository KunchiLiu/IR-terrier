	<brief_title>Serum Lactate Trend in Liver Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During liver resection high serum lactate (sLac) concentration can be related to several clinical factors: impairment in lactate metabolism (i.e. extraction and utilization by the liver) or overproduction by splanchnic tissues; restrictive fluid regimen in order to limit the intraoperative back-flow bleeding; ischemia-reperfusion syndrome. However, the Pringle maneuver (temporary clamping of the hepatic hilum) seems having a sensible effect in inducing a significant increase in sLac levels during liver resection, particularly in the event of compromised liver function such as in cirrhosis. Although the peak of sLac concentration may correlate with outcome, the lactate clearance (cLac) seems to be a better predictor. To date, this relationship has been mainly demonstrated in severe sepsis and shock septic. However, the effective correlation between the cumulative clamping time and cLac has not been clearly investigated. The correlation between cumulative hepatic ischemic time and sLac trend in the perioperative period after liver resection with intermittent PM was investigated.</detailed_description>
