	<brief_summary>This study aims to: 1) quantitatively assess parameters of bone calcium balance in healthy postmenopausal Asian women of Chinese descent; 2) assess possible ethnic differences in calcium metabolism by direct comparison of acquired data in Chinese postmenopausal women with those acquired earlier in Caucasian postmenopausal women using the same methodology; 3) assess differences in calcium and strontium metabolism in parallel to evaluate if strontium stable isotopes can be used for tracing bone calcium metabolism qualitatively</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Calcium Metabolism in Caucasian and Asian Postmenopausal Women of Chinese Descent and the Use of Strontium as a Qualitative Marker of Calcium Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will follow closely the protocol that was used previously by the PI at ETH Zurich to study calcium metabolism in healthy postmenopausal women. Calcium metabolism will be studied after a single oral administration of a calcium tracer (Ca-41) and by following the excretion of the tracer in urine over 6 months. Obtained data will be used to assess parameters of calcium metabolism (flux rates and sizes of body calcium compartments) by kinetic modelling. A strontium tracer (Sr-84) will be administered in parallel and its urinary excretion pattern compared to Ca-41 excretion to determine if strontium tracers can be used to assess calcium metabolism qualitatively. Subjects will be supplemented with Vit D throughout the study. Vit D supplementation will commence 1 month before isotope administration.</detailed_description>
