	<brief_title>Bivalirudin Infusion for Ventricular Infarction Limitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will assess the effect of bivalirudin administration during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and for 4 hours (h) afterwards, looking at contrast enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) assessed infarct size and on circulating markers of thrombosis and cell injury in subjects treated with PPCI for a large myocardial infarction (MI). The objective of this study is to determine whether bivalirudin, compared to unfractionated heparin (UFH), for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) in large ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) can: Primary Objective - Reduce infarct size assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) at 5 (defined as 5 days ± 36 h from randomisation) days after PPCI Secondary Objectives - Improve other CMR derived parameters of myocardial recovery 5 days after PPCI (i.e. left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], myocardial salvage index [MSI] and micro-vascular obstruction [MVO]). - Improve LVEF by CMR at 90 days - Modulate markers of thrombin activity and cell injury after reperfusion Approximately 200 subjects will be randomized. Subjects will be stratified prior to randomization according to: a) total duration of ischemic pain (&lt; 6 h vs. ≥6 h), and b) by site. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Selection: Adult subjects (≥18 years) with an onset of symptoms of &gt;20 minutes (min) and &lt;12 h will be enrolled based on a diagnosis of STEMI with ST segment elevation of ≥1 mm in ≥2 contiguous precordial leads, or presumably new left bundle branch block and who have Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 0 or 1 flow in the infarct related artery (IRA) and fulfill angiographic criteria/score for a large infarction and are candidates for PPCI. All subjects should receive as soon as logistically feasible: aspirin (150-325 milligrams [mg] orally, or 250 500 mg intravenously [IV]) and a loading dose of any approved P2Y12 inhibitor unless already on maintenance dose. Bivalirudin will be administered at the time of PPCI at the approved dose of 0.75 mg/kg bolus followed by a 1.75 mg/kg/h infusion that will continue for 4 h after the completion of the index procedure. Subjects randomized to UFH should be treated according to the institutional protocol (including the timing and dosing of the UFH bolus). A target activated clotting time (ACT) of ≥250 seconds (s) is recommended. Criteria for Evaluation: Primary Endpoint: • Infarct size assessed by CMR 5 days post-PPCI Secondary Endpoints: - CMR MVO assessment at 5 days - CMR MSI at 5 days - CMR assessment of LVEF at 5 days - CMR assessment of LVEF at 90 days - TIMI flow and Myocardial Blush Grade (MBG) at end of PPCI - In-hospital net adverse clinical events (NACE) up to 5 days or discharge, whichever comes first (death, re-infarction, ischaemia driven revascularisation [IDR], and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium [BARC] ≥3 bleeding) - Death at 90 days Exploratory assessments • Assess patterns between comparator groups at various peri-procedural time points with respect to but not limited to: micro-particle release, thrombin anti thrombin complexes (TAT), myeloperoxidase (MPO) Sub-study: • Index microcirculatory resistance (IMR) and collateral flow index (CFI) sub-study</detailed_description>
