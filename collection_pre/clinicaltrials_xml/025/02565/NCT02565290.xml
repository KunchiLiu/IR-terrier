	<brief_summary>The effect of anti-inflammatory substances on the dynamics of the fetal ductus arteriosus is well documented, but the anti-inflammatory property of polyunsaturated fatty acid omega-3 about changing this dynamic is not established. This study evaluate the relationship between supplementation of omega-3 in the dynamics of the fetal ductus arteriosus in the third trimester. Women with gestational between 28 to 32 weeks will receive capsules of omega-3 or placebo, to be consumed daily for 3 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Mother's Supplementation Omega-3 in the Dynamics of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: a Randomized Clinical Trial.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The omega-3 features similar the statins to be antioxidants and anti-inflammatory drugs and their derivatives have the function of slowing the neuro-inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death anti-inflammatory properties. Also, they have antithrombotic effects, being related to prevent disease. Studies show that supplementation with omega-3 has a positive impact on several outcomes like cardiovascular disease, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzehimer. Objective: Evaluate the relationship between supplementation of omega-3 in the dynamics of the fetal ductus arteriosus in the third trimester. Methodology: randomized double blind clinical trial. Women with gestational age between 28 to 32 weeks, literate, over 18 years will be invited. Pregnant women with anti-inflammatory drugs, they have a higher intake of dietary polyphenols to 127mg / day or using drugs that may interfere with the absorption of omega-3 are excluded. The selected women will be randomized to receive capsules of omega-3 or placebo, to be consumed daily for 3 weeks. In the first interview, and after 3 weeks, they will respond the Questionnaire Food Frequency (QFF) to quantify polyphenols and omega 3 in their diet, weight and height will be measured and the examination of fetal echocardiography is performed.</detailed_description>
