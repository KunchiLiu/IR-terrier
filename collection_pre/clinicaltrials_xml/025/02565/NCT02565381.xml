	<brief_summary>The QUIT (Quitting with Usual Care, Incentives, and Technology) Smoking Study is a 3-arm pilot randomized controlled trial that will test the effect of 2 different experimental smoking cessation interventions relative to a control condition in homeless cigarette smokers. All participants will receive free transdermal nicotine patches and weekly in-person smoking cessation counseling. In addition, participants randomized to the first experimental condition will receive financial rewards for biochemically-verified smoking abstinence, and participants randomized to the second experimental condition will be enrolled in a text messaging program to support smoking abstinence.</brief_summary>
