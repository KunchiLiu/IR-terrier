	<brief_title>Prospective Assessment of Quality of Life in Patients Treated by Radiosurgery for Brain Metastases (PRAMECE-1302)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients who meet the selection criteria and who have accepted to participate at the study will answer different questionnaires of the study before radiosurgery and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the treatment of brain metastases. Baseline examinations will be done before receiving the treatment during the hospitalisation for the Gamma Knife treatment, and then they will be repeated at the evaluation visits which are classically done every 3 months. MRI's will also be performed every 3 months. In this way, no additional travel or MRI will be carried out as part of the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient with newly diagnosed brain metastases Patient with cancer regardless of the type of primary cancer, with anatomopathological proof At least, one measurable lesion ≥ 10 mm on the MRI T1 gadolinium sequences Number of brain metastases lower or equal to 5 Indication of radiosurgery treatment Age ≥ 18 years old ECOGPS 02 Expected survival &gt; 3 months Ability to complete selfadministered questionnaires. If the patient has a motor disability (hemibody deficit) that does not allow to complete himself the questionnaires, these will be read by a CRA of the Neurosurgery department who will outline the questions without making any comment. A nonopposition form must have been completed by the patient Previous cancer (&lt; 5 years) except of carcinoma of cervix uteri, basal cell or squamous cell skin carcinoma adequately treated Previous brain radiotherapy Neurological pathology with cognitive disorders existing before the study Having a contraindication for MRI Associated leptomeningeal disease Patients having another severe or uncontrolled pathology which could compromise the participation at the study (such as infection, cardiovascular, digestive, renal or pulmonary disease) Pregnant or breastfeeding woman. The women must not breastfeed for at least 6 months Impossibility to submit to the medical examinations of the study due to geographic, social or mental reasons</criteria>
