	<brief_summary>The sensory innervation of the clavicle remains an area of debate. Regional nerve blocks aimed at relieving pre- and post-operative pain include the superficial cervical plexus blocks, interscalene blocks and a combined version of the above. In this case study, the investigators aim to describe the protocol used in a university hospital: general anaesthesia with interscalene brachial plexus block, followed by optional iv morphine administration in phase 1 recovery and oral oxycodone on the ward.</brief_summary>
