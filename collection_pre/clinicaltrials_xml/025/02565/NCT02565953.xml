	<brief_summary>In recent years the use of paclitaxel releasing percutaneous transluminal angioplastic (PTA) balloon catheter is spreading in vascular pathology, mainly in stenosis infrainguinal arteries. This device combined the mechanical action of PTA balloon with the antiproliferative effects of paclitaxel. The use of these devices in venous pathology is limited. This devices could improve the treatment of renal dialysis arteriovenous fistula stenosis.</brief_summary>
