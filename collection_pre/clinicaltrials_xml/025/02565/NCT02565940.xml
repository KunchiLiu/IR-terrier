	<brief_summary>This work also highlights the presence of an unknown virus double-stranded DNA. In this project we propose 1) incorporating a bank of 150 samples from patients with diabetic foot infection in grades 2-4; 2) to study the microbial flora of a selection of 50 diabetic feet previously untreated with antibiotics for bacterial metagenomics, viral metagenomics and a minimum of 10 per culturomique; 3) to evaluate the use of targeted quantitative PCR on the most frequent new species frequency in the disease and incidentally get a sense of their role in the evolution and prognosis of the disease, including failures of and targeted antibiotic therapy on all 150 samples.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study by Metagenomics and Culturomicsapproaches of Bacterial and Viral Flora of Diabetic Foot Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be included by the infectious and tropical diseases and diabetes services the Nîmes Teaching Hospital which have a large active file and proven expertise internationally in this pathology. The usual agents of infection will be searched by standard bacteriological techniques as part of the microbiological documentation of such cases and will be performed by the microbiology laboratory of CHU Nîmes which will freeze the rest of the sample to -80 ° C the will send it to the Marseille Microbiology Federation for realization of metagenomics-culturomics</detailed_description>
