	<brief_summary>This study will employ a phase Ib design using the established dose of CAVATAK with pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced melanoma for whom pembrolizumab would be considered standard of care. Our hypothesis is that oncolysis of melanoma cells by CAVATAK will be important in amplifying the T-cell potentiating effects of pembrolizumab.</brief_summary>

Subjects previously treated with CVA21 or antiPD1/ PDL1 agents. Subjects requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior to the first treatment. Subject has received chemotherapy within the last 4 weeks prior to first treatment. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease. Females of childbearing potential must have negative serum or urine pregnancy test. Subjects requiring or using other investigational agents while on treatment in this trial. History of other malignancy within the last 3 years (with exceptions). Active infection requiring systemic therapy. Known history of HIV disease, active hepatitis B or hepatitis C. History or evidence of other clinically significant disorders that would pose a risk to subject safety. Inability to give informed consent and comply with the protocol.</criteria>
