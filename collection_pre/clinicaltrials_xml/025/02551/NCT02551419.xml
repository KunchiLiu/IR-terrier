	<brief_summary>A six month, placebo-controlled, parallel group project in which MCI participants will receive 30 g/day of a custom-made MCT-based ketogenic supplement or a matching placebo. Uptake of both the brain's fuels - ketones (as 11C-AcAc) and glucose (as FDG) - both before and after the intervention will be assessed by PET (position emission tomography) imaging, as well as fMRI, diffusion MRI and cognition.</brief_summary>
