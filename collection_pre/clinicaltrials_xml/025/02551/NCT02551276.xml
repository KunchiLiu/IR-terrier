	<brief_summary>Studies in animals have shown that beta2-adrenoceptor activation with selective agonists regulates protein metabolism and muscle growth in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue. These effects may be mediated by cAMP/PKA dependent activation of several downstream sites that modulate protein synthesis and breakdown. While the role of beta2-adrenoceptor signaling is well-described in animals, it is inadequately explored in humans. The purpose of the study is thus to investigate the effect of chronic beta2-adrenergic stimulation (cAMP/PKA-signaling) on muscle hypertrophy.</brief_summary>
