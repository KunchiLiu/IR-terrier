	<brief_summary>This study examines the effect of cord blood in the treatment of newborn infants with neonatal encephalopathy in combination with hypothermia, which is the standard treatment for this condition. The hypothesis is that the cord blood + hypothermia combination will produce better neuroprotection than the standard treatment of hypothermia alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuroprotective Effect of Autologous Cord Blood Combined With Therapeutic Hypothermia Following Neonatal Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is to determine the neuroprotective effect of intravenous administration of autologous cord blood in neonates with severe encephalopathy (hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or cerebral infarction). It is hypothesized that the administration of autologous cord blood will be safe and well tolerated in neonates with severe encephalopathy. If a neonate is born with signs of moderate to severe encephalopathy and cooled for the encephalopathy, the neonate will receive their own cord blood. The cord blood cells are divided into 3 doses and infused at 24, 48, and 72 hours after the birth. Infants will be randomised to treatment with autologous cord blood and hypothermia or hypothermia only and followed for safety and neurodevelopmental outcome up to 18 months. All infants in both groups will be treated with hypothermia for 72 hours started within 6 hours of delivery and infants who allocated to hypothermia and xenon will also receive autologous cord blood in 24 hours from birth through a purpose designed delivery system. Additionally, postnatal neuro-developmental outcomes in neonates with encephalopathy after autologous cord blood therapy will be measured; HIE injury to the neonate/infant brain post autologous cord blood therapy by imaging will be characterized; MRI's will be obtained per clinical routine; serum levels of selected cytokine and neurotrophic factors in neonates with HIE before and after autologous cord blood therapy will be compared and immune cell phenotype and function in neonates with HIE before and after autologous cord blood therapy will be compared.</detailed_description>
