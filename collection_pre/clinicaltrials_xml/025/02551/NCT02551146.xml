	<brief_title>Influence of Implants and Locators for Improved Retention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For this prospective randomized controlled clinical trial patients with edentulous mandibles and tissue supported (full) dentures were treated with 2 dental implants and locators in order to improve prosthesis stability. The LOCATOR System is comprised of three parts: The LOCATOR implant attachment (LOCATOR abutment), the LOCATOR Male and the LOCATOR Denture Cap. The abutment is inserted directly into the implant using a torque wrench, while the Denture Cap is placed into the base of the overdenture for polymerization using acrylic resin. Custom retention is achieved via LOCATOR Males - small color-coded (according to retention force) plastic inserts - which can be exchanged as needed.</detailed_description>
