	<brief_title>Folinic Acid in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to realise a pilot study in France in order to evaluate the efficiency of folinic acid in treatment of autism spectrum disorder and get first estimations about prevalence of auto antibodies anti-FRα in France. The study is a randomized controlled trial monocentric,evaluating folinic acid 10mg per day versus placebo, in single-blind during 12 weeks. Primary objective : The primary objective is to evaluate the efficiency of folinic acid (calcium folinate) 5mg twice a day during 12 weeks on reduction of autistic troubles, particularly on communication and social interaction Secondary objective : - Evaluate the efficiency of folinic acid on reduction of autistic symptoms perceived by parents - Evaluate the constancy of auto antibodies anti-FRα rates</detailed_description>
