	<brief_summary>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) involves the narrowing of blood vessels connected to and within the lungs. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a focal adhesion-associated protein kinase involved in cellular adhesion and spreading processes which leads to stiffening and thickening of blood vessels in lungs. This further increases the blood pressure within the lungs and impairs their blood flow. This study aims to demonstrate biodistribution of FAK inhibitor, GSK2256098, in cardiopulmonary sites i.e. heart and lung tissues. The uptake of 11C-radiolabelled GSK2256098 within the lung and / or heart of healthy subjects and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) patients will be assessed using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Based on study results the decision as to whether a follow-on phase 2 trial should be initiated to investigate the therapeutic utility of GSK2256098 in iPAH will be decided. Sufficient number of subjects will be screened (up to 30 days prior to scan) to enrol 12 healthy subjects and 12 PAH patients in the study. Enrolled subjects will receive a microdose of [11C]-GSK2256098 on a scanning day which will be followed by the follow-up visit (2-4 weeks post-last dose).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria for healthy volunteers Healthy subjects enrolled between 40 to 70 years inclusive at the time of signing the informed consent. Healthy subjects will be recruited to be age (+/5 years) and gender matched to idiopathic PAH patients.

Normal spirometry at Screening (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] and forced vital capacity [FVC] &gt;= 80% of predicted measurements to be taken in triplicate and the highest value must be &gt;= 80% of predicted). A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator, in consultation with the medical monitor if deemed necessary, agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Subject is ambulant and capable of attending for PET computed tomography (CT) imaging. A negative Allen's test in at least one arm for arterial blood sampling (indicating adequate collateral circulation to the hand from both the radial and ulnar arteries).

Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment.

Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from scan until 3 months after the last dose of study medication. In addition, they must not plan to father a child, or donate sperm, for 3 months after the scan. 2. Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia. 3. Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options below: Contraceptive subdermal implant Intrauterine device or intrauterine system Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone Injectable progestogen Contraceptive vaginal ring Percutaneous contraceptive patches B.
