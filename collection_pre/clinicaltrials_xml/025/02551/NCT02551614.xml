	<brief_summary>This is an exploratory study to further develop an imaging platform for the assessment of whole lung neutrophil retention. The primary objective of the study is to quantify and compare neutrophil retention in the lungs of lipopolysaccharide-challenged healthy subjects, saline-challenged healthy subjects and subjects with stable COPD. There will be two treatment groups, one with healthy subjects and the other with subjects with stable COPD. The total duration of this study for healthy subjects will be approximately 1 week, in addition to the screening window of 28 days. The total duration of this study for subjects with COPD will be approximately 1 week for those that complete Visit 1 only, and approximately 2 weeks for those subjects with COPD that return to the unit for Visit 2 7-10 days later, in addition to the screening window of 28 days.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Group 1: Healthy subjects Between 45 and 75 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring: A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor if required agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. A subject with wellcontrolled hypertension, noninsulin dependent diabetes or other well controlled medical conditions may be included if the investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor if required, agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Subjects must be stable on their current treatment for at least one month prior to first imaging visit. Current nonsmokers who have not used any tobacco products in the 6month period preceding the screening visit and have a pack history of less than 5 pack years. Pack years = (cigarettes per day smoked/20) x number of years smoked) Body weight &gt;=50 kilogram (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 1930 kg/meter (m)^2 (inclusive). Males. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test), not lactating, and of non reproductive potential defined as: Premenopausal females with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation, Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, Hysterectomy, Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy. Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause (refer to laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol. Group 2: COPD patients Between 45 and 75 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Stable stage 23 COPD patients, in accordance with the definition in the GOLD guidelines, 2014 and with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &gt;=40% predicted. Stable is defined as: No COPD exacerbations in the 3 months prior to first imaging visit. Subjects who are stable on their current treatment for at least one month prior to first imaging visit. Body weight &gt;=45 kg and BMI within the range 1832 kg/m^2 (inclusive). Males A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative hCG test), not lactating, and of non reproductive potential defined as: Premenopausal females with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation, Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, Hysterectomy, Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy. Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with FSH and estradiol levels consistent with menopause (refer to laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels). Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol.

Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first imaging visit. Previous exposure to ionising radiation above background (e.g. through work or research studies) that, combined with the estimated exposure dose to be given in this study, results in exposure over 10Milisievert (mSv) in a three year period.
