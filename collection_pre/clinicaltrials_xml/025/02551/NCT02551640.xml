	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to explore the effects of FeatForward on physical activity and cardio-metabolic risk factors. The study will be implemented as a 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effects of FeatForward in patients assigned to use the application versus a control group who will not use the app over a 6-month follow-up period. The investigators hypothesize that subjects using FeatForward will be more physically active and will achieve greater improvements in their cardio-metabolic risk (CMR) factors than a usual care control group that will not use the app over a 6-month period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Physical Activity Through a mHealth Intervention in Cardio-metabolic Risk Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TextToMove (TTM) was a dynamic text messaging program which the investigators developed in 2012 with the goals of increasing physical activity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), improving self-management of the disease, and lowering HbA1c levels. TTM has since been evaluated in a PHRC-approved randomized controlled trial. In our current proposed study, the investigators plan to convert TTM into a mobile application for smartphone use, with increased and improved functionality and with the potential for easy translation to additional use cases. The investigators used feedback gathered from users and observations from the previous trial to shape the development plan for this second iteration, aptly named "FeatForward." The FeatForward app will be hyper-personalized to users and to respond specifically to individual users' behavior patterns so that the application feels like an intelligent health coach partnering with users to achieve better health outcomes. What defines FeatForward from TTM are additional features, including the incorporation of machine learning components for the messaging algorithm, tailoring of message frequency based on users' activity levels, integration of patient data into the electronic medical records through the Remote Monitoring Data Repository, inputs to improve the generalizability of feedback regarding health metrics (e.g., weight, blood glucose), as well as a community feature to enable interactions with other similar patients and a comprehensive educational library. FeatForward's primary goal is to help users increase their level of physical activity. Physical inactivity has been identified as one of the leading risk factors contributing to the rising rates of chronic diseases. And despite being the most common cardio-metabolic risk (CMR) factor, it also happens to be the easiest to target. Current estimates suggest that over half (52%) of adults in the United States do not meet the recommended physical activity levels. A number of studies to date have demonstrated the dose-response protective effect of increasing physical activity on the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that FeatForward will help users to increase their physical activity levels and also lead to improvements in cardio-metabolic risk factors compared to usual care controls that will not use the intervention.</detailed_description>
