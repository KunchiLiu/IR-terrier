	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy is considered by many the preferred mode of screening for colorectal cancer (CRC). The effectiveness of any CRC screening program is critically dependent on an adequate bowel preparation. For bowel preparation, effective, well-tolerated and safe methods should be applied. Recently, oral sulfate solution was adopted to Korea. Still, in Korea, there was no data of direct comparison of 2L polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid (PEG-Asc) and oral sulfate solution (OSS) in split method for bowel preparation. Therefore, in this study, we planned the comparative evaluation the efficacy of PEG-Asc and OSS in split method for bowel preparation</brief_summary>
