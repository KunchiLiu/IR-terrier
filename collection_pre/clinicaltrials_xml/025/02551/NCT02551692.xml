	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of varenicline versus nicotine replacement versus placebo on personal smoking environment cue (PSE) reactivity. The results of this study will inform whether first-line pharmacotherapies for nicotine dependence (e.g. nicotine patch, varenicline) alter reactivity to environment cues. The investigators propose to identify 120 regular cigarette smokers who will complete 10 visits (1 screening visit, 1 training visit, 1 camera turn-in 2 cue exposure sessions and 4 post-quit medication check sessions). Smokers will be randomized to one of three medication conditions: placebo (PLAC; n=40), transdermal nicotine patch (NRT; n=40) or varenicline (VAR; n=40) in a double blind, double-dummy design. Reactivity variables (craving, latency to smoke, and smoke intake) will be entered into 3 (Medication: NRT, VAR, PLAC) x 2 (Environment: smoking, nonsmoking) repeated measures ANOVAs with random-effects. The investigators hypothesize that personal smoking, as compared to nonsmoking environments, will be associated with greater reactivity (i.e. increased craving and smoke intake; decreased latency to smoke). A Medication x Environment interaction will be characterized by decreased reactivity to smoking as compared to nonsmoking environments in the VAR and NRT groups as compared to the PLAC group.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. generally healthy [(i.e. ambulatory, not currently sick)] 2. between the ages of 18 and 60 3. smoking of at least 5 cig/day of a brand delivering â‰¥ 0.5 mg nicotine (FTC method) for &gt; 1 year 4. an expired CO concentration of at least 10 ppm (to confirm inhalation) or urinary cotinine &gt;1000 ng/mL (NicAlert = 6). 5. interest in quitting smoking within the timeframe of the experiment. 6. ability to identify 4 personal smoking and 4 personal nonsmoking places. Exclusion criteria: 1. immediate or no desire to quit smoking; 2. inability to attend all required experimental sessions; 3. use of psychoactive medications; 4. use of smokeless tobacco including ecigarettes in the past 30 days; 5. current alcohol or drug abuse; 6. use of illegal drugs as measured by urine drug screen (excluding marijuana); 7. use of experimental (investigational) drugs; 8. current use of nicotine replacement therapy or other smoking cessation treatment; 9. Hypertension (systolic &gt;140 mm Hg, diastolic &gt;100 mm Hg, coupled with a history of hypertension); subjects with no previous diagnosis of hypertension may have a screening blood pressure up to 160/100. Participants with a history of hypertension may, however, be allowed to participate in the study if the study physician determines that the condition is stable, controlled by medication, and in no way jeopardizes the individual's safety; 10. Hypotension with symptoms (systolic &lt;90 mm Hg, diastolic &lt;60 mm Hg); 11. Coronary heart disease; 12. Lifetime history of heart attack; 13. Cardiac (heart) disorder (including but not limited to valvular heart disease, heart murmur, heart failure, arrhythmia); Abnormal EKG results suggestive of ischemia or undiagnosed cardiovascular disease please consider adding if it seems reasonable. For example, STsegment depression or elevation, Twave abnormalities, and lack of R wave are obtained with a 12lead EKG). 14. Active skin disorder (e.g., psoriasis) within the last year, except minor skin conditions (including but not limited to facial acne, minor localized infections, and superficial minor wounds); 15. Medical condition that may contraindicate participation in the opinion of the investigator and study physician.(for example, EKG results) 16. Current psychiatric disease (with the exception of anxiety disorders, OCD and ADHD); 17. Suicidal ideation (within the past 10 years) or lifetime occurrence of attempted suicide; 18. Current depression The PrimeMD will be used to screen for current (within 2 weeks) depression. Potential subjects who score &gt;9 (or who score &gt;0 on item #9 ("Thoughts that you would be better off dead, or of hurting yourself in some way") will be excluded from study participation, and, at the discretion of the study physician, referred to appropriate psychiatric treatment; 19. Bulimia or anorexia; 20. Significant adverse reaction to Chantix/Varenicline in the past; 21. Currently pregnant, breast feeding or likely to become pregnant; 22. History of seizure disorder. 23. A quit attempt within the last 30 days</criteria>
