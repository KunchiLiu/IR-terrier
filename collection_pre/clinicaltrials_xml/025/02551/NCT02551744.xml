	<brief_title>Proton Pump Inhibitor Versus Histamine-2 Receptor Antagonist for the Prevention of Recurrent Peptic Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aims of the randomized double-blind comparison study are to compare the efficacy of Proton Pump Inhibitor and H2 receptor antagonist for the prevention of recurrent peptic ulcers in thienopyridine users. We plan to enroll 334 thienopyridine (clopidogrel or ticlopidine) users without baseline gastroduodenal ulcer at initial endoscopy. The patients will be randomly assigned to receive either (1) pantoprazole (40 mg qd) or (2) famotidine (40 mg qd) for 6 months.The ulcer recurrence rate between the treatment groups will be compared.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Recent endoscopic examination (within 2 months) reveals normal appearance or erythematous patches only (without subepithelial hemorrhages, erosions or ulcers). Peptic ulcers (a mucosal break Â³ 5 mm in diameter) have been documented by a previous endoscopic examination. Subjects have received thienopyridine therapy for at least two weeks. Requiring longterm antiplatelet therapy for ischemic cardiovascular diseases. A history of gastric or duodenal surgery other than oversewing of a perforation. Subjects who are allergic to the study drugs. Requiring longterm treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, aspirin, or anticoagulant agents. Pregnancy. Subjects who have active cancer, acute serious medical illness or terminal illness. Subjects who have gastroesophageal reflux disease.</criteria>
