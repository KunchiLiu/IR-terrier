	<detailed_description>Autologous fat was obtained from thighs, waist or abdomen using resonance liposuction instrument. Fat was injected into the tissues in a multitunnel and multilayer way until they were firm and appeared fully tumesced according to the Coleman method.All MRI volume analyses were blindly performed by examiner independently preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. Object marking was done using avanto 1.5T superconducting magnetic resonance scanner.Volume analysis was done by counting pixels within the frames of the MRI using ImageChecker CAD software.The Chinese version of BREAST-Q augmentation module was obtained from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the University of British Columbia. 38 patients were given the BREAST-Q questionnaire to express their thoughts preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. Data were calculated using the Q-score program, which converts raw BREAST-Q scores of 1 through 4 or 5 to scores of 0 to 100.</detailed_description>
