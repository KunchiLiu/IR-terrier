	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, phase 2 comparative study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of nal-IRI in combination with other anticancer therapies, compared to nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine, in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma who have not received prior chemotherapy. This study will assess the following regimens: - nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV + oxaliplatin - nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV - nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine The study will be conducted in two parts: 1. a safety run-in of the nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV + oxaliplatin regimen, and 2. a randomized, efficacy study of nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV + oxaliplatin, and nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV, versus nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine.</brief_summary>
