	<brief_summary>Sleep education has been used as a method of primary and secondary prevention of sleep problems in all age groups. An especially vulnerable age group are adolescents who frequently have poor sleep habits and suffer from sleep deprivation. In adolescents, insufficient sleep, inadequate sleep quality, and irregular sleep patterns are associated with daytime sleepiness, negative moods, increased likelihood of stimulant use, higher levels of risk-taking behavior, poor school performance, and increased risk of unintentional injuries. As an US study has shown, sleepiness was the major causal factor in many traffic accidents and more than 50% of sleep-related crashes involved drivers aged 25 or younger. The study was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a theory-based sleep hygiene intervention in improving sleep quality in adolescents.</brief_summary>
