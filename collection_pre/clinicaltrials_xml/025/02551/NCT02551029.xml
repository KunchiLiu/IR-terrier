	<brief_summary>Brain imaging has shown abnormal brain activations in response to visceral stimulation in patients with the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). To investigate the possible role of the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract (NTS), the primary relay station in the brainstem for vagal afferents, its activation in IBS and functional dyspepsia patients will be evaluated. Prior to this, an exploratory study in healthy volunteers will be conducted. This will be the first high magnetic field fMRI study evaluating the possible role of NTS activation in visceral abdominal pain. Moreover, this will be the first fMRI study using duodenal capsaicin infusion as a chemical stimulus, which is more physiological than mechano-stimulation.</brief_summary>
