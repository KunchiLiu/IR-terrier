	<brief_summary>Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is the most frequent valvular disease. The severity of the obstruction of the left ventricle (LV) is essentially analyzed today by echocardiography Doppler, which assesses two key markers that are aortic valve pressure gradient and the aortic valve area. however these marker are a poor reflect of the clinical severity of AVS. The aim of the study is to validate new markers assessing cardiac fibrosis that might best or complementary markers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Valvular Aortic Stenosis: Study of Myocardiac Fibrosis by Magnetic Resonance Imagery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To validate new markers assessing cardiac fibrosis three groups of subjects were studied in controls subjects and patients with AVS in order to : 1. Analyze myocardial fibrosis markers in MRI, the degree of hypertrophy, remodeling and wall shear stress in a control population and in three groups of subjects to RA progressively increasing risk: asymptomatic subjects without symptomatic subjects LV dysfunction, symptomatic patients with LV dysfunction. The factors favoring the appearance of fibrosis observed in MRI will be analyzed on all subjects. 2. To validate these fibrosis markers estimated by MRI by histological analysis of biopsies performed in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. 3. Monitoring compliance with the distribution of markers of fibrosis and wall stress estimated on Initial MRI are factors of aggravation or not improved function and / or remodeling remote myocardial.
