	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to study the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A (Xeomin®) injected utilizing kinematically-based injection parameters for the treatment of upper extremity essential tremor (ET). Additional objectives are to study the benefit of kinematic assessment tools in determining injection parameters and to study the composition of tremor using kinematics.</brief_summary>
