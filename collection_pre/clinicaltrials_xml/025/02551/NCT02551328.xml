	<brief_title>Preconditioning With Sevoflurane and Propofol in Patients Undergoing Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main aim of this study is to compare markers of cardiac injury (Troponin I), inflammatory response and platelets function during minimally invasive mitral valve repair or replacement (MIMV) via right mini-thoracotomy in two standard anaesthetic regimes: - Volatile conditioning (sevoflurane) used during induction (preconditioning) and during the operation as maintenance (perconditioning) and no propofol. - Propofol induction and maintenance (TIVA) and no volatile anaesthetics. Outlet/residual blood samples coming from routine check will be collected at different time points. Study will be powered on Troponin I (primary statistical outcome). Original secondary outcome will be considered: platelets activation, left ventricle function, clinical figures (length of stay, inotrops requirements, ventilation times and other relevant).</detailed_description>
