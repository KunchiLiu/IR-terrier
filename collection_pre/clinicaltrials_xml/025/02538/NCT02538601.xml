	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a CBT-based smoking cessation treatment enhanced with transdiagnostic skills for the management of anxiety and fear-based avoidance behaviors (CBT-A) relative to a standard CBT-based smoking cessation treatment (CBT-S) for smokers with elevated PTSD symptoms who were exposed to the 9/11 World Trade Center disaster. The investigators hypothesized that the CBT-A treatment would yield more favorable outcomes with regard to smoking abstinence as well as improvements in PTSD and respiratory symptoms over a 6-month follow-up period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhanced Smoking Cessation Intervention for Smokers Exposed to the World Trade Center (WTC) Disaster</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory illness and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are the primary health sequelae of the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster on September 11th 2001 and are often comorbid. Cigarette smoking is a modifiable health behavior associated with both lower respiratory symptoms (LRS) and PTSD. Smoking cessation programs are considered the crucial front-line intervention for smokers with pulmonary problems. Unfortunately, trauma exposed smokers with elevated PTSD symptoms have greater difficulty quitting, are more likely to fail standard cessation programs, and are more likely to relapse than smokers with other anxiety disorders and those without mental illness. Interventions that concurrently target mechanisms thought to maintain the comorbidity between PTSD and LRS (e.g., anxious reactivity to nicotine withdrawal, smoking to reduce negative affect) may offer a means of improving smoking quit rates in trauma exposed populations. Thus, the purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a combined CBT smoking cessation treatment enhanced with transdiagnostic skills for the management of anxiety and fear-based avoidance behaviors (CBT-A). The investigators randomized 90 WTC disaster exposed daily smokers with elevated PTSD symptoms to either CBT-A (N=44) or a standard CBT-based smoking cessation program (CBT-S; N=46). Participants were followed up to six months post-treatment.</detailed_description>
