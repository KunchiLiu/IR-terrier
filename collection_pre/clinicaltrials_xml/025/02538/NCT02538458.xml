	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of 3% Hypertonic Saline Inhalation (24h vs 72h) to Treat Acute Bronchiolitis in Hospitalized Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In acute bronchiolitis in infants, 3% hypertonic saline nebulizations proved to be efficient, reducing the hospitalization length and clinical severity scores. Among the questions remaining, treatment length is still being discussed in the literature. The trial hypothesis is that the efficiency of a 24 hours treatment by 3% hypertonic saline is not inferior to a 72 hours treatment, in acute bronchiolitis in infants. The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficiency of a 24 hours treatment by 3 % hypertonic saline, versus a 72 hours treatment maximum, on clinical remission, judged by the Wang score measured 72 hours after starting treatment, in children younger than 12 month hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis.</detailed_description>
