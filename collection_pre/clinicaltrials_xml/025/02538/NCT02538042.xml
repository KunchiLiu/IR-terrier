	<brief_summary>The central objective of the project is to evaluate the effect of incorporating smoking related contexts into very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarette extinction trials on clinically relevant, smoking-related outcomes. Adult smokers interested in quitting smoking (N=80) will be interviewed and trained to take pictures where they smoke cigarettes. Following taking these pictures, participants will then be switched to smoke VLNCs while wearing a 21 mg/d nicotine patch (EXT) for three weeks. During this 3-week treatment period, half of the sample (n=40) will be randomly assigned to undergo six, 60-minute sessions of multiple context extinction (MCE+) during which they will view smoking-related environments and smoke their assigned cigarettes. The remaining 40 participants will undergo control MCE (exposure to nature environments; MCE-) and smoke their assigned cigarettes. At the end of the three weeks, participants will quit smoking and continue to wear the nicotine patch while being followed during a 10-week abstinence period. Participants will also complete a follow-up phone call 6 months after their quit day.</brief_summary>
