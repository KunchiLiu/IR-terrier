	<brief_summary>Vascular Prothesis Infection is a rare but an extremely serious complication. Diagnosis is often difficult (germs are found only in 50% of cases). Conventional imagery is often non-specific and difficult to interpret especially in early postoperative phase. Leukocytes isolated from the patient's blood are labeled with a radiopharmaceutical technetium 99mTc-HMPAO. The aim of this study is to assess the overall diagnostic performance of scintigraphy (hybrid SPEC-CT) with labeled leucocytes in diagnosis of subdiaphragmatic vascular prothesis infection.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>patient of more than 18 years old Patient with a subdiaphragmatic vascular prosthesis Vascular prosthesis infection suspected with clinical (flow from the scare and/or local pain and/or erythema and/or persistent fever and/or bacteraemia) and/or biological (inflammatory syndrome : elevated Creactive protein and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and/or white blood cells increased) infection signs Patient willing to participate with a signed informed consent Patient covered by a healthcare insurance Pregnant women or of childbearing age without effective contraception Prosthesis limited to a bare stent. Patient who has been committed to an institution by legal or regulatory order Contraindications for labeled leukocytes scintigraphy realization : Restlessness, inability to keep still lie at least 1 hour Claustrophobia Poor compliance predictable or impaired general condition making it impossible to carry out the examination Refusal to participate in the study</criteria>
