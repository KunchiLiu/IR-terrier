	<brief_title>Phase II Trial of EP4 Receptor Antagonist, AAT-007 (RQ-07; CJ-023,423) in Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II trial of (RQ-07) in advanced solid tumors in advanced prostate, breast or lung cancer. The purpose of this trial is to determine whether the administration of the study drug RQ-07 can decrease circulating tumor cells in advanced prostate, breast or lung cancer. Additionally, the study will evaluate whether the study drug may improve outcome in advanced prostate, breast or lungs cancer either by itself or when combined with gemcitabine, a standard chemotherapy drug. The combination of with gemcitabine will only be investigated after disease has worsened with the study drug RQ-07 by itself and only in patients with prostate or lung cancer.</detailed_description>
