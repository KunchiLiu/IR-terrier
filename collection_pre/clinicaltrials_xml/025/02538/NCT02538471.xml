	<brief_summary>Patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving at least one single agent chemotherapy and demonstrating stable disease or disease progression at two consecutive clinical/radiological assessments (at an interval of at least 2 weeks). Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFΒ) blockade will enhance response of irradiated tumors and improve the function of Dendritic and T cells. Patients will receive 300 mg/day of study drug administered via oral drug tablet every day for 14 days on and 14 days off (=28 day cycle). Radiation to a metastatic site will be delivered at a dose of 7.5 Gy, given consecutively on days 1-3-5.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) is a pleiotropic cytokine which belongs to a superfamily of ligands, including bone morphogenetic proteins and activins [1-5]. Under normal conditions, members of the TGFβ family maintain homeostasis in many organ systems. In normal and non-cancerous cells, TGFβ limits the growth of epithelial, endothelial, neuronal, and hematopoietic cell lineages through anti-proliferative and apoptotic responses. In addition, TGFβ exerts potent effects that influence immune function, cell proliferation/ functional differentiation, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix production, cell motility, angiogenesis, and cytokine production. TGFβ has been implicated as an important factor in the growth, progression, and metastatic potential of advanced cancers. Although TGFβ has been shown to suppress the growth of epithelial cells in the early stages of tumor development (premalignant conditions), the effect on advanced cancers is more complex [1, 5-6]. Increased production of TGFβ has been found in many neoplasms such as breast, prostate, gastric, renal, and epidermal carcinomas, and elevated plasma TGFβ levels in patients have been correlated with advanced disease, metastases, and lower survival rates [7-13]. In these later stage cancers, TGFβ induced growth suppression is lost, and instead, TGFβ promotes tumor growth and metastasis. Eli Lilly has developed and produced a Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β) receptor type-1 kinase inhibitor. LY2157299 monohydrate (LY2157299) is a small molecule that inhibits the TGF-β receptor type 1 kinase activity. LY2157299 was developed to investigate its activity in patients with glioblastoma where TGF-β has been demonstrated to play a specific role in tumor progression. In addition, LY2157299 was investigated in other patient populations, either as a stand-alone therapy or in combination with standard anti-tumor treatment regimens for indications including hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Future investigations include indications with likely TGF-β associated pathway activation, such as melanoma, breast and prostate cancer as well as hematologic malignancies.</detailed_description>

Patients must have at least 3 distinct metastatic sites with at least one measurable lesion which is at least 1 cm or larger in largest diameter 5. At the time of enrollment, patients must be ≥ 4 weeks since all of the following treatments (and recovered from the toxicity of prior treatment to &lt;= Grade 1, exclusive of alopecia): major surgery; radiotherapy; chemotherapy (note: must be ≥ 6 weeks since therapy if treated with a nitrosourea, mitomycin, or monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab); immunotherapy; Biotherapy/targeted therapies. 6. Patient ≥ 18 years of age. Patient life expectancy &gt; 6 months. Eastern cooperative group (ECOG) of 0 or 1 7. Adequate organ function including: 1. Marrow: Hemoglobin &gt;= 10.0 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;=1,500/mm3, and platelets &gt;=100,000/mm3. 2. Hepatic: Serum total bilirubin &lt;=1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (Patients with Gilbert's Disease may be included if their total bilirubin is &lt;= 3.0 mg/dL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;= 2.5 x ULN. If the patient has known liver metastases, an ALT and/or AST &lt;= 5 x ULN are allowed. 3. Renal: Estimated or measured creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min. 4. Other: Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; ULN. 8. Patients must have negative tests (antibody and/or antigen) for hepatitis viruses B and C unless the result is consistent with prior vaccination or prior infection with full recovery. 9. Male and female patients of childproducing potential must agree to use effective contraception while enrolled on study and receiving the experimental drug, and for at least 3 months after the last treatment. Exclusion Criteria : 1. Patients diagnosed with another malignancy unless following curative intent therapy, the patient has been disease free for at least 2 years and the probability of recurrence of the prior malignancy is &lt; 5%. Patients with curatively treated earlystage squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) are eligible for this study. 2. Concurrent cancer therapy is not permitted. 3. Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases, meningeal carcinomatosis, malignant seizures, or a disease that either causes or threatens neurologic compromise (e.g., unstable vertebral metastases). 4. History of ascites or pleural effusions, unless successfully treated. 5. Patients with an organ transplant, including those that have received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. 6. Patients on immunosuppressive therapy including: 1. Systemic corticosteroid therapy for any reason, including replacement therapy for hypoadrenalism. Patients receiving inhaled or topical corticosteroids may participate (if therapy is &lt; 5 days and is limited to systemic steroids as antiemetics). 2. Patients receiving cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, or sirolimus are not eligible for this study. 7.
