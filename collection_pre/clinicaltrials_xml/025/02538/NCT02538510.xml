	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of pembrolizumab and vorinostat in treating patients with squamous cell head and neck cancer or salivary gland cancer that has come back, has spread to other places in the body and/or cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab together with vorinostat may be a better treatment for head and neck cancer or salivary gland cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab and Vorinostat in Treating Patients With Recurrent Squamous Cell Head and Neck Cancer or Salivary Gland Cancer That Is Metastatic and/or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and tolerability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in combination with vorinostat patients with recurrent metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (RMHNSCC) and recurrent metastatic salivary gland cancer (RMSGC). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rates and disease control rates of the combination of MK-3475 and vorinostat in patients with RMHNSCC and RMSGC. II. Examine programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and T cell phenotype in archived tumor, on-treatment tumor biopsies, pre- and post-treatment blood samples and correlate these with clinical response to the drug combination. III. Determine median overall survival and progression free survival in and RMHNSCC and RMSGC patients enrolled in the study. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Explore peripheral T cell phenotype at baseline and after 3 cycles vorinostat and MK-3475. II. Measure expression of the proteins in the PD-1 family on baseline tumor samples and on treatment biopsies. OUTLINE: Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) or via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on days 1-5 and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 8-12 weeks thereafter.</detailed_description>
