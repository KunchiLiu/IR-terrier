	<brief_title>Hospital Without Dyspnea. Rationale and Design of a Multidisciplinary Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We sought to investigate whether if teaching interventions specifically addressed to medical staff improve the well-being of dyspneic patients. The MAIN GOAL of this study is to evaluate the effect of two talks (conveyed to doctors and nurses of Cardiology and Respiratory Medicine Departments) on the patient-perceived dyspnea. The contents of these talks will be prepared and supervised by Palliative Care specialists. This is a four-staged study that includes a first observational phase (prevalence study of dyspnea) followed by intervention and a third phase that will determine the effect of this teaching intervention. The fourth phase consists in the elaboration of specific protocols for management of dyspnea. A pharmacovigilance study of opioids will also take place.</detailed_description>
