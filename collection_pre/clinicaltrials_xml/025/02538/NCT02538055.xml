	<brief_summary>As many as 75% of people with diabetes report chronic pain. While cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improves pain and functioning in individuals with chronic pain, many rural and underserved communities lack resources for such programs. The investigators tested the hypothesis that a CBT-based program delivered by community health workers (CHW) can improve quality of life in individuals with diabetes and chronic pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using CERS to Optimize Quality of Life for Persons With Diabetes and Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a growing chronic disease, affecting 20% of the population of Alabama. However, type 2 DM (90-95% of all DM) rarely occurs in isolation; 25% of all Americans report chronic pain, rising to 58-70% of community-dwellers over age 65. The National Center for Health Statistics reported in 2006 that chronic pain affected 76.2 million Americans, more than cancer, heart disease, stroke and DM combined. Despite the high prevalence of chronic pain, evidence suggests that under treatment is common. In one study, 68% of primary care physicians estimated that chronic pain was inadequately managed in their patients, and 60% thought improving physician education could help. Indeed, 40% of people with moderate to severe pain report not getting adequate relief. Chronic pain is a significant barrier to successful DM self-care; patients with chronic pain have lower medication adherence and are less likely to exercise. Fully 60-80% of DM patients report chronic pain, and in our ENCOURAGE pilot study (Safford, PI), all but one participant did so. About 20-25% of pain may stem from neuropathy, but at least 1/3 stems from OA (osteoarthritis), and coexistence of multiple causes is common. Over half of patients &gt;65 and 60% of women of any age report OA, demonstrating the very high prevalence of OA in this demographic group. Pain management dominated 20% of primary care visits for diabetic patients in one study, and decreased the likelihood of DM risk factor management. Not surprisingly, depressive symptoms are common in individuals with OA and chronic pain, and are also associated with non adherence to DM self-care behavior. Pain is therefore a barrier to not only quality of life, but to successful DM self-care. While cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improves pain and functioning in individuals with chronic pain, many rural and underserved communities lack resources for such programs. The investigators tested the hypothesis that a CBT-based program delivered by community health workers (CHW) can improve quality of life in individuals with diabetes and chronic pain.</detailed_description>
