	<brief_title>Effect of Acetyl-L-carnitine on Chronic Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label pilot study to determine the effect of the amino acid nutritional supplement acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) on chronic pancreatitis. ALC is an acetylated form of naturally occurring amino acid L-carnitine ((R)-3-Acetyloxy-4-trimethylammonio-butanoate) found in red meat and is readily commercially available. Supplementation with ALC may decrease pain and improve overall health based on our preclinical treatment studies in rats with high fat and alcohol induced pancreatitis. In rats, ALC reduces pain measures, improves glucose tolerance, decreases lipid peroxidation, and Ki67 cellular injury biomarker, and improves pancreatic histopathology. The measurable outcomes of this clinical study are patients' questionnaire scores for: pain, quality of life, well-being, and serum pro-inflammatory mediator and oxidative stress levels in volunteers with chronic pancreatitis. The questionnaires are given at intake and at experiment end (3 months). Participants will receive ALC for 3 months. These findings will indirectly determine the effect of ALC on the function and inflammatory state of the pancreas. Currently, there is no specific therapy for chronic pancreatitis, and its pathophysiology is still poorly understood. It is known that chronic pancreatitis is caused by ongoing inflammation in the pancreas, yet, no pharmacological intervention exists that optimally addresses this. The broad actions of ALC as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent as well as its ability to reduce side-effects of alcohol cessation make it a perfect compound to pursue for the treatment of pancreatitis.</detailed_description>
