	<brief_title>A Study of Lenalidomide in Pediatric Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, Phase 2, Simon's Optimal two-stage design study, with an Optional Extension Phase (OEP), that will assess the activity, safety and Pharmacokinetics (PK) of lenalidomide in pediatric subjects from 1 to ≤ 18 years of age with second or greater Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (rrAML). A total of 43 evaluable subjects (18 subjects in Stage 1 and an additional 25 subjects in Stage 2) are required for assessment of the primary endpoint. To allow for subjects found to be unevaluable for the primary endpoint due to an incorrect diagnosis, not having a disease assessment post screening, or who discontinued prior to receiving lenalidomide, up to 4 additional subjects may be enrolled for a maximum of 47 evaluable subjects across approximately 70 sites. Approximately 50% of enrolled subjects will be younger than 12 years of age to provide adequate PK data for this age subset. If during Stage 1, at least 3 of 18 subjects achieve a morphologic complete response (either CR or CRi) within the first 4 cycles of study treatment, then the study will proceed to Stage 2; otherwise, the study will be terminated. Similarly, if at the final analysis, at least 8 of 43 evaluable subjects across Stages 1 and 2 achieve a response (CR/CRi) within the first 4 cycles of study treatment, it will be concluded that lenalidomide has sufficient activity in pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) to warrant subsequent study. The optional extension phase (OEP) will allow subjects who demonstrate clinical benefit, as assessed by the Investigator at the completion of 12 cycles of lenalidomide therapy, to continue receiving oral lenalidomide until they meet the criteria for study discontinuation. In the OEP, only safety, dosing, concomitant medications/procedures, and second primary malignancies (SPMs) will be monitored.</detailed_description>

Subject has recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to first dose. All prior treatmentrelated toxicities must have resolved to ≤ Grade 2 prior to enrollment. 8. Regarding radiation therapy, time elapsed prior to first dose of lenalidomide: 2 weeks for local palliative radiation therapy (XRT). 8 weeks if prior craniospinal chemoradiation therapy (CRT) or if ≥ 50% radiation of pelvis. 6 weeks if other bone marrow radiation has been administered. 9. Graftversushost disease criteria: Subject must be at least 2 months (from first dose of lenalidomide) from stem cell infusion. Subject must have no evidence of active acute or chronic GVHD (Grade 0) for 4 weeks prior to the first dose of lenalidomide. If the subject has a history of maximum Grade 1 or 2 GVHD that was treated with systemic steroid (≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents) or other nonsteroid systemic IST, the subject must be off all IST for at least 2 weeks, and must have ceased treatment doses of steroids for GVHD (≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 4 weeks. o If the subject has a history of Grade 3 or greater GVHD, the subject must be off all systemic IST for 4 weeks o Topical therapy is permitted and does not imply the subject has active acute or chronic GVHD. Physiologic dosing of hydrocortisone is permitted. 10. At least 4 weeks (from first dose) elapsed from donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) without conditioning. 11. Subject has adequate renal function, which is defined as: Creatinine clearance calculated using the Schwartz formula, or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 70 mL/min/1.73 m2. 12. Subject has adequate liver function, which is defined as: • Total bilirubin is ≤ 2 mg/dL unless the increase in bilirubin is attributable to Gilbert's Syndrome • AST is ≤ 3.0 x upper normal limit (ULN) for age. For the purpose of this study, the ULN for AST is 50 U/L. • ALT is ≤ 3.0 x upper normal limit (ULN) for age. For the purpose of this study, the ULN for ALT is 45 U/L. 13. Female Children of Childbearing Potential (FCCBP), Female of Childbearing Potential (FCBP) and male subjects that have reached puberty must agree to undergo physicianapproved reproductive education and discuss the side effects of the study therapy on reproduction with parent(s) and/or guardian(s). 14. All subjects and/or parents/guardians must have an understanding that lenalidomide could have a potential teratogenic risk. Female Children of Childbearing Potential, defined as females who have achieved menarche and/or breast development in Tanner Stage 2 or greater and have not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy and FCBP defined as a sexually mature woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy and has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months) must meet the following conditions below (Note: Amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential): Medically supervised serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL must be conducted in FCCBP/FCBP, including those who commit to complete abstinence*. FCCBP/FCBP must have two pregnancy tests (with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL) prior to starting treatment with lenalidomide. The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10 14 days prior to the start of lenalidomide treatment and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior to starting treatment with lenalidomide. NOTE: The pregnancy test 10 to 14 days prior to initiation of lenalidomide may be omitted, at the discretion of the investigator, for any FCCBP/FCBP who has high acuity disease requiring immediate treatment with lenalidomide. The pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the first dose of lenalidomide is required to be performed. The subject may not receive Investigational Product (IP) until the Investigator has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests performed on Cycle 1 Day 1 are negative. FCCBP/FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28 days of study participation and then every 28 days while on study, at study Treatment Discontinuation Visit, and at Day 28 following IP discontinuation. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28 days and then every 14 days while on study, at study Treatment Discontinuation Visit, and at Days 14 and 28 following IP discontinuation. Female subjects must, as appropriate to age and at the discretion of the study Investigator, either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) and/or agree to the use of two reliable forms of approved and effective contraceptive methods simultaneously.
