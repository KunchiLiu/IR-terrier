	<brief_summary>Bladder cancer is a well-recognized complication in spinal cord injury (SCI) individuals. The observed incidence rates in SCI individuals are considerably higher compared to the general population. Bladder cancer in SCI individuals tends to present at an earlier age compared to the general population. Furthermore, bladder cancer in SCI individuals is more commonly invasive and at a more advanced stage at the time of diagnosis compared to bladder cancer in the general population. Individuals with bladder cancer commonly present with hematuria and other urinary symptoms. The gold standard for diagnosis is cystoscopy. However in SCI individuals, hematuria may get attributed to catheter irritation or trauma or an urinary tract infection. Furthermore, the bladder wall commonly presents with various changes under cystoscopic examination masking the presence of a bladder wall mass. Thus, diagnosis of bladder cancer in SCI individuals can be complicate. Some cytokeratins are frequently overexpressed in tumor cells and are therefore a marker of bladder cancer. There is a new commercial test available for the quantitative measurement of cytokeratins. The diagnostic accuracy of this test has been investigated in non-SCI individuals with symptoms suspicious for bladder cancer. The test showed high sensitivity and specificity values and is thus a promising diagnostic or screening tool. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the test has not yet been investigated in SCI individuals. The primary objective of the proposed study is to investigate whether urine cytokeratin levels in spinal cord injury individuals with symptoms and findings suspicious for bladder cancer are a discriminator between individuals suffering from bladder cancer and those not suffering from cancer. Individuals presenting with symptoms suspicious of bladder cancer will undergo ultrasonic and cystoscopic examination of the bladder. An urine sample will be taken, and the bladder will be flushed for collecting a bladder fluid sample. In patients with bladder wall findings suspicious of cancer, a bladder wall biopsy will be taken, according to clinical standard practice. The bladder fluid and the bladder wall biopsy will be submitted for cytology and histopathology examination, respectively. Cytokeratin levels will be measured in the urine sample.</brief_summary>
