	<brief_title>Determination of the Postprandial Responses to Two Cereal Foods Differing by Their SDS Content Consumed Alone.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aimed at determining the 4-hours postprandial blood glucose and insulin responses to the ingestion of cereal product differing by their SDS content. It is a laboratory-based research study with an open cross-over design, including 20 healthy non-smoking voluntary subjects, aged from 18 to 45 years. 2 test sessions per subject are included in the study. Foods are consumed in a random order according to a randomisation list.</detailed_description>
