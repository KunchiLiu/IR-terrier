	<brief_summary>Volume-targeted noninvasive ventilation (VT-NIV), a hybrid mode that targets a preseted tidal volume (VT) by automated adjustment of pressure support, could guarantee the delivered VT over pressure-limited noninvasive ventilation (PL-NIV) with fixed level pressure support. Whether VT-NIV is more effective in improving gas exchange in patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) as compared with PL-NIV remains unclear. Our aim was to verify whether in comparison with PL-NIV, use of VT-NIV was more effective in correcting hypercapnia, hence reducing the need for intubation and improving survival in patients with AHRF.</brief_summary>
