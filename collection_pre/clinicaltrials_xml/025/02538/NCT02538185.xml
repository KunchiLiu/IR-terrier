	<criteria>Has completed the written informed consent process. Is male or female aged 18 years and 50 years. Agrees to stay in contact with the study site for the duration of the study, provide updated contact information as necessary, and has no current plans to move from the study area for the duration of the study. Agrees to avoid elective surgery for the duration of the study. For female subjects: agrees to avoid pregnancy through the duration of the study. Is in good general health, confirmed by medical history, physical examination and screening laboratory tests. Oral body temperature 37.5 Celcius (C). History or evidence of rabies vaccination or rabies contact. Abnormal CBC (Complete Blood Count) laboratory values (&gt;10% above Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) or &gt;10% below Lower Limit of Normal (LLN)) and abnormal biochemistry values from blood collected at screening (&gt;10% above ULN or &gt;10% below LLN). Analysis can be repeated upon request of the clinician. History or evidence of autoimmune disease. History or evidence of any past, present, or future possible immunodeficiency state, including HIV 1 infection. History or evidence of chronic hepatitis, including presence of antihepatitis B core antibodies or antihepatitis C antibodies.Participation in any other investigational study during the study period. Received immunoglobulin or blood products within 90 days prior to study visit 2. Received any investigational drug therapy or investigational vaccine within 180 days prior to study. Received any licensed vaccine within 45 days prior to study visit 2 (note: the use of licensed vaccines medically indicated during the study is permitted at any time). History or evidence of any treatment that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the vaccine response or compromise the safety of the subject. Received Chloroquin and/or Proguanil treatment within 420 days prior to study. Use of immunosuppressive drugs or anticoagulants. All female subjects: currently pregnant or lactating/nursing; positive screening urine pregnancy test; or positive urine pregnancy test on the day of any study vaccination History or evidence of allergic disease or reaction that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the safety of the subject (Notably: allergy to active principle, excipients, polymyxin B, Streptomycin, Neomycin). History or evidence of dermatologic disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the assessment of injection site reactions. History or evidence of any other acute or chronic disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity of the vaccine or compromise the safety of the subject. Medical, psychiatric, occupational, or substance abuse problems that, in the opinion of the investigator, will make it unlikely that the subject will comply with the protocol. History or evidence of any brain disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the vaccine and compromise the safety of the subject. Abnormal urinalysis at the screening visit that, in the opinion of the investigator, is clinically significant. Skin coloration (skin color, tattoo, freckles) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with injection reactogenicity assessment. Body Mass Index (BMI)&lt;= 18 and =&gt; 33 (weight/height2). Immediate need of rabies immunization.</criteria>
