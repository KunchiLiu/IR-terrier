	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between personal life meaning and purpose and physical activity maintenance in a group of previously sedentary adults starting new exercise programs. Participants complete questionnaires at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks after starting an exercise program. Participants are randomly assigned to complete questionnaires about daily meaning, mood, and activity for the first 4 weeks or to complete 8 random questionnaires about daily activities over the first 4 weeks. It is hypothesized that personal life meaning and purpose will be related to greater exercise participation at 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
