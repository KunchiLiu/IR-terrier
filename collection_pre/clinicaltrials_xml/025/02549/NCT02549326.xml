	<brief_summary>Obesity is associated with lower total serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (S-25OHD) concentration. However, the impact of obesity on free S-25OHD is inadequately studied. A direct assay for free 25OHD was introduced recently. The aim of the study was to evaluate differences in vitamin D metabolism between young adults with severe childhood-onset obesity and normal-weight controls. Half of the obese subjects and controls will receive placebo and the other half will receive vitamin D3 50 Âµg daily for 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
