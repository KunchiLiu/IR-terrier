	<brief_summary>Nimotuzumab (hR3) is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody that recognized an epitope located in the extra cellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Clinical efficacy has been shown in adult with head and neck cancer. The study assessed the efficacy and safety of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concomitantly with chemoradiotherapy in patients with NSCLC .There is a tolerance trial of Nimotuzumab in Combination With Radiochemotherapy treatment before the randomization,double blind,muti-center sites trial of this treatment.</brief_summary>
