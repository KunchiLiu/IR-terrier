	<brief_summary>In France, the prevalence of problem gambling and risk has been estimated at 1.3%. This disorder, currently considered a behavioral addiction is characterized by a loss of control and an excessive focus on the game. The literature on intervening psychological mechanisms in the development of the game led to think that the size of loss of control, central among players, could be understood as a reduction in control capacity but also as automatic activation behavior game. The task of Go-Nogo, commonly used in cognitive psychology, assesses the automatic and controlled components of behavior. Furthermore, different models of the concept of addiction underline the importance of the environment associated with addiction. However, no study takes into account the interaction between the game environment and the involvement of these mechanisms.</brief_summary>
