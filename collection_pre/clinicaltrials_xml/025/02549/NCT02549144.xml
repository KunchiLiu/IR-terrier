	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators aimed at measuring the effect of a two-week high-fat/high-cholesterol (HFHC) normocaloric diet on HDL particles biochemical composition and HDL function compared to a two-week low-fat/low-cholesterol (LFLC) normocaloric diet.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of a Large Increase in Dietary Fats and Cholesterol on HDL Composition and Function in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HDL particles can change their composition and function in response to a variety of pathological conditions and environmental stimuli. It has been previously shown that a western diet is able to drastically modify biochemical composition, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of HDL in animals. In humans little is known on the role of diet on HDL function and composition.</detailed_description>
