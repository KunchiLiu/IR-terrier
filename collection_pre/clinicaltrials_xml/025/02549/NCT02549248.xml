	<brief_summary>Nanoparticles (NP) are particles whose length, width and height are less than 100 nanometres. Over the past decade, industrial applications of NP have increased dramatically. Despite their widespread use, their true impact on human health remains unknown and poorly studied. NP exposure in humans primarily occurs via inhalation through the respiratory system. The aim of this study is to estimate the relationships between the nanoparticle load in the lung and bronchi and some interstitial lung diseases. In the aftermath of human exposure to asbestos, the pathological consequences of environmental exposure to nanomaterials could be evaluated upon a mineralogical analysis of pulmonary samples.</brief_summary>
