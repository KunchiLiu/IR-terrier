	<brief_title>A Dose Titration Study of CPC-201 in Patients With Dementia of Alzheimer's Type</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II, ascending dose study of CPC-201 in patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type to determine the optimal dose titration schedule. The study involves a step wise cohort design in two different patient populations: Group 1 will comprise of patients who have been treated with low dose of CPC-201(5 or 10 mg/day) (given once daily) for at least 4 weeks just prior to Day1. Group 2 will consist of patients who have never been treated with CPC-201 before or who have not received any other AChEI for the past 6 months. In this study, CPC-201 dose will be increased at weekly intervals, in accordance with the schedules given below, to its first intolerable dose (FID) or maximum allowed dose (MAD) 60 mg/day. Cohort 1 1st week: 20mg 2nd week: 30mg 3rd week: 40mg 4th week: 50mg 5th week: 60mg Cohort 2* 1st week: 20mg 2nd week: 40mg 3rd week: 60mg Cohort 3* 1st week: 20mg 2nd week: 60mg *: The dose titration schedule of Cohort 2 and 3 may be altered based on Cohort 1 result. Each cohort will include approximately 6 patients CPC-201(Group 1) and approximately 6 patients not treated with an AchEI for at least 6 months (Group 2). Within each cohort, Group 2 patient will be enrolled only when at least 3 Group 1 patients have completed dose titration per protocol. Patients will be enrolled in Cohort 2 only when patients enrolled in Cohort 1 have safely completed titration. Similary, patients will be enrolled in Cohort 3, only when patients enrolled in Cohort 2 have safely completed titration. Patients reaching their FID or having completed one week treatment with CPC-201 60mg/day, have two options. Option 1: Patient will be allowed to immediately enter a long term extension at their Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or MAD. Option 2: Patients may choose not to enter the long term extension, in which case the Investigator will decide whether the patient should discontinue high dose of CPC-201 without down-titration, or whetherCPC-201should be downtitrated to their own standard of donepezil dose.</detailed_description>
