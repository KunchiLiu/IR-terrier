	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effectiveness of community health workers when added to routine care for patients with diabetes and high blood pressure in rural clinics in Chiapas, Mexico. It does so by recording information on adherence to therapy, blood pressure and blood sugar while a non-governmental organization working in Mexico trains and introduces a community health worker program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Community Health Workers on Adherence to Therapy for Non-Communicable Chronic Disease in Chiapas, Mexico</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compañeros en Salud (CES), an affiliate project of Partners in Health, has been working in the rural Sierra of Chiapas, Mexico since February 2012. CES works in partnership with the local Ministry of Health to rehabilitate and staff existing government primary care clinics. Each community's clinic is staffed by one CES project physician year-round. CES activities span the range of allopathic medicine, but the focus of the project is in the prevention, detection, diagnosis and management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes and hypertension. CES currently operates in several rural communities with catchment areas of approximately 1,500 - 2,500 people. Routine care for NCDs is based on national guidelines and consists of monthly in-clinic visits by primary care physicians. Over 9 months in 2014, CES will introduce a community health worker program called "Acompañantes" to its project communities to augment care of patients with NCDs. Acompañantes are lay health workers and members of the community who bridge the gap between project clinics and patients, improving understanding of NCDs, their treatments, and adherence to therapy. The introduction of Acompañantes to communities is planned in a once-every-three-months fashion, the most rapid roll-out logistically feasible for CES. The investigators' project will document their experience over this time, and for one year after introduction of the Acompañantes program to all four study communities, by documenting adherence to therapy, hemoglobin a1c, and blood pressure at every-three month intervals over this time frame.</detailed_description>
