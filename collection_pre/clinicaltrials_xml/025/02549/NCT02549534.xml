	<brief_title>Early Detection of Taxane-Induced Neuropathy in Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: The study has four aims; - The primary aim of the study is to determine whether women who are receiving either weekly Taxol (80-100 mg/m2) or bi-weekly Taxol (i.e.,dose-dense; 175 mg/m2) show deficits in axon-reflex mediated vasodilation (AMV) over the course of six weeks of Taxol therapy similar to those that have been reported in patients with diabetic and genetically-inherited neuropathies. - The second aim of the study is to determine whether women who are receiving either weekly or dose-dense Taxol develop changes in AMV before developing signs &amp; symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in a way that supports using changes in AMV as an early detection method for small-fiber CIPN. - A third (exploratory) aim of the study is to determine whether any changes in AMV detected during the study are significantly correlated with self-reported CIPN in a way that would support using changes in AMV as a confirmatory marker for CIPN. - A final (exploratory) aim of the study is to describe the size of axon reflexes and axon flares in women receiving weekly Taxol before they start their pre-Taxol anthracycline &amp; cyclophosphamide (AC) therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for Women with Breast Cancer: Age 1885 Able to read, write, and understand English Diagnosed with histologicallyconfirmed, firsttime, nonmetastatic breast cancer (stage IIIIB) No prior exposure to neurotoxic chemotherapy or radiation at the time of enrollment, Will be receiving weekly paclitaxel (Taxol® or generic paclitaxel, 80 100mg/m2) or biweekly Taxol (i.e., dosedense; 175 mg/m2) as a part of their cancer treatment regimen OR Will be receiving an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by weekly paclitaxel (Taxol® or generic paclitaxel, 80100mg/m2) or biweekly Taxol (i.e., dosedense; 175 mg/m2) as a part of their cancer treatment regimen; Inclusion Criteria for Healthy Controls: Aged 1885 Can read, write, and understand English A history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or peripheral arterial/vascular disease; Current use of (1) medications/supplements to control blood pressure (e.g. betablockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, Phosphodiesterase5 (PGE5) inhibitors) or (2) the use of statins for cholesterol; Suspected or diagnosed diabetes (with the exception of gestational diabetes); Preexisting neuropathy, neuropathic pain, or nerve injury; Pain or significant arthritis in the toes of either foot; Current skin disease or fungal infection of the feet; Significant damage or deformity to the feet that would alter blood flow or make it impossible to measure/interpret findings; Diagnosed or suspected vasospastic disease such as Raynaud's syndrome; Current use of tobacco/tobaccocontaining products; Diagnosis of restless leg syndrome or other movement disorders that would prevent accurate data from being able to be collected. InStudy Restrictions: No caffeine or alcoholcontaining products for 12 hours prior to their study visit; No food for at least one hour prior to blood flow monitoring; No nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for 24 hours prior to study visits unless directed by a physician to do so. (Note: These restrictions are designed to improve the rigor and quality of the data, but noncompliance will not be grounds for study exclusion; adherence to these restrictions will be monitored during selfreport).</criteria>
