	<brief_summary>This is a Phase III, prospective, multicenter study with two study parts (epochs) to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of HYQVIA/HyQvia (IGI, 10% with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) administered subcutaneously) for maintenance therapy to prevent relapse (Epoch 1) and GAMMAGARD LIQUID/KIOVIG (immunoglobulin G intravenous (IGIV) 10% administered intravenously) for the treatment of CIDP (Epoch 2). This study will enroll adult subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of CIDP and who have remained on a stable dosing regimen (monthly equivalent dose of 0.4 to 2.4 g/kg body weight (BW) with a dosing interval of 2 to 6 weeks) of IGIV therapy for at least 3 months prior to screening. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of the study (Epoch 1), eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either HYQVIA/HyQvia or 0.25% albumin placebo solution with rHuPH20 every two, three, or four weeks in a double-blind fashion for a period of 6 months or until relapse. Subjects who relapse during Epoch 1 will enter Epoch 2 to receive IGIV treatment for a period of 6 months.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Documented diagnosis of definite or probable Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) (focal atypical CIDP and pure sensory atypical CIDP will be excluded) consistent with European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) 2010 criteria. 2. Participant has responded to IgG treatment in the past, (partial or complete resolution of neurological symptoms and deficits), and must currently be on stable doses of intravenous immunoglobulin G (IGIV) treatment at monthly equivalent dose of 0.4 to 2.4 g/kg body weight (BW) with a dosing interval of 2 to 6 weeks for at least 3 months prior to screening. 3. Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment disability scale (INCAT) disability score between 0 and 7 (inclusive). Participants with INCAT scores of 0, 1, or 2 (if at least 1 point is from an upper extremity) must have a history of significant disability ie, INCAT disability score of 2 (must be exclusively from the lower extremities) or greater in the past 24 months. 4. If female of childbearing potential, the participant must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and agree to employ a highly effective contraceptive measure throughout the course of the study and for at least 30 days after the last administration of investigational product. 5. Participant is willing and able to sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF). 6. Participant is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol. 1. Focal atypical CIDP or pure sensory atypical CIDP. 2. Any neuropathy of other causes, including: 1. Hereditary demyelinating neuropathies 2. Neuropathies secondary to infections, disorders, or systemic diseases such as Borrelia burgdorferi infection (Lyme disease), diphtheria; systemic lupus erythematosus; polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy or edema, Mprotein, skin changes (POEMS) syndrome; osteosclerotic myeloma; diabetic and nondiabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy; lymphoma, and amyloidosis 3. Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) 4. Drug, biologic, chemotherapy, or toxininduced peripheral neuropathy 3. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) paraproteinemia, including IgM monoclonal gammopathy with high titer antibodies to myelinassociated glycoprotein 4. Prominent sphincter disturbance. 5. Central demyelinating disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis). 6. Any chronic or debilitating disease, or central nervous disorder that causes neurological symptoms or may interfere with assessment of CIDP or outcome measures (eg, arthritis, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy) (Participants with clinically diagnosed diabetes mellitus who do not have diabetic peripheral neuropathy, who have adequate glycemic control with Hemoglobin A1C; also known as glycosylated or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) of &lt;7.5% at screening, and who agree to maintain adequate glycemic control during the study are allowed.) 7. Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III/IV), unstable angina, unstable cardiac arrhythmias, or uncontrolled hypertension (ie, diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg). 8. History of deep vein thrombosis or thromboembolic events (eg, cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary embolism) in the past 12 months. 9. Condition(s) which could alter protein catabolism and/or IgG utilization (eg, proteinlosing enteropathies, nephrotic syndrome). 10. Known history of chronic kidney disease, or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m^2 estimated based on CKDEPI equation (2009). 11. Participant with active malignancy requiring chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, or history of malignancy with less than 2 years of complete remission prior to screening. Exceptions are: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, and stable prostate cancer not requiring treatment. 12. Clinically significant anemia or hemoglobin (Hgb) level of &lt;10.0 g/dL at screening. 13. Hypersensitivity or adverse reactions (eg, urticaria, breathing difficulty, severe hypotension, or anaphylaxis) to human blood products such as human IgG, albumin, or other blood components. 14.

Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) 2. Platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/µL 3. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1000 cells/µL 17. Ongoing/active infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Type 1/2 infection. 18.

Participant has received or is currently receiving treatment with corticosteroids within 3 months prior to screening. The following exceptions for prednisolone or its equivalent are allowed: stable dosages of lowdose systemic corticosteroids (≤10 mg prednisolone/day or its equivalent) and nonsystemic corticosteroids (eg, topical, ophthalmic, or inhaled glucocorticoids). In addition and for the purpose of treating AE or nonCIDP intercurrent disease, a single corticosteroid dose &gt;10 mg prednisolone or a single short term course of ≤ to 7 days (such as Methylprednisolone Dose Pack) within 3 months prior to screening is allowed. 20. Participant has undergone plasma exchange within 3 months prior to screening. 21. The participant has any disorder or condition that in the investigator's judgment may impede the participant's participation in the study, pose increased risk to the participant, or confound the results of the study. 22. The participant is nursing or intends to begin nursing during the course of the study. 23.
