	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 5-period crossover study is to assess the effect of single oral doses of MK-1064 on latency to persistent sleep (LPS) as measured by polysomnography (PSG) in healthy young male participants, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single oral doses of MK-1064 and MK-6096 in healthy young male participants. The primary efficacy hypothesis is that at least one dose of MK-1064 is superior to placebo in decreasing LPS in healthy male participants as assessed by PSG.</brief_summary>
