	<brief_summary>Hemiplegic adults after stroke (stroke), children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) have both muscles spastic and paresis. These movement disorders are likely to cause muscle changes both structural and viscoelastic involved in the alteration of neuromotor functions such as walking. Therefore, it seems interesting to study the structure of these muscles with available imaging techniques. The medial gastrocnemius muscle presents architectural characteristics which allows easy evaluation 2D ultrasound. The literature lacks data on the reproducibility of the measurement, by 2D ultrasound, of the pennation angle and muscular thickness, particularly in children. In addition, the sonoelastometry by Supersonic ShearWave Imaging (SSI) is a new technique of ultrasound, non-invasive, dynamic, which allows the calculation of the modulus of elasticity within a muscle tissue. This allows to consider new perspectives evaluation of the viscoelastic properties of the muscle. No studies have evaluated the reproducibility of this method in adults/children/ adolescent after stroke and hemiplegia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurement by 2D Ultrasound of the Pennation Angle and Elasticity of Gastrocnemius Muscle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 1 week apart, an ultrasound examination will be conducted on the hemiplegic leg side, while lying on his stomach and on the back. The thickness, elasticity and the pennation angle of the medial gastrocnemius muscle will be measured.</detailed_description>
