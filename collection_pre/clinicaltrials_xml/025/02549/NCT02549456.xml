	<detailed_description>Intervention will be done by conventional laparoscopy and transanal endoscopy (TEO or Gelpoint platform), patients are divided into two arms to compare different natural orifice techniques in resection of colorectal cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Medically fit patient. 2. Non metastatic pathologically proven sigmoid colon cancer. 3. Non metastatic pathologically proven rectal cancer. 4. Patient continent for stool. 1. Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) score 4 and 5. 2. Patients with cardiac or chest problems that cannot withstand insufflation. 3. Unresectable tumors (defined as those who cannot be resected without a high likelihood of leaving microscopic or gross residual disease at the local site because of tumor adherence or fixation). 4. Obstructed or perforated cancer. 5. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. 6. Incontinent patients.</criteria>
