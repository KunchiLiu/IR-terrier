	<brief_summary>The prevalence of non-specific neck pain is 12.1 / 1000 patients / year. Their support is most often based on analgesics combined with physical therapy. More recently authors have advocated the use of self-rehabilitation, that is to say, the use by the patient himself of physiotherapy exercises to perform at home regularly. However, if there are currently many studies on the effectiveness of self-rehabilitation for low back pain, there are few data on neck pain. In this context we have chosen to implement a prospective, randomized study, on the effectiveness of self-rehabilitation in patients with chronic neck pain.</brief_summary>
