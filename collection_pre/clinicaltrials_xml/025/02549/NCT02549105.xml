Research Question: Is lidocaine-prilocaine (EMLA) cream application effective as compared to local anesthetic (lidocaine) infiltration on post-caesarean section pain? Research Hypothesis: Lidocaine-prilocaine (EMLA) cream application is effective in post_caesarean section pain as compared to local anesthetic (lidocaine) infiltration.
