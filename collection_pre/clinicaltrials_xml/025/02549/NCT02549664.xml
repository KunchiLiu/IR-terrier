	<detailed_description>Yale is the central site for this multicenter study. Patients with HCM and LQTS will be recruited via high-volume HCM and LQTS sites, patient-groups, and websites. Information about exercise participation will be acquired via interview and online instruments at enrollment and every six months for three years. Quality of Life questionnaires will be filled out at enrollment and at the end of the study. Participants will receive a Fitbit (pedometer) and will wear it initially for two weeks and then one week every three months. The Fitbit is used for assessment of exercise level only. Clinical records will be obtained from treating physicians. Participants will also be asked to call the central site if they experience syncope, appropriate ICD shock, or resuscitated arrest. Information regarding the patient's activity at the time of event will then be obtained by phone interview. Follow-up clinical records will be obtained as indicated to corroborate endpoints.</detailed_description>
