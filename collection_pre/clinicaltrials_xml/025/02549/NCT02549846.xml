	<detailed_description>It is much more important in Japan than Western to improve the prognosis after stroke because the prevalence and mortality rate of stroke in Japan is about 3-4 times as those of acute myocardial infarction. Investigators will study whether immediate statin treatment after the onset of stroke is beneficial on the neurological protection since most of previous studies with statins just showed the preventive effects from onset of primary or recurrent cerebral infarction.</detailed_description>
