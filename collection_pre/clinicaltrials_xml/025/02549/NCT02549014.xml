	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rising, single oral doses MK-1064 in healthy, young, male participants. The primary pharmacokinetic hypothesis is that at least one dose of MK-1064 that is generally safe and well tolerated produces an average MK-1064 plasma concentration from 0 to 4 hours of ≥2.2 μM. Since this is an early Phase I assessment of MK-1064 in humans, the study protocol allows for modifications to the outlined dose, dosing regimen and/or clinical or laboratory procedures, if required to address study objectives and/or to ensure appropriate safety monitoring of participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single Dose Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of MK-1064 (MK-1064-001)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two panels (Panels A and B), will receive alternating single rising oral doses of MK-1064/placebo (i.e., order of administration will be Panel A 5 mg, Panel B 10 mg, Panel A 25 mg, Panel B 50 mg, and continuing in this alternating sequence). Following dosing for a given treatment period, a minimum of 3 days will elapse before administration of the next scheduled dose. After administration of each dose, safety and tolerability will be reviewed. The decision to proceed to the next Panel/Period in the alternating sequence will be contingent on acceptable safety and tolerability data from the preceding Panels/Periods.</detailed_description>
