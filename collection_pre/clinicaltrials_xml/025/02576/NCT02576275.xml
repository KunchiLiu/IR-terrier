	<brief_title>A Study of Duvelisib in Combination With Rituximab and Bendamustine vs Placebo in Combination With Rituximab and Bendamustine in Subjects With Previously-Treated Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (BRAVURA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study IPI-145-22 is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm Phase 3 study designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of DBR vs PBR in subjects with previously-treated iNHL (including follicular lymphoma [FL], small lymphocytic lymphoma [SLL] and marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]). Approximately 600 subjects will receive 25 mg of duvelisib or placebo, orally BID for 28 day continuous cycles, in combination with 375 mg/m2 of rituximab given on Day 1 of Cycles 1-6 and 90 mg/m2 of bendamustine given on Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycles 1-6. Subjects will receive duvelisib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
