	<brief_summary>Phase 1 will investigate maximum tolerated dose of OXi4503 as a single agent and in combination with intermediate-dose cytarabine in subjects with relapsed/refractory AML or MDS. Phase 2 will investigate overall response rate of OXi4503 in combination with intermediate-dose cytarabine in 1) subjects with MDS after failure of 1 prior hypomethylating agent (Arm A) and 2) subjects with relapsed and refractory AML after treatment failure of up to 1 prior chemotherapy regimen (Arm B).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation of OXi4503 as Single Agent and Combination With Cytarabine w/Subsequent Ph 2 Cohorts for AML and MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1 dose escalation component will assess the safety, PK/PD, and preliminary efficacy of OXi4503 as a single agent in subjects with relapsed/refractory AML and MDS, and the safety and PK/PD of the combination of OXi4503 with intermediate-dose cytarabine in subjects with AML/MDS. Phase 2 will assess the preliminary efficacy of the OXi4503+cytarabine combination in 2 cohorts.</detailed_description>
