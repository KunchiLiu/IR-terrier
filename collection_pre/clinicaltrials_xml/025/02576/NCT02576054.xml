This study will consist of two periods. Period I of the study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and tolerability of V501 up to Month 7. Period II of the study is to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity and safety from Month 7 to Month 30. Two analyses are planned. The first analysis will be conducted when all subjects have completed their Month 7 visit or have been discontinued before that time. The second analysis will be conducted at the end of study.
