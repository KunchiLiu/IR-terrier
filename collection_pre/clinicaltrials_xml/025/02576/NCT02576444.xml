	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this phase II trial is to determine tumor overall response rate (ORR) in molecularly selected patients with measurable disease as assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), before versus after 16 weeks of treatment across tumor types in each arm of the study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a phase II signal-searching study in a range of tumor types with the potential to identify novel tumor indications for combination therapy with olaparib that can subsequently be explored in dedicated studies. Patients will be enrolled in this study based on molecular markers from genetic profiling performed on their tumors prior to study entry (outside of protocol). The trial will also identify genetic determinants of response and resistance. Patients with tumors harboring mutations in DNA damage repair genes will be treated with olaparib. Patients with tumors harboring either TP53 or KRAS mutations or mutations in KRAS and TP53 will be treated with AZD1775 plus olaparib. Patients with tumors harboring PIK3CA, AKT, or ARID1A mutations or other molecular aberrations leading to dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway will be treated with AZD5363 plus olaparib. Patients with tumors harboring mutations such as TORC1/2 or TSC1/2 or LKB1 mutations or are PTEN-deficient (determined either by genetic mutation or by IHC) will be treated with AZD2014 plus olaparib.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically documented metastatic cancer (solid tumors, not including hematologic malignancies) Patients who have received standard firstline therapy for metastatic cancer (except for the tumors for which no firstline therapy exists) and in whom a trial of targeted therapy is considered the best available treatment option.

Progressive cancer at the time of study entry Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 Age ≥ 18 years Life expectancy ≥ 16 weeks Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) score of 0 or 1 (APPENDIX A: Performance Status Criteria) Able to understand the nature of this trial and provide written informed consent Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up. Molecular testing results from CLIAcertified laboratories used for patient eligibility should be obtained from the most recent tumor biopsy (baseline tumor biopsies and onprogression tumor biopsies are optional) No previous treatment with the specific assigned study drug or any other drug sharing the same target. Prior treatment in monotherapy when treated in one of the combination arms in the study is allowed. Prior radiation therapy is allowed. Patients must not have received radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment. Other therapies: Prior experimental (nonFDA approved) therapies (other than drugs that share the same target) and immunotherapies are allowed. Patients must not have received these therapies for 30 days or five halflives of the drug (whichever is less) prior to the initiation of study treatment and must have full recovery from any acute effects of these therapies. Adequate hematologic function defined as: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/μL White blood cells (WBC) &gt; 3x109/L Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 10 g/dL (may be achieved with erythropoietin agents; no blood transfusions in the 28 days prior to entry) Platelets ≥ 100,000/μL No features suggestive of MDS/AML on peripheral blood smear Adequate renal and liver function defined as: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) (≤ 5 × ULN if considered due to primary or metastatic liver involvement) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ×ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2× ULN (≤ 5 × ULN if considered due to tumor) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN At least one lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥ 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥ 15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ≥ 10 mm with calipers by clinical exam OR At least one lesion (measurable and/or nonmeasurable) that can be accurately assessed by CT/MRI/plain xray/clinical exam at baseline and follow up visits. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 7 days prior to starting the study drug. Both males and females must agree to adequate birth control if conception is possible during the study and for 6 months after the last dose. Female patients are considered to not be of childbearing potential if they have a history of tubal ligation or hysterectomy or are postmenopausal with a minimum of 1 year without menses. Patients with known germline BRCA mutations will be excluded from the study, however testing is not required for inclusion in the study. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site) Previous enrolment in the present study Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the last 30 days or five halflives of the drug (whichever is greater) prior to the initiation of study treatment. Prior treatment with the same agent or combination as the study drug. Prior treatment in monotherapy when treated in one of the combination arms in the study is allowed. Patients with hematologic malignancies (includes patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia). Patients must not have received allogeneic stem cell transplant Concurrent administration of any other anticancer therapy Bisphosphonates and Denosumab for bone metastases are allowed as long as these were started at least 4 weeks prior to treatment with study drug.
