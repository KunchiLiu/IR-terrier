	<brief_title>Long-term Outcome of End-stage Renal Disease Patients Treated With Hig-efficiency Hemodiafiltration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growing evidences suggested the superiority of high-efficiency hemodiafiltration (HDF) which could provide both diffusion and convection in a single therapy compared with the conventional hemodialysis. However, the long-term, upto 10 years, outcome still limited. This retrospective cohort study was conducted in 66 end-stage renal disease patients who underwent high-efficiency hemodiafiltration technique in a single-center, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, between 2001-2013 to determine the survival rate as well as other long-term outcome</detailed_description>
