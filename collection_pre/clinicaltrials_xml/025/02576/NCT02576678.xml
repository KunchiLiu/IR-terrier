	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis aged 6 to 17 years, inclusive, intended to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of apremilast with 2 weeks of oral apremilast treatment followed by a 48-week extension of apremilast treatment. Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is defined as Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 12, Body Surface Area (BSA) ≥ 10%, and static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) of ≥ 3. The total study duration for each subject will last for up to a total of 107 weeks which includes screening, treatment (including the PK portion of the study and the extension treatment period), two short-term follow-up periods and a long-term follow-up period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Apremilast (CC-10004) in Pediatric Subjects With Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each subject will undergo a screening period of up to 5 weeks, a treatment period of 2 weeks with PK sample collection, and an extension treatment period of 48 weeks, to allow subjects access to apremilast treatment if medically appropriate (following the completion of the 2 week PK portion). Regardless of when they stop treatment, subjects should complete two post treatment follow-up visits at approximately 4 and 8 weeks after the last dose. All subjects should complete the final follow-up visit at Week 102 or at a timepoint 52 weeks after the last dose of apremilast was taken in subjects who have withdrawn at any time prior to Week 50. At least 32 subjects will be enrolled into this study to provide an adequate PK profile and safety assessment in subjects of different ages and body weight ranges. Subjects will be divided into 2 age groups (adolescents [ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive] and children [ages 6 to 11 years, inclusive]), with at least 16 subjects in each group. Apremilast treatment will start in older and heavier subjects. Group 1 (ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive; weight ≥ 35 kg) - The data collected from the first 8 subjects will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (DMC) to determine if it is appropriate to proceed with dosing the balance of Group 1 subjects and to proceed with dosing in the Group 2 subjects. and an evaluation of these data by the DMC has been completed. Group 2 (ages 6 to 11 years, inclusive; weight ≥ 15 kg) - The dose regimens (dose strength and/or dose frequency) for these first 8 subjects will be based upon the PK and safety assessments from the first 8 subjects in Group 1. - For the remaining subjects in Group 2, the dose (dose strength and/or dose frequency) will be based upon the subject weight as determined by the PK and safety assessments. The dose strength and/or dose frequency will be adjusted for any safety concerns or for unexpected changes in exposure. In the event of a dose regimen adjustment after the second PK and safety assessment, the first 8 subjects in Group 2 will return to the site for the appropriate dosing adjustment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the study: 1. Male or female subjects 6 to 17 years of age, inclusive, at the time the informed consent document is signed by the legal guardian 2. Group 1 Only: ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive, and weighs ≥ 35 kg 3. Group 2 Only: ages 6 to 11 years, inclusive, and weighs ≥ 15 kg 4. Subject is able to swallow the apremilast tablet 5. Able to sign an assent with a legal guardian who can understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent 6. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements 7. Must agree to withhold vaccinations during the first 2 weeks of dosing. Inactivated vaccines will be allowed during the extension treatment period 8. Diagnosis of chronic plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months prior to Screening 9. Have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis at Screening and Baseline as defined by: Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score ≥ 12; and Body surface area (BSA) ≥ 10%; and Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) ≥ 3 (moderate to severe) 10. Disease inadequately controlled by or inappropriate for topical therapy for psoriasis 11. Candidate for systemic or phototherapy 12. Have not been exposed to any or have been exposed to no more than one conventional systemic agent for psoriasis 13. No previous biologic therapy 14. At Screening, laboratory values must be within the following ranges: White blood cell (WBC) count ≥ 3000/mm3 (≥ 3.0 x 109/L) and &lt; 14,000/mm3 (&lt; 14 x 109/L) Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL (≥ 100 x 109/L) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.2 X upper limit of normal (ULN) for age and gender. Aspartate transaminase (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) (AST (SGOT)) and Alanine transaminase (serum glutamate pyruvic transaminase) (ALT (SGPT)) ≤ 1.5 X Upper limit of normal (ULN) for age and gender. If initial test of ALT or AST is &gt; 1.5 X ULN, one repeat test is allowed during screening. Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL (≤ 34 μmol/L). If initial test result is &gt; 2 mg/dL, one repeat test is allowed during the screening period. Hemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 9 g/dL (≥ 5.6 mmol/L) 15. Male subjects who engage in activity in which conception is possible must use barrier contraception (male latex condom or nonlatex condom NOT made out of natural membrane [for example, polyurethane]) while on apremilast and for at least 28 days after the last dose of apremilast 16.
