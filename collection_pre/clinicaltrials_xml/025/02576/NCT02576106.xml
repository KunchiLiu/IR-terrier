	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this monocentric and feasibility study is to review the efficacy of cryotherapy in the treatment of unifocal mammary carcinomas in post-menopausal patients, with lumpectomy indication. The efficacy is defined by the rate of success of cryotherapy procedures. For each one of those evaluated process, an success will be defined on the tumor sample of lumpectomy by the absence of viable tumour cells. On the basis of our expertise, it seems interesting to propose this experimental procedure to patients as described above.</brief_summary>
