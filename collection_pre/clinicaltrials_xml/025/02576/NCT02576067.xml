	<brief_summary>Vascular inflammation, a central feature of atherosclerosis, participates in the initiation, perpetuation and instability of plaques. Multiple clinical trials of cholesterol lowering therapy with statins have demonstrated that reductions in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) events are associated with reductions in both LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and the systemic inflammatory mediator C-reactive protein (CRP). The Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial (CIRT) investigates if an anti-inflammatory agent commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis (low dose methotrexate (LDM)) can reduce CV morbidity and mortality among patients with a prior myocardial infarction or angiographically demonstrated multivessel coronary artery disease (GCO#13-1467). In this ancillary CIRT imaging study, the investigators propose to use this well validated approach by non-invasive serial FDG-PET/CT imaging in a subset of patients enrolled in the main CIRT trial to directly visualize vascular inflammation. Once the subjects are enrolled in the main CIRT trial, baseline imaging will be done and follow up imaging will be done approximately 8 months after the baseline imaging. 18FDG-PET imaging data will be acquired, analyzed centrally and results incorporated into the main CIRT database. The investigators hypothesize that LDM treatment will result in a significant decrease in plaque inflammation as measured by 18-FDG-PET/CT after 8 months as compared to placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The NHLBI funded (Ridker 5U01HL101422) Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial (CIRT) provides a unique opportunity to investigate whether a commonly used anti-inflammatory agent used in rheumatoid arthritis (low dose methotrexate (LDM)) can reduce CVD morbidity and mortality among patients with stable coronary artery disease. CIRT, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial among 7,000 men and women with prior myocardial infarction or angiographically demonstrated multivessel coronary artery disease. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated over a three to four year period to usual care plus placebo or usual care plus LDM (average dose of 15-20 mg po/weekly. CIRT proposes that the reduction in CVD events with methotrexate derives from its effect on vascular inflammation, thus it is crucial to incorporate a measure of vascular inflammation imaging for confirmation of the primary mechanism of action underlying CIRT. As such, the direct evaluation of arterial inflammation would enhance the scientific value of the CIRT trial. The inclusion of the proposed vascular inflammation imaging substudy has widespread implications that will allow this imaging modality to serve as a surrogate measure of disease, and thereby provide an opportunity for stratification in individuals at risk for CVD and evaluation of other interventions with presumed anti-inflammatory effects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years at screening Documented MI in the past or past evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease by angiography must have completed any planned coronary revascularization procedures associated with the qualifying event, and must be clinically stable for at least 60 d before screening; the qualifying prior MI must be documented either by hospital records or by evidence on current electrocardiogram of Q waves in 2 contiguous leads and/or an imaging test demonstrating wall motion abnormality or scar; the qualifying documentation of multivessel coronary disease must include angiographic evidence of atherosclerosis in at least 2 major epicardial vessels defined either as the presence of a stent, a coronary bypass graft, or an angiographic lesion of 60% or greater. Left main coronary artery disease that has been revascularized with a stent or bypass graft will qualify as multivessel disease, as will the presence of a 50% or greater isolated left main stenosis.
