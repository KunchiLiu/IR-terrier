	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized study is to examine the effect of a selective suprascapular nerve block on post operative pain after arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Half of the subjects will receive a active nerve block with Ropivacain. Half of the subjects will receive a placebo nerve block with saline.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Suprascapular Nerve Block as Postoperative Analgesia After Artroscopic Shoulder Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative pain management after arthroscopic shoulder surgery traditionally includes opioids and/or an interscalene brachial plexus block(IBPB). Opioid consumption often leads to unpleasant side effects including nausea, vomitting and sedation. IBPB offers very efficient pain relief but includes the discomfort of a paralyzed arm. Furthermore this approach often also leads to unilateral paresis of the phrenic nerve causing reduced respiratory capacity. The latter offering discomfort and a potential risk in patients with lung diseases or heavy overweight. The suprascapular nerve is the most important nerve to the shoulder and a selective block of this nerve could offer a good pain relief without the mentioned side effects. In this randomized study the investigators wish to examine the pain relieving effect of a selective block of the suprascapular nerve after arthroscopic shoulder surgery. 40 patients are randomized to a block of this nerve with either active drug (Ropivacaine) or placebo (Saline). All patients will get a PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia) pump for administration of i.v. morphine in doses based on age and weight. Patient are being monitored for 6 hours. The primary outcome is reduction in VAS at rest from baseline to 30 minutes after nerve block.</detailed_description>
