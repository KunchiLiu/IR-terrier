	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open label, single arm study of Toca 511 and Toca FC. Based on their cancer diagnosis (brain metastases from non small cell lung cancer or breast cancer; colorectal cancer with liver metastases; metastatic renal cell carcinoma; locally advanced or recurrent melanoma; locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer or breast cancer [ie, other than resectable brain metastases]) subjects will receive Toca 511 either intravenously (IV) or intralesionally (IL). Up to 6 subjects will be enrolled for each disease group. In all but the melanoma group, Toca 511 will be administered by IV injection for 3 consecutive days (14 mL per day); in the melanoma group, at least 3 subjects may receive Toca 511 by IV injection (same dosing regimen as the other 3 groups), and at least 3 subjects will receive Toca 511 by IL injection (approximately 0.1 mL to 4 mL for 5 consecutive days). Based on the disease group, subjects will have either multiple core biopsies or a resection of a metastatic lesion (primary for subjects with renal cell carcinoma undergoing debulking nephrectomy), approximately 14 to 28 days after Toca 511 administration. A portion of the resected or biopsied tumor sample will be evaluated for the presence of Toca 511 vector sequences and markers for disease characteristics. After recovery from the biopsy or surgery (approximately 4-6 weeks from Toca 511 treatment start), subjects will begin the first cycle of oral Toca FC (ie, a 7 day course of 220 mg/kg/day; thereafter, cycles of 7-day courses of Toca FC will be repeated approximately every 6 weeks). Toca FC may be continued alone or in conjunction with standard therapy (other investigational treatments prohibited). One or more disease groups may be expanded to allow replacement of subjects or to provide a better assessment of efficacy. Subjects will be followed for safety for up to 15 years as required by regulatory authorities. In addition, subjects will be followed for efficacy (objective response and survival).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Metastatic solid tumor, including: Subjects with brain metastases with a primary tumor of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, suitable for planned resection of brain metastasis Subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer with liver metastases suitable for core biopsy Subjects with renal cell carcinoma presenting with metastatic disease, with primary planned for resection or who have metastatic lesions suitable for biopsy Subjects with locally advanced/recurrent melanoma with skin or nodal disease suitable for resection Subjects with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer or breast cancer (other than brain metastases) with lesions that are amenable to biopsy 2. Subject has given written informed consent 3. Subject is between 18 years old and 90 years old, inclusive 4. Laboratory values adequate for subject to undergo surgery or biopsy, including: Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Hgb ≥ 10 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3 Normal PT/PTT (subnormal PT/PTT acceptable) Adequate liver function, including: total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (unless known Gilbert's syndrome); ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5.0 x ULN in subjects with liver metastases) 5. The subject has an ECOG Performance Status 0 to 1 6. The subject must be a candidate for biopsy or resection of at least one lesion 7. Subject must have a life expectancy of &gt; 3 months 1. History of other malignancy, unless the patient has been disease free for at least 5 years. Adequately treated basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell skin cancer is acceptable regardless of time, as well as localized prostate carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ after curative treatment. 2. The subject has or had any active infection requiring antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral therapy within the past 2 weeks 3. The subject has any bleeding diathesis, or must take anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents, including nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), at the time of the scheduled resection that cannot be stopped for surgery 4. The subject received cytotoxic chemotherapy within the past 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas) 5. The subject received any investigational treatment within the past 2 weeks or prior immunotherapy or antibody therapy within the past 45 days and/or has not recovered from toxicities associated with such treatment 6. Severe pulmonary, cardiac or other systemic disease, specifically: New York Heart Association &gt; Grade 2 congestive heart failure which is not controlled on standard therapy within 6 months prior to study entry Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia (such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or Torsades des pointes), clinically significant pulmonary disease (such as ≥ Grade 2 dyspnea, according to CTCAE 4.03) 7. Subjects who have any other disease, either metabolic or psychological, which as per Investigator assessment may affect the subject's compliance or place the subject at higher risk of potential treatment complications</criteria>
