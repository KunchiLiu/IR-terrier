	<brief_title>Mesh Reinforcement During Temporary Stoma Closure After Sphincter-Saving Rectal Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim to assess long-term results of an incisional hernia-prophylactic mesh placement during stoma reversal after TME for rectal cancer. Patients are randomized in 3 groups : no mesh, synthetic mesh (Parietex, Covidien), biologic mesh (Cellis, Meccelis). Meshes are placed in retromuscular position after diverting ileostomy closure. Primary endpoint is radiological incisional hernia rate, assessed on CT-scan, at the end of follow-up Secondary endpoints include postoperative morbidity, postoperative pain, postoperative quality of life, long-term clinical incisional hernia rate.</detailed_description>
