	<brief_summary>Rationale: Inhaled bronchodilators, beta-2-agonist or anticholinergic or combinations, can be delivered by several types of devices: dry powder (DPI), pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDI), and wet nebulizers. Wet nebulization is available for short-acting bronchodilators only, is cumbersome, and, importantly, has never been scientifically been proven to be more efficacious than delivery by the other two methods. Yet many patients are happy with wet nebulization and in many clinics this administration method prevails. The investigators believe that combined long-acting bronchodilators, are more efficacious than combined short acting bronchodilators per nebulizers. Objective: To test the hypothesis that: The combination of the two long-acting bronchodilators indacaterol and glycopyrronium by dry powder inhalation confers a superior improvement compared to nebulisation with ipratropium/salbutamol, when administered as single dose in patients with stable state chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Study design: Investigator initiated, randomised, active controlled, cross-over double-blind (and therefore double-dummy), study comparing the effects of single dose indacaterol/glycopyrronium 110/50 Breezhaler® versus single dose ipratropium/salbutamol nebulisation in patients with COPD in stable state Study population: Patients visiting the outpatient clinics or from general practitioner (GP) practices with COPD GOLD stage A-D, and (FEV1) post-bronchodilator FEV1/ forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 70%; post-br FEV1 &lt; 80%pred. Intervention The investigators will compare the effects of single dose indacaterol/glycopyrronium 110/50 Breezhaler® versus single dose ipratropium/salbutamol nebulisation in patients with COPD in stable state Main study parameters/endpoints: Area under the curve (AUC) from 0 to 6 hours of FEV1 with indacaterol and glycopyrronium, compared to nebulisation with ipratropium/salbutamol Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: This study has no specific benefits for the participating patients. The study also has no major risks. Minor risks for participants after a single dosis can be throat irritation, cough, headache and dizziness, sinus tachycardia. The combination of treatments with β2-agonist bronchodilators and anticholinergic bronchodilators have been used in daily practice for many years in many countries and they are often prescribed both in COPD. Both indacaterol/glycopyrronium and ipratropium/salbutamol are approved for COPD treatment in the Netherlands</brief_summary>
