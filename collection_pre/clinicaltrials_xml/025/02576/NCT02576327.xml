	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Aprepitant in Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a serious complication of treatments of hematological malignancies. Although aprepitant has been shown to control CINV in highly emetogenic therapies for solid tumors, the antiemetic effect of aprepitant in hematological chemotherapies is still not clear. In this multi-central perspective randomized controlled study, the investigators are trying to evaluate the efficacy and safety of additional aprepitant to standard antiemetic regimen in Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.</detailed_description>
