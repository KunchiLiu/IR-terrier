	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effect of leucocyte and platelet rich fibrin (L-PRF) during endodontic microsurgery (EMS) on patient's post-operative comfort and periapical bone healing. Also the influence of an occlusive membrane barrier in EMS on the periapical bone healing will be studied. The trial design is an open randomized controlled clinical trial with a 2x2 factorial design. Half of the participants will receive EMS with L-PRF (experimental group), the other half without (control group). The control and experimental group will be divided in 2 subsequent groups: half of the participants will receive an occlusive membrane during EMS, the other half not.</brief_summary>
