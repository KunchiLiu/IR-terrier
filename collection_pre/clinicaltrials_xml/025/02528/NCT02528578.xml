	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to evaluate in healthy volunteers, the influence of empathy on pain perception. It is widely accepted in the clinical management that the feeling of listening to the patients' pain would have a favorable influence on the pain, and conversely, the lack of listening would be aggravating. In this study, the volunteer will receive painful thermal stimuli in empathetic context (l, empathetic or non-empathetic) Two situations will oppose, one where the examiner neglect or minimize the suffering of the voluntary and the other or the contrary, the subject will receive empathy. The first part of the project is to verify that the pain is influenced by the empathetic context. The second part will be conducted functional MRI, which should isolate the brain regions affected by other people's empathy for pain.</brief_summary>
