	<brief_summary>Drug-coated balloon technology (DCB) has recently attracted considerable interest as a promising alternative treatment option, particularly in the setting of in-stent restenosis (ISR). Optical coherence tomographic finding of restenosis lesions in drug-eluting stents (DESs) after Balloon Angioplasty with Two Different Paclitaxel-Coated Balloons will be compared between two paclitaxel-coated balloon devices; Pantera Lux™ and SeQuent® Please.</brief_summary>
