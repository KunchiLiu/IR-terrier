	<brief_summary>The proposed study is in the field of thoracic radiation oncology where radiation therapy is used to treat lung cancer. The primary objective of the early phase clinical trial will be to evaluate the safety of performing functional avoidance radiation therapy for lung cancer patients using 4D computed tomography (4DCT) ventilation imaging.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Incorporating Lung Function Imaging Into Radiation Therapy for Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study plans to learn more about radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is one of the main treatments used to treat lung cancer. One of the known side effects of this radiation therapy is scarring of the lungs and reduced lung function that can result in shortness of breath. At this time the radiation treatment plan does not take into account differences in lung function between one part of the lung and another. Studies have shown that lung function can vary substantially throughout the lungs. This study aims to plan the radiation therapy to be away from the highest functioning portions of lungs while still delivering the intended radiation dose to the tumor. This study will allow researchers to determine whether taking lung function information into account when designing radiation treatment plans can protect lung function after radiation therapy.</detailed_description>
