	<brief_title>Gluten-free Diet in Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) is commonly encountered in primary and secondary-care practice. There are various triggers including diet. There is a growing number of people taking a gluten-free diet (GFD) of their own volition even in the absence of coeliac disease (CD). The investigators aim to assess whether a GFD could be of benefit to patients with IBS-D, previously naive to the effects of gluten and in whom CD has been excluded as per normal duodenal biopsies. The investigators will also assess whether certain factors may predict a clinical responder such as the presence or absence of at-risk coeliac serology.</detailed_description>
