	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate how the liver is affected with regard to inflammation and fibrosis during Sofosbuvir based treatment regimes of chronic hepatitis C. In order to examine how the liver heals, we want to use blood samples to check for the occurrence of special liver inflammation cells (CD163 and CD206). To assess to which extent fibrosis disappear during treatment, we want to examine the liver with FibroScan (a type of ultrasound examination) and also preferably with extraction of a small tissue sample. We want to examine how the liver function as inflammation and scar tissue decrease, especially concerning the liver's ability to produce proteins. Furthermore, we want to examine with a gastroscopy, if the circulation of blood in the liver is improved after successful treatment with the expected result that potential varicose veins in the esophagus vanish.</brief_summary>
