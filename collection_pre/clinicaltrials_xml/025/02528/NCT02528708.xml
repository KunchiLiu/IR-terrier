	<brief_summary>In this prospective, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, parturients with primary PPH are eligible for treatment with fibrinogen concentrate following both vaginal delivery and cesarean section complicated by an estimated blood loss (EBL) &gt;1000 mL and an ongoing bleeding notwithstanding standard treatment measures (volume replacement, uterine massage, and uterotonic agents).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Program to Evaluate Riastap® and FIBTEM® for the Early Control and Treatment of Postpartum Hemorrhage (PERFECT PPH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed trial targets early detection and treatment of fibrinogen depletion in PPH. A widespread belief in the benefits of early fibrinogen substitution in cases of PPH has led to an increased use for this indication. The PERFECT PPH aims to provide an evidence-based knowledge for the recommendation of the early use of fibrinogen concentrate in PPH.</detailed_description>
