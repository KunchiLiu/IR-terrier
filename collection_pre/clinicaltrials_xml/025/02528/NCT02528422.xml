	<brief_summary>Ghrelin (growth hormone release inducer) is produced in the stomach. The active form of Ghrelin is Acyl-Ghrelin. Acyl-Ghrelin stimulates the Ghrelin receptors. Ghrelin receptors are detected in the distal tubules in mice and animal studies have shown that Ghrelin increases the absorption of sodium in the renal tubules. Ghrelin infusion directly into the renal artery of rats increased sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron, presumably via the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). The purpose of the study is to measure the acyl-ghrelin induced effects on GFR, tubular transport of sodium and water in different nephron segments and central and peripheral blood pressure in a randomized, cross-over, single-blind, placebo-controlled dose-response study.</brief_summary>
