	<brief_summary>Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) or sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) has been proposed as a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes. However, how DPP-4 inhibitors or SGLT2 inhibitors exert protective actions for diabetic complications in addition to their glucose-lowering effects remains unknown.</brief_summary>
