	<brief_summary>Randomized comparison of different cardiotoxicity of carbetocin and oxytocin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Clinical Carbetocin Myocardium Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carbetocin has been in clinical use in EU for some years and the efficacy is documented in several RCTs. Circulatory adverse events leading to death has been reported after intravenous injection of oxytocin. Some studies indicate that oxytocin may lead to dose dependent ischemic ECG changes, prolongation of QT time and liberation of biomarkers of myocardial cell death. Previously we have demonstrated comparable vasodilatory effects of oxytocin and carbetocin. There is no clinical study comparing the specific myocardial effects of oxytocin with carbetocin. It may have great impact on the choice of standard medication if the cardiotoxicity of carbetocin is lower compared with oxytocin. The study of potential cardiotoxicity has to be performed in healthy women. Knowing that millions of laboring women have had uneventful injections of oxytocin and carbetocin after delivery, there is probably no reason to fear long lasting negative effects of either drug. If there are differences in cardiotoxicity, this new information should be taken into consideration when planning delivery in pregnant women with heart disease. The aims of this study are to compare 0h (before C-section), 4h, 12h, 24h, and 48h plasma concentrations of Troponin I, Troponin T, proBNP, CK, and other relevant myocardial markers in elective healthy C-section patients randomized to oxytocin 2.5 U or carbetocin 100 Âµg, 1 minute injection immediately after delivery.</detailed_description>
