	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind, randomised, controlled, two period crossover phase Ib trial using an individualized standard meal with a fixed nutrient ratio in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus to investigate postprandial blood glucose control with BioChaperone insulin lispro compared to Humalog®. The assessments will be conducted before and after a period of multiple daily dose administrations for 14 days. The meal tolerance test will be performed on day 1-3 and on day 14 of each period. Furthermore the study aims at investigating Post-prandial glucose (PPG) profiles with BioChaperone insulin lispro and Humalog® when injected at various injection meal intervals (-15min, 0 minutes, +15 minutes). Each subject will be randomised to a sequence of two treatments, either BioChaperone insulin lispro-Humalog® or Humalog®-Biochaperone insulin lispro, and three different sequences of injection-meal intervals. A blinded to patient continuous monitoring of glucose (CGM) will be performed during the 14 day treatment periods.</brief_summary>
