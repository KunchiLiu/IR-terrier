	<brief_summary>The renal transplant patient is at high cardiovascular risk compared to the general population. The cardiovascular mortality represents one of the most important causes of late graft loss. Cardiovascular risk prediction tools applied to the general population, however, are caught failing on the population of kidney transplant and tend to underestimate the actual risk. Central blood pressure is the pressure imposed at large artery (aorta, carotid) and is directly related to the target organ (heart, kidney, brain). Central blood pressure could be a cardiovascular risk factor more robust and powerful than brachial blood pressure. Central blood pressure may in part explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the population of kidney transplant patients. A cohort of 250 kidney transplant patients will be constituted with a measure of concomitant central hemodynamic monitoring to the annual review will be conducted. The main objective of this study is to describe the central blood pressure measured by oscillometric method in renal transplanted population.</brief_summary>
