	<brief_summary>The Exalenz Dual Mode BreathID® Hp System comprised of IDkit: Hp™ TWO and the Dual Mode BreathID® Hp test device will be used to perform a urea breath test in the initial diagnosis and post treatment monitoring of H.pylori infection in adult patients and its results will be compared to biopsy results.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exalenz Lab Mode System Compared to Biopsy for H.Pylori Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for initial diagnosis of H.pylori infection or post therapy confirmation of eradication will be eligible to participate in the trial. Two sets of biopsies will be taken: one set for histological analysis and one set for rapid urease test (RUT) analysis. The two results will be used as a gold standard composite score in determining the presence of H.pylori bacteria in the stomach. The Urea Breath Test (UBT) using the Exalenz Dual Mode BreathID Hp System will also be performed within a week of the biopsy. The outcome of the UBT will be compared to composite score of the biopsy and the accuracy of the UBT will be evaluated. The UBT will be performed using breath collection bags, where the subject will be asked to breathe into the bags before and after ingestion of the 13C-labelled urea.</detailed_description>
