	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Intepirdine (RVT-101) on Gait and Balance in Subjects With Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess the effect of intepirdine (RVT-101) versus placebo on quantitative and qualitative gait and balance parameters. Each subject will be randomized 1:1 to one of the following sequences: Sequence 1: AB = RVT-101 35 mg during the early treatment period and Placebo during the late treatment period Sequence 2: BA = Placebo during the early treatment period and RVT-101 35 mg during the late treatment period Treatment A = RVT-101 35 mg once daily. Treatment B = Placebo once daily.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key 1. Male or female subject with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). 2. Mini Mental State Examination score 14 to 26 3. Gait impairment, as assessed by history gathered by the clinical investigator and quantitative measurements 4. Subjects must be on stable background acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy Key 1. History and/or evidence of any other CNS disorder that could be interpreted as a cause of dementia (in the opinion of the investigator) 2. Any clinically relevant concomitant disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study.</criteria>
