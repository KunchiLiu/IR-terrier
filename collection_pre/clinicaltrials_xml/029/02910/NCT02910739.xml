	<brief_summary>This study consists of Part I and Part II. The purpose of Part I is to compare the plasma pharmacokinetics of verubecestat (MK-8931) following administration of a single oral dose of 40 mg MK-8931 to participants with moderate hepatic insufficiency (HI) to that of healthy matched controls. A safety and pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed in order to support the decision to continue with part II. If a decision to continue with part II is made, participants with mild HI will be enrolled to receive a single oral dose of MK-8931 40mg. If any healthy participants from Part I do not meet the matching criteria for Part II additional healthy participants will be enrolled.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants with HI 1. Adult male or female participants, 4585 years of age, inclusive, at screening. 2. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 19 and ≤ 40 kg/m2, at screening. 3. Continuous nonsmokers or light smokers (&lt; 10 cigarettes/day or the equivalent). 4. Baseline health is judged to be stable based on medical history (except for the hepatic insufficiency condition). 5. Participant has a diagnosis of chronic (&gt; 6 months); stable (no acute episodes of illness within the previous 2 months due to deterioration in hepatic function) HI with features of cirrhosis due to any etiology. 6. Part 1 only: Participant's score on the ChildPugh scale must range from 7 to 9 (moderate HI) at screening. 7. Part 2 only: Participant's score on the ChildPugh scale must range from 5 to 6 (mild HI) at screening. 8. Participants must be completely informed of the unknown risks of pregnancy and agree not to become pregnant or father a child during the time they are participating in this study. 9. For a female of childbearing potential: either be sexually inactive (abstinent) for 14 days prior to dosing and throughout the study or be using an acceptable birth control method. 10. Females of nonchildbearing potential must have undergone one of the following sterilization procedures at least 6 months prior to the first dose: hysteroscopic sterilization; bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy; hysterectomy; bilateral oophorectomy; or be postmenopausal with amenorrhea for at least 1 year prior to dosing and have folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) serum levels consistent with postmenopausal status as per Investigator or designee's judgment. 11. Nonvasectomized male participants must agree to use a condom with spermicide or abstain from sexual intercourse from dosing until 90 days after dosing. 12. Male participants must agree not to donate sperm from dosing until 90 days after dosing. 13. Understands the study procedures in informed consent forms (ICFs), be willing and able to comply with the protocol, and provides written informed consent for the trial, including for Future Biomedical Research. Future Biomedical Research participation is voluntary and is not required in order to participate in the trial. Healthy Control Participants 1. Healthy adult male or female participants, 4585 years of age, inclusive, at screening. 2. BMI ≥ 19 and ≤ 40 kg/m2 at screening. 3. Continuous nonsmokers or light smokers (&lt; 10 cigarettes/day or the equivalent). 4. Medically healthy with no clinically significant medical history, physical examination, laboratory profiles, vital signs, or ECGs, as deemed by the Investigator. 5. Participants must be completely informed of the unknown risks of pregnancy and agree not to become pregnant or father a child during the time they are participating in this study. 6. For a female of childbearing potential: either be sexually inactive (abstinent) for 14 days prior to dosing and throughout the study or be using an acceptable birth control method. 7. Females of nonchildbearing potential must have undergone one of the following sterilization procedures at least 6 months prior to the first dose: hysteroscopic sterilization; bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy; hysterectomy; bilateral oophorectomy; or be postmenopausal with amenorrhea for at least 1 year prior to dosing and have FSH serum levels consistent with postmenopausal status as per Investigator or designee's judgment. 8.
