	<brief_summary>To test the effect of atorvastatin or placebo in combination with ticagrelor on ACh-induced vasodilatation of the forearm resistance vasculature as assessed by forearm blood flow (FBF) measurement before and 10 min after a 20 min forearm ischemia. The area under the dose-effect curve (AUC) of different ACh doses will be calculated and compared between treatment groups (atorvastatin + ticagrelor vs. placebo + ticagrelor) and different time points (pre-ischemia vs. post-ischemia).</brief_summary>
