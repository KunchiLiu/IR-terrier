	<brief_summary>In the FINE 75+ study, 307 Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) patients, 75 years old or older, were included between September 2009 and June 2010. The purpose of this observational study (FINE75+5) is to describe these patients, especially regarding the following variables: cardiovascular risk, co-morbidity and frailty, and to assess the prognostic value of frailty on 5-year outcomes. We hypothesize that frailty is independently associated with 5-year mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Frailty as an INstrument for Evaluation of Elderly Patients With Non ST ElevationMyocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) - 5 Year Follow up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The term frailty denotes a multi-dimensional syndrome characterized by increased vulnerability and decreased physiologic reserves. Frailty stratification predicts a patient's risk of death and need for institutional care. The construct is well validated, but there is not one single accepted operational definition. The CSHA Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a 7-point scale relying on clinical judgement. It is a global clinical measure of biological age, and it mixes co-morbidity, disability and cognitive impairment.Though frailty instruments so far mainly have been used in a geriatric context, it has been pointed out as relevant for cardiologic patients as well, e.g. regarding risk stratification for elderly patients with NSTEMI. In the FINE 75+ study, 307 Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) patients, 75 years old or older, were included between September 2009 and June 2010. We reported importance of frailty for short-term (1 month) and medium-term outcome (1 year) in a NSTEMI population (Ekerstad et al. 2011, Ekerstad et al. 2013). However, there are no published data on the importance of frailty on longer-term outcome. Information on long-term prognosis may substantially improve informed decision making in elderly patients with NSTEMI, with acute potentially harmful treatments aiming at improved long-term prognosis. The purpose of this study is to describe patients, 75 years old or older, with NSTEMI especially regarding the following variables: cardiovascular risk, co-morbidity and frailty, and to assess the prognostic value of frailty on 5-year outcomes.For the purpose of the current analysis all patients included in the final FINE 75+ study will be followed over 5 years from hospital admission. We hypothesize that frailty is independently associated with 5-year mortality.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patients included in the FINE 75+ study population between October 2009 and June 2010. Patients, 75 years old or older, with diagnosed NSTEMI, and cared for at one of the following hospital care units: cardiology, acute medicine, geriatrics, other internal medicine unit. Not willing to participate. Nonevaluable patient due to communication problems and insufficient clinical information for the judgement of frailty.</criteria>
