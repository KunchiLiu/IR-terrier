	<brief_summary>This is a phase 2/3 open label, multicenter trial testing blinatumomab monotherapy for the treatment of subjects with Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) aggressive B-NHL not achieving CMR after 2 cycles of standard platinum-based chemotherapy regimens administered as S1. This study incorporates multiple interim analyses for futility, efficacy, and unblinded sample-size re-estimation. In the phase 3 part of the study, blinatumomab will be compared to Investigator's Choice chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Biopsy proven aggressive Bcell NonHodgkin Lymphoma (BNHL), including diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (NOS), follicular lymphoma Grade 3B, Primary Mediastinal BCell Lymphoma, Tcell rich Bcell lymphoma, or DLBCL that represents transformation of indolent nonHidgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), (including follicular, marginal zone, and lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma) excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia or Hodgkin Lymphoma. The following histologies are not eligible: Lymphoblastic lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma Any histologies not specifically mentioned must be discussed with medical monitor. Refractory (no prior complete metabolic response (CMR)) or relapsed (prior CMR) following front line treatment of standard multiagent chemotherapy containing an anthracycline AND an approved antiCD20 agent. For refractory disease, PET positivity should be demonstrated no less than 6 weeks after radiotherapy Biopsy evidence of relapsed disease. Received 2 cycles of standard of care platinumbased chemotherapy in the S1 setting and had a response of progressive metabolic disease (PMD), no metabolic response (NMR), partial metabolic response (PMR) as centrally assessed by PET CT scan or received at least 1 cycle of S1 chemotherapy and had evidence of progressive disease (PD) as centrally assessed Radiographically measurable disease with a demarcated nodal lesion at least 1.5 cm in its largest dimension or a target extranodal lesion at least 1.0 cm in its largest dimension Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status less than or equal to 2 Potentially eligible for high dose chemotherapy (HDT) and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) Laboratory parameters: Hematology: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L Chemistry: Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3X upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin (TBL) &lt; 2x ULN (unless Gilbert's disease or if liver involvement with lymphoma) CMR following S1 chemotherapy Treatment within 30 days prior to randomization with another investigational device or drug study (ies). Prior antiCD19directed therapies Prior HDT with autologous HSCT Prior allogeneic HSCT Clinically relevant central nervous system (CNS) pathology such as epilepsy, paresis, aphasia, stroke, severe brain injury, dementia, Parkinson's disease, cerebellar disease, organic brain syndrome, or psychosis Evidence of CNS involvement by NHL Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus or chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (hepatitis B surface antigen positive) or hepatitis C virus (anti hepatitis C virus positive) History of malignancy other than BNHL within the past 3 years with the exception of: Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present for ≥ 3 years before enrollment Adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna Adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ Adequately treated breast ductal carcinoma in situ Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia without evidence of prostate cancer Adequately treated urothelial papillary noninvasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ Known sensitivity to immunoglobulins or any of the components to be administered during dosing. Subject likely to not be available to complete all protocolrequired study visits or procedures, and/or to comply with all required procedures. History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition or disease (with the exception of those outlined above) that would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures or completion. Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant or breastfeed, or of childbearing potential unwilling to use an effective method of contraception while receiving, and for an additional 48 hours after the last dose of blinatumomab.</criteria>
