	<brief_summary>This study will measure the dynamic real-time IOP in the anterior chamber during standard phacoemulsification surgery. What is known: - Fluidics control is determined to be one of the primary drivers of physician decision making in choosing phacoemulsification equipment. - Active pressure system fluidic control has a perceived and possibly real (based upon recent literature) improvement in intra-cameral IOP stability and reduced pressure fluctuations. - Improved fluidics can allow for reduced dynamic IOP fluctuations, in-the-bag positioned phaco tip, and intra-cameral fluid flow all of which will likely improve corneal health post-operatively.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>• Age 18 or greater Bilateral cataracts for which phacoemulsification extraction and posterior IOL implantation has been planned for both eyes Subjects able to give informed consent Nuclear Sclerotic cataract graded 2+ or 3+ Naturally dilated pupil size (in dim light) &gt; 4.0 mm (with no dilation medications) for both eyes Preoperative corneal astigmatism of 2.5 D or less Ages between 55 and 80 Availability, willingness, and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with examination procedures • Uncontrolled systemic disease that in the opinion of the Investigator would put the subject's heath at risk Intraoperative complications Subjects with only one functional eye Those with one eye having poor or eccentric fixation Mild or severe cataracts, predominantly posterior subcapsular cataracts High corneal astigmatism (i.e. those eyes displaying an oval contact image) Those with corneal scarring or who have had corneal surgery including corneal laser surgery Microphthalmos Buphthalmos Severe Dry eyes Blepharospasm Nystagmus Keratoconus Any other corneal or conjunctival pathology or infection. Central corneal thickness greater than 0,600 mm or less than 0,500 mm (2 standard deviations about the human mean) Acute or chronic disease or illness that would increase risk or confound study results (e.g. diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised, etc.) Uncontrolled systemic or ocular disease History of ocular trauma or prior ocular surgery Fuchs Dystrophy Subjects who may be expected to require retinal laser treatment or other surgical intervention, including LRI's Capsule or zonular abnormalities that may affect postoperative centration or tilt of the lens (e.g. pseudoexfoliation syndrome) Pupil abnormalities (nonreactive, tonic pupils, abnormally shaped pupils, or pupils that do not dilate at least 4.0 mm under mesopic/scotopic conditions) Contact lens usage within 6 months for PMMA contacts lenses, 1 month for gas permeable lenses or 1 week for extendedwear and dailywear soft contact lens</criteria>
