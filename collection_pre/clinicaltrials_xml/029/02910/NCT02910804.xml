	<brief_summary>This is an open-label positron emission tomography/near infrared (PET/NIRF) study to investigate the imaging navigation performance and evaluation efficacy of dual modality imaging probe 68Ga-BBN-IRDye800CW in glioblastoma (GBM) patients. A single dose of 40μg/111-148 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) and 1.0 mg/ml 68Ga-BBN-IRDye800CW will be injected intravenously before the operation and intraoperative respectively. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET images and real-time margins localization for surgical navigation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IRDye800CW-BBN PET-NIRF Imaging Guiding Surgery in Patients With Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-invasive preoperative PET imaging evaluation and real-time fluorescence-guided surgery would be of great help in GBM patients. BBN, with the amino acid sequence of Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2, has been extensively used for the development of molecular probes for the imaging of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family of bombesin receptors that over-expressed in various types of cancer cells including glioblastoma multiforme. For interests in clinical translation of GRPR targeting dual modality probe, an open label dual modality imaging PET/ NIFR study was designed to investigate the safety and imaging guiding performance of 68Ga-BBN-IRDye800CW in patients with GBM.</detailed_description>
