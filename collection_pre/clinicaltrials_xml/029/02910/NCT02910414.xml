	<detailed_description>The TARGET BP I Trial is a randomized, double-blinded, multi-center, international, sham-procedure controlled trial, comparing renal denervation performed with the Peregrine System Kit in the treatment group to the sham control group (without renal denervation - no alcohol infusion). Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to treatment versus sham control via central randomization. The TARGET BP I clinical trial uses a percutaneous catheter to deliver very small amounts of alcohol (neurolytic agent). The patient population for this trial is comparable to those used in other renal denervation studies, but also incorporates lessons learned from recent trials of renal denervation. This is to enable the study of an optimized patient population who stands to benefit from the intervention, in a manner that reduces possible study bias. This trial is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Peregrine Catheter when used to deliver a 0.6 mL volume of alcohol to the perivascular area of the respective renal arteries while patients are adequately managed with oral antihypertensive medications.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject is &gt; 18 and ≤ 75 years old at time of enrollment. 2. Subjects has maintained their antihypertension medication regimen of 25 medications (labelled for hypertension) for at least four weeks (28 days) prior to randomization. Two of the antihypertensive medications must be at least at 50% of their maximally labelled dose prior to the planned renal denervation treatment. In subjects on two medications, at least one must be a diuretic and the second an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). All subjects must currently be on, or have documentation that they failed or cannot tolerated a diuretic. For patient on two nondiuretic antihypertensive medications because they either failed or have been unable to tolerate a diuretic, the two medications must consist of an ACE or ARB and a Calcium Channel blocker (CCB). Note: the following classes of antihypertensive agents that would count towards the minimum number of agents are: ACE inhibitors, ARB, calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, betablockers, centrally active agents, alpha receptor blockers, direct vasodilators, direct renin inhibitors, and hydralazine. 3. Patient agrees to have all trial procedures performed, to comply with medication regimen and is able and willing to comply with all followup visits. 4. Patient is willing to provide written informed consent. 5. Meets blood pressure criteria once the four week stable medication monitoring phase has been completed, and prior to the procedure: 1. Mean of 3 measurements of office systolic Blood Pressure ≥ 150 mmHg and ≤ 180 mmHg, AND 2. Daytime mean systolic Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurement (ABPM) ≥ 140 mmHg and ≤ 170 mmHg. 6. Investigator judges that the subject can be managed safely for up to 12 weeks (4 weeks pretreatment plus 8 weeks posttreatment) without any changes to their current antihypertensive treatment regimen. 1. Patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. 2. Patient with documented secondary hypertension, including but not limited to: Cushing's disease or Cushing's Syndrome, hyperaldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, documented obstructive sleep apnea, documented thyroid and parathyroid abnormalities etc., or onset of hypertension prior to the age of 18. Note: documented evaluation of secondary hypertension is required. 3. Renal artery stenosis ≥ 50% diameter stenosis, or aneurysm(s) 4. History of previous stenting or balloon angioplasty of the renal arteries 5. History of preeclampsia 6. Orthostatic hypotension at baseline, or documented history of orthostatic hypotension within the last 12 months, defined as a drop in blood pressure that is greater than 20 mmHg in systolic BP and/or more than 10 mmHg in diastolic BP within 3 minutes upon standing from sitting or from a lying down faceup (supine) position 7. Renal artery anatomy as assessed by imaging (CTA or, MRA or renal angiogram) meeting the following criteria: 1. Main renal artery that has a diameter of &lt; 4 mm or &gt; 7 mm or a length of &lt; 11 mm (Note: patients with more than one main eligible renal artery per side will be excluded), 2. Accessory renal arteries with diameter &gt; 2 mm, 3. Excessive renal artery tortuosity based on Investigator judgment, 4. Moderate or severe, and diffuse renal artery calcification, 5. Renal anatomic vascular abnormalities (as assessed by renal imaging) that would increase the risk of renal catheterization, and/or 6. Fibromuscular dysplasia 8. Occlusive peripheral vascular disease that would preclude percutaneous access for the procedure. 9. Patient is known to have a unilateral nonfunctioning kidney or unequal renal size (&gt; 2 cm difference in renal length between kidneys). 10. Single kidney, kidney tumor, urinary tract obstruction, or other anatomic abnormality. Note: Simple renal cysts are not an exclusion. 11. Previous renal denervation. 12. History of renal transplantation. 13. History of pyelonephritis within 6 months. 14. History of recurrent (&gt; one episode) kidney stones, or history of kidney stones within the last year. 15. Estimated eGFR (by the CKDEpi formula) &lt; 45 mL/min per 1.73 m2, or on chronic renal replacement therapy. 16. Unexplained hypokalemia (i.e. K &lt; 3.5 mEq/L in subjects not on a potassiumwasting diuretic). Note: Patients with hypokalemia who are not on a potassiumwasting diuretic but have another potential reason for hypokalemia should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. Note: Hypokalemia, with known etiology (i.e. diuretic effect), should be corrected before proceeding with the procedure. 17. Patient in whom an ABPM device cannot be used due to arm size (&gt; 40 cm arm circumference) or other reasons as identified by the Investigator or study coordinator. 18. Patient with severe cardiac valve stenosis for which, in the opinion of the Investigator, a significant reduction of blood pressure is contraindicated. 19. Patient has heart failure (NYHA Class II to IV) or has an ejection fraction ≤ 35%. 20. Known primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension. 21. Active infection. 22. Type 1 diabetes mellitus. 23. Patient requiring chronic oxygen support or has severe COPD. 24. Patient has known hypersensitivity to contrast agents that cannot be adequately premedicated 25. A known hypersensitivity to Dehydrated Alcohol Injection, USP. 26. Platelet count &lt; 75,000/microliter and/or known bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy at time of screening. 27. Receiving anticoagulant drugs (e.g., warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, or low molecular weight heparins), that in the opinion of the Investigator, would affect the safety of the trial procedure. Use of antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and/or thienopyridines (e.g., clopidogrel) are permitted. 28. Patient has current problems with substance abuse (e.g. alcohol, illegal drugs, etc.). 29. Patient on steroids at immunosuppressant doses, or immunosuppressant therapy, except for nasal and pulmonary inhalants. 30. Patient has a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, or stroke during the 6 months prior to enrollment. 31. Pregnant or nursing or planning to become pregnant during the trial time period. Note: If subject is of childbearing potential, as defined in the protocol, agrees to use of contraception. 32. Any acute or chronic condition that the investigator believes will adversely affect the ability to interpret the data or will prevent the subject from completing the trial procedures, or has a life expectancy of &lt; 12 months. 33. Patient is participating or does not agree to not participate in any other investigational drug or device trial until their participation in this study is completed.</criteria>
