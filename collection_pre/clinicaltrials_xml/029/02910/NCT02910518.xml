	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate bioequivalence between insulin glulisine given as 300 Units/mL test formulation and insulin glulisine 100 Units/mL reference formulation after a single subcutaneous (SC) dose. Secondary Objectives: - To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles and further pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of insulin glulisine U300 in comparison to insulin glulisine U100 after a single SC dose. - To assess safety and tolerability of the test and the reference formulation of insulin glulisine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Demonstrate Bioequivalence Between Insulin Glulisine U300 and Insulin Glulisine U100 After a Single Subcutaneous Dose Using the Euglycemic Clamp Technique, in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study duration per patient will be 18 to 62 days and will consist of a 4 to 28 days of screening period, a treatment period of 2 days, a washout between dosing occasions of 5-18 days, and follow up visit 7-14 days after last dosing.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Male or female subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) for more than 1 year. Total insulin dose of &lt;1.2 U/kg/day. Fasting negative serum Cpeptide (&lt;0.30 nmol/L). Glycohemoglobin at screening (HbA1c) ≤9%. Subjects with antiinsulin antibody titer at screening ≤30.0 kU/L. Stable insulin regimen for at least 2 months prior to study. Normal findings in medical history and physical examination (cardiovascular system, chest and lungs, thyroid, abdomen, nervous system, skin and mucosae, and musculoskeletal system), vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and safety laboratory. Exclusion criteria: Any history or presence of clinically relevant cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, metabolic (apart from T1DM), hematological, neurological, psychiatric, systemic (affecting the body as a whole), ocular, gynecologic (if female), or infectious disease; any acute infectious disease or signs of acute illness or any history or presence of heparin induced thrombocytopenia Type II (HITtype II). Severe hypoglycemia resulting in coma/seizures or requiring assistance of another person, and/or hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis in the last 6 months before screening visit. Frequent severe headaches and/or migraine, recurrent nausea and/or vomiting (more than twice a month). Symptomatic hypotension (whatever the decrease in blood pressure), or asymptomatic postural hypotension defined by a decrease in systolic blood pressure equal to or greater than 20 mmHg within three minutes when changing from the supine to the standing position. Presence or history of drug hypersensitivity, or allergic disease diagnosed and treated by a physician. Likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with drugs not permitted by the clinical study protocol. Any medication (including medicine containing St John's Wort) within 14 days before inclusion (for systemic glucocorticoids within 3 months) or within 5 times the elimination halflife or PD halflife of the medication, with the exception of insulin, stable treatment (at least 2 months) with thyroid hormones, lipidlowering and antihypertensive drugs and if female with the exception of hormonal contraception or menopausal hormone replacement therapy. Positive reaction to any of the following tests: hepatitis B surface (HBs Ag) antigen, anti hepatitis C virus (antiHCV) antibodies, antihuman immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 antibodies (antiHIV1 and anti HIV2 Ab). The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
