	<brief_summary>Outside the setting of well-designed prospective clinical studies, the current standard preoperative RT should be a conventionally 1,8-2 Gy fractionated regimen to a total dose of 50 Gy in 5-6 weeks. However, given the vast diversity of sarcoma subtypes, it is also unlikely to assume a uniform radiotherapeutic management to be optimal for all sarcomas alike. Other than 2 Gy fraction sizes and/or 50 Gy total dose series have been investigated in the past and should be further exploited in the future, but the practical implementation in humans is hampered by the rarity of the disease. This platform may form the basis for preclinical radiotherapy investigations.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed newly diagnosed (non)metastatic intermediate to high grade STS for which the patients is advised to undergo a combination of radiotherapy and surgery (e.g. deep seated, and/or &gt; 5cm according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria and/or grade II/III according to the FNCLCC definition) Local recurrences are allowed provided prior management was surgery alone Age â‰¥ 18 years Able and willing to undergo tumor biopsies Localization of sarcoma enables safe biopsy. Written informed consent Ewing sarcoma and other PNET family tumours, rhabdomyosarcomas (both paediatric and adult), osteosarcomas Known coagulation disorder and/or anticoagulant medication in as far it might interfere with a safe biopsy procedure (to the discretion of the treating physician and attending radiologist). Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the study.</criteria>
