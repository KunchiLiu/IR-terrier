	<brief_summary>The present prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial investigates the effects of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) during the early rehabilitation after stroke. Patients with hemipresis will receive either sham or real iTBS over their affected hemispheres before occupational therapy for 8 days. Motor recovery is assessed one day after the intervention phase and three months after enrollment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Theta-Burst-Stimulation in Early Rehabilitation of Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date, rehabilitation of stroke with hemiparesis mainly includes physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Yet, the majority of patients retain movement impairment relevant for activities of daily living. One explanation for this deficit is the insufficient recovery of connectivity between brain regions after stroke. It is possible to modulate this process by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using the protocol of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS). Previous data indicate that modulation of the motor cortex with iTBS enhances the effects of subsequent motor training. The present study aims at investigating whether daily repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over 8 days combined with subsequent physiotherapy leads to better motor recovery, compared with physiotherapy after sham stimulation. In the first weeks and after three months, motor function, degree of disability and quality of life are examined in order to evaluate the effects of iTBS in the rehabilitation of stroke patients.</detailed_description>
