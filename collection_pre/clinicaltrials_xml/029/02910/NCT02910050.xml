	<brief_title>Bicalutamide Plus Aromatase Inhibitors in ER(+)/AR(+)/HER2(-) Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Androgen receptor(AR) is closely related to molecular type, treatment and prognosis in breast cancer. Over 70% of breast cancer expressed androgen receptor. And in some estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells which are resistant to Aromatase inhibitors can change androgen receptor dependent. So AR may be a new target in the treatment of breast cancer. Bicalutamide is a selective androgen receptor inhibitor with a clinical benefit rate of 19% and median progression free survival of 12 weeks in the ER-/AR+ metastatic breast cancer. This study is aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bicalutamide and aromatase inhibitor in ER+/AR+/HER- metastatic breast cancer patients who have disease progression after treatment of an AI.</detailed_description>
