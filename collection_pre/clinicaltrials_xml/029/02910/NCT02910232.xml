	<brief_title>In Vivo Clinical Trial of Porous Starch - Hydroxyapatite Composite Biomaterials for Bone Regeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The products were prepared from medical grade Thai rice starch mixed with high purity (&gt;97%) hydroxyapatite powder from fresh cow bone, and already passed in vivo animal biocompatility test, then processed by freeze-drying. There were 44 volunteers from orthopedic and neurosurgical division, 4 and 40 patients, respectively.</detailed_description>
