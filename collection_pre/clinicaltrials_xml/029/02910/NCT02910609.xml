	<brief_title>International Experience in Timing And Choices for Ductal Closure in Patent Ductus Arteriosus:INTERPDA Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), of which incidence is inversely related to gestational age and birth weight, is one of the the most common conditions among preterm infants. In recent years, the use of antenatal steroids, postnatal surfactant, noninvasive ventilation strategies and low oxygen saturation targets have affected the incidence of hemodynamically significant PDA (HSPDA). There is not any consensus about the best approach on the clinical management of PDA in preterm infants. Over past years, the management of HSPDA shifted to aggressive medical and surgical intervention from conservative treatment, but conservative treatment approach has been mainly concerned again nowadays. Today, the three options for the treatment of PDA in preterm infants are conservative approach, pharmacological intervention and surgical ligation. There is not any randomized-controlled trial that demonstrates the superiority of these approaches in preterm infants. Many countries including developed countries only give recommendations, instead of publishing guidelines, on screening, timing of treatment and treatment choices of PDA, because of the differences on management of PDA between the centers even within a single center. Timing of PDA treatment and treatment choices at preterm infants born before 28 gestation weeks' differ in our country also in many countries over the world. In this study, it is aimed to record the managements of PDA detected beyond postnatal 3 days, to compare the effects of the managements at postnatal 3-7 days and after 7 days on closure, surgical ligation rates and side effects of drugs.</detailed_description>
