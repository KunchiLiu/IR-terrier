	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of DCL-101 to GoLYTELY in preparing the large bowel for colonoscopy. Additional secondary objectives will compare the safety of DCL-101 to GoLYTELY in preparing the large bowel for colonoscopy and compare the tolerability of DCL-101 to GoLYTELY in preparing the large bowel for colonoscopy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Male or nonpregnant, nonlactating females, 18 to 75 years of age. Females of child bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to randomization, and must use a hormonal (oral, implantable or injectable) or barrier method of birth control throughout the study. Females unable to bear children must have documentation of such in the source records (i.e., tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or postmenopausal [defined as a minimum of one year since the last menstrual period]). 2. Routine, nonurgent, screening or surveillance colonoscopy is indicated and scheduled. 3. Ability of subject to participate fully in all aspects of this clinical trial, including ability and willingness to swallow capsules. 4. Informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization will be obtained and documented from all subjects prior to the start of any studyspecific procedures. 1. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to any of the components of GoLYTELY or DCL101 2.

Diverticulitis within the past 6 weeks 3. Current or former tobacco users 4. Prior colorectal surgery, esophageal surgery, or gastric surgery. This includes colectomy in the past, colostomy, ulcer surgery (antrectomy or pyloroplasty) or bariatric surgery, including lap band or fundoplication 5. Chronic constipation, gastroparesis, esophageal motility disorders or other gut dysmotility disorders 6. Requiring medications that cannot have the administration schedule safely altered to be compatible with bowel preparation 7. Current or history within the past year of any ongoing clinically relevant electrocardiogram abnormalities 8. Clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities during Screening, defined by the range of normal of the central laboratory 9. Significant psychiatric illness 10. Renal failure or chronic kidney disease (creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min, unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome/congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Functional Classification grade III or IV), ascites 11. Received any investigational therapy within 60 days of randomization 12. Blood donation within 56 days prior to randomization 13. Plasma donation within 7 days prior to randomization 14. Received luminal contrast agents such as barium or watersoluble oral contrast agent within 21 days prior to randomization 15. Known to have an impaired gag reflex, or prone to regurgitation or aspiration 16. Serious underlying disease that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the subject's ability to participate fully in the study 17. History of alcohol or drug abuse that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the study procedures 18. Pregnant or lactating women 19. Prior enrolment in the current study and had received study treatment 20.
