	<brief_summary>Antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are among the oldest prescribed drugs still used in clinical practice. Relatively inexpensive and well tolerated, these drugs have been recognized to be effective in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Interestingly, there is growing evidence of their beneficial impact on cardiovascular risk, particularly diabetes. HCQ therapy can improve balance in patients with unbalanced diabetes. This drug therapy may be a new therapeutic approach for diabetes. There is need for a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the improvement of the metabolic response to drug treatment. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with a drug improves the function of the beta cell and its ability to secrete insulin in response to glucose. The investigators will examine the impact of short-term therapy for HCQ in beta cell function in healthy volunteers and in patients with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
