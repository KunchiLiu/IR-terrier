	<detailed_description>This is a 3-group randomized clinical trial to compare usual care to two educationally enhanced approaches to breast density notification. Usual care involves sending written notification along with the mammogram report; all women will receive usual care. In addition, some women will receive written educational materials about breast density, with or without interaction with a promotora (culturally congruent health educator). Study outcomes include short and long term assessments of psychological (anxiety, knowledge) and behavioral (continued mammography screening, discussion with primary care provider) outcomes. The study also includes qualitative inquiry and a cost analysis.</detailed_description>
