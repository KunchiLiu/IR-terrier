	<brief_summary>Persistent chronic inflammation is an important underlying event in multiple diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases and type 2 diabetes. These disorders are characterized as inflammatory in part because of the important mediating role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in their pathogenesis. This study will investigate whether transcutaneous auricular electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve will affect and decrease the inflammatory cytokine response in healthy individuals.</brief_summary>
