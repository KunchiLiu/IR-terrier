	<brief_title>Effects of a Workplace Prevention Program for Problematic Gambling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a considerable knowledge-gap regarding the efficacy of problem gambling prevention in workplace settings. At the same time, this knowledge is widely requested upon both by researchers and government agencies. The evaluation of prevention programs is important both in a public health perspective and for the organizations investing in preventive interventions for problem gambling at the workspaces and the current study aims to contribute with knowledge regarding the potential effects of such an intervention. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a workplace prevention program regarding problematic gambling, on a variety of outcomes. The authors hypothesize that the program will lead to differences in: - A change in gambling habits among coworkers and managers - That fewer workers and managers will report problem gambling - That the managers who participate in the intervention will report being more confident in handling gambling and problem gambling at the workplace - That the managers who participate in the intervention will report a higher inclination to engage in a conversation with an employee when suspicion or worry about problem gambling arises - That the number of actions to help employees with problem gambling or other types of harmful use will raise among organizations who participate in the intervention. - An increase in the employees' knowledge about what kind of support regarding gambling or addiction is available from the workplace and where to find it.</detailed_description>
