	<brief_summary>To assess the impact of an e-learning course in neuromuscular monitoring on the frequency of application of objective neuromuscular monitoring for assessment of depth of neuromuscular blockade in general anaesthesia and secondarily on the incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade after anesthesia. We will collect data prospectively from 6 Danish anaesthesia departments from the time of intervention, using data from the Anaesthesia Information Management System (AIMS). Baseline data is obtained from another study based on the same data extraction procedure (NCT02914119).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Departments We will include the 6 largest anaesthesia departments in the Zealand Region of Denmark. Anaesthetists We will include the following anaesthesia personnel as anaesthetists: nurse anaesthetists in training, nurse anaesthetists, first year residents in anaesthesiology, residents in the last 4 years of training in anaesthesiology, and specialist consultants in anaesthesia. Patients We will include and collect data from all patients undergoing general anaesthesia with neuromuscular blockade in each data collection period. Patients, who are eligible more than once, i.e. undergoing general anaesthesia on more than one occasion, will be included in the analyses with a case for every general anaesthetic received. Exclusion criteria We will exclude personnel without clinical functions, i.e. administrative personnel.</criteria>
