	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to determine the optimal technique to elicit the grasping response in patients with dementia or suspected frontal lobe dysfunction. The proposed study is to perform two techniques to elicit grasp response in patients with dementia or suspected frontal lobe dysfunction and observe the presence or absence of the response and prominence of the response on a proposed rating scale. Future goals will be aimed at aiding clinicians in refining their clinical techniques to be more sensitive for diagnosing frontal lobe dysfunctions.</brief_summary>
