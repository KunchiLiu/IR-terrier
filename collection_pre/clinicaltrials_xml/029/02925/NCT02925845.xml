	<brief_summary>- Objective: To analyze the effect of neuromuscular electrostimulation in the maturation of radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (RC-AVF) patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5-5D - Design: Clinical Trial with medical devices, 18-month, single-center, within the hospital setting. - Disease or disorder study: vascular Access maturation. - Population: Patients with CKD stage 5-5D at the research center. - Project duration: 78 weeks - Methodology: - Patients with CKD stages 5-5D that has undergone a native AV in service stations to give their informed consent and meeting the inclusion criteria will be included. - At baseline two study groups were established: - Group 1: neuromuscular electrostimulation - Group 2: isometric exercises</brief_summary>
