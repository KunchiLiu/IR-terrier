	<brief_summary>This study involves research, and the purpose of this study is to evaluate live birth rates among couples who are treated by Natural procreative technology, (NPT) for infertility and miscarriage. Comparisons will be made to those declining NPT treatment, waiting for NPT treatment, receiving other treatment, or stopping treatment. The investigator seeks to document specific pregnancy rates for different factors such as age and type of infertility diagnosis. Investigators will also assess characteristics of environmental exposures that may be associated with infertility. Couples will be followed for up to three years, regardless of when they begin NPT treatment, or whether they continue treatment. Data from all couples will be useful for this study, regardless of their individual circumstances or actual treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective cohort observational study. Couples presenting for possible treatment with NPT will be recruited for participation in the study. No randomization will occur. If a couple agrees to participate, investigators will collect information in three ways: 1. Questionnaires. (standard of care) These will be done at entry (SOC) to the study, on an annual basis for up to three years (research related), for any pregnancy, or whenever a patient exits the study. Questionnaires may be done by mail, email, or telephone. Each questionnaire has a woman's and a man's version, except the pregnancy questionnaire, which only has a woman's version. Each questionnaire will take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete. 2. The subject's own Creighton Model fertility charts. (standard of care) 3. Information about NPT treatment and pregnancies from the medical records of their NPT physician(s). (standard of care)</detailed_description>
