	<brief_title>Safety of Either a Single or Two IV Doses of Orbactiv in Subjects With ABSSSI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical studies in adult subjects with ABSSSI have demonstrated that a single 1200-mg IV dose of oritavancin was clinically non-inferior, well tolerated, and had a similar safety profile to 7 to 10 days of IV vancomycin treatment. The 1200-mg dose of oritavancin is the United States (US) approved therapeutic dose. Subjects with ABSSSI will be enrolled in this study to obtain safety information of two 1200-mg IV infusions of oritavancin when administered one week apart. The safety information will include the potential for antibody production following two 1200-mg IV infusions of oritavancin. This study will be a randomized, double-blind study. Subjects will be randomized to receive either two doses of oritavancin or one dose of oritavancin and a single dose of placebo one week apart in order to obtain safety information. This safety information will include information regarding the potential for antibody production following one or two doses of 1200 mg oritavancin.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of ABSSSI (wound infections, Cellulitis/erysipelas, or cutaneous abscess) suspected or confirmed to be caused by a Grampositive pathogen requiring IV therapy Able to give informed consent and willing to comply with all required study procedures Infections associated with, or in close proximity to, a prosthetic device Severe sepsis or refractory shock Known or suspected bacteremia at time of screening ABSSSI due to or associated with any of the following: Infections suspected or documented to be caused by Gramnegative pathogens (i.e., human or animal bites, injuries contaminated with fresh or salt water, external malignant otitis) Wound infections (surgical or traumatic) and abscesses with only Gramnegative pathogens Diabetic foot infections (infection extending distal to the malleoli in a subject with diabetes mellitus and peripheral neuropathy and/or vascular insufficiency or any ulceration of their foot) Concomitant infection at another site not including a secondary ABSSSI lesion (e.g., septic arthritis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis) Infected burns A primary infection secondary to a preexisting skin disease with associated inflammatory changes such as atopic dermatitis, eczema, or hidradenitis suppurativa Decubitus or chronic skin ulcer, or ischemic ulcer due to peripheral vascular disease (arterial or venous) Any evolving necrotizing process (i.e., necrotizing fasciitis), gangrene, or infection suspected or proven to be caused by Clostridium species (e.g., crepitance on examination of the ABSSSI site and/or surrounding tissue(s) or radiographic evidence of subcutaneous gas in proximity to the infection) Infections known to be caused by a Grampositive organism with a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) &gt;2 μg/mL or clinically failing prior therapy with glycopeptides Catheter site infections Currently receiving chronic systemic immunosuppressive therapy such as chemotherapy or prednisone (prednisone at nonimmunosuppressive doses of ≤15 mg/day is permitted) Subjects who are likely to need treatment with IV unfractionated heparin sodium within 48 hours after oritavancin administration Last known cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count &lt;200 cells/mm3 in subjects with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) Neutropenia with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;500 cells/mm3 Significant or lifethreatening condition (e.g., endocarditis) that would confound or interfere with the assessment of safety Women who are pregnant or nursing, or who are of childbearing potential and unwilling to use at least 2 acceptable methods of birth control: (e.g., prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, barrier method(s) or male partner sterilization). Women ≥2 years postmenopausal or surgically sterile are exempt from this exclusion History of immunerelated hypersensitivity reaction to glycopeptides (such as vancomycin, televancin, daptomycin, or dalbavancin) or any of their excipients. Note: subjects who have had histaminelike infusion reactions to a glycopeptide are not excluded Subjects unwilling to forego blood and/or blood product donation for at least 1 month from initiation of oritavancin dose Treatment with investigational medicinal product within 30 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, before enrollment and for the duration of the study Investigational device present, or removed within 30 days before enrollment, or presence of devicerelated infection Subjects who the investigator considers unlikely to adhere to the protocol, comply with oritavancin administration, or complete the clinical study (e.g., unlikely to survive 90 days from initiation of oritavancin dosing) Prior exposure to oritavancin alone or in combination with another product.</criteria>
