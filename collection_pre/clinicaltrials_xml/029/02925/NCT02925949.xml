	<brief_title>Duo Partnership Adherence Commitment Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will test the intervention to improve HIV care engagement by enrolling 150 same-sex male couples and randomizing 75 couples each to one of two conditions: 1) DuoPACT, a newly-developed couples intervention; or 2) LifeSteps, a standardized antiretroviral adherence intervention for HIV+ individuals. After randomization, intervention sessions will be delivered weekly (6 DuoPACT sessions, or 3 Life Steps sessions). All couples will be assessed pre/post intervention to evaluate intervention effects via behavioral indicators of engagement in HIV care, the couple's relationship dynamics, and the primary outcome of HIV viral load.</detailed_description>
