	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the possibilities of early and precise management to decrease portal vein pressure in cirrhotic patients, guided by a non-invasive 3D-virtual-model of hepatic portal system (3D-vHPS). Healthy volunteers are enrolled to determine the normal range of pressure density in different sites of HPS. Cirrhotic patients without visible gastro-esophageal varies by endoscopy are randomly enrolled to virtual portal vein pressure gradient (vPVPG) monitored or non-vPVPG monitored groups. Non-vPVPG groups are followed-up and treated according to Baveno V consensus in portal hypertension. Patients in vPVPG-monitored groups are followed-up by anatomic computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and Doppler ultrasound every six months. Once vPVPG is above 12mmHg, participants will receive carvedilol treatment. All cirrhotic patients are followed-up with the incidence of portal hypertension-related complications, mortality rate and life quality assessment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The non-invasive 3D-HPS is a newly-developed test to determine vPVPG based on anatomic computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and Doppler ultrasound. In this study, vPVPG is determined by the 3D-HPS.</detailed_description>
