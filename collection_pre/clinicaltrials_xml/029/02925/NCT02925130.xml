	<brief_summary>Beta2-mimetics such as Salbutamol have been shown to have ergogenic effects. Acute and chronic inhaled or oral doses of Salbutamol have been shown to increase whole body exercise and muscle performances. The underlying mechanisms are however unclear. Some data suggest that Salbutamol may have some effects on the central nervous system which may explain the improved exercise and neuromuscular performances. The present study aims to assess the effects of acite inhaled or oral Salbutamol intake on the neuromuscular system by using neurostimulation techniques and magnetic resonance imaging.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The effects of Salbutamol intake will be assessed by using transcranial magnetic stimulation on one hand and magnetic resonance imaging on the other hand. Maximal voluntary activation and cerebral activation will be measured during motor tasks performed until exhaustion after acute inhaled slabutamol intake, acture oral salbutamol intake or oral placebo intake.</detailed_description>
