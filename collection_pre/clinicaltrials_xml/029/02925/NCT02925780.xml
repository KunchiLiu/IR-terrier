	<brief_title>Action of Infiltration Resin Icon in Fluorosis, Clinical Trial, Monitoring for 12 Month</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dental fluorosis is an endemic public health concern that affects infants ages 15 to 30 months, being the critical period for an excessive amount of fluoride during enamel formation (Muñoz, Arana-Gordillo, Mongruel, Mongruel, Campanha, et al., 2012). Anatomopathologically, dental fluorosis presents itself as a hypermineralized surface layer and subsurface hypomineralization involving the external third of the thickness of the enamel, which is equivalent in early carious lesions (Denis, Atlan, Vennat, Tirlet, &amp; Attal, 2013). In addition, it features a number of clinical changes in the enamel surface, ranging from the appearance of thin white lines up to severe structural defects (Thylstrup, 1978; Aplleton, Chestersa, &amp; Kierdorf, 2000). Up to its mildest forms according to TF and Dean's index, the tip of the summit of the cups of the premolars, molars, or incisal border of the anterior teeth present opacities, faint white flecks, spots, or striations (Muñoz, 2012). Thereby, fluorosis compromises overall esthetics, which sometimes leads to children to drop out of school due to its psychological impact (Denis, et al, 2013). With the aim of improving dental esthetics, a therapeutic alternative such as a minimal invasive infiltrant resin technique, will be used on 31 patients, ages 10 to 12 years of age with stage 1, 2, and 3 of fluorosis according to the Thylstrup and Fejerskov (TF) scale or Questionable, Very Mild, and Mild according to Dean's Index, will be evaluated using digital photography analysis, during 12 months. The research includes a clinical, longitudinal, and blind study, in which a total of 31 patients: 15 children from the province of Pichincha, Ecuador and an additional 15 from the province of Cotopaxi, Ecuador, are chosen according to inclusion and exclusion criteria upon informed consent of their parents and or legal guardian. In addition, a clinical examination, a basic medical history, and a diagnosis according to TF and Dean's index are the parameters for patient eligibility for this study. It is important to note that the infiltrant resin technique follows the manufacturers' instructions. Finally, a three month follow up will be reinforced in order to clinically evaluate the treated teeth at the end of one year. The relatively new resin material offers great expectation towards its use in clinical fluorosis affecting the Ecuador population, due to the in vitro preliminary studies of Viteri &amp; Armas (2015), which prove that resin infiltration over enamel affected with incipient flouorosis is effective. Through its use in this clinical trial, the structural changes of the enamel with fluorosis will be analyzed against contact with the resin infiltration Icon ®-DMG technology. This study will be conducted in order to show promising esthetic changes using a minimally invasive procedure on teeth with mild fluorosis.</detailed_description>
