	<brief_title>Efficacy of 311-nm Ti:Sapphire Laser Versus 308-nm Excimer Laser Treatment in Vitiligo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 308-nm excimer laser (EL) has been widely used for localized vitiligo. Recently, the 311-nm Ti:Sapphire laser (TSL) was developed to treat patients with vitiligo. To compare the efficacy of TSL vs. EL in the treatment of vitiligo. A randomized controlled non-inferiority trial based on split-body was planned. The paired symmetric vitiliginous lesions will be randomized to either TSL or EL treatment groups. All lesions will be treated twice weekly for a total of 12-week period. The degree of repigmentation will be assessed as % from baseline by using a computer program every 4 weeks, and the non-inferiority margin was set at 10%. Overall 16 patients will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
