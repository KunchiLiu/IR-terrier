In Israel most rehabilitation centers do not provide treatment to this population who generally are high-functioning. A single-blind-randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Adults after mild to moderate stroke living in community from "Maccabi Health Services" and "shiba" will be invited to participate in this study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria: &gt; 18 years, at least six month post stroke, severity mild to moderate (NIHSS≤10), independent prior to the stroke, can understand and speak Hebrew, with no other neurological or psychiatric conditions, without dementia or depression (GDS&lt;10). Assessments will be administered pre and post the 10-week intervention and at follow-up 4-weeks later by assessors blind to the group allocation. Following the pre assessment, participants will be randomly allocated into two groups: treatment group will receive (FACoT) and the control group receiving standard care. Sample size: 43 patients - 23 in each group. the treatment sessions will include: functional activities, cognitive activities and strategies (pencil-pen treatment), and behavioural strategies</detailed_description>
