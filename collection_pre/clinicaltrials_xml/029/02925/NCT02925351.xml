	<brief_summary>This pilot trial studies how well fluorine F 18 clofarabine positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in imaging patients with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. Fluorine F 18 clofarabine is an imaging agent or tracer which may be taken up by inflammatory tissue in the body. Diagnostic imaging, such as PET/CT scans, can be used to measure the amount of injected tracer that is taken up by inflammatory tissue. PET/CT scan may help to determine how fluorine F 18 clofarabine is distributed throughout the body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorine F 18 Clofarabine PET/CT in Imaging Patients With Autoimmune or Inflammatory Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine how fluorine F 18 clofarabine (18F‐clofarabine) is distributed in the body, in patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. II. Determine whether 18F‐clofarabine can be used to image patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. OUTLINE: Patients receive fluorine F 18 clofarabine intravenously (IV) and undergo a single PET/CT scan for up to 120 minutes.</detailed_description>
