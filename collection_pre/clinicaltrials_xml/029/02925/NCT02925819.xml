	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to collect in a prospective registry all cases of French patients undergoing an assessment for percutaneous treatment of mitral valve disease on a native valve or due to deterioration after surgical valve repair or replacement. In these patients, valvular surgery should be considered contra-indicated or at prohibitive risk. This registry will evaluate the morbidity and mortality up to 24 months for those patients with severe mitral valve disease who are not included in a clinical trial. The association of demographic, clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic variables and treatment options with morbidity and mortality will be evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with symptomatic severe mitral valve disease will have a medical evaluation visit (physical examination, ECG, biology) with transthoracic Â± transesophageal echocardiography in each center. If the patient is considered not eligible for surgery by the heart-team and is not included in a clinical trial, the investigator informs the patient of the existence of the registry and verifies that it does not express opposition to the use of its clinical data. In each participating center, demographic information, clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic and treatment options will be collected and reported in an electronic case report form (e-CRF). Each center will be responsible of patient monitoring, including phone call at 6 months and a medical visit at 1 and 2 years. Transthoracic echocardiography will also be performed at 1 year and 2 years.</detailed_description>
