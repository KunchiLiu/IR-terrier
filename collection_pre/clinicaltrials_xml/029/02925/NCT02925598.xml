	<brief_summary>The standard procedure used for airway control in general anesthesia for LC (laparoscopic cholecystectomy) is endotracheal intubation (EI). AuraGain and I-Gel are supraglottic airway devices (SADs) used for airway control for certain types of surgeries. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the performances of new types of SADs with EI regarding their insertion times, durations, perioperative complications and effects on hemodynamic parameters and peak airway pressures (Paw) in LC as well.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The standard procedure used for airway control in general anesthesia for LC (laparoscopic cholecystectomy) is endotracheal intubation (EI). AuraGain and I-Gel are supraglottic airway devices (SADs) used for airway control for certain types of surgeries.Previous studies have investigated and/or compared the performance of ProSeal™ LMA (Intavent Orthofix, Maidenhead, UK) during LC. But the performances of I-Gel and AuraGain have not been studied well yet. The main aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the performances of new types of SADs (i.e. AuraGain and I-Gel) with endotracheal intubation regarding their insertion times, ease of insertion and perioperative complications. The secondary aim was to observe their effects on hemodynamic parameters and peak airway pressures.</detailed_description>
