	<criteria>1. Male or female, ≥18 years of age (≥20 years of age in Taiwan) 2. Patients with histologically/cytologically confirmed solid tumor, or lymphoma. For the expansion cohort, only patients with peripheral/cutaneous T cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and other nonHodgkin's lymphoma would be considered eligible 3. Malignancies for which there is no standard therapy, or previously treated locally advanced, refractory/relapsed or metastatic disease for which local curative surgery, curable radiotherapy, or satisfactory systemic anticancer therapy is no longer available 4. Assessable disease status defined by Cheson (for lymphoma) or modified severity weighted assessment tool (mSWAT) (for mycosis fungoides [MF] and Sezary syndrome [SS]) criteria, or having measurable tumors defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines (RECIST 1.1) (for solid tumor) 5. Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤2 6. Anticipated life expectancy of more than 3 months per Investigator's judgement 7. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the screening visit 8. Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential, and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use effective birth control. Effective birth control and cessation of lactation must be complied at least 2 weeks prior to first study drug administration, during the trial participation, and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug 9. Willing and able to comply with the study procedure and sign a written informed consent 1. Patient with untreated or inadequate controlled brain metastases. Brain metastases or lymphoma with CNS involvement previously treated by radiotherapy or other modality and stable for at least 3 months prior to screening without requirement of corticosteroids or anticonvulsants are permitted 2. Prior systemic standard or investigational anticancer therapy, including target therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug. The above mentioned conditions which the Investigator considers there is no more drug effect, such as ≥5 halflives are permitted 3. More than 5 lines of previous cytotoxic therapies. For patients of CTCL who failed romidepsin, more than 4 lines of previous therapies 4. Extensive prior radiotherapy on more than 30% of bone marrow reserves or prior bone marrow/stem cell transplantation within 2 years before screening. Limited field radiation for ≤2 weeks prior to screening period is permitted 5. Any toxicity due to prior therapy that has not been resolved to less than Grade 2 severity by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.03 or higher) criteria 6. Medical history of uncontrolled but clinically significant abnormal cardiac conduction abnormalities at electrocardiogram (ECG), any history or evidence of long QT syndrome or QTcF interval &gt;450 msec for males and ≥470 msec for females (according to Fridericia's correction) at screening 7. Poor vital organ function defined as: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1,500/mm3, pretransfusion platelets &lt;100,000/mm3, or pretransfusion hemoglobin &lt;9.0 mg/dL (the patient is required to have at least 2 weeks free from blood transfusion, GCSF and erythropoietin use prior to the hematology test) International Normalized Ratio (INR) for coagulation above upper normal range Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate amino transferase (AST) or Alanine amino transferase (ALT) &gt;3 times ULN in patient without liver metastasis or liver cirrhosis Child Pugh B or C stage liver disease Creatinine clearance (by Cockcroft Gault formula) &lt;40 mL/min 8. Use of potent inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 within 14 days prior to first study drug administration.</criteria>
