	<brief_title>Web-based Intervention to Improve Executive Functioning in Teens With Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epilepsy is a common childhood condition affecting approximately 326,000 youth in the United States. Adolescents with epilepsy are at significant risk for poor social and academic outcomes, neurobehavioral comorbidities (i.e., internalizing and externalizing symptoms), and poor treatment adherence. Studies have shown that one potential reason for these poor outcomes are deficits in executive functioning (EF), defined as the skills necessary for goal-directed and complex activities, including problem-solving, initiation, monitoring, organization, planning, self-regulation and working memory. EF deficits have been documented in 1/3 of youth with epilepsy, which is 3 times the prevalence in healthy youth. Evidence-based interventions to improve EF could play a critical role in preventing adverse outcomes (e.g., psychological comorbidities, non-adherence to the treatment regimen) and promoting optimal functioning in adolescents with epilepsy; however none exists for this vulnerable population. The aim of the current study is to establish the feasibility, accessibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of an individually-tailored intervention to improve EF in adolescents with epilepsy (Executive Functioning Intervention-Epilepsy; EFI-E). Thirty participants will be recruited who have at least one clinically-elevated EF subscale or at least two at-risk subscale scores (&gt; 1 standard deviation above the mean) on the parent Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEFÂ®)) to qualify for the EFI-E. EFI-E will consist of 10 web-based modules addressing foundational EF skills. Each online module will be accompanied by a videoconference with a therapist to review the skills and problem solve around adolescent-identified goals. Baseline and post-treatment questionnaires will be completed by adolescents and primary caregivers and electronically-monitored adherence will be obtained throughout the open trial. Participants will be in the trial for 9 months.</detailed_description>
