	<brief_summary>This controlled prospective cohort study is designed to assess the feasibility and effect of bi-weekly non-traditional guitar classes on PD patient's self-reported and measurable outcomes including upper extremity function, motor findings, quality of life, mood, and cognitive findings. Prior to conducting a larger study, this study seeks to assess the possibility that participation in an instrumental performance activity in a group setting may improve outcomes in PD patients. Twelve patients with PD will be recruited to participate in the guitar class group (intervention) in addition to usual treatment, while another group of 12 patients with PD will be recruited to the control group to receive only their usual treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Non-traditional Guitar Group Instruction on Functional Movement and Well-being in Parkinson's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROBLEM STATEMENT: Engagement in musical activities has been found to improve symptoms in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), and physical therapy and music therapy have been demonstrated as viable non-pharmacological intervention methods that improve motor function in these individuals. Therapeutic instrumental music performance has the attributes of physical, rhythmic and social engagement combined with immediate auditory feedback, and has the potential to bring in additional neuro-rehabilitative effects associated with musical engagement into a treatment design. However, until now, much of the research has focused on the rhythmic aspects of music. Few studies have examined how active and complex engagement with music, such as learning to play an instrument, may help PD patients. Finger-style guitar instruction has the potential to improve bilateral dexterity in addition to other gains reported with music-based interventions in patients with PD. PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot controlled prospective cohort study is to assess the feasibility and the effects of non-traditional finger-style guitar classes on the quality of life, motor symptoms, upper extremity function, cognition, mood and social participation in individuals with PD. HYPOTHESIS: The investigators hypothesize that a 6-week bi-weekly finger-style guitar group intervention (12 sessions in total) in addition to usual and routine treatment will be a feasible intervention in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD), and will result in significant gains in quality of life, mood, social engagement, upper extremity function and upper extremity dexterity as compared to controls who receive only their usual and routine treatment. IMPORTANCE: The estimated overall prevalence of PD in the world is 315 per 100,000 individuals overall, and about 2 per 100 individuals 60 years of age or older, with higher estimates for older individuals living in North America, Europe and Australia (Pringsheim, Jette, Frolkis, &amp; Steeves, 2014). PD prevalence in the United States is projected to rise by 77% between 2010 and 2030 (Dorsey et. al., 2013). Music and rhythm-based interventions are noninvasive, patient-oriented techniques that lack side effects. The guitar is the most popular played instrument in the U.S (Richard K Miller and Associates, 2012), and it is the principal instrument of choice for music therapists (Krout, 2007). It is affordable and portable, with easy access to commercial instruction. Non-traditional engagement in finger-style music making on the guitar may have a broad impact on PD by improving the quality of functional upper extremity movements, decreasing the amplitude of involuntary movements, increasing social and cognitive participation in activities of daily living, and improving quality of life.</detailed_description>
