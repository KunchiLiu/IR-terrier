	<brief_summary>This study compares the efficacy of two dental interventions in the treatment of cervical dentine sensitivity. The participants will be selected from adult dental patients registered at a general dental practice in West Sussex, UK. The participants will be split into 2 groups. One group will receive the intervention of topical fluoride varnish application while the other group will receive a topical application of self-etching dentine bonding agent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial to Compare the Efficacy of a Fluoride Gel and a Dental Bonding Agent in Treatment of Tooth Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topical Fluoride Varnish(TFV) and Self-Etching Dentine Bonding Agent (SEDBA) are both routinely used in dentistry in the management of cervical dentine sensitivity(CDS). Both interventions are topically applied and well tolerated by patients. The interventions differ in mechanism of action. TFV releases fluoride which is incorporated into the organic matrix of dentine making the dentine tubules less conductive. Dentinal tubules form the key conduit between stimulus and pain perception in the tooth. SEDBA differs in that it penetrates and occludes the tubules. It is light cured for an almost instant set time.</detailed_description>
