	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years. Patient provides signed written informed consent before any studyspecific procedure. Patients suffer from coronary artery disease (CAD) including at least one angiographically significant (&gt;70% visual estimation) stenosis present in a native coronary artery with planned PCI. Subjects with emergent PCI or in cardiogenic shock. Subjects with target left main (LM) lesion, with restenosis or stent thrombosis in the target vessel or with aortoostial lesion location within 3 mm of the aorta junction (both right and left). Extreme angulation (&gt; 90°) or excessive tortuosity (&gt; two 45° angles) proximal to or within the target lesion. Known renal insufficiency (examples being but not limited to estimated glomerular Filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 50 ml/kg/m2, serum creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dL or on dialysis). Any other medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator will interfere with patients safety or study results. Currently participating in another clinical study that interferes with study results. Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year following index procedure. Any condition that precludes the subject from undergoing PCI, for example subjects with heparin induced thrombocytopenia, or contrast allergy</criteria>
