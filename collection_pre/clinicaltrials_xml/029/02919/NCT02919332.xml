	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies how well delayed fludeoxyglucose F-18 (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in improving visualization of brain tumors in patients with glioblastoma. Radiotracers such as 18F-FDG are highly taken up by tumors in the brain and are visualized using PET/CT. Increasing the interval of time between 18F-FDG administration and PET/CT scan may improve the visualization of brain tumors in patients with glioblastoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To improve the visualization/delineation of glioblastoma lesions using delayed 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging. OUTLINE: Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F-18 intravenously (IV). Patients then undergo a standard of care PET/CT scan at 60 minutes and a second PET/CT scan at 240 minutes after injection. Note: Standard Uptake Value (SUV) is defined for state-of-the art PET/CT scanners as Standardized uptake values = count activity per ml within region of interest (MBq/ml)/[injected dose (MBq)/body weight (kgx1000)]</detailed_description>
