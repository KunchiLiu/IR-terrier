	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of nasal and oronasal interfaces during ASV treatment on sleep efficiency and sleep architecture. Therefore, patients starting treatment with ASV, will be randomized between two groups. In the first group, patients will use a nasal interface during the first night and an oronasal interface during the second night. In the second group, patients will use an oronasal mask first and a nasal mask during the second night. The results of this trial will have major impact on future clinical practice as it would deliver prediction rules to choose the correct interface immediately.</brief_summary>
