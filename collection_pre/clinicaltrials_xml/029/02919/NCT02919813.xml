	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn more about Mindfulness based Group Cognitive Behavior Therapy (M-gCBT) as a treatment for Provoked Localized Vulvodynia (PLV). M-gCBT is a counseling technique that has been shown to reduce pain and anxiety with other medical conditions, including chronic pain conditions. The investigators wish to see if participation in M-gCBT course will help reduce anxiety, fear, and pain in women with PLV greater than education alone. Both techniques use a group setting including other women with PLV. "Mindfulness-Based Group Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Women with Localized Vulvodynia" is a study designed to learn more about the use of mindfulness based group cognitive behavior therapy for PLV pain and anxiety over education alone. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: mindfulness based cognitive behavior therapy or group education seminars.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>M-gCBT for Women With Provoked Localized Vulvodynia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>M-gCBT is a type of counseling that teaches women to have more control over their pain. Educational seminars teach women about the different aspects of PLV that affect emotional and physical health. Both groups will be given a binder containing course material at the first session and homework at each session that you will be asked to complete. The group education seminars will include an informational video clip reviewing an aspect of PLV and sexuality and will be followed by a group discussion facilitated by an instructor. Each session will involve a teacher and a small group of 6 to 12 women with PLV. Additionally, women in both groups will be asked to perform a weekly test to measure pain and to complete a daily diary.</detailed_description>
