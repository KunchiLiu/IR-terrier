This sub-study includes 50 participants and 8 arms, in total 350 participants will be assessed in all 7 sub-studies. General study information: This is a randomized, cross-over, quantitative study, which investigates physiological variables, mood, and affect of healthy participants in response to colored light exposure. The Participants take part in 5-8 arms and are exposed to colored light only, or are additionally asked to solve cognitive tasks during the colored light exposure. Primary aim is to measure the change in several physiological variables, mood, and affect during colored light exposure of 15 or 45 minutes. The risk for the participants is negligible and comparable to the risk during daily life.</brief_summary>
