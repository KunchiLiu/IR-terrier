	<criteria>The participant must have histological or cytological evidence of cancer which is advanced and/or metastatic, and is an appropriate candidate for experimental therapy in the judgment of the investigator, after available standard therapies have ceased to provide clinical benefit. Have the presence of measureable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). Are native Chinese men or women. Have adequate organ function, including: Hematologic: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 109/Liters (L), platelets ≥100 x 109/L, and hemoglobin ≥9 grams per deciliter. Participants may receive erythrocyte transfusions to achieve this hemoglobin level or platelet transfusions to achieve platelet levels at the discretion of the investigator; however, initial study drug treatment must not begin earlier than the day after transfusion. Hepatic: Bilirubin ≤1.5 times upper limits of normal (ULN), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤3.0 times ULN. Renal: Serum creatinine ≤1.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) for males or ≤1.0 mg/dL for females. Have a performance status ≤1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. Recovered from the acute effects of therapy (treatment related toxicity resolved to baseline) except for residual alopecia. Have an estimated life expectancy of ≥12 weeks. Have received previous therapies for cancer (including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and investigational therapy) within 21 days for myelosuppressive agents or 14 days for nonmyelosuppressive agents prior to receiving study drug. Have an acute leukemia or other relevant cancers at the discretion of the investigator. Females who are pregnant or lactating. Participants consuming drugs or foods that are known to be inducers (for example, grapefruit juice, phenytoin, carbamazepine) or strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be excluded during Cycle 1. Have history or evidence of central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis. Screening of asymptomatic participants without history of CNS metastases is not required for enrollment.</criteria>
