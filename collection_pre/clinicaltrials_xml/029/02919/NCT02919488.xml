	<brief_title>The Effect of an Acute Bout of Exercise on High-sugar Meal Induced Endothelial Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endothelial dysfunction is due to an imbalance between vasodilating and vasoconstricting substances produced by the endothelium. An imbalance in these substances limits the ability of the blood vessel to relax in response to a shear stress stimulus. Endothelial dysfunction is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. High-sugar intakes result in postprandial hyperglycemia and endothelial dysfunction. Exercise may attenuate the endothelial dysfunction induced by a high-sugar meal. There are only two studies that have examined the effect of exercise on endothelial dysfunction induced by high-sugar intake. Both studies found that a bout of aerobic exercise attenuated the impaired flow mediated dilation induced by high-sugar ingestion. Neither study measured important markers of endothelial dysfunction such as blood nitric oxide, endothelin I, and angiotensin II concentrations, however. In addition, whether the same results apply to older post-menopausal women is unknown. Understanding how acute exercise affects meal-induced endothelial dysfunction in older women is important given that age is related to endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease.</detailed_description>
