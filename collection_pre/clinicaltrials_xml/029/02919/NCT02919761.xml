	<brief_summary>2 part multicenter study to examine the effect of Acthar in adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with persistently active disease. Part 1 is an Open Label Period in which all eligible subjects receive Acthar for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment with Acthar, subjects will be evaluated for treatment response using the DAS28-ESR. Subjects who have achieved low disease activity will enter a double-blind randomized maintenance period (Part 2) and be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Acthar or matching placebo for an additional 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
