	<brief_title>Motivational Instant Messaging and E-diabetes Prevention Programme for High Risk of Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will examine whether a wearable technology, combined with biofeedback, motivational messaging and an e-diabetes prevention programme, is effective in reducing weight and increasing physical activity after 12 months. The intervention will consist of a wearable technology and a smartphone application made available for a 12 month period. 22 online multimedia sessions targeting diet, physical activity and mental resilience delivered via the smartphone application. Motivational messaging based on the diabetes prevention module content and biofeedback will be sent to participants via the application. The control group will receive the wearable technology and will have access to a smartphone application detailing their activity. Participants will be directed to the same educational material as is made available via the multimedia sessions, but will not receive motivational messages.</detailed_description>
