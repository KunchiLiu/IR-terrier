	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of varying nitrate doses of beetroot juice supplementation on dynamic, multijoint resistance exercise performance in active, trained individuals. Performance will be assessed based on parameters including neuromuscular efficiency, anaerobic performance capability, oxygen consumption, plasma nitrate/nitrite levels, specific muscle tissue biomarkers including lactate, and anthropometric measurements of select muscle groups.</brief_summary>
