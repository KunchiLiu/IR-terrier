	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the modulatory effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on functional connectivity with the insula. Functional connectivity (FC) measures the interaction between brain regions, and recent neuroimaging studies have used FC to investigate how addiction affects FC among pertinent brain regions. rTMS, which can excite cortical neurons, has shown promise as a method to manipulate brain connectivity and could be used therapeutically to treat addiction. However, investigators first need more information on brain FC and how it relates to behavior, in order to guide rTMS target selection.</brief_summary>
