	<brief_title>Quality of Telemedically Guided Prehospital Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard emergency medical service (EMS) in Germany consists of a two-tiered system with ambulances (paramedics) and prehospital EMS physician units. For example, legal conditions restrict opioid-based analgesia to physicians. Based on pre-defined standards regional emergency dispatch centers deploy both kinds of emergency units. In recent years telemedicine emerged as a complementary system in EMS that may provide remote medical expertise and sustain or even improve quality of medical treatment on-scene. Particularly, based on the results of the projects Med-on-@ix and TemRas (telemedical rescue assistance system), emergency telemedical services were gradually implemented in daily routine of the EMS of the city of Aachen, Germany. In this retrospective study the quality and adverse events of analgesia by telemedically supported paramedics shall be compared to conventional treatment by on-scene EMS physicians in the EMS of the city of Aachen, Germany.</detailed_description>
