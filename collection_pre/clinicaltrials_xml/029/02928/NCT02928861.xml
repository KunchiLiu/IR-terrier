	<brief_title>18F-FDG PET/CT-based Prognostic Model for Predicting Outcome in Patients With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study investigators develop a prognostic model based on 18F-FDG PET/CT and test its ability for prognostic value in patients with DLBCL. PET/CT scans evaluation using the liver SUVmax as reference. Positive lesions in PET were indicated as SUVmax of residues higher than the threshold (1.6 fold of liver SUVmax) or new 18F-FDG avid lesions. 18F-FDG PET/CT-based prognostic model includes PET/CT image, dominant clinical and pathological prognostic factors to predicting disease progression during chemotherapy or survival in DLBCL.</detailed_description>
