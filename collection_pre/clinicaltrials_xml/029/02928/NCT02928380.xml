	<brief_summary>In this clinical study, an experimental denture adhesive with a precision tip nozzle will be tested to evaluate the relative efficacy to reduce the ingress of food under the denture compared to use of no adhesive or a standard marketed adhesive.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Experimental Denture Adhesive to Prevent Food Ingress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to explore the mass of food particle ingress when an adhesive is extruded through the new nozzle with directed application compared to the use of no adhesive and a marketed adhesive (extruded through a flat ribbon nozzle [FRN]) with standard application as per product label, utilizing a peanut occlusion methodology. This will be a single center, controlled, single blind (to the examiner performing the safety assessments (oral soft tissue [OST] examination) and the laboratory staff weighing the peanut particles), randomized, three-treatment, three-period, cross-over design in participants with full upper and lower dentures. Each treatment period will consist of one day of testing with at least two days between treatment visits. This study will consist four visits: Visit 1 - Screening Visit; Visit 2 - Treatment 1 Visit; Visit 3 - Treatment 2 Visit and Visit 4 - Treatment 3 Visit.</detailed_description>
