	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see what the patients perceptions are of the Coping Together manuals during the first 100 days after their Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT), and if they would make any changes to Coping Together manuals for future patients, caregivers and couples that use these manuals after their HSCT. The investigators would also like to see what is the caregiver's perception of this intervention, and to see if they have any suggestions for changes. If the caregiver is interested in providing feedback, they will sign a separate consent form.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A two-part, qualitative descriptive design will be employed to systematically adapt the Coping Together manuals based on recommendations of HSCT patients, CGs, dyads and clinicians (for Phase 1 only). For this study, CG is defined as spouse, partner, family member, friend, colleague, or neighbor who can, but do not necessarily live together, and provide uncompensated care. A dyad is defined as a combination of a patient and their designated CG. Dyads can review the Coping Together manuals individually or jointly, but will be interviewed together. Part 1 will capture diverse perspectives of HSCT patients, CGs, dyads and clinicians using individual (patients, CGs, clinicians) and dyadic (dyads) interviews for the preliminary adaptation of the Coping Together manuals. Part 2 will explore the experiences of HSCT patients, CGs and dyads with HSCT CT, which will be the HSCT-modified version of the Coping Together manuals, using individual (patients, CGs) and dyadic (dyads) interviews to refine the HSCT CT manuals.</detailed_description>
