	<brief_summary>Limitation of expiratory flows is considered as the main determiner of dynamic distension and dyspnoea in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The analysis of proximal and distal resistances should allow to better appreciate the functional impact. This study should also allow to specify the best parameters in respiratory functional explorations useful for the follow-up in COPD and to specify the relevance of functional indications other than the forced expiration volume at 1 second (FEV1) or the functional residual capacity (FRC) to estimate in a more relevant way the clinical improve with the increase of the therapeutic load (increase of posology, association of two bronchodilatators, addition of an anti-inflammatory drug, thus etc…) at already handled patients suffering from a persistent dyspnoea insufficiently relieved.</brief_summary>
