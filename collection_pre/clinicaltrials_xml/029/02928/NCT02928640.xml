	<brief_title>ClariCore Optical Biopsy System Used in TRUS (Trans-Rectal Ultrasound)-Guided Prostrate Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to collect information on prostrate tissue biopsies using the ClariCore System. The ClariCore system is designed to improve how the tissue samples are being collected from the prostrate by using light sensors (fiber optics) that can see changes in the tissue. Researchers will study the data collected from the light sensor (optical readings) to develop a method (like a mathematical equation) that can be used to tell the difference between normal and cancerous prostrate tissue during the biopsy. What the researchers are hoping to learn from this study is if a light guided biopsy procedure can improve the accuracy of prostrate biopsy sampling.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient scheduled for TRUSguided prostrate biopsy with or without MR TRUS Fusion determined based on standard of care requirements Prostrate volume â‰¥ 20cc and height at least 22mm (at the area(s) to be biopsied) as verified by ultrasound or prostrate MRI Patient, or authorized representative signs a written Informed Consent form to participate in the study, prior to any study mandated determinations or procedure Contraindications to TRUS prostrate biopsy Acute painful perianal disorder Surgical absence of a rectum or the presence of a rectal fistula Patients with contraindications to MRI (e.g., pacemaker, claustrophobia, etc.) (MR/TRUS only) Patients with renal dysfunction are excluded due to their inability to undergo contrast enhanced MRI Previous prostrate surgeries Prior pelvic irradiation Active inflammatory bowel disease within the last 6 months Any condition, or history of illness or surgery that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose additional risks to the patient (e.g., significant cardiovascular conditions or allergies) Patient has systemic infection or evidence of any surgical site infection (superficial or organ space), including active urinary tract infection Bladder cancer (current or prior) Symptomatic acute prostatitis Actively taking blood thinning agents (with the exception of low dose aspirin [81 mg] Plavix, Coumadin, etc.) or severe comorbidity prohibiting halting of anticoagulation therapies or history of bleeding disorder (e.g., coagulopathy Any malignancy other than nonmelanoma cell skin cancer, unless no evidence of disease for a minimum of 5 years Hormone therapy for locally advanced disease (except patients on 5alpha reductase inhibitors to reduce the size of the prostrate) Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy Salvage radical prostatectomy, i.e., patients having surgery due to failure of previous therapy (radiation, brachytherapy, cryotherapy, etc.) Patient has a compromised immune system or autoimmune disease (WBC &lt; 4000 or &gt; 20,000) Patient is not likely to comply with the followup evaluation schedule Patient is participating in a clinical trial of another investigational drug or device Patient is mentally incompetent or a prisoner</criteria>
