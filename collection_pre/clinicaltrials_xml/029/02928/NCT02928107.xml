	<brief_summary>The aim of this project is to develop evidence that can inform hearing health care best practices for adults between the ages of 65-75, and to determine what level of involvement by the primary care practitioner (PCP) is required to inform and encourage adults age 65-75 to follow through with routine hearing screening. The ultimate goal is to provide information to implement changes in health care policy to facilitate accessible and affordable hearing health care. This project will compare implementation of three PCP-based hearing screening strategies that include progressive levels of PCP time and guidance to complete telephone-based hearing screening.Those who fail screening go on to a medical referral study and receive (1) diagnostic audiological testing and (2) determination of the reliability and validity of identification of conditions that should require medical referral prior to hearing aid provision (called FDA 'Red Flag' conditions, including conditions such as sudden hearing loss, cerumen impaction, conductive hearing loss, dizziness, external deformity, ear drainage). Adults between the ages of 65-75 years old who are being seen for a routine appointment at a participating Duke primary care site may be eligible to participate. The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of subjects in Groups 1 and 2 who dial the phone number and complete the test at or within two months of their PCP visit, relative to Group 3. Secondary outcome measures will be the proportion of subjects in all groups who: a) schedule and b) complete the visit for diagnostic audiological testing, and subsequently, c) complete a plan for appropriate hearing loss intervention, if indicated, within four months of initial hearing screening. Physical exams and procedures associated with this study present no significant risk to the participant.These are conducted routinely in the clinical setting.There is the potential for loss of confidentiality.</brief_summary>
