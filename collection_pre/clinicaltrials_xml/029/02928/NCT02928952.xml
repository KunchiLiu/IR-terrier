	<brief_title>Mindful Stress Reduction in Diabetes Self-management Education for Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: One million Veterans (25%) who receive health care through Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes and are therefore responsible for daily diabetes self-management (DSM). DSM is essential for glycemic control and prevention of potentially life threatening and disabling complications such as severe hypoglycemia, kidney failure, acute coronary syndrome and stroke. Importantly, 40% of individuals with diabetes suffer from diabetes-related distress (DRD) that interferes with their ability to sustain healthy self-management behaviors, and may be particularly problematic for Veterans who are at higher risk for comorbid negative emotional states such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Diabetes self-management education (DSME) has traditionally contained little content or skill-building directly related to stress management, leaving this critical component of diabetes self-management largely unaddressed in DSME. In the investigators' pilot work, the investigators have developed a brief stress management intervention known as Mind-STRIDE, which contains mindfulness training and home practice and is easily integrated into existing DSME. While the investigators have previously demonstrated the feasibility, patient acceptability, and initial efficacy of Mind-STRIDE, its effects on diabetes-related psychological and physiological patient outcomes remain unknown. There is, therefore, a critical need to determine the efficacy of this targeted mindfulness intervention for improving DRD, diabetes self-efficacy, DSM behaviors, and metabolic control of Veterans with diabetes in order to offer comprehensive, evidence-based DSME that improves Veteran-centric diabetes outcomes. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to determine the efficacy of Mind-STRIDE for improving DRD, diabetes self-efficacy, DSM, and metabolic control, and to characterize distinctive Veteran experiences with DRD and Mind-STRIDE. Methods: To achieve these objectives, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 126 Veterans at a large VA medical center in southwest PA. Participants will be assigned to one of two study conditions: an experimental group that receives routine diabetes education plus Mind-STRIDE, or to a usual care group that receives diabetes education alone. DRD, diabetes self-efficacy, and DSM will be assessed using self-report questionnaires. Metabolic control (Hemoglobin A1c) will be assessed using standard laboratory procedures. Data will be collected at baseline, 12-weeks, and 24-weeks, and will be analyzed using mixed-effects models. Telephone interviews will be conducted at 15-weeks post-intervention in a subset of participants from the experimental group, and will be analyzed using modified Grounded Theory methods. Quantitative and qualitative findings will be compared and interpreted using Convergent Parallel Design. Status: The project team is completing study start up activities and will begin recruitment in October 2016.</detailed_description>
