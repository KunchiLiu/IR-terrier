	<brief_summary>To evaluate the effects of a knee flexion Dynasplint orthosis on knee flexion angle after a total knee arthroplasty. Sixty participants, who underwent a total knee arthroplasty, were randomly assigned in two groups: control group and Dynasplint group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Dynamic Splinting on Knee Flexion Angle After Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-surgical rehabilitation interventions following total knee arthroplasty consist mainly of stretching exercises to improve flexibility and prevent soft tissue fibroses around the joint, thus, avoiding contractures and providing increases in the range of motion at the knee joint. Although knee manipulation and open arthrolysis may improve range of motion after total knee arthroplasty , the results have been variable and additional procedures are frequently necessary. Studies demonstrated the effectiveness of dynamic orthoses in reducing joint contractures after orthopedic surgeries in various joints that require a long rehabilitation period. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the knee flexion Dynasplint orthosis (KFD) on the length of rehabilitation and range of knee flexion angle after total knee arthroplasty.</detailed_description>
