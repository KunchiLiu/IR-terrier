	<brief_summary>This study is evaluating how ruxolitinib affects premalignant breast cells. One half of the study participants will receive ruxolitinib for approximately 15 days, and the other half will receive a placebo (sugar pill) for approximately 15 days. Once study participants have completed their ruxolitinib or placebo, participants will undergo surgery to remove the premalignant breast tissue.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Have a breast biopsy showing ADH (atypical ductal hyperplasia), ALH (atypical lobular hyperplasia), LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ), or DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) requiring surgical excision. NOTE: Tissue from the diagnostic biopsy must be accessible/available for research correlates (i.e., a tissue block or ~10 unstained slides). Due to the nature of the study, fewer slides may be accepted with prior permission from the Protocol Chair if there is insufficient tissue. Women and men age 18 and older. Adequate hematologic and organ function, defined as follows: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Platelet levels &gt;200 x 109/L Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x institutional ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 x institutional ULN Creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min as calculated by the CockroftGault method Willing to not use concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors as this could interfere with the metabolism of ruxolitinib (i.e azole antifungals, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, mibefradil, nefazodone, protease inhibitors, telithromycin). Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to starting therapy. The effects of ruxolitinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because class C agents are potentially teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents within 30 days of enrollment. Participants with current or previous history of invasive breast cancer. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, end stage renal disease (ESRD), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant or nursing women are excluded from this study HIVpositive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ruxolitinib. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated. Prior or current treatment with a JAK inhibitor, for any indication. Known Hepatitis B or C participants</criteria>
