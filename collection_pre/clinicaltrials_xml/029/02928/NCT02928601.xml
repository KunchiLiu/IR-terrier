	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effect of prophylactic ondansetron on the incidence of spinal hypotension and vasopressor consumption in caesarean section patients using norepinephrine treatment. Half of participants receive ondansetron before spinal anesthesia while the other half receive saline.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Norepinephrine Consumption After Prophylactic Ondansetron</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal hypotension in cesarean section patients can occur vigorously and may lead to cardiovascular collapse. If doesn't treated precipitously, It can cause maternal hypotension, nausea and vomiting and fetal acidosis. Recently norepinephrine has been proposed for the prevention and treatment of spinal hypotension with less tendency to decrease HR and CO. It has been reported that ondansetron can be used for prophylaxis and treatment of nausea and vomiting, may also reduce the vasopressor requirement in patients undergoing caesarean section with spinal anesthesia. The aim of the present study is to assess the effect of prophylactic ondansetron on norepinephrine consumption and incidence of spinal hypotension, and side effects such as maternal nausea, vomiting and bradycardia.</detailed_description>
