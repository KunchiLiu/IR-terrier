	<brief_title>The Associations Between Sedentary Behaviour and Impact Characteristics on Bone Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significant proportions of adults engage in sedentary behaviour for prolonged periods of time which is generally regarded as having deleterious effects on health. However, far less is known about its specific effects on bone health. Exercise has been proposed as a method of improving bone health, as impact forces generated as the foot contacts the ground during physical activity have the potential to aid bone maintenance and development. The properties of bone are regulated through the amount mechanical loading, frequency of loading and duration of loading endured, which can create an osteogenic effect. These variables can be quantified via accelerometry which records the magnitude, rate and duration of accelerations experienced at the site on the body where the accelerometer is worn. Although there is a vast amount of literature where accelerometers have been used to monitor physical activity, there is a lack of studies that use accelerometers to determine the most effective exercise for bone, especially in relation to the lumbar spine. Exploring the bone health and loading characteristics of sedentary and low and highly active non-sedentary individuals will provide evidence upon which to base future interventions that are likely to be of benefit for bone health in sedentary populations.</detailed_description>
