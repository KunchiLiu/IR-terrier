	<brief_title>Low Pulse Amplitude Seizure Therapy (LAP-ST Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is hypothesized to increase stimulation focality, thus minimizing cognitive side effects compared to conventional ECT. The study will enroll 22 patients recruited from the Behman Hospital, Cairo, Egypt. Patients referred to ECT service in the Behman Hospital who are clinically indicated to do ECT for major depressive episode of a mood disorder or psychotic episode of a primary psychotic disorder will be approached. Eligible participants who signed informed consent will be included to receive a course of Right Unilateral Ultrabrief LAP-ST.</detailed_description>
