	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a clinical training intervention utilizing standardized patient actors to improve communication and interpersonal skills of health care workers who serve HIV-infected adolescents and youth in Kenya, resulting in increased engagement in HIV care. The effect of the intervention on retention in care will be evaluated in a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial at 24 HIV care and treatment facilities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Actor Training to Improve HIV Services for Adolescents in Kenya</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adolescents and youth have the highest HIV incidence rates compared to any other age strata. Inadequate provision of accessible and acceptable HIV testing, counseling, and treatment services has been cited as a barrier to uptake of and retention in HIV care in this population. The "SPEED" study aims to develop and evaluate a clinical training intervention utilizing Standardized Patient (SP) actors to improve communication and interpersonal skills of health care workers (HCWs) who work with adolescents and youth (ages 10-24), resulting in increased engagement in HIV care in Kenya. This intervention includes a series of role plays between HCW participants and professional Kenyan actors, followed by feedback and debriefing sessions. The hypothesis is that SP encounters will increase HCW confidence and capacity to facilitate HIV status disclosure and provide supportive interactions with HIV-infected youth, which will in turn increase uptake and improve retention in HIV services among adolescents and youth. The pilot phase (Aim 1) will consist of developing patient case scripts specific to adolescent HIV-related care and counseling needs and establishing HCW competency scores. To evaluate the intervention, a cluster randomized controlled stepped-wedge trial will be conducted in 24 HIV care and treatment facilities to assess the impact of SP encounters on the proportion of adolescents and youth patients retained in care at HIV treatment facilities in Kenya (Aim 2). Finally, the cost effectiveness and cost utility of the SP intervention will be determined (Aim 3). The estimated study duration is five years. The primary outcomes from Aim 1 are final scripts and pass/fail scores for use in SP encounters. The primary outcome for the randomized controlled trial (RCT) (Aim 2) is retention in care among HIV-positive adolescents and youth, based on electronic medical records data. Secondary outcomes will include satisfaction (patients and HCWs), HCW competency in youth- friendly counseling, antiretroviral therapy adherence, and viral suppression. For the cost effectiveness and cost utility analyses (Aim 3), the cost per additional HIV-infected adolescent/youth retained in care and the cost per additional life year saved and disability-adjusted life averted will be estimated.</detailed_description>
