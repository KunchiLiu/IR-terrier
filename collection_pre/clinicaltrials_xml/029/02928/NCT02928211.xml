	<brief_summary>Single center, open-label study for which each cohort is defined according to the number of administrations of the medical imaging agent, Aftobetin-HCl received. The medical imaging agent (the ointment) is applied to the cornea and time to detection of optimal fluorescence (amyloid burden) in the lens of the eye is determined. This will be measured by the Sapphire II device in subjects who are cognitively normal, or have mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's Disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aftobetin-HCl and Fluorescence Detection Measured by Sapphire II to Determine the Number and Timing of Administrations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single center, open label study. 35-50 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will undergo the following procedures: - Complete physical and neurologic examination (Screening) - Neuropsychological testing (Screening) - Ophthalmologic examination (Screening and Visit 3 - Safety follow up visit) - Administration of ointment - 1 or 2 administrations (Visit 1) - Sapphire II Fluorescent Eye Measurements (Visit 1 &amp; 2): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hours (+/-10 minutes) and 24 hours (+/- 2 hours) after last ointment administration - Amyvid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Amyloid Scan (at Screening for cognitively normal subjects and Visit 4 for MCI and mild AD subjects) Subjects will also be asked to participate in an elective second Sapphire II assessment to assess its reproducibility. Repeatability testing is optional and will require a separate consent. Subject will come back for Visit 5 (ointment administration and eye scans), Visit 6 (24 hour scan), and Visit 7 (follow up safety assessment).</detailed_description>
