	<brief_summary>Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor. This is the immunosuppression of reference for patients undergoing a first liver transplant. This treatment can prevent graft rejection, but can cause side effects including kidney failure (in 25% after the first year). Everolimus is an immunosuppressive that effectively prevents acute rejection in heart and kidney transplant recipients. It preserves renal function when it is started soon after the transplant, i.e. before a severe dysfunction is installed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>De Novo Everolimus Versus Tacrolimus in Combination With Mofetil Mycophenolate and Low Dose Corticosteroids to Reduce Tacrolimus Induced Nephrotoxicity in Liver Transplantation: a Prospective, Multicentric, Randomised Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the liver transplant, early interruption of calcineurin inhibitors with a quick relay everolimus monotherapy preserves renal function and is associated with a lower acute rejection rate. We wish to assess whether the introduction of a de novo immunosuppression everolimus under protection of basiliximab induction, mycophenolate mofetil and then low doses of corticosteroids, reduces the nephrotoxicity of immunosuppressive therapy in liver transplant patients, compared to a standard protocol with tacrolimus associated with mycophenolate mofetil and low dose corticosteroids.</detailed_description>
