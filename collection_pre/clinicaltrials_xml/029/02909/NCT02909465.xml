	<brief_summary>Ketamine is the cornerstone of procedural sedation in emergency department but ketamine induced agitation has limited its usage by many physicians. As a solution, some propose using midazolam or haloperidol before ketamine injection. In this randomized double blind clinical trial, patients who are eligible for sedation by ketamine are allocated in 3 groups. In first group, the patients will receive 0.05 mg/kg midazolam, in second group 5 mg of haloperidol and in 3rd group a placebo five minutes before receiving the sedative dose of ketamine (1 mg/kg). The patients are assessed for agitation during and after the procedure the clinician's satisfaction with sedation instrument is evaluated after the procedure.</brief_summary>
