	<brief_title>MaxART: Early Access to ART for All in Swaziland</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical evidence in support of offering antiretroviral treatment (ART) for all HIV-positive individuals to improve patient health outcomes and reduce HIV incidence is building, and the resource-limited countries where this approach could have the biggest impact want to evaluate if this is a feasible and effective intervention to turn the course of their HIV epidemics. The MaxART Early Access to ART for All (EAAA) implementation study was designed to determine the feasibility, acceptability, clinical outcomes, affordability, and scalability of offering early antiretroviral treatment to all HIV-positive individuals in Swaziland's government-managed health system. This is a 3-year randomized stepped wedge design with open enrollment for all adults 18 years and older across 14 rural health facilities in Swaziland's Hhohho Region. Primary endpoints are retention and viral suppression. Secondary endpoints include ART initiation, adherence, drug resistance, tuberculosis, HIV disease progression, and cost per patient per year. Sites are grouped to transition two at a time from the control (standard of care) to intervention (EAAA) stage at each 4-month step. This balanced design will result in approximately one half of the observations being under an intervention clinic, and the other half under control. Power calculations were conservatively based on the estimated number of individuals expected to enroll in the study comparing the first 12-month measure of retention and 6-month of viral suppression on ART of those entering clinics during their control stage versus those that will be entering a clinic during intervention period. A strategic mix of multidisciplinary research methodologies will be applied to meet the study aim, including implementation science, social science research, economic evaluations, and HIV incidence modeling.</detailed_description>
