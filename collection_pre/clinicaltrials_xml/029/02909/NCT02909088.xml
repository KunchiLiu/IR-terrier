Suffer from irregular heart rate or seizures 8. Subjects who are pregnant or nursing an infant. 9. Subject with a MADRS ≥ 14 10. Breastfeeding a child during the course of the study or for one month following completion 11. It is the investigator's opinion that the subject poses a significant suicide risk by the following criteria: 1. It is the investigator's opinion that the subject may be at risk of suicide. 2. the subject responds "yes" to question #4 (Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent) on the Baseline Visit of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS), if the most recent episode occurred within the past 12 months.</criteria>
