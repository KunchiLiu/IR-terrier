	<brief_summary>Electronic activity monitoring (EAM) devices are wearable electronic devices that monitor functional activity and provide personal feedback on activity progression. This study aims to determine if EAM can provide an objective, assessment of patient functional activity. The study will also examine the change in functional activity experienced by patients during the first cycle of chemotherapy. Another objective of the study will be to see if baseline functional activity and the change in functional activity that occurs during the first cycle of chemotherapy can be used to predict patient tolerability of subsequent cycles of chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
