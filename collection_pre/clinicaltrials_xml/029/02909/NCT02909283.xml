	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate determinants of cerebral oxygenation and perfusion at the microcirculatory level in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) using combined novel investigational tools: Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) perfusion MR (Magnetic Resonnance) imaging, brain Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) and red blood cell (RBC) rheological properties.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sickle Cell Anemia and Cerebral Microcirculation : Multimodal Exploration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that brain perfusion and/or oxygenation modifications may be evidenced in SCA children who have no microarteriopathy and may correlate with hemorheological abnormalities and impaired vasomotion. A multimodal approach designed to study a. cerebral perfusion and oxygenation, b. flow motion properties and c. blood rheological parameters might help to describe the different processes involved in cerebral ischemia.</detailed_description>
