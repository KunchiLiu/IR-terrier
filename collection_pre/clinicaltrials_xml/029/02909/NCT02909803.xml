	<brief_title>Measuring the Glycemic Index and Tracking Metabolites of New and Emerging Lentil Varieties</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall aim of this work is to produce credible evidence for substantiating a food health claim for post prandial blood glucose lowering by lentil. Although several studies have shown that lentil consumption results in a lowering of post prandial blood glucose, it is not known whether different lentil varieties have the same efficacy. Similarly, the carbohydrate component of lentils responsible for lowering blood glucose is not known, nor is the bioavailability of lentil metabolites and polyphenol bioactive. The investigators hypothesize that the slowly digestible starch content of lentil is inversely related to in vivo glycemic response. The specific aims of this study are: (i) to identify the putative component(s) in lentil that might account for its blood glucose lowering effect, and (ii) to identify differences in blood glucose reduction among lentil varieties. These aims will be achieved in a three-step process. Firstly, in vitro studies will be pursued to determine the carbohydrate fractions of 20 new and emerging Canadian lentil varieties. Secondly, these results will be used to choose 8 lentil varieties with different slowly digestible starch content for a human Glycemic Index study. Thirdly, identification of lentil metabolites will be achieved by collecting extra capillary blood (200uL)and urine samples at fasting and 120min for measurement of polyphenols and metabolites using established HPLC and metabolomics techniques.</detailed_description>
