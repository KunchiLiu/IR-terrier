	<brief_title>Study Safety and Effectiveness of CURVE Laser Therapy for Circumference Reduction of the Waistline.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involves research to obtain information on the CURVE. In recent years Low Level Laser therapy devices have grown in popularity due to increased scientific understanding of their mechanism of action, published research, and patients demand for more non-invasive procedures in body contour and fat reduction. LLL are widely used in health clinics, medical spas and in aesthetic medicine in the treatment of cellulite and for inflammatory conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome. This study will further evaluate the effectiveness of low-level laser treatments without the extraction of adipose tissue using liposuction or in combination with other treatment modalities.</detailed_description>
