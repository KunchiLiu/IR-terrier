	<brief_summary>This research will focus on young women between the ages of 18-38 who underwent a heart operation and their life experiences. This research will focus on these life events and the paradigm of these women being raised as "heart sick," and consequently lacking self-esteem (Frigiola, Bull, &amp; Wray, 2014; Hickey et al., 2012). Most qualitative studies focusing on the quality of life compare men and women, completely ignoring women's body image and the experience of womanhood (Hickey et al., 2012; Hövels-Gürich et al., 2007; Sarikouch, et al., 2013). This study aims to focus on women's stories about their life experiences and the influence of surgery(ies) on their daily life using an the qualitative phenomenological approach.</brief_summary>
