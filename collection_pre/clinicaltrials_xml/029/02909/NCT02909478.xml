	<brief_summary>Addition of aprepitant, an NK1 receptor antagonist to a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone regimen was shown to be effective for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). Little is known about the efficacy of aprepitant when used without dexamethasone. Dexamethasone is widely used to prevent both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy. However, multi-period use of dexamethasone could be associated with side effect, such as hyperglycemia, dyspepsia and insomnia. This randomized phase III trial studies antiemetic therapy with aprepitant and tropisetron to see how well they work compared to dexamethasone plus tropisetron in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with colorectal cancer receiving FOLFOX(oxaliplatin, leuvovorin and 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
