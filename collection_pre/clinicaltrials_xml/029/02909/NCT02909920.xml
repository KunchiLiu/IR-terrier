Telerehabilitation program describes the exercises to be performed, the number of repetitions depending on the level of training and criteria for progression. Patients are initially supervised by a physiotherapist who will conduct three training sessions through individual videoconference, to ensure proper execution of exercises and encourage patient adherence.
