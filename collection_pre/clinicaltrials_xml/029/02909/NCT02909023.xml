	<brief_summary>Activation of the immune system against a pathogen can be considered one of the most effective interventions in the field of infectious diseases. Transgene is developing a therapeutic vaccine "TG1050" for the treatment of patients with chronic and treated Hepatitis B. This biotherapy compound is for the development of T cellular immune response in these patients in order to achieve the total elimination of infected cells. Therefore it is necessary to have measures of ways to assess accurately and reliably the presence of such a response in the study subjects.</brief_summary>
