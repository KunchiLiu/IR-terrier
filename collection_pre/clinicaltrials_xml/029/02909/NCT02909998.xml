	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Chronic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic arthritis in children and in adults represent a public health problem in number and difficulty of treatment. 30% of patients are non-responders and / or relapse upon discontinuation of treatment. Some of these treatments are not always well tolerated, sometimes with infectious complications including tuberculosis limiting the use of biological therapies. This study will validate a battery of genetic markers to predict responders biotherapy, determine the prognosis of patients, these treatments are reserved for the most severe forms, and thus improve the care of patients.</detailed_description>
