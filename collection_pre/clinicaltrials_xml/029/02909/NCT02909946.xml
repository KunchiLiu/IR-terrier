	<brief_summary>Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are endemic in nursing homes (NHs) with prevalence rates surpassing those in hospitals. The aim of the study is to design and evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention to reduce new acquisition of MDROs in NH residents. The intervention will incorporate resident-level, environmental, and caregiver based strategies. Using a cluster-randomized study design, three NHs will be randomized to the intervention group and three to the control group. Control NHs will be allowed to continue standard infection prevention practices. Nursing homes will serve as the unit of allocation. Analyses will be performed both at the resident and the cluster level. The primary outcomes of the study are reduction in MDRO prevalence, and reduction in new MDRO acquisition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The NH intervention will incorporate resident-level, environmental, and caregiver based strategies, including: a. Standard precautions and hand hygiene for care of all residents. Enhanced barrier precautions including hand hygiene, glove use, and gown use for healthcare workers when providing activities of daily living (ADL) assistance for residents at highest-risk (caregiver intervention); b. Hand hygiene education to residents and families (resident-level intervention); c. Standardized bathing practices including using chlorhexidine-based cloths to reduce resident MDRO colonization (resident-level intervention); d. Standardized environmental protocol and education to reduce contamination on inanimate objects and surfaces (environmental intervention); e. Feedback monthly of facility-level microbial data and new MDRO acquisition rates to infection preventionists, front-line healthcare personnel, and facility leadership (facility intervention).</detailed_description>
