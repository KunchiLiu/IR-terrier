	<brief_summary>This prospective, non-therapeutic study will determine whether a novel imaging technique can identify presumptive tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) in patients with ocular tumours. In this study, we will modify the standard angiography protocol by having patients return twice in the week following angiography for additional photographs. Photographs will be obtained 2-7 days after angiography, but without further injection of dye. This technique contrasts with normal angiography in which photographs are taken during the transit phase of dye circulation and in the minutes thereafter. Of note, both the dye and the cameras used for its detection have been approved for clinical use for several decades and are routinely used in the evaluation of patients with ocular tumours. We will evaluate 5 groups: 1. Choroidal nevus (low-risk features): requires distinction from melanoma through diagnostic testing 2. Choroidal indeterminate melanocytic lesion (high-risk features): requires diagnostic testing for identification and distinction from nevus and melanoma 3. Choroidal melanoma: requires confirmation of diagnosis and evaluation for potential metatstases 4. Suspected metastatic tumour (ie, primary tumour elsewhere): requires identification of primary tumour 5. Locally treated ocular tumours: requires followup to evaluate response to treatment and potential change or repeat therapy</brief_summary>
