	<brief_title>ACURATE Neo™ AS Aortic Bioprosthesis for Implantation Using the ACURATE neoTM AS TF Transfemoral Delivery System in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single arm, prospecitve, multicenter, non-randomized and open trial. The purpose of this trial is to collect and safety and performance data concerning the ACURATE neo™ AS Aortic Bioprosthesis and ACURATE neo™ AS TF Transfemoral Delivery System The ACURATE neo™ AS Aortic Bioprosthesis and ACURATE neo™ AS TF Transfemoral Delivery SystemACURATE neo™ are intended for use in minimally invasive, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using transfemoral access in patients presenting with severe aortic valve stenosis. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and performance of the study device in patients presenting with severe aortic stenosis (AS) considered to be high risk for surgery. The secondary objective is to evaluate adverse events and study device performance.</detailed_description>
