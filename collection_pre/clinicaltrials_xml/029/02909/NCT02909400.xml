	<brief_summary>Mitochondrial Diseases are rare, progressive, multi-system, often-early fatal disorders affecting both children and adults. KH176 is a novel chemical entity currently under development for the treatment of inherited mitochondrial diseases, including MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes), MIDD (Maternally Inherited Diabetes and Deafness), Leigh's Disease and LHON (Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy). The current Proof of Concept study aims to explore the effects of treatment with KH176 for 4 weeks on clinical signs and symptoms and biomarkers of mitochondrial disease and to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of KH176 in patients with m.3242A&gt;G related mitochondrial disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The KHENERGY Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial will be a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-centre, two-way cross-over trial. Twenty patients, with a confirmed mitochondrial DNA tRNALeu(UUR) m.3243A&gt;G mutation and with clinical signs of mitochondrial disease, will be randomized over 2 groups (active or placebo first). After a screening period and a training session, each group will have 2 dosing periods of 28 days, with a washout period of at least 28 days in between. On these occasions, patients will receive 100 mg KH176 twice daily (treatment A) or a matching placebo (treatment B) twice daily for 28 days. Clinical assessments will be performed once in a training session prior to baseline, at baseline and in week 4 post dosing during each treatment phase (A and B). Testing conditions and circumstances, with respect to timing of the assessments, hospitalization and meals, will be standardized for each assessement period. Furthermore, assessments of biomarkers for mitochondrial functioning, pharmacokinetics and specific safety assessments will be performed weekly.</detailed_description>

Willingness to use adequate contraceptive methods (male and female) and negative urine pregnancy test (females) at screening and first baseline assessment. 11. Able and willing to refrain from the use of (multi)vitamins, coenzyme Q10, Vitamine E, riboflavin, and antioxidant supplements (and idebenone/EPI743), as well as any medication negatively influencing mitochondrial functioning (including but not limited to valproic acid, glitazones, statins, antivirals, amiodarone, and NSAID's) as well as any strong Cytochrome P450 inhibitors (all 'conazolesantifungals', HIV antivirals, grapefruit) and strong Cytochrome P450 inducers (a.o. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicine, St Johns wort, pioglitazone, troglitazone) as well as any medication known to affect cardiac repolarization (all antipsychotics, several antidepressants: nor/amytriptilline, fluoxetine, antiemetics: domperidone (motilium) granisetron, ondansetron). 1. Motoric abnormalities other than related to the mitochondrial disease interfering with the outcome parameters. 2. CPEO patients with clinical signs and symptoms restricted to the eye only 3. Heteroplasmy level as measured in urine &lt; 20% 4. Poor nutritional state as judged by the investigator 5. Body Mass Index (BMI) not within 18.030.0 kg/m2 at screening. 6. History of cancer 7. Surgery or active illness of gastrointestinal tract that might interfere with absorption. 8. Participation in a trial of an investigational product in the preceding 3 months prior to the first dose or during this trial. 9. Positive drug, alcohol or cotinine test at screening and/or admission (Day 1 of the first dosing period). 10. Clinically relevant abnormal laboratory, ECG recordings, cardiac echo (within 1 year prior to screening), vital signs or physical or mental findings at screening as judged by the Investigator. 11.

Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction &lt;45% 15. History or family history of congenital Long QT syndrome 16. Increased or decreased potassium (local laboratory normal range) 17. Inadequate contraception use, pregnancy or breast feeding (females) 18. Clinically significant presence or history of allergy as judged by the Investigator. 19. History of hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to any of the components of the investigational drug. 20. Within 4 weeks prior to dosing, the use of: (multi)vitamins, coenzyme Q10, Vitamine E, riboflavin, and antioxidant supplements (and idebenone/EPI743), as well as any medication negatively influencing mitochondrial functioning (including but not limited to valproic acid, glitazones, statins, antivirals, amiodarone, and NSAID's) as well as any strong Cytochrome P450 inhibitors (all 'conazolesantifungals', HIV antivirals, grapefruit) and strong Cytochrome P450 inducers (a.o. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, St Johns wort, pioglitazone, troglitazone) as well as any medication known to affect cardiac repolarization (all antipsychotics, several antidepressants: nor/amitriptyline, fluoxetine, antiemetics: domperidone (motilium) granisetron, ondansetron) as well as any medication metabolized by Cytochrome P450 with a narrow therapeutical width.
