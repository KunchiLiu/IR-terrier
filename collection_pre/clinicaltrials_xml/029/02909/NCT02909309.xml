	<brief_title>Pilot Study : New Sensors to Monitor Apnea During Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2016 , monitoring of propofol sedation , currently recommended by the American Society of Anaesthesiology and European companies includes among others, a pulse oximeter (SpO2) and a continuous measurement of CO2 exhaled by an appropriate device (CapnoLine). This monitoring does not allow to anticipate the occurrence of obstructive apnea . The anticipation of the occurrence of apnea or airway obstruction using this type of monitoring could allow the anesthesiologist to act earlier on the titration of propofol and maintaining the airway. This would avoid the side effects associated with hypoxemia and hypercapnia and therefore further improve patient safety . This pilot study tests the JAWAC system to detect those apneas. This is an interventional diagnostic study on the JAWAC monitoring system validation in a prospective cohort of patients undergoing sedation in order to provoke sleep apnea. Indeed , sedation technique is already used with propofol during snoring provocation tests in patients at risk for sleep apnea.</detailed_description>
