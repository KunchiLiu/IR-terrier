The endoscopic care of the treatment of pancreatic collections post-surgery is not yet standardized. After failure of the medical treatment, the drainage of collections by echo-endoscopy was described. There are not much series on this specific subject. Only 2 series contain more than 20 patients with 31 patients for the most important. The timing and the technical choice of the endoscopic treatment as well as the long-term follow-up are not clear. The purpose of this study is to estimate the success and the complications of the endoscopic drainage by echo-endoscopy according to the techniques of drainage and the timing of the endoscopic treatment. The not estimated long-term follow-up will be also considered.</brief_summary>
