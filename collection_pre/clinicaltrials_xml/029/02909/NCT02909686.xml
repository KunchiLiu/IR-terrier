	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this protocol is to test if Gulf War Illness (GWI) involves chronic inflammation that cannot be measured with typical techniques. The investigators will be observing the effects of nine different botanical compounds (supplements) that are known to suppress inflammation. If one of those supplements helps the symptoms of GWI, it will give the investigators information about what is wrong in people with GWI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Botanical Microglia Modulators in Gulf War Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is still a poor understanding of the pain, fatigue, and other symptoms that affect approximately 250,000 veterans. The precise mechanism of Gulf War Illness (GWI) is not understood, and there is no targeted treatment for the condition. A current model for GWI points to the central nervous system, immune cells, called microglia that may be hyperactive in patients with GWI. Discovering effective treatments for this disorder is a top priority of GWI research. Given the investigator's preliminary data, it is suspected that GWI is a form of low-level neuroinflammation that involves hypersensitivity of receptors on microglia. In order to help test that hypothesis, the investigators will be administering supplements that have been shown in vitro or animal in vivo to suppress microglia function in a way that is anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective. If any of these agents suppress symptoms in GWI, it will give the investigators important information about the disease that may allow for creation of better diagnostic tools and treatments in future research studies. Observing the effects of the selected nine anti-inflammatory botanical compounds, in this clinical study, is a strong compliment to the ongoing mechanistic GWI research.</detailed_description>
