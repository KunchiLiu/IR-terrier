	<brief_summary>Reduced quality of vision and glare in twilight or night are frequently mentioned complaints within the optometric examination. A reason for these problems could be a myopic refractive shift in dark light conditions, commonly known as night myopia or twilight myopia. The aim of this study was to investigate whether quality of vision in twilight or night could be improved by a spectacle correction optimized for mesopic light conditions. Moreover, objective refraction in large pupils measured by aberrometry was compared to subjective mesopic refraction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Night Spectacle Correction Concerning an Improvement of Mesopic Vision Quality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After obtaining informed consent, aberrometry was performed in a darkened room (0.1 lux). Subjective photopic refraction and visual acuity were measured before light was turned off and mesopic refraction was obtained after a dark adaptation period of five minutes. Finally, frames and lenses were fitted by a centration system. Lens grinding was executed centralized by a grinding workshop. In the course of this study, subjects were randomly assigned to wear two glasses double-masked in turn. One with photopic subjective refraction data and another with mesopic subjective refraction data. Both were worn for 14 Â± 2 days each. Follow Up 1: After two weeks, participants were asked for their subjective experiences with the first correction by a visual analogue scale questionnaire. After the evaluation, glasses were changed. Follow Up 2: Two weeks later, subjective experiences were evaluated again. After visual analogue scale questionnaire, subjects were asked to compare the two glasses concerning quality of mesopic vision and subjective safety level during night driving.</detailed_description>
