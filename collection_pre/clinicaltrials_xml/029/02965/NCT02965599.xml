	<brief_summary>GSK3117391 has the potential to complement existing therapies in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral GSK3117391 (Dose A) administered to subjects with severe RA despite treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). This is a randomised, double-blind (sponsor open), multicentre, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. The total maximum study duration is approximately 10 weeks. Following a screening period of up to 28 days, subjects will be randomized (1:1) to placebo or GSK3117391 (Dose A) administered orally for a period of 28 days. Subjects will be followed up for 7 to 14 days post final dose. Approximately 40 subjects with severe RA will be randomised into the study.</brief_summary>

Subjects with past history of granulomatous disease eg. leprosy, sarcoidosis. Subjects with current symptoms of severe, progressive, or uncontrolled renal, hepatic, haematological (including clotting disorders), gastrointestinal (including gastrooesophageal ulcers), pulmonary, cardiac (including ischemic heart disease), neurological, or cerebral disease, or other medical conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might place the subject at unacceptable risk for participation in this study.
