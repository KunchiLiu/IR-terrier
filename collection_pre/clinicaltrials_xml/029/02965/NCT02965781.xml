	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of SADBE in the prevention of recurrent herpes labialis in adults. Two-thirds of the participants will receive a SADBE solution, while the other third will receive only the vehicle as a placebo control. The solutions will be administered topically to the patient's arms. The study will compare a single-arm application versus a two-arm application versus two placebo doses on the arm.</brief_summary>

History of malignancy (except patients with surgically cured basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers) History of organ transplantation HIVpositive status determined by history at screening or known history of any other immunosuppressive disease. Severe comorbidities (diabetes mellitus requiring insulin, CHF (EF&lt;50% at baseline will be exclusionary) MI, CVA or TIA within 3 months of screening visit, unstable angina pectoris, oxygendependent severe pulmonary disease History of exposure to squaric acid or squaric acid dibutyl ester. Known hypersensitivity to DMSO Any condition judged by the investigator to cause this clinical trial to be detrimental to the patient. Subject is currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial(s), or subject has received other investigational agent(s) within 28 days of baseline visit.
