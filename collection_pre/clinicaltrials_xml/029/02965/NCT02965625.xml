	<brief_summary>Human epicardial fat is the true visceral fat depot of the heart, and its regional distribution and physiology is of growing scientific and clinical interest. This study aims to characterize the expression profile and function of the epicardial and pericardial adipose tissue compartments of the heart (EAT and PAT). EAT and PAT adipose biopsies will be obtained from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) or valve replacement surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization of Epicardial and Pericardial Adipose Tissue in Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) stretches from the myocardium to the visceral layer of the pericardium. Adipose located on the outside of the visceral pericardium to the external site of the pericardium is called the pericardial adipose tissue (PAT), and is of a separate origin than EAT. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the global expression profile of the EAT and PAT compartments, in addition to characterizing the function, structure, metabolic and inflammatory profile. Furthermore, this study will determine whether CABG and valve replacement patients display different EAT and PAT characteristics</detailed_description>
