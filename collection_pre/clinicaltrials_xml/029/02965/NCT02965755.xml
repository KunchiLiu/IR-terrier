	<detailed_description>The goal of this research study is to determine if we can obtain personalized genetic information from a subject's blood sample that is similar to that obtained from a tumor tissue sample, and if we can use that information to make treatment suggestions. As tumor samples can be difficult to collect, we hope to be able to collect similar genetic information from blood or urine samples that we find in tumor tissue. Ultimately, we hope to identify genes important to cancer cells that could potentially identify standard-of-care or research-based recommendations for therapy.</detailed_description>
