	<brief_summary>Total joint replacement is an efficacious treatment for osteoarthritis of hips and knees. Both total knee replacement (TKR) and total hip replacements (THR) have excellent implant survivorship. However, patients' satisfaction is lower in TKR than THR. A possible cause of the discrepancy is the unnatural knee kinematics after TKR. Various implants designs have been developed to solve the problem. However, most of their designs are based on experimental data and little has been studied about their kinematics in vivo. In this study, we will analyze the in vivo kinematics of the Global Medacta Knee Sphere (GMK Sphere) implant and compare it with a well documented design and implant (Nexgen Cruciate Retaining (CR), Zimmer Biomet). We assume our study will contribute the development of more satisfying knee implants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Kinematics of Contemporary Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Worldwide the number of patients requiring treatment for osteoarthritis is increasing. Especially the young population will increase within the group of patients for arthroplasty. Learmonth describes hip arthroplasty as the "operation of the century" because patients are highly satisfied with pain relief and function after the procedure. Knee arthroplasties have in recent years also shown promising results and have surpassed hip arthroplasty in frequency in western countries. However, patient satisfaction is not as high . Reported problems are insufficient function and persistent pain on the other hand, knee arthroplasties are increasingly implanted in younger and more active patients who require high function and quality of life. Improvement of knee implants is an urgent issue in the field of orthopedic research. Small alterations in implant design can influence the survival of implants, but also the function of the implants in vivo. The final design of the GMK Sphere has been introduced in 2012. Knee kinematics and implant designs A possible cause of lower function of replaced knees is the unnatural postoperative knee kinematics. Kinematics of replaced knees is closely related to their function. For example, replaced knees with excellent flexion angles have kinematic similarities to normal knees and malalignments of implants can cause postoperative pain. Compared to hip joints which are simple ball-and socket joints, the kinematics of knee joints is more complex. It is a combination of rolling and gliding motion of femoral condyles and rotation of tibia. Based on the kinematics of the normal knee joint, various attempts have been made on the design of knee implants to reconstruct normal kinematics after replacement surgery. The contributing anatomical structures for knee kinematics are two cruciate ligaments, the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) inside the joint. However, in knees with osteoarthritis, these ligaments may be damaged by inflammation and may not deserve retaining. Therefore, there are three concepts regarding the retaining of these ligaments in knee replacement surgery. 1: Sacrifice both ACL and PCL, 2: Retain PCL , socalled Cruciate Retaining (CR) knee designs, 3: Retain both ACL and PCL. When sacrificing the ACL and PCL one possibility to mimic the function of these ligaments is by different designs of the tibial insert. The CR design has been widely used in the northern countries and stability data for the Nexgen implant with high precision measurements available in the literature. The tibial insert of the GMK Sphere has a medial ball in socket joint and allows lateral anterioposterior movement. This intends to resemble the physiologic movement of the knee joint and allow femoral rollback. This new design has been developed by a group of dedicated researchers. This design intention is to resemble the function of the cruciate ligaments. Theoretically, knee implant designs, which retain the function of cruciate ligaments are predicted to have the closest kinematics to normal knees compared to other designs and to have a potential to achieve the highest patient's satisfaction. Analytical Method Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA) has been used in orthopedic research fields since 1970s. The original application of this method was for the evaluation of implant migration (i.e. fixation) and polyethylene wear of artificial joints using static X-ray pictures. When combining RSA with fluoroscopy, we get Roentgen Fluoroscopic Stereophotogrammetric Analysis (RSFA), a Method with high accuracy and precision. Only in a few implant designs one has been analyzing the actual kinematics in postoperative patients. We plan to investigate the knees during in vivo motion and weightbearing using RSFA. Purpose of the study The aim of this study is to analyse the in vivo kinematics of a medially stabilized knee arthroplasty implant (GMK Sphere) and to compare it with a well known design (Nexgen CR) by using RSFA. By using flat panel fluoroscopy, we will document and compare the kinematics of the two implants in all 6 degrees of freedom (DOF). 26 patients will be randomized into two groups, one will receive a NexGen CR prosthesis, the other group GMK Sphere.</detailed_description>
