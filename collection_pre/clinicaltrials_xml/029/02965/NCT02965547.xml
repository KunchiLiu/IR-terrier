	<brief_title>Remote Ischemic Preconditioning of Dynamic Cerebral Autoregulation in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Remote ischemic preconditioning(RIPC) is the phenomenon whereby brief cycles of ischemia and reperfusion, applied to a distant organ, provide protection to the target organ. Dynamic cerebral autoregulation(dCA), a mechanism to maintain the cerebral blood flow, has been proved to be critical for the occurrence,development and prognosis of ischemic neurovascular disease. In this study, we hypothesis that RIPC provides neuro-protection by means of improving dCA.</detailed_description>
