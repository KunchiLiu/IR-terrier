	<brief_title>Surrogate Markers of Response to New Therapies in Cystic Fibrosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is based upon the hypothesis that clinical response of cystic fibrosis patients to CFTR modulators is correlated to in vitro responses to these drugs of epithelial cells derived from the patients, as assessed by CFTR-dependent Chloride secretion. Epithelial cells will be derived either from nasal or rectal epithelia, and consist both of cultured cells and organoids. The drugs tested will be Ivacaftor, or Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor, according to patient's treatment. Results of these assays will be compared with response to treatment at 6 and 12 months, assessed by clinical response and in vivo assay of CFTR function.</detailed_description>
