	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to test if naltrexone, when taken in low doses, has an anti-inflammatory effect that may be associated with positive clinical outcomes in people with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). In part, the present study, is a continuation of prior work in which we showed that chronic fatigue symptoms are associated with immune activity, and that low-dose naltrexone might exert anti-inflammatory effects in fibromyalgia, which is thought to share some pathophysiological and clinical characteristics with CFS.</brief_summary>
