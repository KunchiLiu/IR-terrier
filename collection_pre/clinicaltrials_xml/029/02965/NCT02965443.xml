	<brief_summary>To perform a study that investigates the effectiveness of adding the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin + the DPP-4 inhibitor saxagliptin vs placebo to revert from a BBIT regimen to a BOT regimen in patients with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dapagliflozin + Saxagliptin in a Basal-bolus Insulin Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a phase IV study investigating the efficacy and safety of adding the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin together wih the DPP-4 inhibitor saxagliptin to an intensified insulin treatment regimen. Because BOT is superior to BBIT in respect to the development of bodyweight, hypoglycaemia and patient satisfaction in type 2 diabetes, we hypothesize that the combined addition of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin with the DPP-4 inhibitor saxagliptin is effective and safe to revert from a BBIT to a BOT treatment regimen.</detailed_description>
