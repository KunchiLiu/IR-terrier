	<criteria>Male, 18 years of age or older, at the screening (day 51) visit OR Females, who are naturally postmenopausal (permanent cessation of menstrual periods for at least 12 consecutive months) or are permanently sterilized (ie, eg, tubal occlusion,hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and/or bilateral oophorectomy) at the screening (day 51) visit In at least 1 eye, all of the following objective measures of evaporative dry eye (EDE) must be present at the standardization (day 21) and baseline (day 1) visits. The same eye must qualify at both visits Tear film breakup time (TBUT) ≥ 2 seconds and ≤ 7 seconds Corneal sodium fluorescein staining score ≥ 1 and ≤ 4 (Oxford scheme) Anesthetized Schirmer's tear test score ≥ 10 mm after 5 minutes At the standardization (day 21) and baseline (day 1) visits, patients must have: Ocular Surface Disease Index© (OSDI) score &gt; 12 (0 to 100 scale) Overall ocular discomfort score ≥ 1 and &lt; 4 (0 to 4 scale; 0 = none, 4 = very severe) Ocular burning score ≥ 1 and &lt; 4 (0 to 4 scale; 0 = none, 4 = very severe) Blurred vision score ≥ 1 and &lt; 4 (0 to 4 scale; 0 = none, 4 = very severe) In at least 1 eye, a lower lid margin meibum quality global assessment score ≥ 1 at the standardization (day 21) and baseline (day 1) visits. The same eye must qualify at both visits In at least 1 eye, the number of lower lid margin expressible meibomian glands must be ≥ 3 at the standardization (day 21) and baseline (day 1) visits. The same eye must qualify at both visits Use of an artificial tear product, lid hygiene (ie, warm compress, lid massage, lid scrub), omega3 supplementation (topical ocular or systemic), or antibiotics (ie, systemic or topical macrolides, tetracyclines, tetracycline derivatives [including doxycycline and minocycline]) for the treatment of dry eye disease, or meibomian gland disease within 1 year of the standardization (day 21) visit Male patients with a history of, known, or suspected prostate cancer Male patients with a prostatespecific antigen (PSA) level ≥ 4 μg/L Female patients with a history of known or suspected breast, cervical, ovarian, or uterine cancer Female patient who is of childbearing potential At standardization (day 21) and / or baseline (day 1) visits, a lower lid margin meibum quality global assessment score of nonexpressible (NE) in either eye Patients who are currently using estrogen and/or progesterone containing products (including herbal and nutritional supplements) and not on a stable dose (at least 90 days prior to the standardization visit (day 21) and/or anticipate initiating use and/or changing use during the study Patients who are currently using or have used any androgen or antiandrogen treatment (including herbal and nutritional supplements), within 90 days of the standardization (day 21) visit or anticipated use during the study Patients who are currently using or have used any hair growth product within 90 days of the standardization (day 21) visit or anticipated use during the study Patients who are currently using or have used topical corticosteroids in the eyes or on the eyelids within 60 days prior to the standardization visit (day 21), or any such use anticipated prior to the month 6 visit Patients who are currently using or have used oral or topical macrolides, tetracyclines, tetracycline derivative drugs (including doxycycline and minocycline), retinoids (eg, isotretinoin), calcineurin inhibitors (ie, RESTASIS®, Ikervis®), oral (systemic) corticosteroids, or lifitegrast (Xiidra™) or any other therapeutic dry eye treatment within 60 days of the standardization visit (day 21), or anticipated use before the month 6 visit</criteria>
