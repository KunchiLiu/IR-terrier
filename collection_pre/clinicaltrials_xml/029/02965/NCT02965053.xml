	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized study designed as a 2x2 cross-over in two periods (Period 1 and Period 2) to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of EOS789 in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hyperphosphatemia receiving hemodialysis. Period 1 is double-blind and Period 2 is open-label. Period 1 and Period 2 are identical with regard to the design, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and assessments. EOS789 and its combination with sevelamer carbonate are tested in Period 1 and Period 2 respectively.</brief_summary>
