	<brief_title>The Femoral Popliteal Artery Trial for LEGFLOW OTW</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the paclitaxel eluting balloon dilatation catheter (LEGFLOW OTW) compared with the standard balloon (Admiral Xtreme) for the treatment of stenosis or occlusions in femoral popliteal artery. This is a prospective, multicenter, prior desiged, randomize and controlled study, planned to enrol 172 subjects. all these subjects will be allocated 1:1 to the LEGFLOW OTW group n=86 and Admiral Xtreme group n=86. and accept the treatment of LEGFLOW and Admiral Xtreme balloon. and followed up at day 0-30, month 6, 12 by DUS and clinical examination. all the endpoint data will be assessed by DUS core-lab, CEC, then be statisticed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 85 years. 2. De novo or restenotic lesions in the femoral popliteal artery due to atherosclerosis, which located in the superficial femoral artery and/or proximal popliteal artery (arterial segment starting at least 1cm beyond the common femoral artery bifurcation to the distal P1 segment of the popliteal artery at the level of the proximal edge of the patella). And the patients are suitable for endovascular therapy with LEGFLOW OTW or Admiral Xtreme. 3. Rutherford class 2 to 5. 4. Target lesion length ≤ 200mm. 5. Target lesion stenosis ≥ 70% or total occlusion, and it can be passed with common manipulation. 6. Reference vessel diameter ≥ 4mm and ≤ 8mm by visual estimate. 7. Target lesion consists of a single of de novo or restenotic lesion, or a adjacent lesion or a combination lesion or multiple lesion which meets the following criteria: adjacent lesion: (1) lesion space ≤ 30mm; (2) total lesion length (include lesion space) ≤ 200mm; (3) can be treated as a single lesion. Combination lesion: combination lesion is defined as not a chronic total occlusion (CTO), but may include a part of total occlusion (100% stenosis). The total lesion length ≤ 200mm. Multiple lesion: (1) lesion space &gt; 30mm; (2) total lesion length (include lesion space) ≤ 200mm; (3) can be treated as multiple lesions. 8. Angiographic evidence of adequate distal runoff to the foot (at least one native calf vessel is patent, defined as &lt; 50% diameter stenosis), whether or not this outfolw was reestablished by previous intervention. 9. If subject has ipsilateral/contralateral iliac disease that requires treatment during the procedure, the iliac lesions must meet all the following criteria: Iliac lesion or occlusion is ≤ 100mm in length; must be treated before the target lesion (superficial femoral artery/proximal popliteal artery). must be successfully treated before target lesion treatment; success is defined as: (1) residual stenosis &lt; 30%; (2) free of dissection which can limit blood flow; (3) no occurrence of thrombus, embolization, or other SAE. 10. Life expectancy more than one year. 11. Understands the study objective and is willing to participate and provide the informed consent form, and is willing to comply with specified followup evaluations at the specified time points. 1. Women of childbearing age with negative pregnancy test before procedure, and breastfeeding women. 2. Stroke or STEMI within 30 days prior to the procedure. 3. Either local or systemic thrombolytic therapy within 6 weeks prior to the procedure. 4. Any major surgical operation (operation class ≥ 3) or interventional therapy within 30 days prior to the procedure. 5. Any major selective surgical operation (operation class ≥ 3) or interventional therapy within 30 days prior to the procedure. 6. Restenotic lesions after DCB or bypass surgery. 7. Target limb has been previously treated with bypass surgery. 8. Guidewire must be passed through from the distal part of limb. 9. Known allergies or sensitivities to contrast agent, paclitaxel, antiplatelet, anticoagulants or thrombolytic drugs. 10. Known allergies or sensitivities to heparin, including those patients who have had a previous incidence of heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II. 11. Aneurysm located at the target vessel. 12. Acute or subacute thrombosis in the target vessel. 13. Angiographic evidence of severe calcification (defined as dense circumferential calcification that makes the target lesion nondilatable and/or calcificatin that is present on both sides of the vessel wall and that extends more than 5 cntinuous centimeters in length within the target lesion prior to contrast injection or digital subtraction angiography). 14. The bilateral lower limb must be treated in one procedure. 15. Uncorrected bleeding disorder. 16. Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt;2.5mg/dL or renal dialysis). 17. Stenosis or occlusions due to nonatherosclerosis, such as thrombotic occlusive vasculitis or vasculitis. 18. Septicemia or bacteremia. 19. Patients with severe disease (such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignant tumor, dementia, etc.) or patient's physical condition may affect the compliance with this study. 20. Predilation resulted in a major (≥ Grade D) flowlimiting dissection or residual stenosis &gt; 70%. 21. Major distal amputation (above the transmetatarsal) in the study limb or nonstudy limb. 22. Patients who have participated in another investigational drug or device trial that has not completed the primary endpoint.</criteria>
