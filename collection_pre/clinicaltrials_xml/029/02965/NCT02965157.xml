	<brief_summary>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD20 will be evaluated for safety and efficacy in patients with CD20+ B cell lymphoma. The CAR consists of a CD20 targeting antibody scFv with two intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3 zeta and CD28. Autologous T cells will be gene-engineered with the CAR gene using a retrovirus vector. Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy.</brief_summary>
