	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Fenofibrate Combined With UDCA in PBC Patients With an Incomplete Biochemical Response to UDCA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary biliary cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the only drug approved for the treatment of PBC. Although UDCA can improve the clinical outcomes in patients with PBC, about 40% of PBC patients show an incomplete biochemical response to this treatment, accordingly have a significantly increased risk of developing liver transplantation or death. Therefor there is a urgently needed for better therapies for these patients. The development of new treatments is therefore needed. The Fenofibrate is the candidate, there is now a substantial body of circumstantial evidence supporting that Fenofibrate is well tolerated and can improve biochemical response in PBC patients with incompleted response to UDCA. The purpose of this protocol is to conduct a trial in a selected population of patients with PBC based on an incomplete biochemical response after 12 months of UDCA therapy.</detailed_description>
