	<brief_summary>A First-in-Human (FIH) study of TAS-116 in patients with advanced solid tumors was first initiated in Japan in April 2014 and has been ongoing since then. The study consists of a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. Three dosing regimens of TAS-116, once daily (QD), every other day (QOD) and 5 days on/2 days off regimens in 21-day cycles, are being evaluated. This phase I study is also planned to enrol with advanced solid tumors in UK to confirm the MTD, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of TAS-116 in a Western patient population in the dose expansion phase. In addition, patients with HER2+ MBC, NSCLC harbouring EGFR mutations (EGFRT790M+) or EGFR mutations (T790M-) will be further evaluated for safety, tolerability and efficacy in 3 separate cohorts at recommended dose of TAS-116 on the 5 days on/2 days off regimen.</brief_summary>
