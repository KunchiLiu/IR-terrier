	<brief_summary>Validating a peptide-based laboratory test enabling the measurement of Tysabri® serum levels (pharmacokinetics, PK) in multiple sclerosis patients undergoing therapy. The results of this newly developed test will be compared to Tysabri® serum levels measured in parallel using an independent test. We will also simultaneously measure a pharmacodynamic marker of Tysabri®, receptor saturation levels on blood immune cells, which is thought to correlate with Tysabri® serum levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of a Laboratory Test Measuring Natalizumab (Tysabri®) Serum Levels in MS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From a single site, consenting patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis who are currently begin treated with Tysabri® (natalizumab) and meeting the eligibility criteria will be asked to provide blood samples on the same day, and prior to, a scheduled infusion of Tysabri® 300 mg IV. Up to 500 patients will be enrolled in this study. Each patient may be asked to donate blood up to 2 times (one blood draw per cycle) to obtain longitudinal data points. Each patient will also be asked to fill out a wellness patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire along with the blood draws</detailed_description>
