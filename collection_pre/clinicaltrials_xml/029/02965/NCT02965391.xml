	<brief_summary>Previous study showed circulating tumor DNA levels reflect the total systemic tumor burden. Circulating tumor DNA levels should decrease after complete surgery and could be increase as tumor recurrence. Few study investigated the half time of circulating tumor DNA in lung cancer patients that no criterion has been established of how to use it for surveillance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic Changes of Circulating Tumor DNA in Surgical Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For adenocarcinoma patients who received surgery, multiple time of plasma will be collected before or after surgery. A series of mutations will be detected in plasma before surgery based on next generation sequencing. The positive mutation will be traced after surgery and in follow up.</detailed_description>
