	<detailed_description>A total of 105 overweight and obese children ages 8 to 17 years participated in a 10-week family-based weight management intervention focusing on physical activity, nutrition, and behavioral modification. A quasi-experimental design was used to group cohorts into three conditions: two cohorts had no pedometer (n=24); two cohorts had pedometer only (n=25); and four cohorts had pedometer with step goals (i.e. 500 steps/day weekly increase above baseline; n=56). Height and weight were measured at baseline and week 10 and used to calculate body mass index (BMI). Analysis of covariance was performed to examine difference by condition for change in weight, BMI, and BMI z-score, controlling for age and baseline value. Differences in steps/day and psychosocial health were compared between the two pedometer conditions.</detailed_description>
