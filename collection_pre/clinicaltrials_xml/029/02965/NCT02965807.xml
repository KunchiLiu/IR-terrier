	<brief_title>Effect of Bronchial Thermoplasty on Moderate Bronchial Asthma in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, open-label and single arm study. At least 50 patients with moderate asthma receive Bronchial Thermoplasty for three times. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), Frequency of mild asthma acute attack, PEF, FEV1, Emergency and Hospitalization are compared between before and after BT treatment. The unified peak flow test meter will be provided to all subjects enrolled in this study. They will get a follow-up diary book before leaving hospital. In order to ensure the efficiency, all enrolled asthma patients are trained and tested by doctors and nurses from in-patient or out-patient department when they follow up, including how to use the PEF meter, how to read and record the data. As for the dosage of medication, all the medication uses are followed the doctor's advice, once the rescue medications were used, the times and dosages are mandatory to be recorded in the diary book by the patients themselves.</detailed_description>
