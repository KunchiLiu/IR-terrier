	<brief_summary>Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) caused by blast effects of explosive devices has been called the "signature injury" of soldiers who served in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. mTBI can also occur from impact or hitting the head on an object or the ground. Although termed "mild" in comparison to major brain injuries, people with mTBI can have problems with their memory and concentration. People with mTBI can also find they are more irritable, have more anxiety, and have trouble with their mood and sleep. The purpose of this study is to see if a medication called prazosin can help treat chronic headaches in people with mTBI. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved prazosin for treating people with high blood pressure. At this time, the FDA has not approved prazosin in the treatment of mTBI or headaches. Some people who have posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and have been taking prazosin for their medical conditions or who have taken it in research studies have said they have fewer headaches.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prazosin for Post-Concussive Headaches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background and Rationale: Headaches following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are common, can be refractory to standard therapies, and may persist and worsen to become a debilitating chronic pain syndrome. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the centrally acting alpha-1 adrenoreceptor (AR) antagonist drug prazosin as a prophylactic treatment for chronic posttraumatic headaches (PTHAs). The impetus for this study comes from a large open-label case series in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans with mTBI and PTHAs and data from a placebo-controlled trial evaluating use of prazosin for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in active-duty Servicemembers (SMs). Findings from these studies showed that in addition to decreasing PTSD-related symptoms and improving sleep quality, prazosin decreased the frequency and severity of headaches, which were common in the study populations. Study Objectives, Specific Aims, and Hypotheses: The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of prazosin as a prophylactic treatment for persistent PTHAs, which will be accomplished by conducting a randomized placebo-controlled double blind trial of prazosin vs. placebo in active-duty SMs and Veterans who were in military service at any time from October 7, 2001 to the present with persistent PTHAs. - Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect of prazosin compared to placebo on headache frequency, headache severity and duration, use of abortive/analgesic medications, and headache-related disability. - Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of prazosin on sleep disturbance, PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, alcohol consumption, global cognitive function, health-related quality of life, and global clinical status.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female Activeduty Servicemembers or Veterans aged 18 or older who were in military service at any time from October 7, 2001 to the present who are in good general health. History of blast and/or impact head trauma mTBI meeting Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC) mTBI criteria, which define mTBI as an injury to the head causing at least one of the following: alteration in consciousness (for up to 24 hours after the injury), loss of consciousness 030 minutes, and/or posttraumatic amnesia up to 1 day postinjury. If available, the Glasgow Coma Scale score must be 1315, and head imaging findings (if imaging was performed) must be negative. Frequent headaches (HAs) that started within 30 days after a head injury. The HAs either 1) must last 4 or more hours a day and reach a moderate to severe intensity at any point during the headache, or 2) may be of any severity or duration if the participant takes a triptan or ergotamine. HAs meeting these criteria must have been present on average at least 8 days per 4week period, starting within 30 days after head injury and occurring by selfreport for at least 3 months prior to the Initial Screening Visit. The 4week HA frequency/severity criteria must be confirmed during the Preliminary Screening Period. Women of childbearing potential must agree to abstain from sexual relations that could result in pregnancy or use an effective method of birth control acceptable to both participant and the clinician prescriber during the study. Men are not required to use contraception during the study. Participants must have English fluency sufficient to complete study measures. Participation in other interventional research. History of penetrating head injury History of TBI more severe than mild by DVBIC criteria Diagnosis of a primary or secondary HA disorder other than PTHA Lifetime history of 5 or more migraine or probable migraine headaches predating mTBI HAs of any kind of moderate or severe intensity on an average of more than 2 days per month preceding the concussive trauma Continuous HAs of any kind (i.e., persistent daily HAs with no HAfree period less than 8 hours between attacks) Acute or serious medical illness or unstable chronic medical illness (e.g., unstable angina, myocardial infarction within 6 months, congestive heart failure, clinically significant or concerning cardiac arrhythmias; preexisting hypotension [systolic blood pressure&lt;110] or orthostatic hypotension [systolic drop &gt;20 mm Hg after 2 min standing accompanied by lightheadedness], chronic renal or hepatic failure, acute pancreatitis, Meniere's disease, or insulindependent diabetes, or diagnosed but untreated sleep apnea). The eligibility of potential participants having acute serious and/or chronic medical illnesses other than those listed will be evaluated on a casebycase basis by a study physician, PAC, or ARNP. Use of prazosin or other alpha1 antagonist (including but not limited to alfuzosin, doxazosin, silodosin, tamsulosin, terazosin) for any purpose in the 4 weeks prior to initial screen (P1) visit and prohibited throughout the study Allergy or previous adverse reaction to prazosin or other alpha1 antagonist Active psychosis or psychotic disorder, severe depression (as determined per clinician prescriber judgment), severe psychiatric instability or severe situational life crisis (including evidence of being actively suicidal or homicidal). Meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM5) criteria for any Substance Use Disorder except caffeinerelated disorders, or tobaccorelated disorders. History of delirium within the prior 3 months, epilepsy, stroke, dementia, psychotic disorder, or bipolar disorder Structural brain abnormalities on any prior imaging with associated clinically evident manifestations Current participation in transcranial magnetic stimulation studies Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant, planning to become pregnant during the study period, or nursing. Participation in a HA support group or other activity such as meditation or yoga intended to mitigate HA or other chronic pain must be stable at least 4 weeks prior to beginning the initial screen (P1) visit and may not be started during the study Failure to record HA data for at least 80% of days during the Screening Period Not suitable for study per clinician judgement.</criteria>
