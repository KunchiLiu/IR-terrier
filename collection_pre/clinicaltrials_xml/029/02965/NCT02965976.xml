	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well botulinum toxin type A works in preventing complication after surgery in patients with esophageal cancer. Botulinum toxin type A may cause less complications of nausea and vomiting after surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Botulinum Toxin Type A in Preventing Complications After Surgery in Patients With Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if intra-pyloric botulinum toxin type A (botulinum toxin) injection (Botox) during a minimally invasive esophagectomy decreases postoperative occurrence of delayed gastric emptying. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if intra-pyloric botulinum toxin injection during a minimally invasive esophagectomy reduces the number of repeat procedures for delayed gastric emptying within 90 days. II. Determine if intra-pyloric botulinum toxin injection during a minimally invasive esophagectomy decreases time to oral intake meeting 100% of nutritional requirements. III. Determine if intra-pyloric botulinum toxin injection during a minimally invasive esophagectomy reduces the incidence of pulmonary complications directly related to delayed gastric emptying. IV. Determine if intra-pyloric botulinum toxin injection during a minimally invasive esophagectomy reduces hospital length of stay related to delayed gastric emptying. V. Determine if intra-pyloric botulinum toxin injection during a minimally invasive esophagectomy increases patient quality of life. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive botulinum toxin type A injection intramuscularly (IM) while undergoing standard minimally invasive esophagectomy. ARM II: Patients undergo standard minimally invasive esophagectomy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2, 3-4, and 6-8 weeks, and at 90 days.</detailed_description>
