	<brief_summary>This randomized phase IIa trial studies how well aspirin works in preventing colorectal cancer in patients with colorectal adenoma. Aspirin may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aspirin in Preventing Colorectal Cancer in Patients With Colorectal Adenoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To test for the equivalency of the two aspirin schedules. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the effects of aspirin treatments on the ratio of cell proliferation (Ki-67)/apoptosis (TUNEL) in rectal biopsies. II. To evaluate the effects of aspirin treatments on the ratio of cell proliferation (Ki-67)/necroptosis (MLKL) in rectal biopsies. III. To evaluate the effects of aspirin treatments on fecal occult blood test (measures of adverse events) as measured by stool samples. IV. To evaluate the effects of aspirin treatments on methylation biomarkers in genes (i.e. CDKN2A [cell cycle regulation], MGMT [DNA repair], DAPK1 [apoptosis], CDH1 [cell invasion], WNT16 [Wnt pathway] and RASSF1 [RAS signaling]) involved in colorectal carcinogenesis, as measured in rectal biopsies. V. To evaluate the effects of aspirin treatments on colorectal mucosal nanoscale cellular structural changes measured by PWS (partial wave spectroscopy) obtained through rectal brushings. VI. To evaluate the effects of aspirin treatments on abundance of E. coli and Fusobacterium in rectal swabs. VII. To evaluate if the effects of aspirin arms may be modified by dietary intake of calcium as measured by the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms. ARM I: Patients receive aspirin orally (PO) daily for 12 weeks. ARM II: Patients receive aspirin PO daily at weeks 1-3 and 7-9 and placebo PO daily at weeks 4-6 and 10-12. ARM III: Patients receive placebo PO daily for 12 weeks. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 months.</detailed_description>
