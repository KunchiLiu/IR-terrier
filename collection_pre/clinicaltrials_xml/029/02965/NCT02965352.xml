	<brief_summary>This study has developed a peripheral to quantify the functional strength of children without motor change during the movement of grip and pinch. It was possible to know the exact values of these strengths, the range of motion that was made, and also if the grip strength was maintained during all the arc of motion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peripheral for Quantify Strength of Children Functional During the Pinch Movement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since childhood, it has been necessary to produce sufficient force to grip and pinch, for performing daily tasks independently; therefore, measurements of these forces end up being useful markers to evaluate the performance and the physical development of the child. It was developed a peripheral containing three devices and instrumented for analyzing the force applied during execution of the cylindrical grip movement, pinch pulp-side and pinch pulp-pulp in different situations of the daily life of the volunteer. The data acquisition interface was developed in a software for data recording. For the peripheral functionality tests, thirty volunteers of both genders were selected. They were also students of the Sports Secretary, with no motor abnormalities, between seven and ten years old.</detailed_description>
