	<brief_summary>This trial will compare conventional sequential bilateral rTMS to a bilateral theta burst stimulation protocol. The right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortices will be the site of stimulation in both treatment conditions. The site of stimulation will be targeted using MRI co-registration. The study seeks to determine if the bilateral theta burst protocol has similar effectiveness to the conventional bilateral rTMS protocol in treating major depression.</brief_summary>
