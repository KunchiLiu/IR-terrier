Any male partner should be willing to use condom or should be vasectomized. Diagnosis of laboratoryconfirmed influenza in the 2015/2016 season. Use of any investigational drug product within 3 months before screening or planned use during the study period, including the safety followup. Administration of an influenza vaccine during the 6 months before screening. Previously received another vaccine within 28 days before administration of the study vaccine, or is scheduled to receive another vaccine during the study period, excluding the safety followup. Any contraindication to intramuscular administration of the influenza vaccine AdimFluS according to its prescribing information. Any contraindication to administration of the influenza vaccine Fluenz Tetra according to its summary of product characteristics (SmPC). History of any anaphylactic reaction and/or serious allergic reaction following a vaccination, a proven hypersensitivity to any component of the study vaccine (e.g., to eggs or egg product as well as ovalbumin, chicken protein, chicken feathers, influenza viral protein, kanamycin, gentamycin and neomycin sulphate). Diagnosis of asthma with poor disease control as assessed by the Investigator. Potent immunosuppressive therapy including cytostatics, antibodies, drugs acting on immunophilins, interferons and other drugs used to prevent rejection of organ transplants, within 6 months before screening. Use of any parenteral or oral corticosteroids within 30 days prior to screening. Inhaled steroids are allowed. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. Any progressive or severe neurologic disorder, seizure disorder or GuillainBarré syndrome. History of GuillainBarré syndrome within 6 weeks of receipt of prior inactivated influenza virus vaccine. Received blood, blood products and/or plasma derivatives or any administration of immunoglobulin preparation within the three months prior to Visit 2, or planned during the study. Participation in blood donation within 3 months or plasma donation within 1 month prior to Visit 2. History of substance or alcohol abuse within the past 2 years. History or any illness/condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with the results of the study or pose additional risk to the subjects due to participation in the study. Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody and HIV. Pregnant or lactating female or intent to become pregnant during the clinic phase (up until and including Visit 4 for group 1 to 4 and Visit 3 for group 5 and 6) and for 2 months after the last vaccination. History of Bell's palsy. Ongoing regular use of intranasal sprays including corticosteroids and decongestants. Ongoing cough, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps or obstruction, including septum deviation significant enough to prevent bilateral administration of study vaccine.
