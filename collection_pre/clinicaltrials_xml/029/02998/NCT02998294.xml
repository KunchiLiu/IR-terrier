	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of one-time respiratory volume measured by RVM(Respiratory Volume Monitor) compared to the one-time respiratory volume measured by mechanical ventilation in post-operative ICU patients. In addition, the investigators investigated the decrease in respiratory volume in opioid infusion after ventilator weaning in this patient, and to measure the one-time respiratory volume change by RVM during deep breathing induction using Inspirometry exercise.</detailed_description>
