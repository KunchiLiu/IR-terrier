	<brief_summary>This is an prospective study conducted in a Chinese heart failure population. The study investigates the effects of cardiovascular disease risk factors such as lifestyle behaviors,biomarkers and intermediate diseases on heart failure prognosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Evaluation and Management in Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure is the main cause of cardiovascular death. The primary goal of this study is to estimate the association of lifestyle behavior (e.g., alcohol, tea and coffee consumption, sedentary behavior, smoking habit, sleep disorder and physical activity), intermediate conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia), genetic risk factors and circulating biomarkers with heart failure prognosis. Another goal is to improve the health status and reduce cardiovascular events and death for heart failure patients via patient education, disease monitoring and medication titration. This study planned to consecutively enroll 1,000 heart failure patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Each participants will be followed up for at least 5 years. The study endpoints, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events, will be identified by directly contacting participants during the follow-up surveys, checking pertinent medical records and discharge lists from the hospitals, or checking death certificates from local vital statistics offices. The Cox proportional hazard model will be used to estimate the risk factors for health outcomes in heart failure patients.</detailed_description>
