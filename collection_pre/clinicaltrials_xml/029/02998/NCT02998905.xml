	<brief_title>NOACs for Stroke Prevention in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Previous ICH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The NASPAF-ICH study is an open-label, randomized, controlled, phase II study that will assess the feasibility of a controlled trial examining the efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) compared with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for stroke prevention in patients with high-risk atrial fibrillation and previous intracerebral hemorrhage, as well as provide evidence of efficacy and safety for planning of a phase III trial. Recruitment will occur at 10 high-volume stroke research centres across Canada over 2 years, at which 100 adult patients with high-risk atrial fibrillation (CHADS2 ≥2) and previous spontaneous or traumatic ICH (intraparenchymal or intraventricular hemorrhage while on or off anticoagulation) will be randomly assigned to receive a NOAC (particular agent at the discretion of the local investigator) or ASA 81 mg per day. Patients will be followed for a mean of 1 year to a common end-study date. The feasibility of recruitment will also be tested. The investigators estimate that five patients per year per centre can be recruited.</detailed_description>
