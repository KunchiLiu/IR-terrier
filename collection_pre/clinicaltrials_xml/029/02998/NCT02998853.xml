	<brief_title>Non Culprit Functional Evaluation With 3D Angio QFR in STEMI PCI Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3DAngio QFR is an angiographic based tool for coronary stenosis functional assessment: it is validated versus Adenosine FFR(ADOFFR) by several studies (FAVOR, VIRTU-1) ; in particular post contrast QFR (cQFR) showed a very good correlation with ADOFFR. Furthermore ADOFFR in non culprit vessel in acute stage of STEMI correlates well with ADOFFR of the same non culprit lesion in staged procedure. Aim of the study is to find a valid correlation between cQFR in acute study and ADOFFR in the staged procedure. A positive result may lead to a fast, easy and cost effective acute functional non culprit lesions evaluation during acute procedure for STEMI patients, selecting those,if any, to be treated immediately or in a staged procedure.</detailed_description>
