	<brief_summary>This study will examine whether brain stimulation paired with social skills learning can help teenage boys with autism learn how to make and keep friends. Brain stimulation can enhance learning in some people. This study involves enrolling in a 14-week training program where teenage boys with autism interact in small groups and learn social skills. During the 14-week program participants will receive active brain stimulation, or non-active stimulation (placebo). Before and after this training, MRI scans will be taken to see whether the training with active brain stimulation made a different in brain activation.</brief_summary>
