	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of Ferrous Sulphate (FS) tablets in improving iron stores and functional capacity in HF patients with Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Term Oral Iron Supplementation in Systolic Heart Failure Patients Suffering From Iron Deficiency Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators conducted a double blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) enrolling 54 Heart Failure (HF) patients (LVEF &lt; 50%) with IDA (Ferritin &lt; 100 ng/mL or 100-300 ng/mL with Tsat &lt; 20%) at outpatient clinic of National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita from January to July 2016. Patients were randomized 1:1 to received FS or placebo for 90 days, the investigators then evaluated the change in 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT) distance as primary end-point and changes on N-Terminal-pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) and post 6MWT serum lactate levels as secondary end-points.</detailed_description>
