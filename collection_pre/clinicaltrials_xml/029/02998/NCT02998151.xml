	<criteria>Subjects ages 1555, with FXS who completed the study entitled "Mechanisms and brain circuits underlying fragile X syndrome (IRB # 20158425). FXS is defined as full FMR1 mutations (&gt;200 CGG repeats) confirmed by genetic testing. General good health as determined by physical exam, medical history and laboratory work up. Subjects with a history of intolerance to acamprosate, lovastatin, or minocycline will be excluded. Subjects will also be excluded if they have taken any investigational drug within 3 months, have a history of substance abuse or dependence within 6 months, or significant psychiatric or CNS neurological disease unrelated to FXS. Uncontrolled seizures impact EEG data as do anticonvulsants, barbiturates, lithium and benzodiazepines and are exclusions (within 5 halflives). Those taking other psychiatric medications must be on stable doses for 4 weeks before any testing. For female subjects of child bearing potential, a positive urine pregnancy test. Potential subjects with a creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min will be excluded. Identified medical issues, inability to tolerate study procedures or study drug per the discretion of the Principal Investigator.</criteria>
