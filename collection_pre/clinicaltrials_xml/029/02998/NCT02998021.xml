	<brief_title>Effect of Vibration Exercise on Upper Limb Strength, Function, and Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: The primary purpose of this study is to explore the benefits of vibration dumbbell resistance training over standard dumbbell resistance training for improving upper limb strength, function and pain among manual wheelchair users with paraplegia. Experimental Design: Randomized Control Trial Methods: Twenty-four subjects with paraplegia will be recruited and randomized into two groups, a vibration dumbbell training (V-DT) group and a standard dumbbell training group (S-DT). Both groups will participate in a supervised 12-week (3 sessions per week) dumbbell (free-weight) strength training program consisting of nine exercises specifically designed to improve upper limb muscle function to support propulsion and transfer activities and protect the shoulders from developing pain. For each of the nine exercises the vibration group will hold a high-frequency (40 Hz) vibrating dumbbell in a static arm posture (isometric training) while the control group will move a non-vibrating dumbbell through the full range of motion for a given exercise (isotonic training). Both groups will follow a standardized protocol for assessing and progressing the amount of weight that is added to the dumbbell to achieve optimal training effects. All participants will participate in laboratory testing for various outcome measures at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 18 weeks (i.e. 6 weeks post intervention).</detailed_description>
