	<detailed_description>When treating atrial fibrillation and targeting various areas in the left atrium, electrophysiologists have the choice to perform ablation with RF energy or cryoenergy. Esophageal ulceration and in more rare cases, esophageal fistulae, are known complications of this ablation procedure. Though rare (0.1-0.25% fistula rate and 15-20% esophageal ulceration rate according to the most recent Heart Rhythm Society EHRA ECA consensus statement)1, the investigators would very much like to understand how to completely prevent these occurrences. Cryoenergy has more recently been introduced as an energy source used in the PVI procedure; therefore, for this energy source, rates of esophageal ulceration are not yet well-defined. Nine esophageal fistulae have occurred in the first approximately 130,000 cryoballoon procedures.</detailed_description>
