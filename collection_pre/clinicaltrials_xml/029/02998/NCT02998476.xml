	<criteria>Eligible 19 years and older in South Korea Relapsed or refractory DLBCL, which has been histologically documented, defined as having received at least 1 but no more than 5 prior treatment regimens and ineligible for highdose chemotherapy supported by autologous stem cell transplant. Must have ≥ 1 measurable lesion (≥2 cm in longest dimension) or ≥ 1 measurable extranodal lesion (≥1 cm in longest dimension) on computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Subjects must be willing to undergo an incisional or excisional lymph node biopsy of accessible adenopathy or provide the most recent, available archived tumor biopsy. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2. Primary mediastinal (thymic) large Bcell lymphoma. Known brain or central nervous system metastases or history of uncontrolled seizures. Allogeneic stem cell transplant within the last 6 months, or active graft versus host disease following allogeneic transplant, or autologous stem cell transplant within the last 3 months. Use or expected use during the study of any prohibited medications, including potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors or inducers within 14 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study drug. Prior treatment with the following: Group A: Prior treatment with a selective phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K) δ inhibitor (eg, idelalisib), a panPI3K inhibitor, or a BTK inhibitor (eg, ibrutinib). Group B: Prior treatment with a selective PI3Kδ inhibitor (eg, idelalisib) or a pan PI3K inhibitor.</criteria>
