	<brief_summary>It is known from research that long-term exercise exposure in type 2 diabetes had positive effects. However, the effect of acute exercise in a patient group with already reduced cardiac function is not known. In this study, the impact of acute exhaustive high intensity interval training on cardiac function will be investigated in type 2 diabetes patients. One single session of exhaustive high intensity interval exercise training is expected to lead to a greater cardiac stress in diabetics than in non-diabetics, and in addition the right ventricle of the heart is expected to be more affected than the left ventricle.</brief_summary>
