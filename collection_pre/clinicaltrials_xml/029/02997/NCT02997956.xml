	<brief_title>Study of Tocilizumab in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Undergoing Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TACE (Transarterial Chemo Embolization) has shown to improve overall survival compared to non-treated patients with intermediate HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) tumors. However, TACE is not considered a curative strategy and eventual local recurrence is observed in nearly all (&gt;95%) of cases. Therefore, significant clinical equipoise exists in this large group of HCC patients such that novel therapies can be tested in an adjuvant manner to TACE. Based on pre-clinical data in HCC and the increasing identification that IL-6 signaling leads to tumor progression or local recurrence in other solid malignancies, significant rationale exists for the use of Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor adjuvant to TACE. While Tocilizumab has been demonstrated to be safe in RA patients and is FDA approved, limited data exists for the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with cirrhosis and HCC. Therefore, a lead in phase IB study design is planned to identify the MTD of Tocilizumab in HCC patients followed by expansion to the phase II component whereupon the primary objective will be median progression free survival (PFS).</detailed_description>
