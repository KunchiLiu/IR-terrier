	<detailed_description>Preliminary observations suggest that food intake coincident with high melatonin levels leads to impaired glucose toleranceâ€”particularly in MTNR1B risk allele carriers. Our objectives are to determine the effect of concurrent food intake and melatonin on glucose tolerance; and to assess the role of MTNR1B single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)*melatonin interaction in this deleterious effect. Our central hypothesis is that concurrent high melatonin levels and food intake, commonly experienced in night shift workers, cause long-term impairment of glucose tolerance and that this effect is worse in carriers of the MTNR1B type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk SNP than in non-carriers. The results of this proposal will help to clarify an ongoing controversy about the role of melatonin in glucose tolerance, and will help to develop novel strategies in the prevention and treatment of T2D, especially in shift workers, night eaters, and MTNR1B risk allele carriers.</detailed_description>
