	<brief_title>PFA-100 Responsive to Effect of Energy Drinks on Platelet Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two previous studies have demonstrated increased platelet aggregation 60 minutes after drinking a commercially available sugar-free energy drink. These studies utilized traditional platelet function studies, such as light transmission aggregometry (LTA), where platelet function is examined while adding varying concentrations of a panel of agonist to platelets. These studies are technically difficult, time intensive studies requiring specialized laboratories. They are relatively non-physiologic and do not mimic platelet response to vessel wall damage. Other tests better represent the reactions to vessel wall damage, including the PFA-100, which measures platelet aggregation and adhesion under conditions of high shear. Overall, PFA-100 is less expensive, requires less technical skill, and is less time consuming than LTA. It has been utilized in bleeding disorders and is demonstrating promise as a marker of thrombophilia. PFA-100 has demonstrated sensitivity to drug and dietary effects. It has also shown differences in closure time between sedentary and athletic individuals PFA-100 has not been used to investigate the effect of energy drinks.</detailed_description>
