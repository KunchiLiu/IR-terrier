	<brief_summary>Positive Psychotherapy for Smoking Cessation (PPT-S) addresses an array of risk factors for poor smoking outcomes (low positive affect, depressive symptoms, and cynical cognitions), while also providing skills that may buffer against stress and negative affect. The overall objective of this project is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of PPT-S, enhanced with text messaging, compared to a time-matched behavioral smoking cessation treatment. Participants in both treatment conditions will receive nicotine replacement therapy and a validated text-messaging intervention for smoking cessation that monitors progress in quitting smoking and extends smoking counseling outside of the individual face-to-face context.</brief_summary>
