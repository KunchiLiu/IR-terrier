	<brief_summary>Steroid-refractory acute GVHD (srGVHD) is one of the causes of mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, while steroid-refractory chronic GVHD significantly increases morbidity, aggravates quality of life and may also impact survival. Currently there is no standard treatment of srGVHD. One of the most promising agents is Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor ruxolitinib, which in the retrospective study demonstrated excellent response rate and survival of patients with either acute or chronic srGVHD. This study prospectively evaluates the efficacy of ruxolitinib in srGVHD patients.</brief_summary>
