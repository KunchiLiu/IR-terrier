	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men and nearly 30,000 deaths occur from the disease each year. Not only is there significant mortality, there is also considerable morbidity from primary and salvage therapies. Understanding which patients require intensified treatment, as well as those who might not require treatment, would improve outcomes on multiple levels. The cohort to be investigated will be comprised of men with intermediate to high risk prostate cancer who are candidates for radiotherapy (RT). The overarching objective of the CoMBINe trial is to identify pretreatment and post-treatment prognostic and predictive factors derived from quantitative imaging prostate features, tumor tissue gene expression signatures, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The CoMBINe trial is a sister trial to another study, termed BLaStM (IRB# 20140627), in men who are candidates for radiotherapy. CoMBINe also allows for men with oligometastasis who are sometimes treated with RT to the prostate and limited metastatic sites.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection and Measurement of Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective -To investigate the relationship of quantitative imaging parameters (multiparametric MRI) pretreatment (pre-Tx) and post-treatment to changes in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) over time in prostate cancer patients who receive treatment with radiotherapy ± androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) per standard of care at the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Miami. Secondary objectives - To evaluate whether CTC changes and/or quantitative imaging parameter changes are associated with patient outcome (biochemical and clinical disease failure). - To evaluate whether ADT will affect quantitative imaging features and/or CTC levels in patients receiving therapy. - To investigate the relationship of quantitative imaging characteristics and/or circulating tumor cell (CTC) changes with other tissue biomarkers (e.g., gene expression signatures) obtained from the pre-treatment MRI ultrasound (US) fusion guided prostate biopsy. - In patients who have undergone the MRI-US fusion guided biopsy (MUFgBx) at 2-2.5 years after all planned treatment, to investigate the relationship of quantitative imaging characteristics, circulating tumor cell (CTC) changes, and/or pretreatment biopsy tissue gene expression patterns with the endpoint prostate research biopsy status. Treatment -Radiotherapy technique and dose, as well as the use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), are per the standard of care at the University of Miami, and are not specified in this protocol.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Biopsy confirmed primary tumor of the prostate 2. Any clinical Tstage based on digital rectal exam 3. By imaging or clinical criteria, any patient with disease staging of N0/N1 and M0/M1 Patients with metastatic disease are encouraged to participate. 4. Any Gleason score will be eligible 5. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is at the discretion of the treating physician; but must be decided (none, shortterm or longterm as counted from the luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist injection) prior to the start of radiotherapy. However if it is planned, the following restrictions apply: It must be started prior to the start of radiotherapy and The total length planned must be ≤ 36 months Short term ADT is defined as ≤ 7 months Long term ADT is defined as &gt; 7 months and ≤ 36 months Permanent ADT is defined as &gt;36 months (e.g., M1 patients) 6. Prostatespecific antigen (PSA) ≤100 ng/mL within (+/) 4 months of signing of consent. If PSA was above 100 and drops to &lt;100 with antibiotics, this is acceptable for enrollment. 7. No previous pelvic radiotherapy 8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document 9. Zubrod performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status may be used to estimate Zubrod) 10. Age ≥35 and ≤85 years at signing of consent 11. Subjects must be planned to receive radiation therapy 12. Subjects must be planned for an MRIUS fusion guided biopsy (MUFgBx) prior to radiation treatment</criteria>
