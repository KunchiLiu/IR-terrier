	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate areas of the brain responsible for self-regulation in adult women who have never had an eating disorder with women who have bulimia nervosa. More specifically, investigators are interested in changes in brain activation (e.g., changes in blood flow and oxygen use) when inhibiting responses and regulating emotions. Data collection will rely on a technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).</brief_summary>
