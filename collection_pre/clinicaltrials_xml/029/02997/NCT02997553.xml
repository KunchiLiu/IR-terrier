	<brief_summary>This is a single-center prospective clinical trial to evaluate non-inferiority of indocyanine green guided sentinel lymph node biopsy compared with the gold standard Technecium99 guided sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with cancers and subjected to surgery. The diagnostic performance and the tolerance of indocyanine green (ICG) to the radio-isotope (Techniciun99) in the detection of sentinel lymph nodes will be assess using an "Optonuclear" probe (EURORAD S.A.).</brief_summary>
