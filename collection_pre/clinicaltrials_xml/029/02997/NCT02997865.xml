	<brief_summary>This study evaluates stepped care for depression in patients with heart failure (HF). The stepped care intervention includes cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), plus antidepressant medication when indicated. Half of the participants will receive stepped care and half will receive usual care for depression; all participants will receive heart failure self-care education and support. The primary aims are to determine whether stepped care is superior to usual care for depression, and whether treating depression improves heart failure self-care outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stepped Care for Depression in Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is associated with poor heart failure self-care. Good self-care practices, including following dietary recommendations, taking prescribed medications, monitoring symptoms, and regular light exercise have been shown to improve quality of life and survival in persons with heart failure. Both CBT and antidepressant medications have been used in previous studies to treat major depression in patients with heart failure. Participants in the intervention arm in this trial will start with CBT. Those who do not improve very much within the first 5-10 weeks of CBT may also be given an FDA-approved antidepressant medication. Heart failure self-care education and support will be provided after the depression intervention. The study will determine whether people with heart failure benefit more from self-care education and support after their depression has been treated with a stepped care intervention, as compared to usual care for depression as provided by primary care providers.</detailed_description>
