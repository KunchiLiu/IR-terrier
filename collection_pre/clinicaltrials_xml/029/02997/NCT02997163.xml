	<brief_title>An Open-Label Pharmacokinetics and Safety Study of Talazoparib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At the End of the Study, patients with no clinically significant toxicities, no contraindications to continue treatment with talazoparib, and no disease progression (underlying cancer progression) may be eligible to continue talazoparib treatment in a separate open-label extension study after discussion with the Principal Investigator and obtaining Sponsor permission. Sponsor decision to allow the patient to continue dosing with talazoparib in an open-label extension study will be based on potential overall benefit-risk, patient acceptance and other relevant criteria.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Signed and dated informed consent form (by the patient or a legally acceptable representative as per the local regulations) obtained prior to initiation of any studyspecific procedure and treatment. 2. Female or male of at least 18 years of age. 3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumor with no available standard approved treatment options in the opinion of the Investigator 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status (PS) ≤ 2. 5. Expected life expectancy of ≥ 3 months. 6. Able to swallow the study drug (no contra indication to oral agents). 7. Renal function at screening and enrollment as defined by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. 8. Patient has had no clinically significant change in renal status within 3 months prior to screening, according to Investigator's review of clinical patient records. 9. Patient is not currently on hemodialysis and/or peritoneal dialysis for management of chronic kidney disease or acute failure/conditions. 10. Patient has no unstable renal function, defined as a change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (calculated with the MDRD equation) of &gt; 25% for patients with mild and moderate renal impaired or as a change in eGFR &gt; 30% for patients with severe renal impaired, from screening to enrollment. 11. Adequate other organ function at screening and enrollment. 12. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and must agree to use a highly effective birth control method from the time of the first dose of study drug through 45 days after the last dose of study drug. 13. Male patients must agree to use a condom when having sex with a pregnant woman or with a nonpregnant female partner of childbearing potential, from 21 days before the first dose of study drug through 105 days after last dose of study drug. 14. Female patients must not be breastfeeding at screening nor during the study participation until 45 days after the last dose of study drug. 15. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other trial procedures. 1. Treatment within 14 days or five half lives prior to enrollment with any type of systemic anticancertherapy or any investigational drug, whichever is longer. 2. Have not recovered (recovery is defined as CTCAE grade ≤ 1) from the acute toxicities of previous anticancer standard or investigational therapy, except treatmentrelated alopecia or laboratory abnormalities otherwise meeting eligibility requirements. 3. Major surgery within 28 days prior to enrollment. 4. Serious accompanying cardiac disorder. 5. Active known or suspected brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease undergoing or requiring treatment. 6. Symptomatic or impending spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome. 7. Has undergone a liver transplant, kidney transplant or nephrectomy. 8. Prior allergic reaction or severe intolerance (meeting the criteria for a serious adverse event, a grade 3 or 4 AE, or permanent treatment discontinuation) to a poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. 9. Known myelodysplastic syndrome. 10. Seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 11. Any serious or unstable medical condition that interferes with ability to tolerate treatment or assessments associated with the protocol. 12. Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption. 13. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the talazoparib capsule components. 14. Any condition or reason that interferes with ability to participate in the study, tolerate treatment or assessments associated with the protocol, causes undue risk, or complicates the interpretation of safety data, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor.</criteria>
