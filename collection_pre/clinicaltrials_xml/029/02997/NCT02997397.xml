	<brief_title>A Novel Tourniquet Technic for Massive PPH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this retrospective comparative study, the investigators compared the peripartum features of patients who experienced profuse postpartum bleeding during C/S and this novel atraumatic tourniquet technique was used and not used. In this technique; the uterus is exteriorized following the delivery of the baby and before the removal of the placenta to be able to apply the tourniquet technique. In this technique it is not obligatory to push the bladder before the procedure. Afterwards, the surgeon and the assistant palpate the ureters with both hands in the two sheaths of broad ligament and try to hear a 'click' sound which comes from ureter sliding out between both fingers. After confirming that the ureters are not in the surgical site, an atraumatic vascular DeBakey clamp is applied widely including both the infundibulopelvic ligament and uterine arteries. Thus, two-sided blood supply of the uterus is reduced significantly and this gives the surgeon some time, for planning further surgical procedures and also serves a minimal bloody surgical site. If the avascular state of the surgical site is needed for a prolonged time, for instance while preparing for a blood transfusion or while waiting until an experienced surgeon is available, the clamps were opened and closed intermittently for a maximum of 10 minutes, as to sustain the blood supply of the ovaries and the uterus.</detailed_description>
