	<brief_summary>MERLIN is an adaptive, single arm, multi-centre, phase IIa multi-disease clinical trial. It is designed to: i) Determine dose safety of ORBCEL-C (selected Mesenchymal stromal cells derived from human umbilical cord) ii) Evaluate treatment activity through assessment of biomarkers This trial has two main stages: - Stage 1 will determine the maximum tolerated dose that can be administered by observing for occurrence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT). - Stage 2 will use the maximum tolerated dose found in stage 1 to and further determine safety and activity outcomes of ORBCEL-C. Upon completion of this trial we hope to be able to justify and conduct separate, larger scale trials using ORBCEL-C.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MERLIN is an adaptive, single arm, multi-centre, phase IIa multi-disease clinical trial. It is designed to: i) Determine dose safety of ORBCEL-C (selected Mesenchymal stromal cells derived from human umbilical cord) ii) Evaluate treatment activity through assessment of biomarkers This trial has two main stages: - Stage 1 will determine the maximum tolerated dose that can be administered by observing for occurrence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT). - Stage 2 will use the maximum tolerated dose found in stage 1 to and further determine safety and activity outcomes of ORBCEL-C. Upon completion of this trial we hope to be able to justify and conduct separate, larger scale trials using ORBCEL-C. OBJECTIVES For Both PSC and AIH patients The primary objective of Stage 1 is: • To determine the maximum tolerated single intravenous infusion dose of ORBCEL-C over a 14-day reporting period to take forward to Stage 2 of the clinical trial (study). All patients who have been recruited to and completed the 14-day reporting period in stage 1 will continue to be evaluated for outcomes as per Stage 2. The primary objectives of Stage 2 are to investigate whether a single intravenous infusion of ORBCEL-C in patients with PSC and AIH: • Is safe and tolerated over the period of trial follow up (up to 56 days) For PSC patients only • Reduces serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in patients with PSC. This is a non-invasive biochemical surrogate of clinical outcomes in PSC For AIH patients only • Reduces serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in patients with AIH. This is a non-invasive biochemical surrogate marker of hepatic inflammatory activity and outcomes in AIH. The secondary objectives of Stage 2 are to investigate whether a single intravenous infusion of ORBCEL-C elicits a change over the duration of the study after treatment in patients with PSC and AIH: - Liver biochemistry and function, immunoglobulin G concentrations (in AIH patients) and composite risk scores - Non-invasive clinical markers of fibrosis - Patient quality of life (QoL) - Severity of co-existent IBD in patients with PSC. Further exploratory research objectives of the trial determine whether MSC infusion modulates the immune response by measuring whether treatment elicits a change in patients with PSC and AIH: - Markers of immune activation including immunoglobulin values and C-reactive protein concentration - Markers of biliary injury including total bile acid levels - Circulating inflammatory cells profile this includes phenotypic expression of T regulatory cells (Tregs) a common mechanistic primary endpoint - Endothelial cell activation markers such as VAP-1 and ICAM1 - Serum cytokine, chemokine, microRNA and RNA expression profiles</detailed_description>
