	<brief_summary>NIL-2 is a clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low doses of Interleukin2 in the treatment of recently diagnosed, steroid dependent idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children. Recent data suggest that Interleukin 2 could be an effective therapy via an increased production of regulatory T cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Steroid Dependent Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome in Children With Low Doses of Interleukin 2: a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will include 10 children (age: 3-15 years old). Patients will receive low doses of Interleukin 2 (0.5 million UI/m²/ injection, subcutaneously).
