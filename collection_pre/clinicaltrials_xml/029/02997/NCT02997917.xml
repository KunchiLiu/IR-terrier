	<brief_summary>The effect of education on the responses to a probe meal (250 mL vegetable soup cooked at low temperature and 25 g bread) will be studied in a parallel design. The effects of education will be tested in two different groups in random order: real versus sham education. In each group the responses to a probe meal will be tested on 2 different days before and after the intervention. Participants will be instructed to eat a standard dinner the day before, to consume a standard breakfast at home after overnight fast, and to report to the laboratory, where the probe meal will be administered 3 h after breakfast. Studies will be conducted in a quiet, isolated room with participants sitting on a chair. Perception will be measured at 5 min intervals 10 min before and 20 min after ingestion and at 10 min intervals up to 60 min after the probe meal.</brief_summary>
