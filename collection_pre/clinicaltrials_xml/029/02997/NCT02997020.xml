	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to establish the novel endoscopically-directed sinus potential difference (EDSPD) assay as an endpoint for therapy of sinus disease. This assay provides a means to measure Cl- secretion across the sinus epithelium in human subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and test the relationship between this data and endoscopic findings of inflammation. The technique is appropriate for investigating acquired CFTR dysfunction in sinus epithelium and examining the therapeutic potential of CFTR potentiators for CRS.</detailed_description>
