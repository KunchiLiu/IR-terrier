	<brief_summary>The long-term goal of this study is to evaluate cognitive function preoperatively and develop techniques of intervention in the perioperative period which would optimize brain function and functional recovery following surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>fMRI Connectivity in Fracture Hip Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this protocol, subjects who are anticipated to be operated for hip fracture will be studied after surgery. Brief cognitive exam will be done followed by fMRI of connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Connectivity (neuronal changes) and DTI (Anisotropy and mean diffusivity) data will be compared with age matched controls and correlated with subjective measures of cognition.</detailed_description>
