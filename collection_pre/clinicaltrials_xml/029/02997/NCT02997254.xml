	<brief_summary>This is a cohort study to evaluate algorithms for mapping atrial fibrillation and for detecting rotational activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COMParison of Algorithms for Rotational Evaluation in Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigators will analyze electrograms collected routinely at clinical electrophysiology study (EPS) in patients undergoing ablation for atrial fibrillation. These electrograms will be recorded from a variety of clinically approved catheters under standard of care conditions, and will be analyzed to better understand the mechanisms for atrial fibrillation and its relationship to outcomes. The investigators anticipate analyzing data from 200 patients through December 2017.</detailed_description>
