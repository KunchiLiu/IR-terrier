	<brief_summary>Many patients with endometriosis experience extra genital and abdominal symptoms as a major part of their problem. This includes gastrointestinal dysfunction with pain, urinary symptoms compatible with interstitial cystitis and gastrointestinal symptoms resembling the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Such problems may be secondary to changes in autonomous neuronal structure and function elicited by the endometriotic elements, which may cause a "visceral syndrome" with the above mentioned symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that dietary treatment will improve the experience of gastrointestinal symptoms, pain and quality of life in patients with endometriosis-related irritable bowel syndrome. The aim of this first randomized, placebo controlled pilot study investigating patients with both endometriosis and IBS, is to test the application of a low FODMAP diet and a placebo diet for endometriosis-related IBS-like symptoms in order to stablish a platform for a randomized controlled study. Thus, the primary aim of this pilot study is to investigate the applicability of a placebo diet in patients with endometriosis and to investigate the compliance in both intervention group and control group. In addition, the aim is to investigate whether the participants find the diet manageable and whether they are able to identify the placebo diet.</brief_summary>
