	<brief_summary>Currently, partial nephrectomy (PN) is considered as the gold standard treatment modality for small renal masses. In this setting, robot-assisted and conventional laparoscopic approaches are gaining more consensus every day. However, until now, no superiority of one technique over the other has yet been demonstrated, especially on postoperative function recovery. This study compares oncological and functional outcomes after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy versus robot assisted partial nephrectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Oncological and Functional Outcomes After Robot Assisted Partial Nephrectomy Versus Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents 2-3% of all cancers, with the highest incidence in Western countries. Due to increased detection of tumors by ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT), the number of incidentally diagnosed RCCs has increased. These tumors are usually smaller and of lower stage. Currently, partial nephrectomy (PN) is considered as the gold standard treatment modality for small renal masses. In this setting, robot-assisted and conventional laparoscopic approaches are gaining more consensus every day. However, until now, no superiority of one technique over the other has yet been demonstrated, especially on postoperative function recovery. This is a single center prospective randomized trial investigating the functional and oncological outcomes of minimally invasive (laparoscopic and robot-assisted) nephron sparing surgery. Patients will be assessed with renal scintigraphy and 24 hours creatinine clearance pre- and postoperatively. Furthermore, duration of the operation, resection and suturing times will be assessed. Renal function recovery is defined as primary endpoint; oncological outcome and positive surgical margin rate are defined as secondary measures. In addition, kidney volume variation will be calculated to describe the amount of healthy tissue preserved in both procedures.The aim of the study is to assess whether robot assisted partial nephrectomy in selective ischemia is superior to laparoscopic partial nephrectomy in global ischemia in terms of functional and oncological outcomes.</detailed_description>
