	<brief_summary>This is a small observational study investigating the physical changes that occur to epidural catheters after insertion for obstetric anaesthesia. Using the observed physical changes as a correlate for the position of the catheter in the patient we will investigate a connection between the position and e function during labour. This information may be useful in guiding the physicians responses to epidurals that do not provide adequate analgesia to aid in deciding on the most appropriate action</brief_summary>
