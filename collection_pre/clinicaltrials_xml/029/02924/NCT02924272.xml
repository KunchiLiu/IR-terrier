	<brief_title>Ixazomib Rollover Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called ixazomib. This study will look at the long term safety profile of ixazomib in participants who have previously received and tolerated ixazomib in a Millennium-sponsored clinical study, and in the investigator's opinion and confirmed by the Millennium medical monitor, may benefit from continued ixazomib therapy. The study will enroll approximately 250 patients. All participants will receive ixazomib at same dose and schedule that they were receiving in the parent study until they experience disease progression, clinical deterioration in the investigator's judgment, experience an unacceptable toxicity, withdraw consent, pursue an alternative therapy, meet other study-specified reasons for discontinuation of study drug, or until ixazomib is available to the participant through commercial channels, including reimbursement for the participant's indication, whichever is sooner. This multicenter, rollover study will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 7 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and a final visit after 30 days of last dose of ixazomib for a safety assessment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of standard medical care. Participants should consent and enter the study within a maximum of 8 weeks of their last dose of ixazomib in the parent study or as agreed by the Millennium clinician/designee. 2. Previously treated with ixazomib (excluding comparator or placebo participants not on current treatment with ixazomib) in a Millenniumsponsored study. Participants will be eligible to enter the rollover study when: 1. The parent study is closed or planned to be closed; and 2. The participant is on ixazomib monotherapy or on a drug combination with another medication, established while in his/her parent study; and 3. In the opinion of the investigator and confirmed by the Millennium medical monitor, the participant may continue to benefit from treatment with ixazomib (eg, response to therapy or stable disease without evidence of disease progression). 1. The participant meets any of the criteria for treatment discontinuation in the parent study.</criteria>
