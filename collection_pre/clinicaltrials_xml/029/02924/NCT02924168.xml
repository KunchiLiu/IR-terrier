	<brief_summary>This is a double blind randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of radial shock waves on functional recovery of the upper limb of patients with sequelae of ischemic strokes in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. A total of 20 patients will be enrolled and will undergo motor, functional and cortical excitability evaluations before and after four weekly sessions of radial shockwaves. 5,000 pulses with a frequency of 15 Hz and 3.5 to 4 bar of air pressure will be applied to the active group, resulting in an energy flux density (EFD) of approximately 0.07 mJ/mm2. The sham group will receive identical treatment, except for the fact that no energy flux will be applied.</brief_summary>
