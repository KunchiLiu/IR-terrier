Have evidence of an active disruptive psychological or psychiatric disorder or other known condition significant enough to impact perception of pain, compliance of intervention, and/or ability to evaluate treatment outcomes. Have an existing drug pump and/or SCS system or another active implantable device such as a pacemaker, deep brain stimulator (DBS), or sacral nerve stimulator (SNS). Have prior experience with SCS. Have an active systemic infection or local infection in the area of the surgical site.
