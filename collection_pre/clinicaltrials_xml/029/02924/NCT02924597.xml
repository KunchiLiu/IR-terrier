	<criteria>patients with sporadic, unilateral, newly diagnosed T1a presumed renal cell carcinoma patients scheduled for robotassisted laparoscopic nephron sparing surgery patients with normal contralateral renal function (diﬀerential renal function of &gt;40% as determined by radionuclide scintigraphy) patients agreeable to participate in this longterm followup study patients' aged &gt;80 years patients with other renal diseases,(including kidney stone, glomerular nephritis, etc.) which might affect the renal function of the operative kidney patients not able to tolerate the robotassisted laparoscopic procedure patients with previous renal surgery or history of any inﬂammatory conditions of the operative kidney patients with the renal tumor involving urinary collecting system</criteria>
