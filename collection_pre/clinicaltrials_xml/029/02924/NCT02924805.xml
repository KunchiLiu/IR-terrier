	<brief_title>Telemedical Versus Conventional Emergency Care of Hypertensive Emergencies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Telemedically guided cases of hypertensive emergencies (april 2014 - March 2015) and urgencies are compared with a historical control group of conventional emergency medical service physician care on-scene for these scenarios. The historical control group is a time period prior to implementation of the telemedicine system and after a research project with a precursor telemedicine system. No telemedical support but only conventional on-scene EMS physician care was available (November 2013 - March 2014).</detailed_description>
