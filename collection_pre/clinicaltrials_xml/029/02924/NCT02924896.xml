	<brief_summary>Aims: To investigate whether acute ingestions of palm oil will have an effect on appetite regulation Design: A randomized, single blind, cross over design including 4 single study visits separated by a week. Visit 1 is an acclimatization visit followed by visit 2,3, and 4 where different types of fat will be given. Population: 12 healthy males and females aged between 18 and 60 years with body mass index (BMI) between 18.5- 29.9kg/m2 and normal fasting plasma glucose and no evidence of insulin resistance will be recruited. No-pre existing morbidity including cardiac, hepatic or renal disease, history of diabetes, hypertension or hyperlipidaemia. Treatment: Acclimatization visit: At visit 1, all participants will be given a milkshake like drink containing fat, protein and carbohydrate. A cannula will be inserted for the duration of the study day but no blood will be taken. Studies show than during the first visit stress response can affect the metabolic response to the study drink resulting in inaccurate results. Study visit 2,3,4: following the acclimatization visit, participants will attend 3 more study visits separated by a week to test the metabolic response to the following fats: palm olein, interesterified palm olein and soybean oil in random order. Participants will be asked to complete a visual analogue scale questionnaire about their appetite at each time point. Fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, appetite hormones and lipids will be measured.</brief_summary>
