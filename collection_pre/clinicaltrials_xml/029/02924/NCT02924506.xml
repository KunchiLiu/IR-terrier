	<brief_summary>Nowadays, there is no clinical and radiological study comparing two different types of mobile implants in patients requiring surgical treatment for symptomatic cervical disc disease. Thus, the choice of the ideal implant remains uncertain. The goal of this work is to compare the impact of two types of mobile implants in height drives, solicitation facets, positioning and collection of prostheses within the intervertebral spaces.</brief_summary>
