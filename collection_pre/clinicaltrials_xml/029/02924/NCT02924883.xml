	<brief_summary>This phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study will investigate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine in combination with atezolizumab or atezolizumab-placebo in participants with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have received prior trastuzumab and taxane based therapy, either alone or in combination, and/or who have progressed within 6 months after completing adjuvant therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Archival tumor samples must be obtained from primary and/or metastatic sites Able to submit tumor tissue that is evaluable for programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) expression HER2 positive breast cancer (BC) as defined by an immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 3 or gene amplified by insitu hybridization (ISH) as defined by a ratio of greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 2.0 for the number of HER2 gene copies to the number of chromosome 17 copies Histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive BC: incurable, unresectable, locally advanced BC previously treated with multimodality therapy or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) Prior treatment for BC in the: adjuvant; unresectable locally advanced; or metastatic settings; which must include both, a taxane and trastuzumab (alone or in combination with another agent) Progression must have occurred during or after most recent treatment for locally advanced BC/MBC or within 6 months after completing adjuvant therapy Participants must have measurable disease that is evaluable as per RECIST v1.1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1 Negative serum pregnancy test for premenopausal women and for women less than 12 months after the onset of menopause Use of highly effective method of contraception as defined by the protocol Prior treatment with trastuzumab emtansine, cluster of differentiation 137 (CD137) agonists, antiPD1, or antiPDL1 therapeutic antibody or pathwaytargeting agents Receipt of any anticancer drug/biologic or investigational treatment within 28 days prior to randomization except hormone therapy, which can be given up to 7 days prior to randomization; recovery of treatment related toxicity consistent with other eligibility criteria Radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 History of exposure to the cumulative doses of anthracyclines History of other malignancy within the previous 5 years, except for appropriately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, nonmelanoma skin carcinoma, Stage I uterine cancer, or participants who have undergone potentially curative therapy with no evidence of disease and are deemed by the treating physician to be at low risk for recurrence Cardiopulmonary dysfunction, symptomatic pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites Current severe, uncontrolled systemic disease Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to randomization or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of study treatment Clinically significant history of liver disease, including cirrhosis, current alcohol abuse, autoimmune hepatic disorders, sclerosis cholangitis or active infection with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus Need for current chronic corticosteroid therapy (&gt;/=10 mg of prednisone per day or an equivalent dose of other antiinflammatory corticosteroids) Spinal cord compression not definitively treated with surgery and/or radiation, or previously diagnosed and treated spinal cord compression without evidence that disease has been clinically stable for greater than (&gt;) 2 weeks prior to randomization Participants with known central nervous system disease History of autoimmume disease Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation Active tuberculosis Receipt of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomization or anticipation that such a live, attenuated vaccine will be required during the study Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or five halflives of the drug (whichever is shorter) prior to randomization Treatment with systemic corticosteroids or other systemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to randomization, or anticipated requirement for systemic immunosuppressive medications during the trial.</criteria>
