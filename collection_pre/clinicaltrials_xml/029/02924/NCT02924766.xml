	<criteria>Greater than (&gt;)18 years of age (or higher legal age of consent in the jurisdiction in which the study is taking place) At least 1 line of prior taxanebased chemotherapy At least 1 line of prior Androgen Receptor (AR) targeted therapy Progression of metastatic prostate cancer in the setting of castrate levels of testosterone less than equal to (&lt;=)50 nanogram per deciliter (ng/dL) on a gonadotropin releasing hormone analog (GnRHa), or history of bilateral orchiectomy at study entry defined as having one or more of the following: (a) Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) progression defined by a minimum of 2 rising PSA levels with an interval of greater than equal to (&gt;=)1 week between each determination. The PSA level at the screening visit should be &gt;=2 microgram per liters (mcg/L) [2 ng/mL], (b) Radiographic progression of soft tissue or bone disease by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria Must continue gonadotropin releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) during the course of the study if not surgically castrate Prior treatment with a poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor Known history or current diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) Known symptomatic or impending cord compression, except if participant has received definitive treatment for this and demonstrates evidence of clinically stable disease Presence of uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] &gt;160 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) or diastolic BP &gt;100 mmHg). Participants with a history of hypertension are allowed, provided that BP is controlled to within these limits by antihypertensive treatment Current or prior treatment with antiepileptic medications for the treatment of seizures</criteria>
