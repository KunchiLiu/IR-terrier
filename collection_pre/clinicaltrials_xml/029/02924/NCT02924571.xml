	<brief_summary>The aim of this investigation is to compare the use of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) and allograft versus to recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP) in subjects undergoing elective thoracolumbar spinal fusion with interbody support. The investigators will look at the safety and efficacy of these two different surgical methods by assessing surgery outcomes and participants' quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMAC &amp; Allograft vs BMP-2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, there are many available orthopaedic graft adjuncts which each have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, although effective, BMPs are very expensive and have a risk of side effects. The use of BMAC may be a good alternative to the use of BMPs, and may not have the same side effects. Subjects who are scheduled for an elective spinal fusion and are enrolled in the study will be assigned to receive either BMP or BMAC. Subjects will be asked to complete questionnaires relating to quality of life, use of pain killers, and overall health, as well as have standard radiographic studies to examine the spine pre- and post-surgically. Subjects will attend 7 visits, which happen at the same time as the standard of care visits they would normally attend for their condition. Subjects will be followed in the study for 2 years in total.</detailed_description>
