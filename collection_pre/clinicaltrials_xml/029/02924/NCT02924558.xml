	<brief_title>Metabolic Effects of Egg Protein and Unsaturated Fat Intakes in Subjects With Hypertriglyceridemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of a combination of egg protein and unsaturated fatty acids acting as substitutes for ~16% of energy from refined carbohydrate on the metabolic profile of men and women with elevated triglycerides. This is a randomized, controlled feeding, crossover trial that includes two screening/baseline visits, two 3-week treatment conditions, and a 2-week washout phase. Subjects consume a standardized background diet (7-day rotating menu) that incorporates at least 3 servings/day of study test foods, providing 40-60% of subjects' daily energy needs. Study test foods consist of yogurt, muffins, waffles, and cookies. The test foods account for 8% higher protein energy (from egg protein) and 8% higher fat energy (from unsaturated fatty acids) in the Active Condition compared to the Control Condition. In the Control Condition, the study foods account for 16% higher carbohydrate energy. The overall macronutrient composition of each condition is as follows: Active Condition, approximately 42/23/35% kcal from carbohydrate/protein/fat, respectively, and Control Condition, approximately 58/15/27% kcal from carbohydrate/protein/fat, respectively. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and end of treatment for measurement of metabolic parameters, and a liquid meal tolerance test (LMTT) will be conducted at baseline and the end of each treatment period.</detailed_description>
