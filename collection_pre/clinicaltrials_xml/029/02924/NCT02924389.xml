	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out how well the HIV medication dolutegravir gets into different parts of the body: including blood plasma, special blood cells, and rectal tissue. Specifically, investigators want to compare how fast dolutegravir lowers the HIV viral load in these three different sites. In addition, investigators seek to learn if there are any differences in how dolutegravir acts in males and females. Results of this study will provide more information about HIV medications and their limitations. In the future, this could help create better HIV medications that can get into these hard-to-reach places and eventually cure HIV infection.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to find out how well the HIV medication dolutegravir gets into different parts of the body: including blood plasma, special blood cells, and rectal tissue. Specifically, investigators want to compare how fast dolutegravir lowers the HIV viral load in these three different sites. In addition, investigators seek to learn if there are any differences in how dolutegravir acts in males and females. Results of this study will provide more information about HIV medications and their limitations. In the future, this could help create better HIV medications that can get into these hard-to-reach places and eventually cure HIV infection. The primary aim of this study is to validate the integrated population PK-VD model that quantitatively describes the relationship between dolutegravir (DTG) exposure and HIV viral decay in blood plasma. The second aim of this study is to develop an integrated population pharmacokinetic-viral dynamic (PK-VD) model to describe the relationship between DTG exposure and HIV viral decay in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and rectal tissue reservoir sites. The third aim is exploratory and will investigate sex differences in DTG penetration into blood plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and rectal tissue reservoirs reservoirs as well as its impact on the rectal microbiome.</detailed_description>
