	<brief_title>Spinal Morphine in Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized controlled trial. It will randomize 160 patients who are scheduled for Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy. The intervention group will receive a single spinal injection of a bupivacaine (12,5 mg)/morphine(300 mcg) mixture. Controlgroup will receive a subcutaneous injection of lidoca√Øne for placebo purposes and an intravenous loading dose of morphine at the end of surgery. Both groups will receive general anesthesia during surgery in a standardized fashion. After the surgery, both groups will receive a Patient-Controlled Analgesia pump for post-operative pain control. Primary outcome is patient satisfaction as measured by the Quality-of-Recovery-15 questionnaire. This questionnaire will be taken at baseline, day 2 and 1 week after surgery. Secundary outcomes are morphine use per PCA, duration of hospital stay, side-effects and ease of surgery.</detailed_description>
