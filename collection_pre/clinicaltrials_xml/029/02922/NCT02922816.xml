	<brief_summary>Transplant patients are at increased risk of colonization and infection with Multidrug Resistant Organisms (MDROs) due to medications that modify their immune systems, increased healthcare and antibiotic exposure, and surgical manipulation of mucosa. In this study, kidney transplant patients who have infections with resistant bacteria will be given a Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT), also known as a fecal transplant, after they receive antibiotic treatment. This study will see if FMT will eliminate the resistant bacteria so that the kidney transplant patients do not have to use last resort antibiotics. This Phase 1 pilot study is to obtain preliminary safety data for FMT in renal transplant patients to support the rationale for a subsequent clinical trial, not to establish efficacy or toxicity. This trial is designed to test the safety of FMT, identify clinical outcomes, assess feasibility, and refine the target population in participants with MDRO colonization and intestinal dysbiosis. Data from this study should provide directions for the design of future clinical trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FMT for MDRO Colonization After Infection in Renal Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Potential participants who meet key eligibility criteria [adults who have undergone renal transplantation and have a history of infection with the Target Multidrug Resistant Organisms (MDRO)] will be approached for consideration of study participation. For this study, Target MDRO colonization is defined as a positive bacterial culture of either carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBL), and/or multidrug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas from perirectal swab sampling. The 20 trial participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two arms: the control arm [not receiving Allogeneic Human Stool in Glycerol (10%; AHSG) via Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT)] and the experimental arm (receiving AHSG via FMT). Participants in the control arm participants can crossover to receive the treatment after completing a study cycle without FMT. Each cycle lasts 6 weeks and participants will complete a maximum of 2 treatment cycles; participants randomized to the experimental arm will complete a maximum of two cycles and those randomized to the control arm will complete up to three cycles. Upon completion of the final cycle, all trial participants will be followed for just over 6 months. In addition to the trial participants, there will also be one stool donor participant. The consented, screened, and eligible stool donor will be identified from an established group of stool donors and will undergo screening procedures that are specific to this study. This individual will donate human stool for the preparation of the AHSG (known as the IND product for this study). Upon processing of AHSG, the stool donor will enter the Follow-Up Period and remain available for communication to the study team (if necessary) until the Study Completion Date. However, no scheduled study assessments are required of the stool donor.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Ability and willingness to comply with study protocol requirements and receive the IND product via rectal retention enema, which was manufactured from a preselected stool donor participant. History of MDRO infection with at least one of the following Target MDROs: CRE, VRE, ESBL, or MDR Pseudomonas. Not on systemic antibiotics for any reason other than if MDRO infection was recent and potential participant is still taking antibiotics for target MDRO at time of screening. If the latter, then participant must complete antibiotic course by Study Day 2 Periectal swab sampling with a positive Target MDRO (e.g CRE, VRE, ESBL, and/or MDR Pseudomonas) result within two weeks prior to enrollment, confirmed by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory. Prior receipt of a living or deceased donor renal transplant. Performance status of either: American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) Classification Score of IIII, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 02, or Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) of 50100%. At least one prior course of systemic antibiotics since renal transplant. If applicable, willingness to discontinue probiotics or other microbiota restoration therapies during screening at least seven days prior to the first intervention. The effects of FMT on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.
