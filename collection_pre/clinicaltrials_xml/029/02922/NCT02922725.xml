	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to determine if 8 weeks of dietary augmentation with oral 5g creatine monohydrate daily and 100 mg of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) twice daily reduces hypoxia-related depressive symptoms measured by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) in women with SSRI- or SNRI-resistant depression, combined with the examination of changes in functional connectivity based on resting-state fMRI and changes in brain metabolism inferred from phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Placebo-controlled Trial of 5-hydroxytryptophan and Creatine for SSRI or SNRI Augmentation in Treatment Resistant Depression in Females</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Serotonin and creatine are processed separately in the brain, and deficits in these brain biochemicals lead to distinct clinical problems. Therefore, investigators believe that treatment with a combination therapy, which could correct both deficits, would have a synergistic effect in the treatment of hypoxia-related depression and possibly other forms of treatment-resistant depression. Thus, investigators propose to investigate antidepressant efficacy of dietary 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and creatine, as a means to restore the brain neurotransmitter and metabolic imbalances linked to chronic hypoxia caused by high altitude residence.</detailed_description>
