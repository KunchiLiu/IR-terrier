	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if Panhematin is safe and effective for prevention of acute attacks of porphyria. The study aims to provide high quality evidence for the use on hemin for prevention of acute attacks of porphyria. A separate study is in progress to evaluate the use of Panhematin for treatment of acute attacks of porphyria. Such studies have not been done previously for treating or preventing acute attacks with hemin. The lack of strong evidence for efficacy of hemin for treatment and prevention of attacks limits its availability for patients with acute porphyrias.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Panhematin for Prevention of Acute Attacks of Porphyria Panhematin for Prevention of Acute Attacks of Porphyria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial investigating the efficacy and safety of Panhematin™ for preventing acute attacks in at least 20 patients with well-documented acute porphyria (acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria or variegate porphyria). These patients will (1.) have had frequent attacks in the past, with symptoms such as abdominal, back and/or limb pain and diagnosed after exclusion of other causes, and (2.) be on hemin prophylaxis for prevention of frequent attacks. It is expected that patients will have had 6 or more attacks in one year before starting hemin prophylaxis. This would be considered justification for a preventive regimen of hemin on clinical grounds. A single double blind dose of Panhematin™ or placebo will be given. An interim analysis will be carried out after completion of 10 patients to assess progress and possibly adjust the sample size. The trial consists of the following: - A screening visit to determine eligibility and obtain informed consent - A treatment visit for administration of a double blind prophylactic dose of Panhematin™ or placebo - Follow up visit at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks to assess response to the infusion of Panhematin™ or placebo. These visits will be in person or by telephone. - Additional visits may be scheduled if needed, for example for treatment of symptoms. - Follow-up visits 3 and 6 months after the end of treatment either in person or by telephone Patients will have laboratory documentation of one of the acute porphyrias. Molecular documentation is also expected, although rarely a causative mutation cannot be detected. Upon entry into the study they will be given in a blinded fashion a single preventive dose of either Panhematin™ (4 mg/kg) or placebo. A recurrent attack within the next 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks will represent treatment failures. Because at study entry most patients are expected to be on weekly prophylactic hemin treatment, and hemin is a short-acting drug, emphasis in the analysis will be on attacks occurring within 1 week after study treatment. Any attacks that occur during the study will be treated according to standard of care, which may include Panhematin™, either at the study site or at the patient's usual treatment location. It is intended that 20 patients will complete treatment with a single blinded dose and at least 4 weeks of follow up. A completed patient is one who meets all entrance criteria, has no exclusion criteria and completes the single dosing and at least one week of follow up, or is withdrawn because of an adverse event.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female aged 18 years 2. Willing to provide written informed consent 3. A diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria or variegate porphyria confirmed by the following criteria, which are based on the criteria for enrollment in the Longitudinal Study of the Porphyrias Consortium. For each type of porphyria, the inclusion criteria are based on 1) clinical features, 2) biochemical findings, as documented by laboratory reports (or copies) of porphyriaspecific testing, and 3) molecular studies to identify a mutation in a porphyriarelated gene. Equivocal biochemical measurements may require confirmatory testing. Testing for a diseasecausing mutation must be attempted, but an identified mutation is not essential for enrollment, since it is known that a mutation cannot be found in a small fraction (&lt;5%) of biochemically proven cases of porphyria. 1. Symptoms such as abdominal, back or limb pain are explained by another condition, as judged by the investigator 2. Known or suspected allergy to Panhematin™ or related products 3. A known or suspected allergy to human albumin 4. Any disease or condition that the investigator judges would lead to an unacceptable risk to the patient or interfere with the successful collection of data for the trial 5. Previous randomization in this trial</criteria>
