	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the impact of soft tissue grafts on soft tissue recession following immediate implant, provisional and bone graft placement in compromised sockets. One third of the patients received a collagen matrix (CM group), another third received a connective tissue graft removed from the palate (CTG group) and the final third did not receive any soft tissue graft (CTL group).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Soft Tissue Grafts on Tissue Alterations After Immediate Tooth Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preventing soft tissue recession following flapless immediate implant and provisional placement (IIPP) in sockets with facial bone dehiscences is a challenge, mainly in esthetic areas. This study evaluated the impact of soft tissue grafts on peri-implant alterations after 1-year follow-up. Twenty-four patients with one single failing maxillary incisor presenting facial bone dehiscence and receiving IIPP were randomly divided in three groups (n= 8 in each group): Control (CTL); Collagen Matrix (CM); Connective tissue graft (CTG). In addition to soft tissue grafts, all groups were treated with collagen membrane and deproteinized bovine bone mineral containing 10% of porcine collagen. Clinical, photographic and tomographic analyses were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 months after surgery to evaluate tissue alterations.</detailed_description>
