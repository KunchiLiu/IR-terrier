	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this research proposal is to develop an adjunct to standard treatments that 'correct' disrupted neural circuitry in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Directly treating these core deficits via targeted behavioral training should slow the progression of PD, assure greater resilience against future decline, and improve the quality of life of many living with PD. The purpose of this exploratory research study is to determine the benefits, if any, of the mobile device-based treatment described above in individuals with PD.</brief_summary>
