	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Mat Pilates Exercises in Individuals With Chronic Nonspecific Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is evidence that exercises based on the Pilates method reduce pain in chronic nonspecific low back pain (CNLBP). However, is noticed the lack of studies that compare the effectiveness of mat Pilates to no intervention in the treatment of individual with CNLBP. Therefore, the main objective of the study is to analyze the effectiveness of mat Pilates compared to no intervention in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain. It is a randomized controlled trial with two arms and double blinded (caregiver, assessor and outcome assessor), composed of 30 patients, aged between 18- 65 years (Â±22,47) of both sexes, diagnosed with chronic non-specific low back pain persisting for more than three months and pain intensity greater than 3 points in the Pain Numerical Rating Scale. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: Pilates Group (n = 15), intervention based on mat Pilates exercises, and Control Group (n =15) with no intervention. The mat Pilates group performed 16 sessions, twice a week in 60-minute duration each throughout eight weeks, whereas the control group participants kept usual cares until the end of the intervention. Both groups were evaluated before and after the program by a researcher who was unaware of the patients' allocation. The primary assessed outcomes: pain intensity (Pain numerical rating scale, and McGill questionnaire), quality of life (SF-36), and disability (Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire). In addition, the strength and muscle activation of transverse abdominal as secondary outcome assessed through the Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback Unit test. As a result, the study infers that mat Pilates exercises have significantly improved all the evaluated outcomes. Thus, supporting clinical decisions for the treatment of chronic nonspecific low back pain.</detailed_description>
