	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, double blinded, pivotal trial to study the safety and efficacy of the WiSE-LV System for Cardiac Re-synchronization Therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stimulation Of the Left Ventricular Endocardium for Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Non-Responders and Previously Untreatable Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The WiSE-LV System is an implantable cardiac pacing system capable of delivering pacing energy to the left ventricle of the heart without using a pacing lead.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Heart Failure</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patient with a class I or IIa (1) or (2) indication for implantation of a (Cardiac Resychronization Defibrillator) CRTD device according to current available guidelines AND are either 'NonResponders' to Cardiac Resychronization Therapy (CRT) OR 'Previously Untreatable' (described below): NonResponder: Patients who have a CRT system that is functional and despite an adequate trial of Guideline Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) and attempts at optimal device programming the patient has not responded to therapy for a minimum of 6M. Nonresponse is defined as remaining clinically unchanged or worsened: 1. Ejection Fraction (EF) has remained unchanged or worsened, and 2. The patient's clinical status based in the totality of available clinical evidence (such as NYHA Class, exercise tolerance, QOL, or global assessment) has remained unchanged or worsened, as determined by the local Site Enrollment Committee. Previously Untreatable: Patients who have a full or partial CRT system, who meet general inclusion criteria and are deemed as 'previously untreatable' for one of the following reasons: 1. Patients in whom coronary sinus (CS) lead implantation for CRT has failed 2. CS lead implanted has been programmed off due any of the following: 3. High risk upgrades: relative contraindications to CS lead implant Pure Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) Left Ventriculart Diastolic Diameter (LVEDD) â‰¥ 8cm Nonambulatory or unstable NYHA class IV Contraindication to heparin, chronic anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents Triple anitcoagulant patients who cannot tolerate periprocedural stopping of anticoagulation therapy must be excluded Patients receiving lithotripsy treatment Attempted device implant (pacemaker, Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), CRT, Left ventricular (LV) lead) or successful coimplant within 1 month Life expectancy of &lt; 12 months Chronic hemodialysis Stage 4 or 5 renal dysfunction defined as Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) &lt;30 Grade 4 mitral valve regurgitation Noncardiac implanted electrical stimulation therapy devices Mechanical aortic valves or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) valves Unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) within the past 1 month Correctable valvular disease that is the primary cause of heart failure Recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) (within the previous 3 months) Persistent or permanent atrial arrhythmias (or cardioversion for atrial fibrillation) within the past month Already included in another clinical study that could confound the results of this study Pregnancy Known drug or alcohol addiction or abuse Moderate or severe aortic stenosis</criteria>
