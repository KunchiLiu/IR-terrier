	<brief_title>Desflurane Versus Total Intravenous Anesthesia in Ophthalmic Ambulatory Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Desflurane balanced anesthesia and total intravenous anesthesia(TIVA) are commonly used in ambulatory surgery, however, there was no clear evidence to discriminate the advantages and disadvantages between desflurane anesthesia and TIVA when used in ophthalmic ambulatory surgery. This study is designed to evaluate a better anesthesia method in ophthalmic surgery through a clinical study. This is a singlecenter, randomized, prospective study. 200 adult patients undergoing ophthalmic ambulatory surgery are enrolled in this study, and the patients are randomly and equally divided into two groups: Group TIVA(TIVA with propofol) and Group Des(desflurane).Group TIVA is maintained with propofol 50~150μg/kg/min,and remifentanil 0.1~0.5μg/kg/min, while group Des is maintained with desflurane ranged from 0.5~1.5 MAC. Both groups of patients' bispectral index(BIS) values are maintained at 40~60 intraoperatively. The primary outcome is awake time, the secondary outcomes include the stay time in the postoperative care unit, discharge time, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), incidence of postoperative agitation, quality of recovery in 1 day postoperatively, as well as anesthesia cost,etc.</detailed_description>
