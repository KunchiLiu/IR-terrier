	<brief_summary>The investigators intend to establish feasibility/acceptability of a pilot randomized trial comparing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and combined oral contraceptives (COCs) in women with premature ovarian insufficiency to estimate differences in quality of life (QOL) and serum hormone assays and markers of bone turnover/cardiovascular risk. At baseline, QOL survey will be administered and serum testing performed. Patients then randomized to HRT or COCs. Repeat testing will be performed after 3 and 6 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hormone Replacement for Premature Ovarian Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a term used to describe when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before the natural age of menopause. Early sequelae of POI include vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, mood swings and insomnia due to estrogen deficiency. Long-term sequelae such as loss of bone mineral density and cardiovascular risk carry are considerable concerns. While exogenous estrogen replacement is recommended for the POI patient population, the optimal regimen for replacement is not clear. One approach to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is to mimic physiologic ovarian function through full replacement doses of estrogen (either orally or transdermally) to reach the typical serum estradiol levels of a menstruating woman (approximately 104 pg/mL per day) with cyclic progestin therapy for endometrial protection. Another approach uses daily combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives (COCs), for ease of administration and increased social acceptability. To date, few studies have been performed comparing the two treatment methods in terms of quality of life measures (vasomotor symptoms, bleeding profile, sexual dysfunction, satisfaction with contraception), endocrine function, bone turnover or cardiovascular risk in POI patients. In this proposal, the investigators intend to establish feasibility and acceptability of a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing traditional HRT with COCs in women with POI and to evaluate differences in quality of life measures, hormone assays, bone turnover and cardiovascular risk between treatment arms. The investigators hypothesize that acceptability and feasibility of the pilot trial will be high and that differences will be detected for all measured variables between treatment arms. Demonstration of feasibility and acceptability of this pilot would allow for the pursuit of a larger trial and identification of a superior treatment regimen would have a meaningful impact on the short and long-term care of this patient population.</detailed_description>
