	<brief_summary>People over 55 years are high-risk with voice disorders. Voice disordered elderly need vocal training in order to improve communication efficiency and quality of life. However, participation in vocal training of elderly is often restricted by motivation, time of practice, and availability to hospital, which thus reduces treatment effects. The purpose of the study is to design a telecommunication vocal training system and a vocal training program for voice disordered elderly in Taiwan. The investigator proposed a 3-year consecutive study, including a single-blind, randomized controlled trial, to test the hypothesis that vocal training via telepractice for voice disordered elderly are not inferior to the standard face to face training.</brief_summary>
