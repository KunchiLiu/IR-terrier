	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to determine whether identifying patients with baseline cognitive deficits through preoperative cognitive screening may aid patient, family, and surgeon decision-making; inform and potentially improve anesthetic management and improve patient safety by identifying risk for postoperative morbidity. Aim 1. Assess the marginal benefit of structured preoperative cognitive screening relative to standard or systematic preoperative evaluation for identifying seniors with likely cognitive impairment. Aim 2. Determine whether preoperative cognitive impairment predicts postoperative outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Cognitive Screening in Older Thoracic and Spinal Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project is designed as a prospective, single-center observational study. The cohort will consist of 500 consenting subjects ≥ 65 years of age who present to the Brigham and Women's Hospital Weiner Center for Preoperative Evaluation (CPE) prior to elective thoracic surgery (specifically, thoracoscopic lung resection, lobectomy, thoracotomy, or esophagectomy) and to neurological posterior thoracolumbar spine surgery by neurosurgeons Dr. Groff, Dr. Lu and Dr. Chi. 250 subjects undergoing thoracic surgery will be recruited and 250 subjects undergoing neurological posterior thoracolumbar spine surgery will be recruited (500 total). These ages are chosen as significant clinical data demonstrate increased cognitive impairment in community dwelling elders. Eligibility criteria include: patients ≥ 65 years of age with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification of I-III presenting for elective thoracic surgery or spinal surgery. Exclusion criteria will include planned Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission postoperatively, history of stroke or brain tumor, uncorrected vision or hearing impairment (unable to see pictures or read or hear instructions); limited use of the dominant hand (limited ability to draw); and or inability to speak, read, or understand English. Patients will be introduced to the study through a flyer provided to them in their surgeon's office. A study team member will speak with those favorably predisposed to participate to determine if they satisfy eligibility criteria. After obtaining consent, study staff will gain information about the patient's age and years of education. Study staff will administer standard instruments to assess social support (MOS Social Support Survey, a 12-item self-report questionnaire) in thoracic surgical patients. The Modified Brief Pain Inventory Short-Form (mBPI-sf) will be administered to spinal surgical patients. Health and functional status activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), respectively, and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale [WHODAS]) will be administered to all surgical patients.The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 is an alternative to the 36-Item Rand Health Survey Short-Form (SF36) to measure physical health and disability. In addition, all patients will be asked if they've had a fall within the last 6 months, whether they've been evaluated for a change in memory or thinking, who accompanied them to their appointment, their employment status and their living situation (alone, institutionalized, living with family members) in a patient survey. The study staff will administer the MiniCog, a simple cognitive screening tool that takes just 2-4 min to complete and has little or no education, language, or race bias. In addition, the Animal Fluency test will be administered, which is a short cognitive screen that takes one minute to complete. Other measures of cognitive impairment will be obtained by study staff through: documentation on the patient's standard preoperative form, patient or informant report of diagnosis or evaluation for cognitive impairment or memory concerns, and systematic medical record review. Each enrolled patient will receive a business card listing the investigators' contact information and be advised to expect a follow up telephone up to 6 and 12 months after surgery to verify data elements and reassess functional outcome. Delirium will be assessed prospectively once per day on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 by a trained study team member using the Confusion Assessment Method [CAM]. For patients that are in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) postoperatively, the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) will be administered prospectively twice per day on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 by a trained study team member (Attachment-CAM-ICU). Delirium is most common on postoperative days 1-3 and the CAM is a well-validated measure of delirium in surgical patients. For functional status, the WHODAS will be administered 6-12 months postoperatively either by personnel in the surgeon's office as part of routine follow up or by study staff or by telephone. We will also collect information on secondary outcomes including presence of an advanced directive, whether they had surgical procedure, time to postoperative anesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge, discharge to place other than home (rehabilitation, skilled nursing facility), hospital length of stay (LOS), in hospital complications, anesthetic dosages (including bispectral index (BIS) information), estimated blood loss, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, 30-day reoperation or readmission rate, and 30-day and 1-year mortality. These outcomes are recorded in the medical record, the BWH Balanced Scorecard, an electronic database of all hospitalized patients that tabulates 31 elements of the hospital event, or the Brigham and Women's Hospital BWH Research Patient Database Enhanced Query. Data will also be confirmed by a follow up telephone interview.</detailed_description>
