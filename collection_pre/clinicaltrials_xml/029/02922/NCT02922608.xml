	<brief_summary>High fidelity simulation provide educational skills but the simulation of critical events could eventually provide anxiety among participants. The anxiety could raise before the simulation session and affect the perceived quality of sleep the night prior to the simulation session. The lack of sleep would eventually affect both participation and memorization during the simulation session. The investigators would like to investigate with a survey how much participants had their sleep affected before the simulation session.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High fidelity simulation provide educational skills but the simulation of critical events could eventually provide anxiety among participants. The anxiety could raise before the simulation session and affect the perceived quality of sleep the night prior to the simulation session. The lack of sleep would eventually affect both participation and memorization during the simulation session. The investigators would like to investigate with a survey how much participants had their quantity and quality of sleep affected before the simulation session.</detailed_description>
