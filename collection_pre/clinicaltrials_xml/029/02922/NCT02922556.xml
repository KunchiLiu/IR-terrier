	<brief_title>Piloting a Novel, Mobile Cognitive Training Tool for Patients With Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will involve a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial to assess the efficacy of a mobile-device-deployed cognitive emotional treatment for depression (Moodify) versus an active control treatment (commercially available computer games). Moodify is comprised of a novel continuous performance task (CPT) to improve cognitive slowing and lethargy often present in cases of major depressive disorder. This training method is based on an existing, validated cognitive training paradigm (tonic and phasic attention training, TAPAT1; WIRB Study No. 1126399). Moodify will also employ two additional cognitive training modules previously validated in this and other clinical populations.</detailed_description>
