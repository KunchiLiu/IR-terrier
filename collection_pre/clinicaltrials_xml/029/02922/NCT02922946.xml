	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of the timing of a moderate-fat meal on the single dose pharmacokinetics of entinostat and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of entinostat under fed and fasting conditions in healthy adult subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Determine the Effect of the Timing of a Meal on the Pharmacokinetics of Entinostat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 2-stage food effect (timing of the meal) study. A total of 48 subjects will be dosed if Stage 2 is conducted. Stage 1 will be conducted as an open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study. On Day 1 of each period, subjects will receive a single, oral dose of entinostat under fasting or fed conditions. If preliminary results in Stage 1 indicate that the timing of a meal exhibits significant effect on the bioavailability of entinostat, then Stage 2 will be conducted which will investigate the effect of a meal either before or after dosing of entinostat on entinostat PK. Stage 2 will be conducted as an open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover study. On Day 1 of each period, subjects will receive a single, oral dose of entinostat under fasting or fed conditions.</detailed_description>
