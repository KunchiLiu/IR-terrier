	<brief_summary>This study aims to create a database of patients with stable and chronic heart failure with comprehensive assessment of bone, skeletal and vascular status. RoC-HF will facilitate cross-sectional and, eventually, longitudinal mechanistic epidemiological analyses to disentangle the role of the bone- vascular axis in chronic heart failure. Blood and urine samples will be stored to facilitate future biomarker analyses.</brief_summary>
