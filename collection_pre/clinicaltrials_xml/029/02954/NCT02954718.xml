	<brief_summary>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is most common chronic rheumatic disease in childhood. The upper extremity involvement in JIA causes muscle imbalance, joint destruction, pain, stiffness and limitations on daily living activities (DLA) in varying degrees. However, the information about prevalence of symptoms, disorders, DLA limitations, participation restriction and options of treatments for upper extremity involvement in JIA are limited. It has been reported that improvements of upper extremity functions were achieved by video-based games (VBG) in various disease groups. However, in the literature, no study has been found about effectiveness of WBG in children with arthritis. The aim of the study was to investigate effects of task-oriented activity training (TOAT) with VBG versus activity training in real life on activity performance and participation in children with arthritis. Participants with upper limb involvement in JIA were randomly assigned to the activity training in real life group (group I) and TOAT with VBG in real life group (group II). The actual materials and rehabilitation kits will be used for activity training in group 1, the DLA that expected to gain independence will be trained with VBG in group 2. Upper extremity muscle strength and grip, range of motion, upper limb functions, activity, participation and quality of life will be evaluated. The hypothesis of this study is that TOAT with VBG improves the activity performance and physical functions and increases the participation, via being stimulative and interactive in order to provide feedback and to increase interest and motivation.</brief_summary>
