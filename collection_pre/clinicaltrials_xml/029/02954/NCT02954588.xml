	<brief_summary>A growing body of evidence demonstrates that increased adipose mass, especially visceral adipose tissue, contributes directly towards an increase in systemic inflammation, (micro-)vascular dysfunction and the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD), insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Advanced glycation/lipoxidation endproducts (AGEs/ALEs) are a heterogeneous family of unavoidable by-products, which are formed by reactive metabolic intermediates derived from glucose and lipid oxidation. In addition to the overwhelming amount of data demonstrating the role of AGEs/ALEs in the development of (micro-)vascular dysfunction and disease, accumulation of AGEs/ALEs in the expanding adipose tissue contributes to the dysregulation of adipokines and the development of insulin resistance. The investigators want to examine, in a double-blind randomized placebo controlled parallel study, the physiological effect of a dietary intervention with pyridoxamine in abdominally obese persons.</brief_summary>
