	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have either &gt;= 1 cm residual invasive breast cancer and/or positive lymph nodes (&gt; ypN+) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy randomized to receive 1 year of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) adjuvant therapy compared to no MK-3475 (pembrolizumab), in both the entire study population and also in the PD-L1 positive subset. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the effects of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) on overall survival (OS) and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) between the two randomized arms for the PD-L1 positive patients and then all patients. II. To assess the toxicity and tolerability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in this patient population with or without radiation therapy. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the association between biomarkers of inflammation and quality of life and patient reported outcomes between the two groups during and at the end of therapy. II. To examine the long-term and late effects of treatment on patient-reported outcomes. III. To collect tissue and whole blood for processing and banking in anticipation of future correlative studies in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I (OBSERVATION): Patients receive no treatment but are monitored at standard clinical intervals during first year after randomization. Patients are examined every 12 weeks for 1 year, and every 6 months for 4 years, then annually for 5 years. ARM II (PEMROLIZUMAB): Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22. Courses repeat every 42 days for 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients may undergo radiation therapy within 12 weeks of last breast cancer operation or after treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 10 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>STEP 1 REGISTRATION Patients must have histologically confirmed estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2negative (triplenegative, TNBC) with residual invasive breast cancer, as defined by the 2010 and 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines, after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy; residual disease must be &gt;= 1 cm in greatest dimension, and/or have positive lymph nodes (ypN+) observed on pathologic exam NOTE: Immunohistochemistry (IHC)positive isolated tumor cells in the lymph node (N0 [i+]) are not considered nodepositive and these patients also must have &gt;= 1 cm residual invasive cancer in the breast in order to be eligible Patients must not have metastatic disease (i.e., must be M0) It is preferred that axillary lymph node sampling is performed after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to allow more accurate assessment of pathologic response; patients must have a complete axillary lymph node dissection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the following situations (exceptions will be granted for patients participating in the Alliance A11202 trial): Patients had documented pathologic involvement of the axillary nodes (fine needle aspiration [FNA] or core biopsy) before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had sentinel node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with positive sentinel node(s) Patient had documented pathologic involvement of the axillary nodes (FNA or core biopsy) before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had only 1 sentinel lymph node removed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy NOTE: Patients who undergo sentinel node biopsy before starting neoadjuvant treatment and do not undergo post neoadjuvant assessment of the axillary nodes or who have negative axillary nodes on post neoadjuvant assessment must have &gt;= 1 cm residual invasive cancer in the breast after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy Patients must have a minimum of five, available unstained slides from the residual (postneoadjuvant) invasive tumor in primary site or lymph node to be submitted within 7 days after registration to determine PDL1 expression; the tumor tissue must be adequate for PDL1 testing, which typically requires a minimum of 100 cancer cells per slide Patients must be offered the opportunity to participate in specimen banking Patients must have had neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery; the recommended neoadjuvant treatment should include 1624 weeks of a third generation chemotherapy regimen as recommended by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for triple negative breast cancer (examples include dose dense adriamycincytoxan [AC] followed by dosedense paclitaxel; weekly paclitaxel x 12 followed or preceded by cyclophosphamideadriamycinfluorouracil [FAC], fluorouracilepirubicincytoxan [FEC], AC or dose dense AC; docetaxel either followed or preceded by FEC/FAC or AC; carboplatincontaining neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also allowed); patients who cannot complete all planned treatment cycles for any reason are considered high risk and therefore are eligible for the study if they have residual disease; patients must have resolution of adverse event(s) of the most recent prior chemotherapy to grade 1 or less, except alopecia and =&lt; grade 2 neuropathy which are allowed Patients may receive postoperative (adjuvant) chemotherapy for up to 24 weeks of duration (e.g. 8 cycles of capecitabine as in the CREATEX trial) after completion of surgery at the discretion of the treating physician; patients must have resolution of adverse event(s) of the most recent prior chemotherapy to grade 1 or less, except alopecia and =&lt; grade 2 neuropathy which are allowed; adjuvant chemotherapy, if administered, must have been completed within 35 days prior to screening registration and must be given prior to radiation Patients must have completed their final breast surgery (rendering them free from disease) with clear resection margins for invasive cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) within 90 days prior to screening registration for patients not receiving postoperative (adjuvant) chemotherapy, or within 210 days prior to screening registration for patients who have completed postoperative (adjuvant) chemotherapy; positive margins are allowed only if the surgical team of the patient deems further resection impossible Patients for whom radiation therapy (RT) to the affected breast or chest wall and regional nodal areas is clinically indicated as per NCCN treatment guidelines, should receive RT after randomization when possible, concomitant with MK3475 (pembrolizumab) if randomized to the experimental arm; however, RT administered prior to registration is also allowed; patients must specify at the time of screening registration whether or not they will receive RT and the extent of intended RT Patients must not have had prior immunotherapy with antiPDL1, antiPD1, antiCTLA4 or similar drugs; patients must not be planning to receive any of the prohibited therapies during the screening or treatment phases of the study Patients must not be planning to receive concomitantly other biologic therapy, hormonal therapy, other chemotherapy, surgery or other anticancer therapy except radiation therapy while receiving treatment on this protocol Patients must have Zubrod performance status =&lt; 2 Patients must not have a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or evidence of active pneumonitis Patients must not have an active infection requiring systemic therapy Patients must not have active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs); replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment Patients must not have received live vaccines within 30 days prior to registration; examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, shingles, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus CalmetteGuerin (BCG), and typhoid (oral) vaccine; seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed Patients must not have known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection prior to registration; patients who have completed curative therapy for HCV are eligible; patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are eligible if they meet each of the following 3 criteria: CD4 counts &gt;= 350 mm^3 Serum HIV viral load of &lt; 25,000 IU/ml and Treated on a stable antiretroviral regimen No other prior invasive malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated basal (or squamous cell) skin cancer, in situ breast or cervical cancer; stage I or II invasive cancer treated with a curative intent without evidence of disease recurrence for at least five years Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent for this protocol in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines As a part of the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN) registration process the treating institution's identity is provided in order to ensure that the current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study has been entered in the system STEP 2 REGISTRATION Patients must not be registered to step 2 until receiving confirmation from the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) Statistical Center that the patient's tissue specimen was adequate for PDL1 testing; patients must be registered within 7 days of receiving the email notification confirming submission was evaluable for PDL1 status A serum thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) must be obtained within 28 days prior to step 2 registration to obtain a baseline value Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500 microliter (mcL) Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) (except Gilbert's syndrome, who must have a total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL) Serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) or serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) =&lt;

women/men of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; a woman is considered to be of "reproductive potential" if she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months; in addition to routine contraceptive methods, "effective contraception" also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a sideeffect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or vasectomy; however, if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures; patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to unknown teratogenic side effects Site must verify that there is no known change in the step 1 eligibility since initial registration</criteria>
