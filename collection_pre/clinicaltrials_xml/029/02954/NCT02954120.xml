	<brief_summary>Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant status (TAS), 8-hydroxy-2´- deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in blood serum and saliva samples in female patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) and to compared healthy individuals. Materials and Methods: A total of 88 women were into four groups each which were consisted of twenty-two subjects. Groups were designed as periodontally and systemically healthy women (PCOS-CP-); periodontally healthy women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (PCOS+CP-), systemically healthy women with CP (PCOS-,CP+) and women with PCOS and CP (PCOS+CP+). Serum and salivary samples were obtained, clinical periodontal parameters were recorded. MDA, TAS, 8-OHdG levels were measured as biochemically.</brief_summary>
