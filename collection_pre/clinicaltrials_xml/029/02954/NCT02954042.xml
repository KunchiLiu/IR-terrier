	<brief_title>Pelvital Stress Urinary Incontinence Training Device: P-SUIT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>120 subjects with SUI will be recruited into a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled crossover trial. Subjects will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio (60 per arm) to either the control arm (PFMT) or the treatment arm (PFMT in conjunction with the Pelvital therapy). Subjects will conduct their respective therapy five minutes a day over the course of six weeks. At weeks two, four and six, the subjects will conduct bi-weekly check-ups. After six weeks, all patients in the control arm will have the option to cross over into the treatment arm if no improvement in symptoms has been shown.</detailed_description>
