	<brief_summary>Transdiagnostic Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) delivered in the individual format, have been proven just as effective as traditional diagnosis specific CBT manuals. The investigators have translated and modified the "The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders" (UP-CBT) to make it applicable as group therapy in Danish Mental Health Service and a naturalistic trial of this manual has shown promising results. As the use of one manual instead of several diagnosis specific manuals in regional clinics could simplify logistics and reduce waiting time, the investigators want to compare group UP-CBT with diagnosis specific group CBT. Method: A partial blinded, pragmatic, non-inferiority, multicentre randomized clinical trial (RCT). UP-CBT is compared to treatment-as-usual CT. 124 patients are included in each intervention arm, recruited from three Danish regional Mental Health Service Clinics.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: Transdiagnostic Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TCBT) Manuals delivered in individual format, have been reported to be just as effective as traditional diagnosis specific CBT manuals. The investigators have translated and modified the "The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders" (UP-CBT) developed by Barlow and colleagues for use in Mental Health Service (MHS), and shown effects comparable to traditional CBT in a naturalistic trial. As the use of one manual instead of several diagnosis-specific manuals could simplify logistics, reduce waiting time, and increase therapist expertise compared to diagnosis specific CBT, the study aim to test the relative efficacy of group UP-CBT and diagnosis specific group CBT. Methods/design: It is a partially blinded, pragmatic, non-inferiority, parallel, multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) of UP-CBT vs diagnosis specific CBT for depression, social anxiety disorder and agoraphobia/panic disorder. In both arms, the intervention consists of weekly group session for 14 weeks. In total, 248 patients are recruited from three regional MHS centers across the country and included in two intervention arms. Outcomes are measured at end of therapy and at 6 months follow-up. Weekly patient-rated outcomes and group evaluations are collected for every session. Outcome assessors, blind to delivered intervention, will perform the observer-based symptom ratings, and fidelity assessors will monitor manual adherence. Discussion: The current study will be the first RCT investigating the dissemination of the UP in a MHS setting and UP delivered in groups and including patients with depression. Hence the results are expected to add substantially to the evidence base for rational group psychotherapy in MHS. The planned moderator and mediator analyses could spur new hypotheses about mechanisms of change in psychotherapy and the association between patient characteristics and treatment effect.</detailed_description>
