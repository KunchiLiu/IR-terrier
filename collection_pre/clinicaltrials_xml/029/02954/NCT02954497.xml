	<brief_summary>PumpKIN is a randomized, multicenter, two-arm trial evaluating the investigational Jarvik 2015 VAD versus the EXCOR® Pediatric VAD in pediatric patients with heart failure. This study will enroll 88 subjects, 44 receiving the Jarvik 2015 and 44 receiving the EXCOR®, at up to 24 sites in the US and Canada. The primary objectives of this investigational device exemption (IDE) clinical investigation are to (1) assess the safety of the investigational Jarvik 2015 through the evaluation of reported serious adverse events (SAEs) while on ventricular assist device (VAD) support up to the first 180 days post-implant and (2) explore the probable benefit of the investigational Jarvik 2015 by evaluating overall survival in the absence of severe neurologic impairment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria All children with severe (Ross or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV) heart failure despite optimal medical therapy (INTERMACS profiles for pediatrics: Profiles 1 or 2) who require mechanical circulatory support and meet the following criteria: 1. Males and females within weight range: 8.0 Kg ≤ weight ≤ 20.0 Kg 2. Males and females within Body surface area (BSA) range: 0.4 m2 ≤ BSA ≤ 0.8 m2 3. Twoventricle circulation, including cardiomyopathy, repaired structural heart disease (e.g. ALCAPA, aortic stenosis) or acquired heart disease (e.g., myocarditis, Kawasaki disease) 4. Documented evidence of Inability to wean from ECMO or other temporary mechanical support OR Inotropedependent, decompensated heart failure with inability to wean from ventilator support OR Inotropedependent, decompensated heart failure AND a combination of two of the following criteria within 48 hours prior to implant (unless otherwise noted) which is attributed to decompensated heart failure despite optimal medical therapy: Urine output &lt; 0.5 cc/Kg/hr Creatinine level &gt; 2 times the ULN for age ALT or total bilirubin result &gt;3 times the ULN for age (either qualifies the patient) Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) &lt; 55% Inability to tolerate enteral feeds (&gt;75% of maintenance calories) for ≥7 days Acidosis: Base excess &lt;5 5. Potentially eligible (i.e., no medical or surgical contraindications) to be listed for cardiac transplant, United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) status 1A or equivalent 6. Written consent of parent(s) or LAR where appropriate. Exclusion Criteria To be eligible for this trial, the subjects must meet none of the following exclusion criteria at the time of enrollment or between the enrollment and device implant: 1. Known contraindication for systemic anticoagulation 2. Currently participating in an interventional trial whose protocol prevents effective application of one or both treatment arms, potentially has an independent effect on trial endpoints, or otherwise interferes with execution of the PumpKIN protocol 3. Any complex cardiac diagnosis (including but not limited to single ventricle anatomy, restrictive cardiomyopathy) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could independently affect the likelihood of the subject meeting the primary endpoint 4. Presence of a mechanical heart valve 5. Unresolved malignancy 6. CPR with duration &gt;30 consecutive minutes within 48 hours prior to device implant or CPR with uncertain neurological status prior to device implant 7. The following are exclusionary if found 24 hours or less prior to device implant: Renal dysfunction that is severe or, in the opinion of the investigator, irreversible Hepatic dysfunction that is severe or, in the opinion of the investigator, irreversible Severe or irreversible pulmonary dysfunction ECMO use for &gt; 10 consecutive days Severe aortic insufficiency Active, systemic infection unresponsive to antimicrobials Known cerebrovascular event within the past 30 days or uncertain neurological status Severe RV dysfunction or significant arrhythmia requiring treatment with an RV assist device (RVAD) (i.e., biventricular assist device) Unmanageable bleeding per judgment of the investigator</criteria>
