	<brief_summary>This study tests the safety of a drug called SGN-CD352A, to find out what its side effects are. SGN-CD352A will be given every 4 weeks to a small group of patients with multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study of SGN-CD352A for Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will have 2 parts. In the first part, different doses of SGN-CD352A will be given to different patients (each individual patient will get the same dose for all treatments). The doses will be very low at the start of the trial, and will increase only when the lower dose levels are proven safe. In the second part of the study, up to 2 dose levels that are both safe and show promising activity against MM will be given to more patients</detailed_description>
