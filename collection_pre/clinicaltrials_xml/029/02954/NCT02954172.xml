	<detailed_description>A randomized, double blind, multicenter phase3 study in chemotherapy naive patients with stage IIIB,IV or recurrent NSCLC of non-squamous. the study will randomize about 436 patients at a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment arms.

	<criteria>1. signed inform consent form(ICF) 2. Age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 70 years, male or female 3. Histologically or cytologically documented inoperable, local advanced (stage IIIB), metastatic (stage IV), or recurrent nonsquamous NSCLC; Mixed tumors should be categorized according to the predominant cell type 4. Histologically confirmed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild type 5. At least one measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors（RECISIT） v 1.1 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 7. Life expectancy ≥ 6 months 8. Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraceptive measures during study treatment and for 6 months after receiving last study treatment (e.g. abstinence, sterilization surgery, oral contraceptives, contraception by progesterone injection or subcutaneous). 1. Prior chemotherapy or target therapy with another systemic anticancer agent (e.g., monoclonal antibody, tyrosine kinase inhibitor) for the treatment of the patient's current stage of disease (Stage IIIB not amenable for combined modality treatment, stage IV or recurrent disease). Prior surgery and irradiation is permitted, provided that the criteria outlined in the protocol for both treatments are met. Disease progressed within 6 months after adjuvant therapy must be excluded. 2. Mixed nonsmall cell and small cell carcinoma, or mixed adenosquamous carcinomas with predominant squamous cell 3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed EGFR mutation type, unknown EGFR status for any reason is allowed in this study. 4. Known hemoptysis within 3 months prior to screening with blood volume more than 2.5 mL 5. Evidence of tumor invading major blood vessels on imaging. The investigator or the local radiologist must exclude evidence of tumor that is fully contiguous with, surrounding, or extending into the lumen of a major blood vessel (e.g., pulmonary artery or superior vena cava) 6. Evidence of brain metastasis, spinal cord compression or carcinomatous meningitis history, or confirmed brain metastasis by CT or MRI at baseline 7. Radical radiotherapy to the thorax with curative intent within 28 days prior to enrollment; palliative radiotherapy for bone lesions outside the thoracic region within 2 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment. 8. Serious, nonhealing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture, or major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to randomization or anticipation of need for major surgery during the course of the study. 9. Minor surgery (Including insertion of an indwelling catheter) within 48 hours prior to first dose of study treatment 10. Recent or current receive treatment of Aspirin (&gt; 325 mg/day) or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) known to inhibit platelet function (within 10 days prior to first dose of study treatment) 11. Recent or current (within 10 days prior to first dose of study treatment) receive treatment of oral all doses of oral or parenteral anticoagulants or thrombolytic agent. Prophylactic use of anticoagulants is permitted. 12. History or evidence of inherited bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or thrombus 13. Uncontrolled hypertension (SBP&gt;150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure&gt;100 mmHg), prior history of hypertensive crisis and hypertensive encephalopathy 14. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease but not limited to active infections; unstable angina; stroke or transient cerebral ischemia (within 6 months prior to screening); myocardial infarction (within 6 months prior to screening) ; congestive heartfailure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class≥ II) ; serious cardiac arrhythmia, hepatic, renal or metabolic disease requiring medication during the study. 15. History of peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal perforation, erosive esophagitis, erosive gastritis, inflammatory bowel disease or diverticulitis, abdominal fistula or intraabdominal abscess within 6 months prior to screening 16. Patient diagnosed with a tracheoesophageal fistula 17. Clinically significant third space effusion (e.g., uncontrolled ascites or pleural effusion by extraction or other treatment) 18. Pulmonary fibrosis or active pneumonia showed by CT at baseline 19. Active malignancy other than nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, superficial basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma, radical surgery of localized prostate cancer, radical surgery of ductal carcinoma in situ within 5 years prior to randomization 20. Known autoimmune disease 21. Known positive HbsAg and hepatitis B virus (HBV)DNA drop test in peripheral blood ≥ 1 x 103 copy number/L; If HBsAg positive and HBVDNA drop test in peripheral blood &lt; 1 x 103 copy number/L, patient is considered to be eligible by investigator only when chronic hepatitis B in the plateau and do not increase the risk 22. Known positive HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) or syphilis 23. Known allergic disease or allergic physique 24. Treatment with any other investigational agent or participation in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to screening 25. Known alcoholism or drug abuse 26. Pregnant or anticipation of pregnant during the study or lactating women 27. Known hypersensitivity to bevacizumab or any of its excipients and/or any of the chemotherapy agents 28.
