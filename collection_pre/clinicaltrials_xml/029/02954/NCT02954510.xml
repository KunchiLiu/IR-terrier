	<brief_summary>There are no current alternatives to diagnostic contrast-requiring imaging for patients with an eGFR &lt;30mL/min due to the association of gadolinium-based imaging modalities to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and iodinated contrast-induced kidney injury. Ferumoxytol-enhanced imaging may offer an alternative approach.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Identify the resolution by which the coronary arteries can be visualized using ferumoxytol-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in non-morbidly obese patients with prior regional cardiac ischemia localized by stress-induced echocardiography or technetium-based myocardial perfusion imaging. 2. Use ferumoxytol-enhanced cardiac MRI to quantify location and length of lesions in the left and right coronary arteries or in branching arteries that derive from the left or right coronary arteries. 3. Identify the resolution by which peripheral vasculature can be visualized using ferumoxytol-enhanced MR angiography and venography in patients with clinical findings consistent with peripheral vascular disease. 4. Use ferumoxytol-enhanced MR angiography and venography to quantify location and length of lesions in femoral arteries and branch vessels.</detailed_description>
