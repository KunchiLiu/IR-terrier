	<brief_title>A Study of TAK-659 in Combination With Bendamustine (+/-Rituximab), Gemcitabine, Lenalidomide, or Ibrutinib for the Treatment of Participants With Advanced Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-659. TAK-659 is being tested to treat people who have advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This study will determine the MTD or RP2D for TAK-659 in combination with bendamustine, bendamustine + rituximab, gemcitabine, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib. The study will enroll approximately 100 participants. Participants will be assigned to one of the 5 treatment groups: - TAK-659 + Bendamustine - TAK-659 + Bendamustine + Rituximab - TAK-659 + Gemcitabine - TAK-659 + Lenalidomide - TAK-659 + Ibrutinib This multi-center trial will be conducted in North America and Europe. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 27 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and will be followed up for safety for 28 days after the last dose of study drug.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female participants aged 18 years or older. 2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of any histology (with the exception of participants with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia [WM]). 3. Radiographically or clinically measurable disease with at least 1 target lesion per International Working Group (IWG) criteria for malignant lymphoma. 4. Participants who are refractory or relapsed after at least 1 prior line of therapy and for whom no effective standard therapy is available per the investigator's assessment. Either treatment na√Øve to, relapsed/refractory to, or experienced treatment failure due to other reasons with ibrutinib, idelalisib, or any other investigational Bcell receptor (BCR) pathway inhibitors not directly targeting spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK). Prior treatment with a regimen that includes the combination drug will not necessarily exclude a participant from that cohort if the investigator views treatment with that agent as appropriate. However, a participant who has a contraindication for a particular combination agent or who has been discontinued from prior therapy with a particular agent for toxicity will not be eligible for inclusion in that particular cohort. 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1 and life expectancy of greater than 3 months. 6. Participants must have adequate organ function, including the following: Adequate bone marrow reserve: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1000 per micro litre (/mcL), platelet count &gt;=75,000/mcL (&gt;=50,000/mcL for participants with bone marrow involvement), and hemoglobin &gt;=8 gram per deciliter (g/dL) (red blood cell [RBC] transfusion allowed &gt;=14 days before assessment). Hepatic: total bilirubin less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1.5*the upper limit of the normal range (ULN); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and AST &lt;=2.5*ULN. Renal: serum creatinine &lt;=1.5*ULN or creatinine clearance &gt;=60 milliliter per minute (mL/min) either as estimated by the CockcroftGault equation or based on urine collection. 7. Female participants who: Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, or Are surgically sterile, or If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 1 highly effective method of contraception and 1 additional effective (barrier) method at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 180 days after the last dose of study drug, or Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [example, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together.) Male participant, even if surgically sterilized (that is, status postvasectomy), who: Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 180 days after the last dose of study drug, or Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [example, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods], withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together.) 8. Both men and women in the rituximab combination arm (Cohort B) must practice contraception as described above from the time of signing of the informed consent form (ICF) through 12 months after the last dose of study drug. 9. Both men and women in the lenalidomide combination arm (Cohort D) must adhere to the guidelines of the RevAssist program (United States participants) or, if not using commercial supplies, must adhere to the Lenalidomide Pregnancy Risk Minimisation Plan as outlined in the Study Manual. 10. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care. 11.

Central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma; active brain or leptomeningeal metastases, as indicated by positive cytology from lumbar puncture or computed tomography (CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 2. Known hypersensitivity (example, anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions) to any particular combination drug will result in a participant being ineligible for inclusion in that particular cohort. 3. For participant in the lenalidomide combination arm, demonstrated hypersensitivity (example, angioedema, StevensJohnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) to lenalidomide. 4. History of druginduced pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids; history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest CT scan; history of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted. 5.
