	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study of TAK-438 (10 mg) in the Treatment of Non-Erosive Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study will be conducted to verify the superiority of TAK-438 (TAK-438 10 mg, once daily, 4 weeks) to placebo (placebo, once daily, 4 weeks) in patients with non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (NERD). The study consists of a 1-week, single-blind run-in period and a 4-week, double-blind treatment period. The participants will receive the study drug (TAK-438 placebo tablet) for the 1-week single-blind run-in period. After the run-in period, eligible participants will be randomized into TAK-438 10 mg or placebo treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. The randomized participants will receive the assigned study drug (TAK-438 10 mg tablet or TAK-438 placebo tablet) for the 4-week double-blind treatment period.</detailed_description>

The participant signs and dates a written informed consent form prior to the initiation of any study procedures. 3. The participant with NERD. 4. The participant is endoscopically confirmed to have the modified LA Classification Grade N or M at the start of the runin period (Visit 1). To allow efficacy evaluation in the participants with Grade N as well as in those with Grade M, the target number of participants in each grade is at least 30% of the total number of participants. Enrollment of patients with either Grade N or M will end when the number of enrolled participants with each grade exceeds 332, or 70% of the total planned number of participants. 5. The participant experiences recurrent heartburn, on at least 2 days a week over the last 3 weeks prior to the start of the runin period (Visit 1). 6. The participant is either a male or female outpatient with a minimum age of 20 years at the time of informed consent signing. However, participants who are hospitalized only for examination purposes are also allowed to participate. 7. A female participant of childbearing potential agrees to use routinely adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study, and for 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug. 8. The participant's compliance to the study drug has been good (75% or better) in the runin period. 9. The participant has experienced heartburn on at least 2 days in the last 1 week prior to randomization. 10. The participant has appropriately provided in the patient's diary all the required information during the runin period. 1. The participant has received any investigational compound within 84 days prior to the first dose of study drug. 2.

However, participants with Barrett's mucosa (less than 3 cm, short segment Barrett's esophagus [SSBE]) or Schatzki's ring (a mucosal tissue ring lining the inferior esophageal sphincter) are permitted to participate. 7. The participant has a history of surgery or treatment affecting gastroesophageal reflux, including fundoplication and mechanical dilatation for esophageal stenosis (except Schatzki's ring), or a history of gastric or duodenal surgery (except endoscopic removal of benign polyps). 8. The participant has acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding or gastric or duodenal ulcer, characterized by a defective mucosa with white coating, within 30 days prior to the start of the runin period (Visit 1).

The participant has any other concurrent upper gastrointestinal symptoms more severe than heartburn. 13. The participant has depression. 14. The participant has, has a history of, or is suspected of functional upper gastrointestinal disorders, such as functional dyspepsia and functional heartburn diagnosed by the Rome IV criteria. 15. The participant has a history of hypersensitivity or allergies to TAK438 (including the formulation excipients ). 16. The participant has a history or complication of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) or of alcohol abuse within 1 years prior to the start of the runin period (Visit 1). 17.
