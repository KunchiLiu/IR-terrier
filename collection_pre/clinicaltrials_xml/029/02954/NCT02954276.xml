	<brief_summary>the trial is a randomized, open label, crossover, single-administration bioavailability study to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of Omexa sumatriptan transmucosal sublingual tablet versus commercial Imitrex® sumatriptan oral tablet in 14 healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Bioavailability Study of Omexa Sumatriptan vs. Imitrex® in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volunteers will randomly receive either the commercial oral tablet 100 mg Imitrex® or 75 mg Omexa sublingual tablet under fasted conditions. One week following the first administration, the volunteers will receive the alternative treatment. Blood samples will be collected at each visit before drug administration and at 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 240, 360 and 480 min after drug administration, in order to characterize the drug's absorption and pharmacokinetics, as well as to evaluate Omexa formulation safety.</detailed_description>
