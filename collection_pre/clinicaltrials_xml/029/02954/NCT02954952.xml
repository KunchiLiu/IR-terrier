	<brief_summary>The SedLine EEG monitor (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA) computes the following parameters: the Patient State Index (PSI) that is calculated via 4 channels of high resolution EEG data, EMG activity, and percent of EEG suppression. Unlike most other non-invasive patient monitoring parameters, there is no gold standard or reference against which the SedLine/Patient State Index (PSI) could be compared. Hence, to evaluate performance of two algorithms, historically clinical outcome parameters such as post-surgery wake-up time, amount of anesthesia used, and frequency of somatic events were compared to evaluate algorithm performance. The new (investigational) PSI is similar to the current (FDA-approved) PSI but has new features to compute PSI. The data collection study and methodology as described in this plan forms the basis for evaluating performance of the new (investigational) PSI against the current (FDA approved) PSI.</brief_summary>
