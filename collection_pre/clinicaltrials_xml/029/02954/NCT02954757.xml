	<brief_summary>Uterine adenomyosis is a common uterine benign condition. They can cause abnormal menstrual bleeding, and menstrual pain. Although surgical intervention is the definitive treatment, some women prefer to have their uterus preserved. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy is receiving increasing interest in the management of uterine adenomyosis by inducing focal thermocoagulation of the fibroids. Results obtained by various research groups have shown that HIFU treatment is safe, effective and is highly acceptable to patients. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of HIFU in the treatment of uterine adenomyosis. In this proposed study, 10 patients who have symptomatic uterine adenomyosis who meet the study inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study which involves the use of HIFU in the management of the adenomyosis. Background information of the patients such as age, body mass index, hormonal (pre- or postmenopausal) status and the presence of chronic medical disease will be collected. Subjects will also be asked to complete an eight-item section of a Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality Of Life Questionnaire (UFS-QOL) and menstrual pain score which evaluate the effect of the adenomyosis on the quality of life of women.</brief_summary>
