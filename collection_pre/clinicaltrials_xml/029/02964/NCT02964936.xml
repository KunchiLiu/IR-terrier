Female subject must agree not to breastfeed starting at prescreening and throughout the study period, and for 28 days after the final study drug administration. Female subject must not donate ova starting at prescreening and throughout the study period, and for 28 days after the final study drug administration. Male subject and their female spouse/partners who are of childbearing potential must be using two forms of highly effective birth control (at least one of which must be a barrier method) starting at prescreening and continue throughout the study period, and for 12 weeks after the final study drug administration Male subject must not donate sperm starting at prescreening and throughout the study period, and for 12 weeks after the final study drug administration Concurrent retinal neovascular lesion requiring treatment and macular edema requiring treatment Concurrent autoimmune disease with inflammation that could impact erythropoiesis History of gastric/intestinal resection considered influential on the absorption of drugs in the gastrointestinal tract (excluding resection of gastric or colon polyps) or concurrent gastroparesis Uncontrolled hypertension Concurrent congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or higher) History of hospitalization for treatment of stroke, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism within 12 weeks before the prescreening assessment Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antihepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody at the prescreening assessment, or positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a past test Concurrent other form of anemia than renal anemia Having received treatment with ESA, protein anabolic hormone, testosterone enanthate, or mepitiostane within 6 weeks before the prescreening assessment Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) or total bilirubin that is greater than the criteria, or previous or concurrent another serious liver disease at prescreening assessment Previous or current malignant tumor (no recurrence for at least 5 years is eligible.)
