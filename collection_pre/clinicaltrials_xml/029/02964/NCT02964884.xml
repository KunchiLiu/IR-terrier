	<brief_summary>Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder that is associated with a four times greater risk of learning disabilities, including reading disabilities, and a deficiency of neurofibromin - a protein important in a signaling pathway that regulates learning and memory. Our previous work (NS49096) demonstrated that school-age children with NF+RD can respond to standard phonologically-based reading tutoring originally developed to treat reading disability in the general population. Combining our work with that by other researchers suggesting that a medication (Lovastatin) may counteract the effects of the deficient neurofibromin, and possibly ameliorate learning disabilities in NF1, the investigator propose to examine the synergistic effects of medication plus reading tutoring.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neurofibromitosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome. The most common concern of NF1 is learning disabilities (LDs). Approximately half of children with NF1 have LDs, the most common of which are reading disabilities (RDs).The purpose of this research is to gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics and treatment of RDs in NF1. The Investigator will evaluate three different groups (see list below) to determine if there are differential outcomes in these groups of children.with NF+RD. 1. Reading tutoring program and a medication called Lovastatin 2. Reading tutoring program and no Lovastatin (placebo) 3. No reading (sham) tutoring and Lovastatin</detailed_description>

	<criteria>This study will be open to all native English speakers who meet eligibility criteria regardless of race, gender, minority or socioeconomic status. A child will be excluded if he/she meets any of the following criteria, which will be determined by initial telephone screening as well as review of medical/developmental history prior to and during testing: 1. previous diagnosis of Intellectual Disability; 2. known uncorrectable visual impairment; 3. documented hearing impairment greater than or equal to a 25 dB loss; 4. medical contraindication to MRI procedures (e.g., metal devices); 5. known IQ below 70; 6. a pervasive developmental disorder; and 7. any known neurologic pathology, including epilepsy, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, optic gliomas, and brain tumors (other than UBOs). 8. Comorbid severe psychiatric disorders will also be excluded. Children who meet criteria for ADHD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, adjustment disorder, and/or mild depression will be eligible as long as they are not taking psychotropic medications, with the exception of stimulant medication for ADHD. Because ADHD is highly comorbid with NF1 (~50%; 116), and it is important that findings of this clinical trial are generalizable (cf. 117), the Investigator will include children with ADHD including those taking stimulant medications. Because the investigator recognizes the importance of taking ADHD into account, the investigator will also incorporate measures of ADHD (with both categorical and continuous variables) as well as stimulant status as moderators in our analyses. This approach is consistent with other Lovastatin clinical trials in NF1 (e.g., 8). Reading disability (RD) will be defined by a score less than the 25th percentile on the Letter Word Identification and Word Attack subtests from the Woodcock Johnson Psychoeducational BatteryIII. This is an accepted definition of RD in reading research 118. The Investigator anticipates that only a few recruited participants will not meet RD criteria because the study is unlikely to appeal to families with children who are not struggling academically; however, if criteria are not met these participants will not be included in the randomization procedure for the clinical trial but, as a courtesy to the family, will be allowed the opportunity to participate in tutoring if they choose to do so. ADHD symptomology as well as status will be determined by DSM5 criteria that require that symptoms be present in at least two settings; therefore, two questionnaires each will be administered to each child's parent and teacher. See below for specific criteria for ADHD diagnosis confirmation/exclusion. Measures to Determine ADHD Status and/or other Diagnoses: The following measures will be used to determine ADHD status and presence of any psychiatric diagnoses that would preclude inclusion in the study. All of these measures were developed under DSMIV guidelines. The Investigator is now under DSM5 criteria but there has not been enough time for measures to be tested against DSM5; however the measures below remain appropriate to capture the necessary data for us to make a determination about the relevant comorbid diagnoses. In particular, the diagnostic criteria for ADHD continue to be based on the same 18 diagnostic symptoms, split equally between inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors, with a threshold of at least six symptoms in at least one domain to make a diagnosis. Also the DSM5 diagnostic specifiers map directly onto the previous DSMIV subtypes of ADHD. Changes to the DSM5 diagnostic criteria include a less stringent requirement for symptoms to have been problematic by 12years old compared to the DSMIV age of 7years. There remains a requirement for symptoms to occur in more than one setting. Overall, the measures below remain appropriate to capture the necessary data to make a determination about ADHD diagnosis, and the Investigator will also have the continuous data which may be the most pertinent for our research questions. Parents and teachers will fill out questionnaires and a clinical interview with the parent(s) will be conducted. Conners Third Edition (Conners 3, 119) is a behavioral rating scale that provides information on a variety of symptoms of ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity) as well as crosscutting symptoms of anxiety, and depression. Completed by parent and teacher using the appropriate forms for each. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IVHome and School Versions 120 is a Likert scale completed about the child's behavior over the past 6 months. The items were developed to assess symptoms of ADHD. Completed by parent and teacher using the appropriate forms for each. Diagnostic Interview for Children, Fourth Edition (DICAIV; 121) is a semistructured interview, designed for determining psychiatric diagnoses, including ADHD. Completed by parent only. Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function 122 is an executive function questionnaire that captures Initiate, Inhibit, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, and SelfMonitor. Completed by parent only. Pediatric Medical and Developmental History Questionnaire (developed in house) will be used to screen for conditions that would preclude inclusion in the study by providing a review of the child's birth, developmental, and medical history. Completed by parent only. ADHD Status: ADHD status will be based on DSM5 criteria. All diagnoses will be confirmed Dr. Rimrodt, a neurodevelopmental pediatrician. To meet criteria for ADHD, children must score positively on one of two parent scales and have a positive ADHD diagnosis on the DICAIV. Specifically, they must have a rating of 2 or higher for 6 of 9 items assessing inattention and/or 6 of 9 items assessing hyperactivity/impulsivity on the ADHD Rating Scale IV and/or a Tscore &gt; 65 on either the Inattention or Hyperactivity/Impulsivity scales of the Conners 3. Subjects must also meet criteria for ADHD on one of the two teacher ratings scale (Conners 3 or DuPaul). During all testing children with ADHD will remain on any prescribed stimulant medications. Children will be considered free of ADHD if they do not meet criteria for ADHD on any of the parent or teacher rating scales used to diagnose ADHD (i.e. they must have a rating of 2 or higher for fewer than 4 of 9 items assessing inattention and fewer than 4 of 9 items assessing hyperactivity/impulsivity on the ADHD Rating Scale IV and a Tscore &lt; 60 on both the Hyperactivity and Inattention scales of the parent or teacher Conners 3). They also cannot meet criteria for ADHD on the DICAIV. Participants with ambiguous ADHD diagnosis</criteria>
