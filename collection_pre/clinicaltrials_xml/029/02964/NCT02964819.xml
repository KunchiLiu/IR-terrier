	<brief_summary>This project will analyze the influence of interferential current therapy in an exercise program for individuals with a unilateral impact syndrome diagnosis. To that end, volunteers of both genders, aged 18-59 years, had an unilateral, unilateral pain in the shoulder with more than 3 months duration, at least grade 4 pain by the numerical scale of pain assessment, positivity In at least 2 of 3 orthopedic tests for impact syndrome, will be randomized into the following groups: exercise group, exercise + ultrasound group, exercise group + interferential current. Sixteen consecutive treatment sessions will be performed, and the volunteers will be evaluated before and after, by means of the following instruments: Numerical scale of evaluation of pain, Shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI), Pain-Related Catastrophizing Thoughts Scale, being applied the Numerical scale of evaluation of pain at the end of Each session and one month after the end of treatment.</brief_summary>
