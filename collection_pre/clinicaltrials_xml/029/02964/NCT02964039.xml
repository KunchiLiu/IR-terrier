	<brief_title>A Novel Mechanics-based Intervention to Improve Post-stroke Stability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every year, approximately 15,000 American Veterans experience a stroke, with an estimated cost of acute and follow-up care in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Following a stroke, the restoration or improvement of walking is a high-ranking goal among patients, but only about half of the population is able to return to typical levels of community ambulation. The resultant decrease in independent mobility is strongly associated with a decline in quality of life. Gait instability is a common contributor to limited mobility through either an increased fall-risk or fear of falling, but current interventions to address post-stroke gait instability have had limited success. This project will conduct initial testing of a novel elastic force-field designed to improve post-stroke gait stability through targeted motor learning. The results of these experiments will serve as the basis for the development of novel gait rehabilitation techniques, which have the potential to increase the quality of life of thousands of Veterans and save millions of dollars.</detailed_description>
