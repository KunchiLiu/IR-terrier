	<brief_summary>Several modalities have been studied to prevent coughing during emergence, including extubation in a deep plane of anesthesia but have proved to be unreliable. So far, no reliable method is recommended as standard of care. The advantages of administering tramadol includes a long duration of action, rapid recovery, limited depression of respiratory function and no effect on platelet makes it a safe medication to use for neurosurgical patients after craniotomy. The primary objective of the study is to observe the effect of single dose of tramadol (1mg/kg) administered 45 minutes before extubation on hemodynamic response (measurement of B.P and H.R) during extubation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Dose Tramadol Effect on Extubation Response and Quality of Emergence Post-supratentorial Intracranial Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extubation after intracranial tumor surgery is desirable in order to make an early diagnosis of intracranial complications. Extubation however, may be associated with haemodynamic and metabolic changes e.g. agitation, increased oxygen consumption, catecholamine secretion, hypercapnia and systemic hypertension. These changes cause cerebral hyperemia, intracranial hypertension leading to cerebral oedema or haemorrhage, thus it is important to have smooth extubation with minimal haemodynamic and metabolic effects. Incidence of coughing on emergence from general anesthesia ranges from 38% to 96%. This may also result in postoperative intracranial hemorrhage, intracranial hypertension, cerebral edema or intraocular hypertension.This can be detrimental in neurosurgery. Several modalities have been studied to prevent coughing during emergence, including extubation in a deep plane of anesthesia but have proved to be unreliable. So far, no reliable method is recommended as standard of care. Tramadol, a synthetic opioid of the aminocyclohexanes group, is a centrally acting opioid analgesic that is used to treat moderate-to-severe pain and has an inhibitory effect on M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors. It also reduces the incidence of cough and improves extubation quality, and provides more stable haemodynamics during emergence. It neither causes respiratory depression, nor affects intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Other potential advantage of administering tramadol includes a long duration of action, rapid recovery, limited depression of respiratory function and no effect on platelets thus making it a safe medication to use for neurosurgical patients after craniotomy. The onset of effect following a single dose is 3 to 5 minutes with peak effect at 45 minutes. Aim of doing this study is to observe the effect of a single dose of tramadol on quality of tracheal extubation as judged by incidence of coughing and haemodynamic changes at emergence from anesthesia. OBJECTIVE: Primary Objective: To observe the effect of single dose of tramadol (1mg/kg) administered 45 minutes before extubation on haemodynamic response (measurement of B.P and H.R) during extubation. Secondary Objective: To measure the quality of emergence from general anaesthesia by measuring the frequency of cough, laryngospasm and episodes of desaturation. OPERATIONAL DEFINITION: Emergence Period: This will be defined as the time from the recovery of spontaneous breathing after giving reversal to tracheal extubation. Quality of emergence: Good quality emergence will be defined as extubation not associated with coughing, bucking, tachycardia, hypertension, laryngospasm or bronchospasm. Tachycardia and hypertension: Rise in heart rate and blood pressure more than 20% from baseline value. Extubation response: Physiological response related to blood pressure and heart rate during extubation of trachea is called extubation response, HYPOTHESIS: Tramadol obtunds haemodynamic and cough response to extubation and thus results in good quality emergence after supratentorial craniotomy.</detailed_description>
