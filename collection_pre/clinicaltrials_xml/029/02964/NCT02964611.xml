	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to understand social cognition changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD), which includes Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Corticobasal Syndrome (CBS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD - behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, progressive non-fluent aphasia and semantic dementia), and the effect of these changes on the patients' relationship with their caregivers. In addition, the study aims to provide a greater clarity in the neuroanatomical correlates of social cognition in patients with FTLD, PD and AD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients: ability to speak and understand the English language (as questionnaires and tests are only available in English) Caregivers: primary caregiver for a given patient ability to speak and understand the English language (as questionnaires and tests are only available in English) Patients and Caregivers: history of another neurological disorder psychiatric disorder severe aphasia (semantic word loss) visual deficits requiring correction beyond the use of eyeglasses or contact lenses (intact visual acuity is required for completing both the questionnaires and the emotion evaluation test which consists of video vignettes) auditory deficits requiring correction beyond hearing aids (videos have auditory component) Patients: presence of pacemakers, aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, ear implants, metal fragments or foreign objects in the eyes, skin or body will be excluded as they will be unable to have a MRI scan. premenopausal women will be excluded due to the unknown risk of MRIs during pregnancy.</criteria>
