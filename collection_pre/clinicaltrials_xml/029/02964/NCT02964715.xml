	<brief_summary>Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease( NAFLD) is common in patients with type 2 diabetes. Empagliflozin, an FDA-approved oral medication used to treat type 2 diabetes, has been shown to reduce production and deposition of fat in the liver in animal experiments. There is little published evidence that this is so in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes. The investigators designed this pilot study to determine if use of empagliflozin for 6 months in patients with type 2 diabetes can improve scan, blood marker and biopsy features of NAFLD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Empagliflozin on NAFLD in Asian Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Empagliflozin, an FDA-approved SGLT2 (Sodium glucose transporter 2) inhibitor used to treat type 2 diabetes, has been shown to reduce hepatic de novo lipogenesis and hepatic steatosis in animal models. There is little published evidence that this is so in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes. The investigators designed this open label proof of concept trial to determine if use of empagliflozin for 6 months in patients with type 2 diabetes can improve biomarkers and histological features of biopsy proven NAFLD. Hypotheses 1. 6 months of empagliflozin will result in improved histology on liver biopsy in type 2 dm patients with NAFLD 2.6 months of empagliflozin will result in changes in liver enzymes, adipocytokines and FGF levels in type 2 dm patients with NAFLD 3.6 months of empagliflozin will result in improved liver stiffness measurement in type 2 dm patients with NAFLD Study protocol This is a prospective open-label proof-of-concept study. The investigators plan to recruit 25 Asian patients with biopsy-proven NASH and type 2 diabetes and commence them on empagliflozin 25 mg daily for 6 months. Upon recruitment clinical information will be obtained via an interview and use of a structured questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements will be obtained at baseline and 6 months. A repeat liver biopsy will be performed after 6 months of empagliflozin therapy. MRI and fibroscan of the liver will be conducted at baseline and 6 months. Fasting blood samples will be drawn for glucose, insulin, c-peptide, triglyceride, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, NEFA(non-esterified fatty acid), HbA1c , liver function test(including albumin, AST, ALT, gamma GT, uric acid, inflammatory markers, FGF(fibroblast growth factor) and other biomarkers at baseline and 6 months. Patients will be reviewed by a physician at 1 month and 6 months for development of any potential adverse events while on empagliflozin therapy. Patients will be instructed not to make any significant changes to diet and lifestyle in these 6 months in order to assess to full effect of the intervention with no possible confounding factors.</detailed_description>
