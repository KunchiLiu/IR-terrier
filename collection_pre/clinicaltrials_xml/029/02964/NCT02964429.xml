	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is the determination of the in-vivo ultrafiltration coefficient (in-vivo KUF) for Diacap Pro dialyzers following routine dialysis prescription in the United States.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determination In-vivo KUF for Diacap Pro Hemodialyser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The in-vivo KUF for Diacap Pro High Flux dialysers with the surface sizes of 1.3/ 1.6/ 1.9 sqm will be determined as required by the US guideline "Guidance for the Content of Premarket Notifications for Conventional and High Permeability Hemodialyzers 1998" for comparison with the in-vitro KUF data. Clinical data of at least 12 patients will be collected for determination of the in-vivo KUF complemented by safety-, performance-data for the removal of small and middle molecular substances and hemocompatibility data.</detailed_description>
