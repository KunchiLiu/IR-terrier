	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to to determine the penetrance of known and probable pathogenic variants in genes and the factors that contribute to penetrance in a population of children and adults in the United States exposed to Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) trigger agents.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to determine how genetic mutations and variants in combination with non-genetic factors influence risk for MH in children who had general anesthesia with triggering agents and develop reliable predictive MH risk algorithms. Rationale: Once the factors responsible for MH risk are determined, it will be possible to better predict risk and develop better individualization of anesthetics such as tailored selection of intravenous anesthetics, regional anesthesia and avoidance of all triggering agents. The long-term goal is to tailor and improve safety of anesthetic and clinical care and to reduce mortality, morbidity and cost of care due to MH with right anesthetics and muscle relaxants for endotracheal intubations for an individual child.</detailed_description>
