	<brief_summary>This is a safety and pharmacokinetics study of MK-7684 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in adults with metastatic solid tumors for which there is no available therapy that is expected to convey clinical benefit. Part A of this study is a dose escalation phase. Part B is a dose confirmation phase to estimate the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) for MK-7684 monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab. The primary hypothesis is that MK-7684 administered as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab is safe when administered at the RPTD.</brief_summary>
