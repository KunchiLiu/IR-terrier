	<brief_summary>The aim is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of binimetinib in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin, and to demonstrate that the combination is feasible and has preliminary activity in previously untreated patients with advanced NSCLC and documented KRAS mutations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Binimetinib in Addition to Standard Chemotherapy in KRAS Mutated NSCLC.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a need for more effective therapies for patients with advanced NSCLC driven by the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway. These tumors are generally aggressive, are almost exclusively of non-squamous histology, and represent the largest group of patients with advanced NSCLC harboring specific driver mutations in Western populations. Based on recent preclinical and clinical evidence, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-inhibition plus first-line chemotherapy is a promising new treatment for patients with NSCLC and KRAS [v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog] mutations. Binimetinib is a medication without marketing authorization. Pemetrexed and cisplatin have marketing authorization in Switzerland and in EU for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and will be administered as standard backbone treatment according to their Swissmedic-approved indication, dose and route of administration. Binimetinib, pemetrexed and cisplatin are IMP in the context of this phase I trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent according to the Swiss HRA and ICHGCP regulation before registration and prior to any trialspecific procedure. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC, predominantly nonsquamous subtype (adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, NOS). Locally advanced or metastatic stage IIIIV disease according to the 7th TNM classification, ineligible for curative treatment. Presence of KRAS exon 2 or 3 (codon 12, 13 or 61) mutations by local testing (concomitant EGFR and ALK mutations are excluded). CT scan showing measurable disease, which is defined as at least one lesion that can be measured in at least one dimension (nonnodal lesions ≥10 mm in longest diameter, lymph nodes ≥15 mm in short axis) according to RECIST 1.1. Eligible for cisplatinbased chemotherapy and able to take oral medications. WHO performance status 01. Age from 18 to 75 years. Adequate hematological values: hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L, ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L. Adequate hepatic function: total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN and &lt; 34.2 μmol/L; ALT and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN. Adequate renal function: calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min, according to the formula of CockcroftGault. Adequate cardiac function: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% as determined by echocardiogram; QTcF interval must be ≤ 480 ms. Women with childbearing potential are using effective contraception, are not pregnant or lactating and agree not to become pregnant during trial treatment and 6 months thereafter. A negative serum pregnancy test before inclusion into the trial is required for all women with childbearing potential. Men agree not to father a child during trial treatment and 6 months thereafter. NSCLC with any additional small cell carcinoma (SCLC) component by local diagnostic pathology report. Meningeosis carcinomatosa, symptomatic or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with treated, controlled CNS metastases can be enrolled 2 weeks after the end of radiotherapy if asymptomatic (no residual neurologic deficits) and no longer on corticosteroids. Previous or concurrent malignancy with the following exceptions: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (adequate wound healing is required prior registration), in situ carcinoma of the cervix, treated curatively and without evidence of recurrence for at least 5 years prior registration, superficial bladder cancer, prostate intraepithelial neoplasm, other noninvasive or indolent malignancy, or other solid tumor treated curatively and without evidence of recurrence for at least 5 years prior registration. Leptomeningeal disease. Concurrent radiotherapy (patients with prior radiotherapy other than for brain metastases ≥ 7 days prior to registration can be enrolled). Previous systemic therapy for advanced NSCLC; previous adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy allowed if last dose was administered at least 6 months ago. Major surgery within 3 weeks before registration. Concurrent treatment with any other experimental drug or other anticancer therapy. Impaired cardiovascular function or clinically severe or uncontrolled cardiovascular diseases, including any of the following: congestive heart failure NYHA III or IV, history of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary angioplasty, or stenting) &lt; 6 months prior to registration, symptomatic chronic heart failure (G2 or higher), history or current evidence of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication and/or conduction abnormality &lt; 6 months prior to registration except atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Uncontrolled arterial hypertension defined as persistent elevation of systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg despite medical treatment. History or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or current risk factors to RVO (e.g. uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, history of hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability syndromes); history of retinal degenerative disease. History of Gilbert's syndrome. Neuromuscular disorders that are associated with elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK; e.g. inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy). Neuropathy (&gt; G1) or hearing impairment/ tinnitus (&gt; G1). Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease (e.g. ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection). History of thromboembolic or cerebrovascular events within 6 months prior to registration, including transient ischemic attacks, cerebrovascular accidents, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli. Known history of acute or chronic pancreatitis. History of chronic inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn's disease requiring medical intervention (immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications or surgery) within 12 months prior to registration. Known positive serology for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), active hepatitis B, and/or active hepatitis C infection. Active infection within 14 days prior to registration. Planning on embarking on a new strenuous exercise regimen after first dose of binimetinib (NB: muscular activities, such as strenuous exercise, that can result in significant increases in plasma CPK levels should be avoided while on binimetinib treatment). Known lactose intolerance. Known hypersensitivity to the trial drugs or hypersensitivity to any other component of the trial treatment, including premedication. Any concomitant drugs contraindicated for use with pemetrexed and cisplatin according to the Swissmedicapproved current product information or with binimetinib according to the latest version of the Investigator's Brochure. Any other serious underlying medical, psychiatric, psychological, familial or geographical condition, which in the judgment of the investigator may interfere with the planned staging, treatment and followup, affect patient compliance or place the patient at high risk from treatmentrelated complications.</criteria>
