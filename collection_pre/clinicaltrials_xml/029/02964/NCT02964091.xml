	<brief_summary>The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a medication, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), used to treat individuals with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Rwandan adults. A sub-cohort of participants will have limited laboratory monitoring to determine the minimum laboratory tests necessary.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is an open-label single arm study that will evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety and tolerability of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir fixed dose combination administered for 12 weeks in HCV treatment-naive and treatment-experienced participants with chronic genotype 1 or 4 HCV infection. Approximately 240 participants will be enrolled and treated with sofosbuvir (SOF) 400 mg/LDV 90 mg fixed dose combination (FDC) one tablet once daily for 12 weeks in the SHARED 1 study. Sixty additional participants will be enrolled in the SHARED 2 sub-cohort with laboratory monitoring blinded to study clinicians.</detailed_description>
