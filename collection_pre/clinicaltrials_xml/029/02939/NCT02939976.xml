	<brief_summary>Patients with partially blocked blood vessel(s) in their heart may need a medical procedure called "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)" to open the narrowed blood vessel(s). The purpose of this study is to simultaneously address four potential advances in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) care for patients at least 65 years old. The investigators are looking to see if these advances can improve the outcome for these patients. 1. Opening the arteries with a Medtronic stent 2. Radial access (from wrist) success with a Medtronic stent 3. Checking the percent of blockage in the diseased artery/arteries using Volcano guide wires. 4. Reduced bleeding and vascular complications with radial arterial access for primary PCI in STEMI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Access Site for Enhancing PCI in STEMI for Seniors (SAFE STEMI for Seniors)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multi-center, randomized, open-label, unblinded, active and historical-controlled trial in which approximately 1100 seniors undergoing urgent PCI from at least 70 centers will be enrolled. All consented subjects will undergo attempted radial arterial access. For Drug Eluting Stent (DES) eligible patients, after stable Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction risk score (TIMI)-3 flow is established in the Infarct Related Artery (IRA), patients without randomization exclusion criteria and multi-vessel disease will be randomized 1:1 to IRA-only revascularization or iFR-guided complete revascularization. After stent implantation, subjects will be contacted for follow-up at 30 days, 1 year, and 18 months. Primary endpoint results will be reported after all subjects have completed 12 months of clinical follow-up. STEMI patients eligible for radial access: - DES Eligible with single vessel Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) will receive DES to IRA - DES Eligible with Multi-vessel CAD will randomize 1:1 to IRA-only revascularization or Instantaneous Wave Free Radio (iFR)-guided complete revascularization. - Enrolled but subsequently determined to be DES ineligible will be followed in a parallel Base Metal Stent (BMS) Registry (up to 100 subjects)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Have the capacity to understand and sign an informed consent or have a Legally Authorized Representative that can understand and sign an informed consent prior to initial arteriotomy access. 2. At least 65 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent and/or randomization. 3. Significant STelevation myocardial infarction or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on ECG with chest pain &lt; 12 hours. 4. Accessible right or left radial artery conduit for PCI. 5. Physician intent to perform transradial PCI. 1. Cardiogenic shock requiring pressor agents or mechanical circulatory assistance (e.g., intraaortic balloon pump, left ventricular assist device, Impella) prior to revascularization. 2. Prior heart transplant or any other organ transplant or is on a waiting list for any organ transplant. 3. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin; heparin or bivalirudin; all available P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticlopidine, cangrelor and ticagrelor); or any zotarolimus, everolimus, sirolimus, cobalt, chromium, nickel, tungsten, acrylic, or fluoro polymers stent; or hypersensitivity to contrast media that cannot be adequately premedicated. 4. Elective surgery planned within the first 12 months after the procedure that will require interruption or discontinuation of planned dual antiplatelet therapy. 5. Known platelet count less than 100,000 cells/mm3 or greater than 700,000 cells/mm3 6. A white blood cell count of less than 3000 cells/mm3 7. Documented or suspected liver disease (including laboratory evidence of hepatitis). 8. History of hemorrhagic stroke, bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions. 9. Known indication for chronic anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist or Novel Oral AntiCoagulant (NOAC). 10. Has had a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic neurological attack within the past 6 months. 11. Has had a significant gastrointestinal or urinary bleed within the past 6 months. 12. Known extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe radial arterial access. 13. Known other medical illness (e.g., cancer, chronic infectious disease, severe vascular disease, or congestive heart failure) or known history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc.) that may cause noncompliance with the protocol or is associated with a life expectancy of less than 1 year. 14. Participation in another clinical study using an investigational agent or device within the past 3 months.</criteria>
