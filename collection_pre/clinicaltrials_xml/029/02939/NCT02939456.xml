	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study taking place at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust. Patients referred for MRI for possible prostate cancer will be invited to take part in the study. Following consent, participants will have an additional MRI sequence performed during their routine MRI called Double Inversion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DIR-MRI). Participants scan images and prostate biopsy histology report (if applicable) will be reviewed by the research team.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study taking place at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust. Patients referred for MRI for possible prostate cancer will be invited to take part in the study. Following consent, participants will have an additional MRI sequence performed during their routine MRI called Double Inversion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DIR-MRI). Participants scan images and prostate biopsy histology report (if applicable) will be reviewed by the research team. The research team will look at the variability of LNR score amongst the two scan typed and the DCE-MRI and DIR-MRI images will be correlated with biopsy results to give an indication of the accuracy.</detailed_description>
