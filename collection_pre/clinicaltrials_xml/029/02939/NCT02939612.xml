	<brief_title>Stress Management Intervention in Early Stage Cancer: Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment can be disruptive and traumatic, often accompanied by a multitude of stressors for the patients and their support network. Uncertainty of outcome and invasive medical procedures with aversive side effects are not uncommon, and while people differ widely in how they experience and cope with such challenges, cancer related distress including anxiety, depression, worry and rumination is prevalent. With multiple domains of function impacted it is also not surprising that quality of life (QoL) often is diminished. Stress management interventions can facilitate adjustment to cancer, including reduced distress and improved quality of life. Unfortunately, many people with cancer do not have the strength or opportunity to attend groups or in-person interventions. This study will therefore test the effect of an app for stress management among patients with different cancer diagnosis. The app contains 10 modules distributed over five weeks, focusing on education of different techniques for reduction of stress and stress reduction exercises. The app will first be tested in a pilot study among 20 patients with different cancer diagnosis and eventually in a randomized controlled trial with a sample of 260 patients with different cancer diagnosis. The participants will be randomly assigned to use the 10 module app or to a control group that receive treatment as usual, and followed with repeated measures over 12 months.</detailed_description>
