	<brief_summary>Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of bronchospasm, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and chronic airway inflammation and pharmacological treatment for this condition is done with bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory. Pharmacologic therapy has clinical efficacy in the control, but the patient often does not adhere adequately. There is need for further research into non-pharmacological therapies for clinical asthma control and in turn the use of CPAP and bilevel pressure in the airways has shown beneficial effects on autonomic modulation and bronchial responsiveness leading to the hypothesis that these therapies also have effects on the BIE. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of these non-pharmacological therapies in several variables and especially the BIE.</brief_summary>
