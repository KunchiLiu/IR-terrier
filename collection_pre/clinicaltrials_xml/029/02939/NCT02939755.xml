	<brief_summary>To test the efficacy of a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention to reduce symptoms of depression, pain, and fatigue and improve health-related quality of life (HRQL) in advanced cancer patients and to reduce stress and depression, and fewer CVD risk factors in caregivers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Web-based Collaborative Care Intervention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will enroll patients at two UPMC sites: Montefiore Hospital, an academic medical center, and Passavant Hospital, a community based hospital. Based on our sample size estimate the investigators will have at least 364 patients and caregivers with complete data at 12 months follow up. The patient and caregiver will be randomly assigned to one of two arms (intervention versus enhanced usual care) stratified by gender and vessel invasion. Because these factors are the two most robust prognostic factors in this patient population. At 6 and 12 months after enrollment, follow-up questionnaires and blood draws will be performed for patients and caregivers. The stepped WBCC intervention includes at least biweekly contact from a care coordinator by phone and face to face visits occurring approximately every 2 months, and 24 hour 7 day a week access to a website. Patients randomized to the "enhanced usual care" arm receive their usual care from their medical team. However, if the patient scores in the clinical range on one or more of the three symptoms s/he will receive education about the symptom and be referred to the appropriate health care provider for further treatment in their community. The care coordinator will follow up with the patient after 3 weeks to assess barriers to treatment and assist further with accessing treatment if needed. Intervention fidelity (e.g., consistency across care coordinators) will be reduced by requiring the care coordinators to follow a 300 page manual and providing standardized training by the PI who is a clinical psychologist. Dr. Steel (PI) has received training and certification from the American Psycho-Oncology Society in the design and analysis of psycho-oncology clinical trials and intervention fidelity. The study investigators will not prescribe any medications but rather make recommendations to the patient's oncologist, PCP, psychiatrist, or pain management specialist who will be free to accept or reject the recommendations by the study team. Medication type, dosage, and adherence to medication (e.g., self-report and pharmacy refills) will be recorded for patients in the WBCC intervention and enhanced usual care arms.</detailed_description>
