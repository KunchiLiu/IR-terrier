	<brief_summary>This randomized, controlled trial aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which a plant-based dietary intervention causes weight loss. Using a low-fat, plant-based diet for 16 weeks, along with an untreated control for comparison, the study will measure changes in insulin sensitivity, postprandial metabolism, and intracellular lipid, and assess their associations with changes in body weight.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diet, Insulin Sensitivity, and Postprandial Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a 16-week trial, overweight adults will be randomly assigned to two groups. Changes in insulin sensitivity, postprandial metabolism, and body weight will be the primary dependent variables. The Diet Group will be asked to follow a low-fat, vegan diet and will receive weekly classes and support. The Control Group will be asked to make no changes in diet or exercise for 16 weeks, but will be instructed in the intervention diet at the study's conclusion. This study conducts a pilot substudy to test the hypothesis that changes in insulin sensitivity observed in response to a diet intervention correlate with changes in intramyocellular and/or intrahepatocellular lipid.</detailed_description>
