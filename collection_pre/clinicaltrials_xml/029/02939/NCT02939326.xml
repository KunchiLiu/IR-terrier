	<brief_title>Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of a Single Treatment Cycle of EB-001 in Subjects With Glabellar Frown Lines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Signed and dated IRBapproved informed consent form (ICF). 2. Men or women between the ages of 18 and 60, inclusive. 3. Subjects in good health as determined by medical history, physical and focused neurological examinations, clinical laboratory studies, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and Investigator's judgement. 4. Presence of bilaterally symmetrical GL of moderate to severe rating at maximum frown, as measured using FWS by both the Investigator and subject prior to study treatment. 5. Subjects with sufficient visual acuity without the use of eyeglasses (contact lens use acceptable) to accurately assess their facial wrinkles as determined by Investigator's judgement. 6. Women of child bearing potential must not be pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the study. 7. Women of nonchildbearing potential must be either postmenopausal (at least 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea) or surgically sterile (e.g., tubal ligation, hysterectomy, etc.). 8. Women of childbearing potential agreeing to use dual methods of contraception from the day of dosing until 3 months afterwards. Female subjects using oral contraception must have initiated treatment at least 2 months prior to the day of dosing. 9. Male subjects with partner(s) of childbearing potential agreeing to use dual methods of contraception from the day of dosing until 3 months afterwards, and to no sperm donation from day of dosing until 3 months afterwards. 10. Willing and able to complete protocol requirements and instructions, which include completion of all required visits. 1. Any condition that precludes a subject's ability to comply with study requirements, including completion of the study visits or inability to read, understand, and/or selfassess GL severity using FWS. 2. Any uncontrolled systemic disease or other medical condition. 3. Any medical condition that may put the subject at increased risk with exposure to botulinum toxin of any serotype, including diagnosed myasthenia gravis, EatonLambert syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or any other condition that might interfere with neuromuscular function. 4. Current or previous botulinum toxin treatment of any serotype. 5. Anticipated need for treatment with botulinum toxin of any serotype for any reason during the study (other than study treatment). 6. Known immunization or hypersensitivity to any botulinum toxin serotype. 7. Known allergy or sensitivity to any of the components of the study treatments, or any materials used in the study procedures. 8. Any of the following procedures or treatments occurring within the specified period prior to screening: 3 months: Nonablative resurfacing laser or light treatment, microdermabrasion, or superficial peels. 6 months: Any facial cosmetic procedure with medium depth to deep facial chemical peels (e.g., trichloroacetic acid [TCA] and phenol), or mid facial or periorbital laser skin resurfacing. 6 months: On topical retinoid therapy and/or topical hormone cream applied to the face, who have not been on a consistent dose regimen and are unable to maintain the same regimen for the study. 12 months: Midfacial or periorbital treatment with nonpermanent soft tissue fillers. 12 months: On oral retinoid therapy. 9. Prior periorbital surgery, facial lift (full face or mid face), brow lift, or related procedures (e.g., eyelid [blepharoplasty] and/or eyebrow surgery). 10. Prior mid face or periorbital treatment with permanent soft tissue fillers, synthetic implantation (e.g., GoreTexÂ®), and/or autologous fat transplantation. 11. Marked facial asymmetry, dermatochalasis, deep dermal scarring, excessively thick sebaceous skin. 12. The inability to substantially lessen facial rhytides (fixed lines) even by physically spreading them apart, as determined by the Investigator. 13. Permanent makeup that would interfere with the assessment of facial wrinkles. 14. Subjects who, in the Investigator's opinion, are unable or unwilling to maintain their standardized skin care regimen throughout the study period. 15. Any eyebrow or eyelid ptosis at baseline as determined by the Investigator. 16. Infection or skin disorder at the injection sites. 17. History of facial nerve palsy. 18. Recent history (within 6 months of screening) of alcohol or drug abuse based on the Investigator's judgement. 19. Anticipated need for surgery or overnight hospitalization during the study. Current enrollment in an investigational drug or device study or participation in such a study within 30 days or 5 halflives of the drug, whichever is longer, of entry into this study.</criteria>
