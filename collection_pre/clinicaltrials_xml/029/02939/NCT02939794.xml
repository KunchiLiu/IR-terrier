	<brief_summary>Anemia after cardiac surgery is a vast phenomena. More than 70% of the patients who under went surgery represented with hemoglobin less than 8 mg/dl (the cutoff for blood transfusion) and more than 80% of the patients receives at least one unit of red blood cell transfusion. There were number of attempts to prevent the postoperative anemia by giving erythropoietin, Iron per os and intra venus iron. non of the above have shown increase in Hemoglobin after the cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Ferric Carboxymaltose on Hemoglobin and Blood Transfusion in Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Objectives The study objectives are: 1. Determine hemoglobin values in non-anemic patients given ferric Carboxymaltose prior to and post heart surgery. 2. Determine the effect of ferric Carboxymaltose in non-anemic patients prior to surgery on the number of blood units administer postoperation. Research Methods Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled research. All patients who are in the cardiac surgery department for bypass surgery, valve replacement surgery or combined surgery will be eligible to participate in the study. The study will be presented and explained to all patients and, if they consent, patients will be divided into two random groups. One group will receive Ferinject IV 24-48 hours prior to surgery. The second group will receive a placebo drug in the same time period as when the drug Ferinject is administered. The Population Studied All patients aged 18 or older hospitalized at the Rambam Medical Center and are candidates for open-heart surgery (coronary artery bypass, valve, combined).</detailed_description>

Patients with anemia prior to surgery for any reason (B12 deficiency or folic acid deficiency). 12. Patients participating in another drug trial. 13. Patients treated with iron who took medication within the four weeks prior to surgery. 14. Patients who received a blood transfusion in the four weeks prior to surgery.</criteria>
