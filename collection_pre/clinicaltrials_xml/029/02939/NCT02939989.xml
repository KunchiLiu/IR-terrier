	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of co-administration of ABT-493/ABT-530 plus sofosbuvir (SOF) plus ribavirin (RBV) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1 - 6-infected participants (including non-cirrhotic, or cirrhotic participants) who have experienced virologic failure in an AbbVie parent clinical study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants who experienced virologic failure during or after treatment with ABT 493/ABT530 in an AbbVie hepatitis C virus (HCV) parent study. Participants who have experienced virologic failure during or after receiving ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r + dasabuvir (3D), ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r (2D) in AbbVie HCV parent study may be enrolled at AbbVie's discretion. Cirrhotic participants must have compensated cirrhosis, (ChildPugh score of less than or equal to 6) at screening and no current or past evidence of ChildPugh B or C Classification or no clinical history of liver decompensation, including ascites noted on physical exam, hepatic encephalopathy or esophageal variceal bleeding. Cirrhotic participants must have absence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as indicated by a negative ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3 months prior to Screening or a negative US at Screening. History of severe, lifethreatening or other significant sensitivity to any study drug or drug component. Female participant who is pregnant, breastfeeding or is considering becoming pregnant during the study or for 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or as directed per the local ribavirin label. Recent (within 6 months prior to study drug administration) history of drug or alcohol abuse that could preclude adherence to the protocol in the opinion of the investigator, and failure in an AbbVie HCV parent study due to nonvirologic reasons. Positive test result at screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Screening laboratory analyses showing creatinine clearance less than 30 mg/dL. Discontinuation from previous AbbVie HCV clinical studies for reasons other than virologic failure (e.g., nonadherence, lost to followup, and/or the occurrence of an adverse event). Receipt of any HCV treatment after failing the treatment regimen in the AbbVie HCV parent study.</criteria>
