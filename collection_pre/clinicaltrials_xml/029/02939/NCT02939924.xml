	<brief_title>Treatment of Patients With Lesions in the Superficial Femoral or Popliteal Arteries Using Kanshas Drug Coated Balloon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The KANSHAS 1 (K-1) trial investigates the inhibition of restenosis using the Kanshas DCB in the treatment of de novo lesions in the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries. The proposed clinical study will be a prospective, multi-center, controlled, open, single-arm study. Up to 50 patients will be enrolled at up to 7 sites in Belgium and Germany. Follow-ups are scheduled before discharge, at 30 days, 6 months, 1, and 2 years. Each patient will have a follow-up contact via hospital visit and telephone.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Peripheral Arterial Disease</mesh_term>
	<criteria>General: 1. Clinically significant symptomatic leg ischemia, requiring treatment of the SFA and/or popliteal artery; 2. Able and willing to provide informed consent prior to study procedures; 3. Able and willing to comply with followup requirements; 4. Rutherford Clinical Category of 24; 5. Resting ABI of &lt;0.9 or abnormal exercise ABI; 6. ≥18 years old; 7. Life expectancy is &gt;2 year; Angiographic Criteria: 8. Cumulative lesion length ≥4 and ≤15 cm within the target vessel; Cumulative lesion consists of either a single de novo lesion or multiple lesions within the 415 cm segment; multiple lesions require to meet all the following; Separated by a gap of ≤ 3 cm; Able to be treated as a single lesion; Total combined lesion length including 3cm gap meets requirements; 9. Lesion location starts ≥2 cm distal to the common femoral bifurcation and terminates at ≥2 cm proximal to the origin of the tibioperoneal trunk; 10. Clinically and hemodynamically significant de novo stenosis (&gt;70% stenosis by visual estimate) or occlusion; 11. Target vessel diameter between ≥4 and ≤6 mm and able to be treated with available device size matrix; 12. Successful, uncomplicated (without use of a crossing device) antegrade wire crossing of lesion; 13. A patent inflow artery free from significant lesion (≥50% stenosis) as confirmed by angiography (treatment of target lesion acceptable after successful treatment of ipsilateral iliac lesions); NOTE: Successful ipsilateral iliac artery treatment is defined as attainment of residual diameter stenosis ≤30% without death or major vascular complication. 14. At least one patent native outflow artery to the ankle, free from significant (≥50%) stenosis as confirmed by angiography that has not previously been revascularized; 1. Pregnant or lactating females; 2. Coexisting clinically significant aneurismal disease of the abdominal aorta, iliac or popliteal arteries; 3. Significant gastrointestinal bleeding or any coagulopathy that would contraindicate the use of antiplatelet therapy; 4. Known intolerance to study medications, paclitaxel or contrast agents; 5. Patient participating in another investigational device or drug study that has not reached the primary endpoint; 6. History of hemorrhagic stroke within 2 months; 7. Previous or planned surgical or interventional procedure within 30 days of the study procedure; 8. Diagnosed liver failure, renal failure, chronic kidney disease, unstable angina pectoris, or myocardial infarction within 30 days of the procedure; 9. Presence of significant stenosis or occlusion of the inflow tract that cannot be successfully treated prior to study consideration. Successful is defined as &lt;30% residual stenosis of ipsilateral iliac artery with no major complications; 10. Acute thrombus in target vessel; 11. At site of target lesion, use of adjunctive therapies (i.e. laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty, scoring/cutting balloon, brachytherapy); 12. Outflow arteries (distal popliteal, anterior or posterior tibial or peroneal arteries) with significant lesions (≥50% stenosis) may not be treated during the same procedure; 13. Has instent restenosis in the target lesion; 14. Previous treatment with a drug coated PTA balloon catheter or drug eluting stent in the target vessel within 12 months of the index procedure; 15. Previous peripheral bypass affecting the target limb; 16. Has injuries in the target vessel, such as major flowlimiting dissection ( &gt; NHLBI Grade C) and perforation, requiring stenting prior to enrollment; 17. Obvious subintimal recanalization or intentional subintimal recanalization in the occlusive lesions; 18. Presence of severe calcification in the target lesions that precludes endovascular treatment. Severe calcification is defined as circumferential calcification involving ≥ 50% of vessel diameter.</criteria>
