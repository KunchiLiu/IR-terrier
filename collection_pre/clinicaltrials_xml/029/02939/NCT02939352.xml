	<brief_summary>High relapse rates among substance dependent individuals are likely due to a combination of factors that involve limbic circuits in the brain involved in craving, including vulnerability to salient cues. Emerging data suggests that non-invasive, targeted brain stimulation may be able to modulate activity in these circuits and decrease craving. The primary goal of this pilot study is to determine the extent to which a single session of continuous theta burst stimulation (TBS) to the medial prefrontal cortex can attenuate limbic circuitry involved in craving among cocaine users and alcohol users. This will be tested through a double-blind,sham-controlled brain stimulation and brain imaging study in a cohort of polysubstance abusers and alcohol users.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Theta Burst Stimulation on the Brain Response to Drug and Alcohol Cues</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This parent protocol contains two components - one of which is targeting cocaine users, the other of which is targeting heavy alcohol users (who will also serve as an appropriate control group for the cocaine users - who typically have comorbid alcohol use disorders). All participants will receive one session of real and one session of sham continuous theta burst stimulation (TBS). TBS is a form of non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation. sham TMS on another visit (randomized). Continuous TBS is designed to lower cortical excitability, and requires a shorter stimulation period than typical low frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The investigators will test the hypotheses that stimulation over the medial prefrontal cortex will attenuate activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (Aim 1), using single pulse TMS in the magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Through this innovative technique it is possible to apply a single pulse of TMS to the medial prefrontal cortex and model the hemodynamic response at the stimulation site as well as monosynaptic target regions, including the striatum. The investigators will also investigate the effect of TBS on neural response to drug cues (Aim 2). The results of these aims will be further correlated with self-reported assessments of craving throughout each experimental visit. These data will be preliminary data for a subsequent R01 focused on the sustained effects of multiple sessions of TBS and their efficacy in lowering craving for extended periods of time in treatment-seekers.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion: nontreatment seeking cocaine users (with or without comorbid alcohol use disorder) and individuals with alcohol use disorders, 2555 years old. For the cocaine sub study: Cocaine users will be excluded for current use of prescription or illicit psychoactive drugs other than cocaine and marijuana, current or past substance dependence criteria other than cocaine, marijuana, or alcohol, smoking &gt;1 pack of cigarettes per day, current breath alcohol concentration &gt;0.002, a lifetime history of head injury, a history of seizures or migraine headaches (as transcranial magnetic stimulation may exacerbate these conditions), and violation of other magnetic resonance imaging safety measures. For both the cocaine sub study and the alcohol sub study: Drug Screens: A multidrug urine panel will be given to all participants at the screening visit and each scanning/stimulation visit. In order to minimize any potential risk of this session of theta burst stimulation, participants must have a negative urine drug screen for stimulants (including cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine) at the Scanning/Stimulation visits and have no signs of alcohol withdrawal. Based on the sensitivity of this test, this will require that the participants abstain from cocaine use for 48 hours prior to the intervention. While there are no reports of adverse events from transcranial magnetic stimulation in cocaine users this precaution is being taken as psychostimulants are known to reduce the seizure threshold. Participants will be informed of this at the Screening visit. If they attend a Scanning/Stimulation visit and have a positive urine drug screen, they will be given an opportunity to reschedule.</criteria>
