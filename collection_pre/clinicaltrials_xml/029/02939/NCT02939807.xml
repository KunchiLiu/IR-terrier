	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II efficacy study of single agent ABC294640. Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have experienced tumor progression with 1st line single agent sorafenib will receive ABC294640 500 mg po bid continuously. Patients will continue on therapy until the development of progressive disease per modified RECIST, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of patient consent or other event as outlined in patient discontinuation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patient must have advanced hepatocellular carcinoma; fibrolamellar HCC is not allowed. Hepatocellular carcinoma should be confirmed by at least one of the following: 1. Tissue diagnosis. 2. The presence of one or more liver lesions measuring ≥ 2 cm in longest diameter, showing characteristic arterial enhancement and venous washout using arterialphase contrast enhanced imaging, and a clinical history of cirrhosis 2. Voluntary signed and dated institutional review board (IRB) approved informed consent form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. 3. Documented progression or intolerance to sorafenib as demonstrated by: 1. Radiographic (by mRECIST, see APPENDIX F) or symptomatic progression on/after sorafenib 2. Intolerance to sorafenib consisting of CTCAE grade 2 or greater drugrelated AE which persisted in spite of comprehensive supportive therapy according to institutional standards AND persisted or recurred after sorafenib treatment interruption of at least 7 days and dose reduction by one dose level (to 400 mg once daily). 4. Patient must have at least one measurable untreated lesion as per modified RECIST criteria. Measurable disease may include extrahepatic lesions. Abdominal imaging should employ a "liver protocol" image capture technique. The following are not considered measurable lesions: bone lesions, ascites, and pleural effusions. Prior RFA, PEI, or TACE of nontarget lesions is allowed. 5. Time interval for last local therapy (radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, radiotherapy, transarterial chemoembolization) more than 4 weeks prior to registration. 6. Willingness to undergo core biopsy of primary hepatic tumor, or a metastatic site prior at baseline and again at Cycle 2 Day 1. 7. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. 8. 18 years of age or older. 9. ECOG performance status of 02. 10. ChildPugh Class A OR B with a score of 7. 11. Acceptable liver function: 1. Bilirubin ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal (CTCAE Grade 2 baseline) 2. AST (SGOT) &amp; ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 x ULN (CTCAE Grade 1 baseline) 12. Acceptable kidney function: a. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X ULN (CTCAE Grade 1 baseline) 13. Acceptable hematologic status: 1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000 cells/mm3, 2. Platelet count ≥ 75,000 (plt/mm3) (CTCAE Grade 1 baseline) 3. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL. 14. Acceptable blood sugar control: a. Fasting glucose ≤ 160 mg/dL (CTCAE Grade 1 baseline) 15. Urinalysis: No clinically significant abnormalities. 16. International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.7 17. As determined by the treating investigator, the patient must have wellcontrolled blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;150mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &lt;100 mmHg for the majority of measurements. 18. A negative pregnancy test (if female of child bearing potential). 19. Willingness to use effective contraceptive methods during the study. If female (or female partner of male subject), is either not of childbearing potential (defined as postmenopausal for ≥ 1 year or surgically sterile) or practicing two forms of contraception. Sexually active male participants must agree to use a physical barrier method (male latex rubber condom with or without spermicide). 1. New York Heart Association Class III or IV, cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, unstable arrhythmia, or evidence of ischemia on ECG. 2. Underlying psychiatric disorder requiring pharmacological intervention or a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score of 8 or more. 3. Neurological disorder (Parkinson's disease, dementia, Multiple sclerosis) 4. Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection, requiring systemic therapy. 5. Pregnant or nursing women. NOTE: Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception or abstinence prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. 6. Treatment with radiation therapy, surgery, or investigational therapy within 28 days prior to registration 7. More than one line of prior systemic therapy for HCC. 8. Unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol. 9. Known infection with HIV. 10. Hepatitis C on protease therapy. 11. Serious nonmalignant disease that could compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the Investigator. 12. Patients who are receiving drugs that are sensitive substrates of CYP450 1A2, 3A4, 2C9, 2C19 or 2D6, or strong inhibitors or inducers of all major CYP450 isozymes that cannot be stopped at least 7 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) before starting treatment with ABC294640 and either replaced with another appropriate medication or not given for the duration of the clinical study. 13. A history of CTC Grade 3 bleeding esophageal or gastric varices within the past 2 months. Prior variceal bleed is permitted if patient has undergone banding or sclerotherapy and there has been no evidence of bleeding for 2 months. Patients at risk for varices (based on the following: known history of esophageal or gastric varices; evidence of hepatic cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension including biopsyproven cirrhosis, hypersplenism, or radiographic findings of varices) will be screened (using either esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD] or capsule endoscopy) for esophageal varices, unless such screening has been performed in the past two years from study entry and the patient is receiving medical treatment for prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, such as nonselective beta blockade. If varices are identified that require intervention (banding), patient will not be eligible until varices are adequately treated. Patients presenting with gastric varices will not be eligible for the study. 14. Patients who are currently taking Coumadin or Coumadin derivatives. 15. Patients who are currently participating in any other clinical trial of an investigational product. 16. History of organ transplantation. 17. Other primary malignancy within past 5 years except carcinoma in situ of the cervix or urinary bladder or nonmelanoma skin cancer. 18. Mental incapacitation or psychiatric illness that would preclude study participation. 19. Prisoners or patients who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness must not be enrolled into this study.</criteria>
