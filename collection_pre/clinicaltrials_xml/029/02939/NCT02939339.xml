	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective treatment in decreasing craving in individuals who habitually smoke cigarettes. The study consists of six total visits to MUSC; one for the consent process, two that will include MRI scans, and five that will include TMS administration. Compensation will be provided for each visit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Theta Burst TMS as a Tool to Change Smoking Behavior</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior and recent evidence suggests a role of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in cigarette smoking. The present study will examine whether a five-day regimen of theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) reduces cigarette smoking outside of the lab (examined through self-report and physiological measures) and motivation to smoke inside the lab (examined through behavioral tasks and functional MRI).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>smoke at least 10 cigarettes a day (on average) comorbid mental or physical illness (managed or unmanaged) pregnancy use of prescription medication that might affect smoking or nicotine metabolism, use of smokeless tobacco or alternative nicotine products use illicit drugs of abuse (verified through urine screen and selfreport), score of above a 7 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (indicative of nonrisky use), a history of epilepsy or seizures not otherwise specified (other than childhood febrile seizures) a history of chronic migraines, failure to meet all criteria on a standardized MRI/TMS safety screen (including but not limited to implanted electronic devices, bullets or metallic fragments above the waist, hair clips and piercings above the waist that cannot be removed) presence of any barriers to making contact between the TMS coil and the skin (e.g. cornrows that cannot be removed, glasses that the participant is unwilling to remove).</criteria>
