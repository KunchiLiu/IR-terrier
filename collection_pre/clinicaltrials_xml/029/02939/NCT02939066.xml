	<brief_summary>Current modalities for lymph node staging in cancer can be limited. Needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) is a novel endoscopic technique, which is compatible with the 19-gauge FNA needle. Under endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) guidance, nCLE enables real-time in vivo imaging of lesion tissues at cellular and subcellular levels.This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) at the time of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and to describe the nCLE features that distinguish between benign and malignant lymph nodes.</brief_summary>
