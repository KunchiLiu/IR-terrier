	<brief_summary>Purpose of study is to determine safety and efficacy of use of autologous Adipose-Derived cellular Stromal Vascular Fraction (AD-cSVF) suspended in Normal Saline and delivered via intravascular system of quality of life and alteration of documented Muscular Sclerosis (MS) and related neurodegenerative patients. It is believed that the heterogeneous cell population which includes multipotent stem/stromal cells are capable of immune modulation/inflammatory modulation properties. Exam of disease progression and quality of life changes will be evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelination disease which features damage to insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. This damage or degenerative changes disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in range of signs and symptoms which include physical and mental changes. Symptoms are variable and often include visual changes, sensory irregularities, and motor coordination. MS has several forms which result in new symptoms in either isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or gradual increasing symptoms (progressive forms). While cause is not clear, mechanisms have been suggested association with loss of the immune system or failure to produce myelin-producing cells. Some suggest a genetic predisposition or environmental factor, but the exact causation in all cases have not been elucidated. Medications have been developed, but remain modestly effective and possessing major side effects and poorly tolerated. Alternative treatments, including physical therapy and some stem/stromal therapies have become more common. Three main characteristics of MS are: 1). Lesion formations in the central nervous system (called Plaques); 2). Inflammation; 3). Destruction of myelin sheaths of neurons. This demyelination is thought to stimulate the inflammatory processes due to action of a lymphocyte group known at T-cell which seems to recognize patient's own myelin as foreign and proceeds to attack it (known as "autoreactive lymphocytes"). Traditionally, exacerbation's are often treated with high dose intravenous steroids which may be of short term reduction of symptoms, not addressing the underlying causation. Current medications available for treatment are expensive and fraught with major side effects, making their use very difficult and producing limited measured value. With the advent of convenient adipose harvesting and processing in closed systems, the ability to easily and safely acquire significant of stem/stromal cells, studies are underway to utilize autologous stem/stromal cells. This study is aimed at evaluation of the safety profile (adverse reactions &amp; severe adverse reaction) of the closed syringe, microcannula harvesting of subdermal fat deposits. This autologous cell group obtained with isolation and concentration of cells within the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) via enzymatic digestion, and deployed via intravascular routes. As these cells are very small, there is belief that they are able to pass into the cerebral fluids in defects of the blood brain barrier (BBB) or are small enough to pass into the fluids of the CNS (central nervous system).</detailed_description>
