	<brief_summary>Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized as a disorder that causes recurrent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airways during sleep. Objectives: In this way, the study will investigate the efficacy of inspiratory muscle training in improving the severity of obstructive sleep apnea and sleep quality of the research participants. Methods: The investigators will invite individuals of both sexes diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea moderate and / or severe, arising from the Sleep Laboratory of the Hospital PROCAPE, located in Recife. This is a randomized-controlled trial, double-blind to be held in two groups: A) Individuals with OSA (moderate or severe) - Experimental Group: The components of this group hold the IMT with load of 75% of Pimáx. ( assessed weekly) for eight weeks. B) Individuals with OSA (moderate or severe) -Group control: This group will simulate training, performing no-load training for the same period the intervention group. All guidance on training and weekly evaluations will be made by the responsible for the research physiotherapist in Cardiopulmonary Physiotherapy Laboratory (LACAP - UFPE). Before and after the eight weeks, the groups will be evaluated by polysomnography, acoustic pharyngometry, tests for respiratory muscle strength (Manovacuometry) and lung function (spirometry). Expected results: Improvement of severity of OSA and sleep quality of research subjects after the completion of eight weeks of TMI when compared to the control group.</brief_summary>
