	<brief_summary>Phase 1 study to evaluate two doses of Alum Adjuvanted Zika Virus Purified Inactivated Vaccine (ZPIV) administered 28 days apart. The study will enroll 75 flavivirus naïve healthy adult subjects into 3 equal groups sequentially. Each group will include 20 ZPIV recipients and 5 placebo recipients. Group 1 will receive two ZPIV or placebo doses 28 days apart. Group 2 subjects will receive a two-dose regimen of IXIARO® 28 days apart; two ZPIV or placebo doses three months later 28 days apart. Group 3 subjects will receive one dose of YF-VAX® followed three months later by two ZPIV or placebo doses 28 days apart. A subset of up to 30 will be selected to receive a third ZPIV vaccination. The primary objectives are: 1) To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a two-dose homologous prime boost regimen of ZPIV among flavivirus-naïve, YF-VAX® primed, and IXIARO® primed subjects; 2) To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a third dose of ZPIV in a subset of up to 30 subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1, First-in-human, Double-blinded, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Trial of a Zika Virus Purified Inactivated Vaccine (ZPIV) With Alum Adjuvant in Healthy Flavivirus-naive and Flavivirus-Primed Subjects.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a single-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, first-in-human, Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of two doses of alum adjuvanted ZPIV administered 28 days apart. The study will enroll 75 flavivirus naïve healthy male and non-pregnant female, non-breastfeeding adult subjects (ages 18-49, inclusive) into 3 equal groups sequentially, starting with Group 1 followed by Group 2 and then Group 3. Screening will occur within 28 days of first vaccination. Each group will include 20 ZPIV recipients and 5 placebo recipients. Two sentinel subjects from Group 1 will be enrolled first and will receive ZPIV in an open-label fashion first. The next 23 subjects (18 ZPIV, 5 placebo) will be randomized into Group 1. This will be followed by the randomization of 25 subjects into Group 2 (JE priming). The remaining 25 subjects to enroll will be randomized into Group 3 (YF priming). Each group will include 20 ZPIV recipients and 5 placebo recipients. Group 1 subjects will receive two 5.0 mcg doses of ZPIV or placebo administered IM on Days 1 and 29. Group 2 subjects will receive a two-dose regimen of IXIARO® (Valneva) 28 days apart; two ZPIV or placebo doses will be administered three months later IM 28 days apart. Group 3 subjects will receive one dose of YF-VAX® (Sanofi Pasteur) followed three months later by two ZPIV or placebo doses administered IM 28 days apart. A subset of up to 30 subjects (10 subjects per group) will be selected to receive a third ZPIV vaccination. The primary objectives are: 1) To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a two-dose homologous prime boost regimen of ZPIV among flavivirus-naïve, YF-VAX® primed, and IXIARO® primed subjects; 2) To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a third dose of ZPIV in a subset of up to 30 subjects (10 per group). The secondary objectives are: 1) To evaluate the quantitative humoral immune response at 28 days after the first and second ZPIV administration, and 112, 196, 280, and 364 days after the first ZPIV administration for each of the three groups; 2) To evaluate the quantitative humoral immune response at 28, 84, and 168 days after the third ZPIV dose in a subset of up to 30 subjects (10 per group).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Must be a male or nonpregnant, nonbreastfeeding female between the ages of 18 and 49 years, inclusive, at the time of screening and enrollment. 2. Must be willing and able to read, sign, and date the informed consent document before studyrelated procedures are performed. 3. Must be willing and able to comply with study requirements and be available for followup visits for the entire study. 4. Must have a means to be contacted by telephone. 5. Must have a body mass index (BMI) &gt;/=18.1 and &lt;35.0 kg/m2. 6. Must have acceptable* screening laboratory findings within 40 days before day 1. Acceptable clinical laboratory parameters include no more than Grade 1 on toxicity scale. White Blood Cell (WBC), Hemoglobin, and platelet count will be reported as part of the Complete Blood Count (CBC). These labs will be graded according to the toxicity scale. Other results included on the CBC panel will not be graded. They will be reviewed by an investigator who will determine clinical significance and may be used to determine additional workup. Sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, random glucose, total protein, albumin, calcium, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase will be reported as part of the Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP). These labs will be graded according to the toxicity scale. Other results included on the CMP panel will not be graded. They will be reviewed by an investigator who will determine clinical significance and may be used to determine additional workup. Note: If laboratory screening tests are out of acceptable range, repeat of screening tests is permitted one time, provided there is an alternative explanation for the out of range value. 7. Must be in good health based on the investigator's clinical judgment when considering findings from past medical history, medication use, vital signs, and an abbreviated physical examination. Note 1: Good health is defined by the absence of any medical condition described in the exclusion criteria in a subject with a normal abbreviated physical exam and vital signs. If the subject has a preexisting condition not listed in the exclusion criteria, the condition cannot meet any of the following criteria: first diagnosed in the last 3 months; worsening in terms of clinical outcome in the last 6 months; or involves need for medication that may pose a risk to the subject's safety or impede assessment of AEs or immunogenicity if they participate in the study. Note 2: An abbreviated physical exam differs from a complete exam in that it does not include a genitourinary and rectal exam. Note 3: Vital signs must be normal by protocol toxicity grading scale or determined to be normalvariant by investigator. In the event of an abnormal heart rate or blood pressure due to physiological variation or activity, the subject may rest for 10 minutes in a quiet room, and then blood pressure and/or heart rate may be remeasured. Repeated vital signs may be used to determine eligibility. 8. Women of childbearing potential* must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test immediately prior to each vaccination. Note: All female subjects are considered of childbearing potential unless postmenopausal or surgically sterile and &gt;/=3 months have passed since sterilization procedure. Postmenopausal is defined as amenorrhea for &gt;/=12 months without an alternative medical cause. Permanent female sterilization procedures include tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectomy, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or successful Essure placement. 9. Women of childbearing potential must use an acceptable method of contraception* from one month (30 days) prior to the first vaccination until at least 60 days after the last vaccination. Acceptable methods of contraception include the following: Use highly effective contraceptive methods, defined by &lt;1% failure rate per year independent of user adherence, including longacting reversible contraception (LARC): progestinreleasing subdermal implants and intrauterine devices (IUD). Use effective contraceptive methods, defined by 59% failure rate with typical use and &lt;1% failure rate with consistent and correct use, including: prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, combined pill, progestinonly pill, hormonereleasing transdermal patch or vaginal ring, and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection (DepoProvera).
