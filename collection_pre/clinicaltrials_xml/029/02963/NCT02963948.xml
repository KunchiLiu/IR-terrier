	<brief_summary>This is a 4-phase study to implement the NIDA CDEs in primary care settings. Collecting and utilizing the CDEs in clinical practice requires a strategy for implementing screening to collect substance use information that populates the CDEs, and assisting primary care medical staff to offer appropriate interventions by providing clinical decision support (CDS) and a mechanism for making referrals to addiction treatment. Investigators aim to maximize the efficient adoption of screening, CDS, and treatment referrals by integrating all of these activities into the electronic health record (EHR). The study will be conducted at three sites, representing three large health systems. Each phase will include deliverables essential to move to the next phase, and an independent Advisory Committee will review progress and make recommendations at each transition about how best to progress to each subsequent phase. Based on progress during earlier phases, the Advisory Committee may recommend expansion to additional clinics or health systems during the second part of Phase 4.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phased-Implementation Feasibility and Proof-of-Concept Study to Assess Incorporating the NIDA CTN Common Data Elements (CDEs) Into the Electronic Health Record (EHR) in Large Primary Care Settings ("CDE-EHR-PC" Study), Phase 3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS 1. To program the NIDA CTN CDEs, the NIDA/ASAM electronic Clinical Quality Measure (eCQM), and a lean decision support module into Epic. 2. To study the process of implementation of screening and referral using Epic-driven CDEs and CDS in three primary care clinics / practices, including defining potential barriers and facilitators to their adoption. 3. To evaluate the impact of implementation on: - Patient level outcomes (diagnosis, treatment referral); - Medical staff level outcomes (screening and assessment, clinical interventions including counseling and treatment referral); and - Systems level outcomes (logistics and costs of introducing the CDEs, feasibility).</detailed_description>
