	<brief_title>Treatment of Nasal Staphylococcus Aureus Colonization in Patients With HHT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a vascular dysplasia characterized by the development of mucocutaneous telangiectasia and arteriovenous malformations in organs such as brain, lung, liver and tube digestivo. Is considered a rare disease, although It means that there is a substantial underdiagnosis. The overall prevalence is 1/5000. Approximately 60% of the general population hosts strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) intermittently and are called intermittent carriers, 20% represent persistent carriers harboring the same strain of S. aureus and 20% of the population are never carriers. On this concept, one might think that HHT patients in whom there is an active and pathological vascular remodeling that causes bleeding, and inflammation is a known activator of abnormal angiogenesis; reducing an inflammatory factor as microbial through the eradication of nasal S. aureus could be useful to reduce bleeding in this population, directly impacting on quality of life.</detailed_description>
