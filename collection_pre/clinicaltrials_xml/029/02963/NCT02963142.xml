	<brief_summary>Severe community acquired pneumonia is common and associated with high mortality. Conventional microbiological diagnostics identify pathogens in approximately half of cases, which is inadequate for both clinical and epidemiological purposes. This study applies next-generation sequencing based metagenomic techniques to patients with extremely severe community acquired pneumonia, to investigate the microbiome of severe community acquired pneumonia and evaluate metagenomic approaches as diagnostic tools.</brief_summary>
