	<brief_title>MS Versus NICE for Colorectal Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE: Current practice requires histopathological assessment to confirm diagnosis for colorectal lesions detected at colonoscopy. Advances in endoscopic imaging contribute for real-time diagnosis which, apart from being cost and time-saving, also guides decision-making and reduces risks. Our study aimed to compare a recently-developed endoscopic classification with an established one. DESIGN: The modified Sano's classification (MS) was compared to the Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) International Colorectal Endoscopic classification (NICE) in a randomised trial between 2013 and 2015. An experimented endoscopist classified each polyp, what was compared to histopathology.</detailed_description>
