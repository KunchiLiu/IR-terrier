	<brief_summary>PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence and clinical correlation of the germline BRCA 1/2 mutation in Korean patients with high grade(HG) serous and/or endometrioid epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a nationwide case-control study on EOC conducted in Korea between 2010 and 2015, 298 Korean women with HG serous and/or endometrioid EOC were tested for gBRCA 1/2 mutation, regardless of the family history. Mutation screening was performed using the Ion AmpliSeq BRCA 1/2 Panel (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Ion PGM platform according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clinical characteristics including survival outcome was assessed in gBRCAm carriers.</brief_summary>
