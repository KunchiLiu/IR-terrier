	<brief_summary>We can speculate that the best responders to tocilizumab should have multiple related elements (Treg CD39, adenosine, IL-35) successfully induced and expressed in order to play its beneficial role. The study of these elements and its pathways could help identify the best responders to tocilizumab treatment.</brief_summary>
