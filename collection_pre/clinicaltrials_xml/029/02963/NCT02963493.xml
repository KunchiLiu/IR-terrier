	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate melflufen in combination with dexamethasone in the treatment of relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in adult patients with disease refractory to pomalidomide and/or daratumumab. All patients in the study will be treated with melflufen on Day 1 and dexamethasone on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Melflufen in Combination With Dexamethasone in Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Melflufen is designed for targeted delivery of alkylating moieties to tumor cells. In contrast to other alkylating agents that are hydrophilic, the lipophilicity of melflufen leads to rapid and extensive distribution into tissues and cells. Inside cells, melflufen may directly bind DNA or is readily metabolized by intracellular peptidases into the well-known antitumor compound melphalan, or by esterases into des-ethylmelflufen, which also has alkylating properties. Due to the high activity of peptidases and esterases in human tumor cells, the formation of melflufen's metabolites is rapid in these cells with subsequent inflow of more melflufen. Since des-ethylmelflufen and melphalan are relatively hydrophilic, there is a possibility for intracellular trapping of these alkylators.</detailed_description>
