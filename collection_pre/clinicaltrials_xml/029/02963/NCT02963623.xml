	<brief_title>Fibtem Predicts Postoperative Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study retrospectively evaluate patients who underwent total knee replacement arthroplasty. Laboratory coagulation parameters, including FIBTEM, before anesthesia induction and after admission to the post-anesthetic care unit and amounts of postoperative hemorrhage and transfusion were reviewed. A correlation coefficient of ρ = 0.3 was calculated from a pilot study. We need at least 84 subjects with an α value of 0.05 and a power of 0.8.</detailed_description>
