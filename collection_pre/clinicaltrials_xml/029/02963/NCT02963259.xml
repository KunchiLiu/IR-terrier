	<brief_summary>This post-marketing evaluation has been designed to consistently investigate the subject's preference when switching from a Medtronic® constant voltage or constant current device to a St Jude Medical Infinity™ or St Jude Medical BrioTM constant current system. As electrodes will not be re-positioned, differences in subject's preference are to be explained by the difference in shape of the delivered pulse or waveform between the two systems.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject signed the approved Informed Consent; Subject is ≥18 and ≤ 74 years of age; Subject is bilaterally treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) using a constant voltage device (i.e. Soletra™, Itrel™, Kinetra™, ActivaPC™ or ActivaRC™ IPG) and in the Investigator's opinion, is responding satisfactory to CV stimulation; In the physician's opinion the subject is a suitable candidate for an IPG replacement with different stimulation paradigm; Subject needs and/or requests an IPG replacement within 12 months after consent and the current IPG has at least 2.6 V output left (i.e. approx. 30% of full battery capacity) at the time of subject enrollment; PD symptom onset is no longer than 20 years; Subject has a Hoehn &amp; Yahr score &lt;IV (on stim); Subject with a normal cognitive function (MMSE ≥ 25); Subject is fluent speaker (as judged by the investigator) of the language spoken in the country where the investigational site is located. IPG battery has less than 30% battery life at the time of consent; Need to replace or reposition the leads or extensions during the IPG replacement procedure; Subject had &gt;10 recurrent falls experienced in the 3 months prior to consent; Subject is unwilling to change to either a St Jude Medical InfinityTM or a St Jude Medical BrioTM DBS system for the IPG replacement; Subject is unable to attend the study visits.</criteria>
