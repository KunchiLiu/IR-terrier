	<brief_summary>Single-center, prospective, descriptive and biomedical research with controls, without health product. Depression is the second risk factor for stroke as tobacco smoking following hypertension. Peripheral abnormalities in serotonin parameters were described in depression and tobacco smoking. The investigators hypothesized dysregulations in pathways of serotonin (5-HT), which has notably complex vasomotor effects and of kynurenine which could have cognitive dysfunction effects. The aim of this study is to evaluate simultaneously the involvement of serotonin and kynurenine pathways parameters in patients suffering from a cerebral infarction shortly after the onset (less than 4 hours and a half), within a 2 days follow-up (Day 1 and Day 2) and 3 months after the cerebral infarction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TSK (Tryptophan - Serotonin - Kynurenine) Biomarkers Assessment in Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tryptophan (TRP), an essential aminoacid, is metabolized in the serotonin (5-HT) or in the kynurenine (KYN) pathway. Serotonin is catabolized to 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindole amino acid) by monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). The TRP to KYN transformation is regulated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). The primary objective was the measurements of serotonin and kynurenine pathways parameters which were performed in blood and urine samples using different HPLC techniques and of serotonin transporters and receptors which were determined in blood platelets. The results in patients were compared to those measured in controls matched for age, gender, tobacco consumption and season of inclusion. The secondary objective was to evaluate the potential relationships between these 5-HT and Kyn pathways biomarkers concentrations, MAOA and IDO enzymatic activations and clinical outcome and criteria.</detailed_description>
