Or, in the case of patients under the age of 18 (or other age as defined by regional law or regulation), provide written assent (if required) and have written informed consent, signed by a legally authorized representative, after the nature of the program has been explained, and prior to any program assessments.

Pregnancy any time during the program; a female patient judged by the physician to be of childbearing potential will be tested for pregnancy. A CLN2 combined motor/language score of less than 1 (apply to US only) Asymptomatic (symptomatic is defined as having any evidence of neurological involvement attributed to CLN2 disease irrespective of the CLN2 score, including clinical signs and symptoms of disease such as seizures, ataxia, language delay or other developmental delays) (apply to US only)</criteria>
