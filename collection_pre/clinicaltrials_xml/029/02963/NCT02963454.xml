	<brief_title>Effects of Levosimendan on Cellular Metabolic Alterations in Patients With Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was designed as a prospective, double-blind, controlled, clinical trial and performed in a multidisciplinary intensive care unit. After achieving normovolemia and a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg, 20 septic shock patients were randomized to receive either levosimendan 0.2 μg/kg/min, or dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min. Interstitial tissue concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, glucose and glycerol were obtained by using muscle microdialysis. All measurements, including data from right heart catheterization were obtained at baseline and every 6 hours for the following 72 hours after randomization.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>patients who fulfilled the criteria of septic shock that required norepinephrine (NE) to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65 mm Hg despite appropriate volume resuscitation (pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure [PAOP] = 12 to 18 mm Hg and central venous pressure [CVP] = 8 to 12 mm Hg) pregnancy, uncontrolled hemorrhage, terminal heart failure, significant valvular heart disease, documented or suspected acute coronary syndrome, and a limitation on the use of inotropes: left ventricle outflow obstruction, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve.</criteria>
