	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy on pulmonary arterial (PA) pressures in acute decompensated heart failure (HF) patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

	<brief_title>Auto-PAP for Pulmonary Hypertension Treatment in Decompensated HF Patients With Sleep Apnea.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ASAP-HF study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, two-center, study with a parallel group design, with subjects randomized to either control (no APAP) or active treatment (APAP) in a 1:1 ratio. Group A (active): standard medical therapy plus treatment with continuous APAP for 48hrs, or Group B (control): standard medical therapy only. Many people who have heart failure (HF) also have sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which is breathing irregularities during sleep. These irregularities may interrupt the sleep as well as increase the rate of progression of Heart Failure. The ASAP-HF study is being done to see if certain clinical outcomes are improved in acute decompensated heart failure (HF) patients with SDB by using a non-invasive breathing device continuously for a short period of time (48 hours) while patient is still in the hospital. The device is called AirSense™ 10 AutoSet (AutoSet). It consists of an air flow generator, air tubing, an air humidifier, and a mask. As the patient breathe through the mask, the AutoSet monitors breathing. The primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy on pulmonary arterial (PA) pressures in acute decompensated heart failure (HF) patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study will also assess changes in functional parameters, biomarkers, and echocardiographic parameters . This device is not currently used to diagnose sleep apnea and its utility is not well studied. This study will establish the utility of the device in diagnosing sleep apnea.</detailed_description>
