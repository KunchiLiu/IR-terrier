	<brief_summary>This proposal will test the hypothesis that EARLY application of a novel early rehabilitation therapy in critically ill patients will improve functional outcomes, and change the functional trajectory of this population. A pilot study of early mobilization with a cycle ergometer will be performed and translate into humans the pre-clinical mechanisms that may mediate the effects of early mobility.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Promoting Critical Illness Recovery in the Elderly-- Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized to intervention or control groups. Patients will receive therapies according to their group assignment until hospital discharge or day 28, whichever comes first. The intervention group will receive in-bed cycle ergometry within 48 hours of randomization if safety criteria are met. In-bed cycle ergometry has been shown to be safe and feasible in the critically ill and is approved for use in this population. Subjects enrolled in the intervention arm will be screened at least 5 days per week to evaluate if they meet pre-defined safety criteria based on other studies of early mobilization and cycling in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Patients will be positioned in the semi-recumbent position for cycling as per ICU guidelines. The cycler will provide 3 different possible modes of cycling—passive, active-assisted, and active. The investigators will start with passive cycling and the patient may progress to active-assisted and active cycling. The goal duration of cycling will be 30 minutes. Subjects will receive in-bed cycling at least 5 times per week for the duration of the ICU stay or until day 14, whichever comes first. During cycling and therapy sessions, the physical therapist will also complete a case report form noting vital signs, level of mobilization, and other safety measures. In addition to cycling, the intervention arm will receive early physical therapy (PT). This physical therapy will be performed according to a protocol of additional ICU and hospital-administered rehabilitation strategies that were previously developed. Patients will receive 30 minutes of Physical Therapy (PT) at least 5 times per week when they are conscious. If unconscious, subjects will only receive passive range of motion (PROM) for 10 repetitions per body part daily. Once conscious, subjects will progress through the different levels of PT with an emphasis on ambulation. Physical therapy for the intervention arm patients will continue while hospitalized through day 28. Outpatient therapy will be provided at the discretion of the patient's treating physicians. The control group will receive usual care physical therapy as ordered by the treating team both in the ICU and on the floor through hospital discharge. These subjects will also receive therapy as outpatients only as ordered by their physicians.</detailed_description>
