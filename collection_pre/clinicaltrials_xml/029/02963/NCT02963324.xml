	<brief_title>Physiologically-based Pharmacokinetic Modeling of Ivermectin in Healthy Human Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ivermectin (IVM) is a broad spectrum antiparasitic drug. Recent research indicates that IVM could potentially be used in malaria vector control. The present study assesses the pharmacokinetic profile of IVM in healthy human volunteers and aims to create a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. This model will be used to characterize enterohepatic circulation, serve as a basis for drug-drug and drug-disease-state interaction studies, and simulations of IVM disposition in different populations, with special regard given to adolescents and children. With this, safety in individual administrations can be increased, and mass drug administration programs, e.g. oral IVM as malaria vector control, be simulated and planned to maximize the share of a population that can be included. Capillary blood concentration profiles will also be determined to assess the amount of IVM delivered to mosquitos in malaria vector control programs. Furthermore, this study will validate dried blood spot analytics of IVM which will allow easier procurement of pharmacokinetics (PK) data in the field.</detailed_description>
