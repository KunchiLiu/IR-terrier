	<brief_title>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder: A Treatment Development and Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to pilot the CBT-AR treatment in youth with ARFID to determine treatment acceptability and efficacy.This includes evaluating the efficacy and acceptability of CBT-AR in reducing primary ARFID symptoms from pre- to post-treatment, and to assess whether improvement in individual symptoms is related to the timing of relevant interventions. The investigators hypothesize that from pre-treatment to post-treatment, subjects with ARFID will increase percentage of calories coming from fruits, vegetables, and protein; and decrease severity of self-reported ARFID symptoms, decrease self-reported anxiety and depression, and improve psychosocial functioning. The investigators further hypothesize that overall, subjects with ARFID will have reduced phobic avoidance, sensory sensitivity, and/or low appetite in comparison to their pre-treatment symptoms.</detailed_description>
