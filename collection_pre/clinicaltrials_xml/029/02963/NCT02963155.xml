	<brief_title>Study of Natural Killer Cells in Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Relationship With Survival and Response Time to Castration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective is to validate prospectively the results of a retrospective study showing a correlation between the level of NKp30 and NKp46 receptor-activators expression on the surface of NK cells and 1) the survival time, 2) the response time to castration in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Prospective monocenter, open-label study. During a visit in the frame of management of the disease, a single blood sample will be collected. Patients will then have a standard care follow-up for a period of 5 years. Follow up data (death, progression) will be collected every 6 months.</detailed_description>
