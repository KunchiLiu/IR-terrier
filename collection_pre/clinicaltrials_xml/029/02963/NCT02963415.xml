	<detailed_description>The proposed project will implement and test a unique Virtual Reality Cognitive Training (VRCT) combined with concurrent cycling on a recumbent stationary cycle, also known as exergame that seamlessly integrates specific cognitive tasks into a virtual environment and is synchronized with cycling to promote cognition. Cycling through an interesting virtual environment will motivate and engage the older adult to participate in the exercise, and VRCT could augment cycling's effects on cognition. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the exergame intervention on cognition through two phases. In Phase I, a prototype of the VRCT exergame will be developed, followed by a feasibility testing using a single-group mixed methods design. In Phase II a more fully-featured version of the VRCT exergame will be developed followed by a an RCT which will randomize subjects on a 2:1:1 allocation ratio to 3 parallel groups (exergame:cycling only:attention control). Mixed methods will be used to assess outcomes in both phases.</detailed_description>
