	<brief_title>Anovaginal Distance, Interobserver Agreement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims: This study describes perineal ultrasound measurement of the AVD in regard to ease of learning and interobserver agreement, in order to establish if the method is reliable to use in further research about objective postpartum description of perineal tears. Methods: To educate the examiners, the method was shown and described by an experienced examiner. The examiners then measured the anovaginal distance in one woman repeatedly with until similar results (+/- 5 mm ) were achieved. The woman was in the lithotomy position and a vaginal ultrasound probe was used. The AVD in another 40 women was then measured and documented by two examiners, right after the other, who were blinded to the other´s results. The distance was measured between the mucosal margin of the internal anal sphincter and the vaginal probe. Interobserver agreement was calculated using Kappa-score.</detailed_description>
