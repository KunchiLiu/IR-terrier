	<brief_title>Rezum I Pilot Study for BPH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, non-randomized clinical trial of subjects with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The objective of the study are to 1) determine the safety and efficacy of the BPH Rezum System and assess its effect on urinary symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and 2) further document the safety and post-operative effects of the Rezum System in the treatment of obstructive BPH.</detailed_description>
