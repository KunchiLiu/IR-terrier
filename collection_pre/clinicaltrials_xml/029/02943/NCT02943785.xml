	<brief_summary>When the upper chambers of a person's heart receive irregular electrical signals it causes abnormal rhythm in the heart beat. This is called atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation increases the chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Some patients also get new heart valves using a catheter. Often doctors give patients a medicine called a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), because it is considered the standard care. This study will see how edoxaban compares to VKA in patients who got a new heart valve by using a catheter. The study will compare the two drugs for up to three years after heart valve replacement, looking at the drug's overall side effects (called adverse events) and major bleeding.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Use of Edoxaban in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and indication to chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) Objective: - To assess the effect of Edoxaban versus vitamin K antagonist (VKA) on net adverse clinical events (NACE), i.e., the composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, systemic thromboembolism (SEE), valve thrombosis, and major bleeding (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [ISTH] definition). - To assess the effect of Edoxaban versus VKA on major bleeding (ISTH definition).</detailed_description>
