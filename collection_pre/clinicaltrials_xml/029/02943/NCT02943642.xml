	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effectiveness — as judged by complete response — of a single four-day treatment with the fusion protein A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) compared to oral Zolinza (Vorinostat), in a randomized 2-arm trial after a maximum of 12 months of treatment. Patient eligibility is stage IB/IIB mycosis fungoides with mSWAT &lt; 50 who have never had lymphoid disease or a prior bone marrow / HSCT transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) Fusion Protein in Subjects With Mycosis Fungoides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: This study objective is to document the incidence of complete responses compared to oral vorinostat, in a randomized 2-arm trial after a maximum of 12 months of treatment for subjects with stage IB/IIB mycosis fungoides with mSWAT &lt; 50 who have never had lymphoid disease or a prior bone marrow / HSCT transplant. Secondary Objective: To further explore the toxicity profile of A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) fusion protein for subjects with mycosis fungoides who have been selected to be free from preexisting cardiac disease and never treated with Campath. Number of Subjects: Lead-in Dosing: 12 / Randomized: 162 Patients will receive full supportive care during the course of the study. Participation in the study will require IV infusions of the research agent 2 times a day for four days (protocol FDA outpatient approved), as well as frequent outpatient blood draws for the first 30 days. Patients with partial or complete remissions at their 1 month follow up visit will have another follow-up visit on day 60, then every three months for 1 year, followed by annual visits to assess duration of the response.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must have signed the current IRB approved informed consent prior to registration (see Informed Consent). Mycosis fungoides, confirmed by biopsy or flow cytometry, without large cell transformation. Relapse or progression after 2 or more systemic therapies. Note: Total electron beam therapy can be counted as a systemic therapy. Disease stage as follows: Stage IB with no lymph node involvement including lymphadenopathy with mSWAT &lt;50; Stage IIB with no lymph node involvement including lymphadenopathy with mSWAT &lt;50. Age 18 years. Subjects must have a performance status of &lt; 2 on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale (see Appendix A). Subjects must have normal lung function evaluated by pulse oximetry with O2 saturation values between 95100%. Subjects must have fully recovered from toxicity of prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Subjects must have: bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, transaminases &lt; 2.5 X ULN, albumin &gt; 3 gm/dL, creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL. Subjects who have had albumin &lt; 3 gm/dL boosted by an albumin infusion must be observed to maintain albumin at &gt; 3gm dL for 14 days without an additional infusion. Subjects must have a normal echocardiogram (EF &gt; 50% normal) without any evidence of cardiac chamber hypertrophy, dilatation or hypokinesis. Females and males must be willing to use an approved form of birth control while on this study and for 2 weeks after completion. Subjects must have a pretreatment antiDT titer of 20 μg/ml or less. Subjects with titers between 21 and 35 μg/ml will have an additional antiDT neutralization test using subject's serum and AdmDT390bisFv(UCHT1). If neutralization is not found these titers will be considered acceptable. Failure to meet any of the criteria. Inability to give informed consent because of psychiatric problems, or complicated medical problems. Allergic to diphtheria toxin a component of the study drug AdmDT390bisFv(UCHT1). Serious concurrent medical problems, uncontrolled infections, or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), hepatic cirrhosis, or chronic kidney disease. CNS leukemia. Preexisting cardiovascular disease. The only exception being well controlled essential hypertension with a sitting blood pressure (B.P.) of &lt;160 systolic and &lt;90 diastolic without any evidence of structural heart disease or one episode of myocardial infarction &gt; 8 months ago. Subjects receiving a betablocker for hypertension should be converted to another antihypertensive drug class 23 weeks before receiving the study drug to prevent a drugdrug interaction reactive tachycardia. Angiotensin inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers are all acceptable. A past history of any of the following conditions is considered as exclusions to study participation: Congestive heart failure, Atrial fibrillation, Pulmonary hypertension, Anticoagulant drug therapy, Thromboembolic events, Cardiomyopathy or a myocardial infarction within the past 8 months. The PI and the Clinical Coordinator will be asked to verify that their referred subjects do not have these exclusionary histories listed in 3.2 and a copy of this verification must be sent to the Sponsor before the Sponsor will approve of enrollment. Referring physicians will not need to sign. Pregnant or nursing women will be excluded from study. History of cirrhosis of the liver based on the ChildPugh score of Class B or C are not eligible to participate. Prior treatment with alemtuzumab (Campath) or similar agents or procedures that depress blood T cell counts to below 50% of the lower limit of normal. Prior history of bone marrow transplant or HSCT is an exclusion. Prior treatment with vorinostat (Prior treatment with vorinostat for leadin dosing arm is acceptable).</criteria>
