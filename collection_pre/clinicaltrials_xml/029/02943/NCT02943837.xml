	<brief_summary>Background: Preoperative pathologic diagnosis of subepithelial tumor (SET) can improve clinical decision making. Although EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) is currently considered the standard method for sampling SET, its diagnostic yield is generally suboptimal. EUS-guided fine needle biopsy (FNB) of SET is safe and feasible with adequate histology obtained. Objective: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA and EUS-FNB.</brief_summary>
