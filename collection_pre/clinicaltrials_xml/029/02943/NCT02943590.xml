	<brief_summary>This research study will test whether atorvastatin, a drug commonly prescribed for reducing cholesterol levels, can protect the heart during chemotherapy with doxorubicin. Atorvastatin is from a family of medications that are commonly called "statins"</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the effectiveness of a drug and determine whether the investigational drug works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied. The chemotherapy drug that the participant have been scheduled to be treated with, Doxorubicin, has been associated with the development of heart failure in some patients. This research study is testing whether Atorvastatin can protect the hearts of patients being treated with Doxorubicin and can reduce cardiac injury and the risk of heart failure. Atorvastatin is not approved by the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) for use to reduce the cardiac injury after Doxorubicin. Atorvastatin is approved by the FDA for lowering cholesterol and for reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke. The heart is a muscle that pumps blood and Atorvastatin may protect the heart by preserving cardiac muscle function. The investigators will test whether atorvastatin protects the heart using a combination of imaging tests on the participants heart, blood tests, and stress testing. The imaging tests will involve an echocardiogram (an echo) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), a type of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.</detailed_description>
