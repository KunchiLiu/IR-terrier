	<brief_summary>Several methods have been used to predict adhesions after abdominal operations. High-resolution ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and scar healing properties were the methods that were evaluated in the English literature for this study. Estimating the likelihood of adhesions and related complications after prior surgery and assessing the severity of adhesion formation after surgery is not easy. Anticipating adhesions is very important to preventing complications by ensuring that the necessary preoperative preparations are in place and/or that appropriate cases are referred to a tertiary center.</brief_summary>
