	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: The interventions follow-up of patients with Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis active moderate-high complexity based on the incorporation of information technologies and communication, to improve monitoring of the presence of inflammatory activity, adherence to treatment and drug toxicity, increase the proportion of inactive patients (clinical remission) at 6 months follow-up and thus improve clinical outcomes and health outcomes (HRQOL, satisfaction) and reduces the consumption of health resources. Goals: - Primary: To assess the effectiveness of intervention Teccu to achieve clinical remission of IBD patients with moderate-high compared to usual care to these patients (G_control) and assisted call with nurses (G_AT) complexity. - Secondary: - To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to improve HRQOL and satisfaction with treatment in patients GTECCU intervention group compared to G_control and G_AT in the 6 months follow up. - To assess the safety of the intervention Teccu judging by adverse events that require a doctor's visit or unscheduled nursing. - Describe the use of health resources (surgeries, hospitalizations, emergency room visits and outpatient visits) by patients of G-Teccu, G_control and G_AT in the 6 months follow up. - Evaluate the effectiveness of intervention in the reduction of a combined endpoint of hospital emergency room visits and unscheduled patients in the intervention group compared to G-Teccu G_control and G_AT within 6 months of follow-up consultations. Description: The proposed intervention is based on the extent of chronic GeCronic program that is currently being developed at the Hospital La Fe de Valencia for comprehensive management of chronic conditions of high complexity using the technology platform NOMHAD. NOMHADchronic is a system designed to allow management services to deploy chronically ill supported by technology. The product consists of different modules that seek to cover all aspects of that management: clinical information on the status of patients according to their respective conditions, support for the coordination of the actors during the care process, logistics management and human resources, integration with accessories and monitoring devices. Of all the modules of the platform, NOMHADcore out as the module which houses all the functionality on clinical and care management of patients.
