	<brief_title>Sleep Therapy for Insomnia and Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first group is the sleep hygiene group. If you are assigned to the sleep hygiene group you have 1 session with a clinician to learn about different things you can do to improve your sleep. The second group is the intensive sleep retraining group. If you are in this group you will spend about 1 day at our sleep lab, starting around your usual bedtime and ending the following day. Over a 20 hour period you will complete a sleep retraining session, which involves an opportunity to fall asleep every 30 minutes; we will wake you after a few minutes if you fall asleep. For both groups, after the treatment session, you will complete questionnaires online and talk with a study clinician who will ask you questions about your mood every two weeks for 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
