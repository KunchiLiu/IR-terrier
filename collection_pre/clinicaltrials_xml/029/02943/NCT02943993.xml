	<brief_summary>According to current guidelines, duration of anticoagulant treatment after a venous thromboembolic event varies from 3 months to indefinite treatment depending on the estimated risks of venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence and bleeding. Current data for edoxaban are limited to a maximum treatment duration of 12 months (Hokusai-VTE; N Engl J Med. 2013; 369:1406-15). Therefore, this study aims to gather further insight into efficacy (i.e. symptomatic recurrent VTE) and safety (i.e. bleeding events, liver adverse events, all-cause mortality and other drug related adverse events) of extended treatment with edoxaban up to 18 months in an unselected patient population in routine clinical practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Edoxaban Treatment in Routine Clinical Practice in Patients With Venous Thromboembolism in Europe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Real-world evidence data in routine clinical practice use of edoxaban up to 18 months will be collected in 2,700 patients, treated by specialized as well as non-specialized physicians in hospitals and office based centres in 11 European countries. Patients from different countries and care settings (primary care and secondary care, different specialties) to ensure representativeness and extended assessment is planned for collection of VTE recurrences for up to 18 months after last data collection point for patients who entered the study early. The enrollment period of patients will be 2 years per country. Documentation of baseline and follow up information at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months (only when available) will be collected. In addition, recurrence of symptomatic VTE and death will be captured retrospectively at time point of Last Patient Out per country. Patients who discontinue permanently edoxaban during the observational period will be followed up according to the same scheme. The results gained in ETNA-VTE-Europe will be compared to data from the PREFER in VTE disease registry. The PREFER registry, was selected as it is similar in bleeding definition, comparable in data collection point schedules, with a robust number of patients (~3,500 patients) enrolled.</detailed_description>
