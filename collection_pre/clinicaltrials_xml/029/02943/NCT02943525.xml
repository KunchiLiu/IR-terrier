	<brief_summary>Vaginal packing is used routinely following vaginal reconstructive surgery, however, no recommendation regarding vaginal packing after laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy exists. Despite little data to support the practice, purported benefits better positioning and fixation of the mesh, improving incorporation of the mesh by its fixation and reduced blood loss. Patients often complain of discomfort associated with the packing or its removal. The aim of this randomized controlled is to compare the subjective impressions of pain and bother in women undergoing laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy treated with and without packing. The investigators also aim to assess differences in postoperative bacteriuria, urine retention and hemoglobin levels on day 5 after the surgery and surgery outcome and complications at one year after the surgery in those with and without packing.</brief_summary>
