	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint is to compare the PFS (progress-free survival ) of etoposide plus carboplatin with paclitaxel combined with carboplatin as first-line treatment for advanced pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. In addition, gene spectrum detection and Mini-PDX are applied for validation of pharmacodynamic. Results of clinical trials and pharmacodynamic test will be analyzed to provide evidence for the precise treatment for LCNEC.</detailed_description>
