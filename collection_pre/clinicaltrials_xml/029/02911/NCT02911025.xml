	<brief_title>Effects of Clobazam on Sleep and Daytime Function in Patients With Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many studies show that patients with epilepsy frequently have disrupted sleep, as well as a high level of daytime sleepiness. This may be due to a sleep disorder, nighttime seizures that lead to disrupted sleep, and other abnormalities. Sleep complaints are widely reported among patients with various epilepsy syndromes. Anti-seizure treatments may affect sleep. Effects vary by type of medication and other health issues. Generally, with improvement of seizure control, the sleep cycle improves and becomes more regular. However, some anti-seizure medications have been associated with insomnia. There have been studies that looked at sleep in relation to some anti-seizure medications. However, there are no currently available published reports on the effect of Clobazam (Onfi) on sleep.</detailed_description>
