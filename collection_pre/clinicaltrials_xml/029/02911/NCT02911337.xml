	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of an intensive, supervised, lifestyle modification program on symptoms and signs of heart failure as well as laboratory and echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function. This will be a 6 month trial in 50 patients with a clinical diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Patients will be enrolled in the Medical University of South Carolina weight management 15 week lifestyle change program which will involve weekly visits that rotate among the clinical specialities (dietary, exercise and behavioral) and scheduled visits with the research Registered Nurse. Each patients baseline data will be used as the control and compared with the same measurements at the 6 month end point.</brief_summary>
