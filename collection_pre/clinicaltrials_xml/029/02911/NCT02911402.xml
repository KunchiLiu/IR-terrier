	<brief_summary>Sea sickness syndrome is present for 80% of persons on board when the boat rotation missions Astrolabe, sometimes there is a risk of very significant dehydration. A special unit specialized in the fundamental study of the vestibular system (inner ear), sensory organ at the base of visual-vestibular conflict inducing this syndrome, also provides medical support for parabolic flights (flight reproducing weightlessness) where this syndrome is strongly present. The goal of the study is to assess the frequency of occurrence of this sea sickness syndrome on the Astrolabe, to understand the triggers (type of boat movements, personality traits, anxiety / stress) without changing habits on board for those on board taking a antinaupathique treatment given by the ship's doctor. This study will be done in collaboration between INSERM U 1075 (France) and the Laboratory of military research VIPER specialized in extreme environments (Belgium). The ultimate goal will be to provide the best recommendations and the best treatment regimen to alleviate as best as possible the symptoms of people on board of the Astrolabe so scientists on board can perform their work.</brief_summary>
