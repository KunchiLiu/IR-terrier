	<brief_summary>There are very few studies on emotion management in chronically ill patients. They usually include small sample size (less than 30 persons) and are not randomized controlled trials. However, emotion management is an essential coping skill in mental well-being and quality of life and is the subject of numerous studies in psychology.The investigators hypothesized that a creative and physical activities combination in chronically ill will promote the strengthening of emotion management skill. The investigators will conduct an innovating study combining quantitative and qualitative variables in a randomized controlled trial to confirm our hypothesis.</brief_summary>
