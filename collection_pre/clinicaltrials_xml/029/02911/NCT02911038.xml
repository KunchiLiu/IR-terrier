	<brief_summary>The aim of this observational study is: producing complete dental prosthesis with the aid of CAD-CAM (Computer aided design &amp; manufacturing) - 3D printing (Stereolithography) technology - using as printable material Poli(methylmetacrylate) - PMMA - with Nano TiO2 nanoparticles composite completely characterized.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereolithographic Technique for Dentures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to improve complete dentures fabrications an experimental model for optimizing the composite material and the execution technique for the 3D printed dental prosthesis was developed. - A new polymer - nano-TiO2 composite system for dentures printing was obtained by adding 0,4-1%TiO2 nanoparticle in the commercially available E-Dent 100 (EnvisionTEC, Germany). - The new polymer was completely characterized and biocompatibility tests were perform. - A stereolithography technique was set-up for CAD-CAM complete dentures manufacturing. - 3D printed dental prosthesis will be inserted to a number of 35 complete edentulous patients from a target group; - Clinical follow-up at 6, 12 and 18 months and quality assessment of the dentures will be recorded in a specific chart. - A statistical evaluation of data recorded during the entire follow-up period will be performed.</detailed_description>
