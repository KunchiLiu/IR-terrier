	<brief_summary>Cesarean section (CS) is a procedure with prolonged hospital stay compared to the routine for normal vaginal delivery in multiparas. The difference is caused mainly by postoperative pain but improvements in management of pain may change this situation and make early discharge possible. However, several aspects need to be considered. The aim of this project is to evaluate fast-track discharge for multiparas after elective CS concerning neonatal and maternal complications as well as the parents' sense of security and well-being. The study is a randomized controlled trial including 142 women allocated to either discharge after 24-28 hours or standard discharge after at least 48 hours after elective CS. This study will be among the first evaluating fast-track discharge after CS in a European context. If a positive outcome is achieved, we expect that fast-track discharge can be implemented with improved quality and reduced costs in postnatal care following elective CS.</brief_summary>
