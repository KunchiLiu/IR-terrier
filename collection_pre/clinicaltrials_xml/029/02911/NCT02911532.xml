	<brief_title>Tissue Engineering Conjunctiva for the Treatment of Pterygium and Atretoblepharia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The most important area for research on the pterygium are the recurrence occurred after operation. Now the best way to prevent the recurrence is autologous conjunctival stem cell transplantation, but this way of operation can cause lack of conjunctiva and conjunctival scar, even may effect the later glaucoma surgery. For the atretoblepharia patients, amniotic membrane transplantation and autologous oral mucosa transplantation can not make effect to alleviate it. In this pilot project, investigators would like to study the effect of tissue engineering conjunctiva transplantation in the treatment of pterygium and tissue engineering conjunctiva transplantation combined with conjunctiva sac formation for the treatment of atretoblepharia. This will allow us to determine if useful data can be obtained, and if so, lead to further studies in various conjunctiva loss caused by trauma, infections, and so on.</detailed_description>
