	<brief_summary>The level of suction on post-operative chest tubes after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy for lung cancer has previously shown to affect duration of drainage. These results, however, are based on traditional drainage systems with water seal and need to be confirmed using digital drainage systems. Hypothesis: Suction of -2 cmH2O is equal to or superior compared with standard suction of -10 cmH2O when looking at chest tube duration and complications.</brief_summary>
