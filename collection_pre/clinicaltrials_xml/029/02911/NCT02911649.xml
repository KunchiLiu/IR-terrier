	<brief_summary>Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) can be experienced by individuals with Prostate Cancer (PC), which can have profound effects on their well-being. Although physical activity has been shown to improve CRF, the recommended levels are generally not met. Step count and distance traveled information can help individuals to increase their physical activity. Wearable technology (WEAR) provides the user with feedback of their physical activity which can motivate behaviour change. Similarly, education workshops (EDU) on the effects of sedentary behaviour and physical activity may also reduce sedentary behaviour. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effects of WEAR and EDU on sedentary behaviour and CRF, and to explore the feasibility of WEAR in this population. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned into WEAR, EDU, WEAR+EDU, or control over a three-month intervention. Assessments at baseline, post-intervention and a 3-month follow up will evaluate CRF, quality of life and level of sedentary behaviour, and use of WEAR devices. The results from this study will provide evidence-based knowledge on the impact of WEAR and EDU on sedentary behaviour and CRF, and an understanding on the use of technology within the PC population. These results can shape the development of programming for CRF and the use of scale-able technology-based interventions/approaches in this population.</brief_summary>
