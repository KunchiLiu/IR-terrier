	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease (PD) is typically associated with cognitive and movement related functional disabilities. One commonly described cognitive complaint is the ability to do several things simultaneously, defined as dual or multiple tasking. The Ronnie Gardiner Method (RGM) is a rhythm and music based rehabilitation intervention that includes components that will train this ability specifically in addition to postural control, motor learning, movement ability and general cognitive function. The aim with the present randomized controlled single-blinded trial is to evaluate the RGM with main focus on dual-task performance, compared to a control group, in individuals with PD. The control group will continue with everyday activities, including ordinary exercise activities, with no additional activity. Both groups will be evaluated pre-, post-, and after 3 months post intervention. Following outcome measures will be analyzed: 1. dual task performance (motor-motor, and motor-cognitive) 2. level of physical activity, motor function and balance 3. cognitive function including memory and spatial function 4. health-related quality of life, fear of falling, and freezing of gait 5. qualitative interviews from focus group discussions</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with Parkinson's disease at the neurological department of University Hospital of Link√∂ping are included and randomized to either the rhythm and music based rehabilitation method Ronnie Gardiner Method or to a control group with no other activity other than everyday activities including habitual exercise. Timed Up and Go (TUG) cognitive and TUG manual will be used to evaluate dual-task performance. The intervention will take place twice weekly for twelve weeks in a neurological rehabilitation facility, and will be led by a highly skilled physiotherapist with ten years of practice from the Ronnie Gardiner Method.</detailed_description>
