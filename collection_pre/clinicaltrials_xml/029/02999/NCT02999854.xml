	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare safety and efficacy of a haploidentical T-cell depleted HSCT and adjunctive treatment with ATIR101 versus a haploidentical T cell replete HSCT with post-transplant administration of high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in patients with a hematologic malignancy. An additional objective of the study is to compare the effect of the two treatments on quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of ATIR101 as Adjunctive Treatment to Blood Stem Cell Transplantation From a Haploidentical Family Donor Compared to Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide in Patients With Blood Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study CR-AIR-009 is a Phase III randomized controlled multicenter open-label study comparing two parallel groups. After signing informed consent, a total of 195 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either a T-cell depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; CD34 selection) from a related, haploidentical donor, followed by ATIR101 infusion, or a T-cell replete HSCT, followed by a high dose of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy). Randomization will use minimization to balance treatment groups with respect to underlying disease (AML, ALL, or MDS), Disease Risk Index (DRI; intermediate risk, high risk, or very high risk) and center. A stochastic treatment allocation procedure will be used so that the treatment assignment is random for all patients entered in the study. Patients randomized in the ATIR101 group will receive a single ATIR101 dose of 2×10E6 viable T-cells/kg between 28 and 32 days after the HSCT. Patients randomized in the PTCy group will receive cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/day at 3 and 4/5 days after the HSCT. All patients will be followed up for 24 months post HSCT.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Any of the following hematologic malignancies: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first cytomorphological remission with Disease Risk Index (DRI) intermediate or above, or in second or higher cytomorphological remission Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or higher remission Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS): transfusiondependent (requiring at least one transfusion per month), or intermediate or higher Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSSR) risk group Clinical justification of allogeneic stem cell transplantation where a suitable HLA matched sibling or unrelated donor is unavailable in a timely manner. An unrelated donor search is not required for a patient to be eligible if the clinical situation dictates an urgent transplantation. Clinical urgency is defined as 68 weeks from referral to transplant center or low likelihood of finding a matched unrelated donor Availability of a related haploidentical donor with ≥ 4/8 but &lt; 8/8, or ≥ 5/10 but &lt; 10/10 matches at the HLAA, B, C, DRB1, and/or DQB1 loci, as determined by high resolution human leukocyte antigen (HLA)typing Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 70% Male or female, age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 70 years. Patients aged ≥ 65 years must have a Sorror score ≤ 3 Availability of a donor aged ≥ 16 years and ≤ 75 years who is eligible according to local requirements and regulations For females of childbearing potential who are sexually active and males who have sexual contact with a female of childbearing potential: use of reliable methods of contraception during study participation Given written informed consent (patient and donor) Availability of a suitable fully matched related or unrelated donor in a donor search Prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &lt; 50% predicted Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50% (evaluated by echocardiogram or MUGA) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2.5 × upper limit of normal (CTCAE grade 2) Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × upper limit of normal (CTCAE grade 2) Creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min (calculated or measured) Positive pregnancy test or breastfeeding of patient or donor (women of childbearing age only) Estimated probability of surviving less than 3 months Known allergy to any of the components of ATIR101 (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide) Known hypersensitivity to cyclophosphamide or any of its metabolites Known presence of HLA antibodies against the nonshared donor haplotype Positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test Positive CMV test of the patient and negative cytomegalovirus (CMV) test of the donor Positive viral test of the donor for HIV1, HIV2, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Treponema pallidum, human Tlymphotropic virus (HTLV) 1 (if tested), HTLV2 (if tested), West Nile virus (WNV; if tested), or Zika virus (if tested) Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the patient or donor ineligible for the study</criteria>
