	<brief_title>Interventions To Help Asthma Clinical Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis is to conduct a pilot test to estimate the effect of the SmartInhaler device in improving daily asthma controller medication adherence rates in children with monolingual Spanish- speaking guardians who have LEP during a six-week intervention period when compared to baseline medication adherence rates in a preceding six-week run-in period. The secondary hypothesis is to determine whether the patient reminder system can improve asthma symptom control during the same six-week intervention period. The third hypothesis is to assess if there are specific, patient behavior characteristics which are associated with the success of a novel asthma medication reminder system.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. We will recruit 30 children ages 5 to 17 years with a diagnosis of persistent asthma who require a daily inhaled corticosteroid metered dose inhaler and whose guardian is the person responsible for administering their daily asthma medication. 2. We wil recruit only patients who have received or receive care at San Francisco General Hospital's 6M Children's Health Center. 3. We will recruit patients whose daily inhaled corticosteroid are metered dose inhalers (MDI) of either Flovent (fluticasone propionate) HFA (Hydrofluoroalkane) or Qvar (beclamethasone dipropionate) HFA. 4. We will also recruit only patients whose guardian responsible for administering their daily asthma medication has Limited English Proficiency (LEP) and whose primary language is Spanish. 1. We will exclude patients whose guardian responsible for administering their daily asthma medication does not have a Bluetooth enabled cell phone capable of receiving text messages. 2. We will exclude patients whose guardian responsible for administering their daily asthma medication does not have an available reliable power outlet where they can recharge the battery of their SmartInhaler. 3. We will exclude patients whose guardian responsible for administering their daily asthma edication is unable to demonstrate correct medication technique based on standard evaluation (Press, 2011) after completion of a standard teaching protocol. 5. We will exclude patients with chronic lung disease. 6. We will exclude patients who do not have an operating system of iOS or Android on their cell phone and who have no data plan with their cellular phone plan. 7. We will exclude patients whose asthma medication regimen is being managed by an asthma subspecialist or health provider outside of the 6M Children's Health Center at San Francisco General Hospital. 8. We will exclude patients who are using an inhaled long acting betaagonist (LABA) as part of their asthma management plan.</criteria>
