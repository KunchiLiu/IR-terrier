	<brief_summary>This multicenter, non-randomized, Phase II, single agent study will assess the efficacy, and safety of trastuzumab emtansine in participants with HER2-positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC]3+ in greater than or equal to [&gt;/=] 30 percent [%] of tumor cells) locally advanced or metastatic UBC or metastatic pancreas/cholangio cancer. Participants must have received at least one prior (for bladder cancer platinum-based) treatment for inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic tumor. Participants will receive intravenous (IV) infusion (infusion duration=90 minutes [mins]) of trastuzumab emtansine until unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, disease progression (PD), or death, whichever occurs first.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically centrally confirmed HER2positive (IHC3+ in &gt;/=30% of tumor cells): locally advanced, metastatic (not treatable with curative intent) UBC or pancreas/cholangio cancer There must be no standard treatment options available for participants with the above HER2 overexpressing tumors and they must have undergone at least one prior platinumbased treatment for inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic tumor. (Note: for pancreas/cholangio cancer, prior treatments are NOT required to be platinumbased) Participant's lesion should be measurable according to RECIST V1.1 on diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Target lesion(s) should not have been previously irradiated At least one formalinfixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) biopsy of the primary tumor and/or from a metastatic site is required Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 01 No significant cardiac history and a current left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;/=50 percent (%) Adequate organ function Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks Participants with previous exposure to HER2targeted therapies in any setting Participants showing histologically confirmed focal HER2expression, i.e., less than (&lt;) 30% of positively stained tumor cells Participants with bone only metastases are not eligible Participants with brain metastasis as the sole site of metastatic disease and/or are symptomatic or require therapy to control symptoms Current uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt;150 millimeters of mercury [mmHg] and/or diastolic &gt;100 mmHg) Current unstable angina pectoris History of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) of any New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria or ventricular arrhythmia that requires treatment History of myocardial infarction within the last 6 months Peripheral neuropathy, Grade &gt;/=3 Current dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy, or other diseases that require continuous oxygen therapy Current severe, uncontrolled systemic disease History of other malignancy within the last 5 years Concurrent, serious, uncontrolled infections or current known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C Known prior severe hypersensitivity to trastuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine or the excipients of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) Clinically significant bleeding within 30 days before enrollment Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to randomization or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of study treatment Concurrent participation in any other therapeutic clinical trial</criteria>
