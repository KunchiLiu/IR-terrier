	<brief_title>Effects of a Pre-Workout Dietary Supplement on Training Adaptations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A number of nutritional strategies have been developed to optimize nutrient delivery prior to exercise. This includes providing carbohydrate and a number of ergogenic nutrients prior to, during and/or following exercise. As a result, a number of pre-workout supplements have been developed to increase energy availability, promote vasodilation and/or positively affect exercise capacity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of ingesting a pre-workout dietary supplement during resistance training on training adaptations.</detailed_description>
