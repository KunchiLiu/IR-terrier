	<brief_title>Lithium for Fracture Treatment: a Double Blind Randomized Control Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the success of traditional treatments for broken bones (surgery, immobilization, or both) 10% of fractures do not heal or take longer than normal to heal. This can have a significant effect on a patient's function and productivity, as well as on healthcare expenditures. Very few advances in fracture healing have been made, despite the need for new approaches to fracture treatment. This study proposes a simple, economical, and non-invasive approach to complement traditional fracture treatment that could decrease healing time and reduce the incidence of delayed healing. The investigators think that this can improve health outcomes for patients and reduce health care costs for the healthcare system in general. The goal is to see if a low-dose of Lithium treatment can have a positive effect on fracture healing and can reduce pain and improve function in patients who have broken a bone. The LiFT study is a participant, surgeon and observer blinded single-centre randomized (1:1), controlled, superiority trial with 2 parallel groups. A minimization procedure will stratify participants based on the fractured long bone (humerus, femur or tibia/fibula) and smoking. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 groups: lithium capsules or placebo. The Lithium/placebo will be taken daily for 2 weeks, starting 2 weeks after the fracture occurs (or 2 weeks after surgery if the participant is treated with surgery).</detailed_description>
