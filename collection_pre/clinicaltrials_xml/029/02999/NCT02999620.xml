	<brief_title>FBCx (Alpha-CD) Mechanism of Action Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical investigation will determine the fat losses in stool associated with alpha-CD use as compared to placebo when ingested with a standardized liquid breakfast (100 microCi of [3H]triolein) and 20 microCi of [14C]tripalmitin). The ingested dose will be 2 g of α-CD at each of three meals per day for 2 days. Eight subjects will be recruited in a two-way crossover design consisting of two treatment periods. Treatment 1 requires all subjects to receive α-CD and a meal containing the fatty acid radiotracers Treatment 2 requires all subjects to receive placebo and a meal containing the fatty acid radiotracers All subjects will be observed for 48 hours as an in-patient, and a further 24 hours as an out-patient following the meal containing the radiotracer and will then undergo at least a further ≥ 14 day washout period before crossing over to the alternate treatment. All subjects randomized to the α-CD treatment arm will receive 2 g of α-CD (2 x 1 g tablets), at each of three meals per day for 2 days. During the placebo phase, all subjects will receive two identical-looking placebo tablets.</detailed_description>
