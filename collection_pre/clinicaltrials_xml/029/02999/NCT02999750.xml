	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to prospectively validate treatment benefit of an individualized treatment concept based on molecular profiling (MP) from paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections obtained before the start of treatment (real time biopsy).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EXtendedAnalysis for Cancer Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment concept will be considered to be of clinical benefit for the individual patient if a progression-free survival (PFS) ratio (PFS on MP-based therapy / best PFS achieved by prior therapy) will be &gt; 1.0 thus generating a patient cohort with this very property. Thereby, the null hypothesis (that â‰¤ 40 % of this patient population would have a PFS ratio of &gt; 1.0) will be evaluated with each patient being his own control. For tumor types with high numbers of patients per cohort, the overall response rate (ORR) will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Consenting patients of &gt;19 years with advanced cancer fulfilling the criteria of having: an advanced malignancy with metastatic spread refractory to conventional treatment a life expectancy of &gt;4 months, the possibility to access and biopsy tumour material within 4 weeks before onset of individualized treatment, a malignancy amenable to further treatment options with either cytotoxic drugs, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies or related molecules with antiproliferative potential to cancer cells, as assessed by the ex vivo analysis and a likelihood of treatment response according to the mathematical model (all outlined in detail above), agreed to participate by their signature on an informed consent form are eligible. Presence of further treatment options, as defined by NCCN guidelines which are available in Austria representing a possible further treatmentrelated response by conventional therapies according to generally accepted medical evidence. No fresh and viable tumor material available. Current use of therapeutic warfarin.
