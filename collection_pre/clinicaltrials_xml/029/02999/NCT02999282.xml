	<brief_summary>In this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study, the investigators will evaluate the effects of frontal and prefrontal anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on neurophysiological parameters of cortical connectivity, assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), in asymptomatic subjects at risk and symptomatic patients bearing a pathogenic Progranulin mutation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study, the investigators will evaluate the effects of frontal and prefrontal anodal transcranial magnetic stimulation (tDCS) on neurophysiological parameters of cortical connectivity, assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), in asymptomatic subjects at risk and symptomatic patients bearing a pathogenic Progranulin mutation. All patients will undergo genetic screening for progranulin mutations, a baseline neuropsychological and neurophysiological evaluation, including assessment of short interval intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation, short interval intracortical facilitation and long interval intracortical inhibition. Subjects will then be randomized in two groups, one receiving a 10 day (5 days/week for 2 weeks) treatment with anodal frontal and prefrontal anodal tDCS and the other receiving sham stimulation with identical parameters. After the intervention, patients will be reassessed with a neuropsychological and neurophysiological evaluation at 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 month after treatment.</detailed_description>
