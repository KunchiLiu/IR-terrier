	<brief_summary>To determine whether glucobrassicin-rich Brussels sprouts can favorably modify the metabolism of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon deuterated phenanthrene ([D10]phe) in current and former smokers</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glucobrassicin-Brussel Sprout Effect on D10 Phe Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be given 1 microgram of [D10]phe, and all urine will be collected for 6 h afterwards to quantify baseline levels of [D10]phenanthrene tetraol ([D10]pheT) and [D10]phenanthrols ([D10]HOP). Within 3 days of this baseline measurement, subjects will consume 200 micromoles of glucobrassicin in the form of raw Brussels sprouts (~150 grams) at the study center once daily for 7 consecutive days. Urine will be collected for 24 h after vegetable consumption on days 3 ± 1 and 6 of the feeding intervention for 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) quantification. On day 7 of the feeding intervention, a second dose of 1 microgram of [D10]phe will be administered at the study center after vegetable consumption, followed by another 6 h urine collection.</detailed_description>
