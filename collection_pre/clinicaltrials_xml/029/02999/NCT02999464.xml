	<detailed_description>Participants: A total of 58 stroke survivors 3 months after the current stroke will be recruited.

The main outcome measure is balance capacity with Mini-BESTest. The secondary outcomes are fall efficacy, number of falls, postural stability and control, depression, physical functions and quality of life. Assessments will be done at baseline, 8 weeks and 16 weeks follow-ups by blinded assessors. Data analysis: The results will be analyzed using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with Statistical Package for Social Science version 21.0.
