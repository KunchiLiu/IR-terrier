	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of isatuximab. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the safety profile of isatuximab. - To evaluate the duration of response (DOR). - To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of isatuximab in patients with T-ALL or T-LBL. - To evaluate immunogenicity of isatuximab in patients with T-ALL or T-LBL. - To assess minimal residual disease (MRD) and correlate it with clinical outcome.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study duration per patient will include a 3-week screening period, an approximately 1 year of treatment period or until disease progression or discontinuation for any other reason, and a follow-up period of at least 30 days after the last investigational medicinal product administration.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Patients must have a known diagnosis of ALL of T cell origin, including TLBL and TALL with extramedullary involvement at relapse confirmed by biopsy. Patients must be previously treated for TALL or TLBL and have relapsed or are refractory to most recent treatment. Patients in first relapse will be eligible regardless of the first remission duration. Patients must have been previously exposed to nelarabine in countries where this drug is available (unless due to a contraindication to its use or administrative issue). No more than 3 prior salvage therapies. Exclusion criteria: Prior treatment with immunotherapy/investigational agents within 3 weeks, chemotherapy within 2 weeks of study treatment. Must have recovered from acute toxicity before first study treatment administration. Prior stem cell transplant within 4 months and/or evidence of active systemic Graft versus Host Disease and/or immunosuppressive therapy for Graft versus Host Disease within 1 week before the first study treatment administration. Clinical evidence of active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia. TALL with testicular involvement alone. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
