	<brief_summary>The BENEFIT-Study is a randomized controlled 3-arm intervention trial investigating the currently discussed hypothesis that exercise concomitant to chemotherapy (CTx) may have a beneficial effect on cancer prognosis by boosting the anti-tumoral effect of the cytostatics or by enhancing therapy compliance. This hypothesis is based on pre-clinical and exploratory clinical trials. Breast cancer patients scheduled for neoadjuvant CTx will be randomized to either a resistance training or an aerobic training concomitant to the neoadjuvant CTx, or a waiting list control group that will get no exercise intervention during neoadjuvant CTx (i.e. usual care) but will exercise after breast surgery. The primary study endpoint is the clinical-pathologic stage (CPS-EG) score, which has been shown to be a valid prognostic factor with respect to survival after neoadjuvant CTx and is routinely assessed after breast surgery. Further, the effects of resistance and aerobic exercise on the pathological complete response (pCR), tolerability and compliance to CTx, physical fitness, patient reported outcomes such as fatigue, sleep problems, quality of life, depressive symptoms, anxiety and pain, and selected biomarkers will be investigated. First an internal pilot phase of n=33 patients will be conducted. Upon the recruitment rate, overall feasibility and funding, it is planned that the study thereafter will directly continue as phase III trial (anticipated sample size n=342), possibly after some adaptions based on the experiences gained in the pilot phase. No interim analysis or unblinding of the pilot data is planned, so that the pilot data can be integrated in the phase III study. A confirmation of the study hypothesis would be a strong argument for patients to engage in exercise as early as during neoadjuvant CTx. The trial will also provide evidence-based guidance for patients regarding type and timing of training.</brief_summary>
