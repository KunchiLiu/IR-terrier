	<detailed_description>A prospective cohort study will be performed to explore the effect of preoperative inflammation-based scores on postoperative morbidity and mortality for laparoscopic gastrectomy.The evaluation parameters are perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative complications and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.</detailed_description>
