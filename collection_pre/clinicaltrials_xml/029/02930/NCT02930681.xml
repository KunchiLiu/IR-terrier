	<brief_summary>Glucosanol had previously been proven to be effective in aiding weight loss and weight loss maintenance. Studies have also shown that Glucosanol (also known as Phaseolamin), was effective in aiding weight loss and also has evidence on reducing post-prandial glucose levels. This study is to enrich the existing evidence on dose-dependent post-prandial glucose effects of Glucosanol</brief_summary>
