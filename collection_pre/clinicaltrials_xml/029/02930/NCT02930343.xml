	<brief_summary>RA (Rheuatoid arthritis) is a multisystem disease that mainly involves joints resulting in destructive arthritis if not treated rapidly. Inspite of various advances in field of early diagnosis and treatment of RA, there is still a need for better understanding of the efficacy and safety of various combinations of conventional DMARDS, and to rank them in order accordingly, so as to give a clearer vision for further management of RA once MTX monotherapy fails, so as to achieve remission as soon as possible. The study will be conducted at the Department of Clinical Immunology, JIPMER (Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education &amp; Research). patients who fail methotrexate monotherapy will be randomised to 2 treatment arms - either a combination of Sulfasalazine (SSZ), Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Methotrexate (MTX) or Leflunomide (LEF), Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Methotrexate (MTX)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs Therapy in Patients With RA Failing Methotrexate Monotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients aged ≥18 years, fulfilling the 2010 ACR EULAR criteria for RA (symptom duration less than two years) , having more than 4 joints involved &amp; having moderate to severe disease activity (DAS28≥3.2) will be invited to participate. After providing written informed consent, eligible patients will be first started on MTX monotherapy &amp; only patients who have persistant moderate disease activity (DAS28 ESR &gt; 3.2) will be randomized into two groups. Block randomization will be done to generate random allocation sequence Group 1 - will receive MTX+LEF+HCQ Group 2- will receive MTX+SSZ+HCQ DMARD dosages used are: MTX 25 mg/week orally (dosage after 6 weeks),SSZ 2g/d (after 4 weeks) LEF 20 mg/day (dosage after 2 weeks) and HCQ 200 mg/day. Glucocorticoids will be given in an oral tapering scheme. All patients will be prescribed folic acid (10 mg/week) during MTX prescription.</detailed_description>
