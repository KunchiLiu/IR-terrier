	<brief_summary>Steinert's disease is an orphan disease. The prognosis of patients with this disease is conditioned by cardiac involvement. Search an early stage alterations in contractile function in subjects suffering from dystrophy would detect patients at risk of sudden death. The first stage of work is to validate the tools to detect early stage of infringement systolic function in a population of patients with myotonic dystrophy.</brief_summary>
