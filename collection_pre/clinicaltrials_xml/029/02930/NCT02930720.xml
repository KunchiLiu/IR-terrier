	<brief_summary>Pelvic floor main role is to maintain continence. pelvic floor malfunction could lead to urinary incontinence (UI). The known prevalence of UI among women is 25%-72%, in about 25%-50% it is Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI), SUI prevalence changes with age and obstetric history. SUI is the complaint of involuntary leakage on activities which involves inter abdominal pressure rase, such as effort or exertion, or sneezing or coughing. pelvic floor movement is coordinated with the diaphragm, it moves caudally while inhaling and cranially while exhaling. it was shown that cranial sagittal displacement of the pelvic floor is correlated to pelvic floor normal and efficient function. in order to maintain continence while internal abdominal pressure rises the pelvic floor as to work in a precise trajectory, timing and force. observing the Urinary bladder by trans abdominal ultra sound (TAUS) was found as a valid and reliable way to estimate pelvic floor sagittal displacement and function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pelvic Floor Displacement in Women With SUI and Healthy Women: An Ultrasound Study (Stress Urinary Incontinence)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>50 women between the age 25-50 with a history of one vaginal delivery will be recruited for the study. 25 women who complain about stress urinary incontinence (research group) and 25 healthy women (control group). all research participants will sign first a participant consent form. all participants will be interviewed about their own delivery, measured for weight and height and follow a trans abdominal ultra sound (TAUS) examination. the research group participants will be asked to fill a quality of life questionaire concerning their SUI complaint. at the TAUS examination the participant will be asked to perform: 1. 3 times quiet breathing. 2. 3 times forced exhalation. 3. 3 times cough. while doing so an ultra sound image of the urinary bladder will be saved for displacement measurements.</detailed_description>
