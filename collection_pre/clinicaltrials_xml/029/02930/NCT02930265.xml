	<brief_summary>It has been known that liraglutide reduces infarct size, improved left ventricular function, reduce myocardial stunning, and play a protective role in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury for patients with acute myocardial infarction. But it is not sure whether liraglutide can benefit patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. This study aim to explore the effect of Liraglutide in improving cardiac function for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study of Liraglutide in Improving Cardiac Function for Patients With Ischemic Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators will enroll 400 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who were admitted to the Chinese PLA General Hospital. All patients enrolled in this study will collect detailed baseline clinical data, including blood, enzymes (troponin, creatine kinase), blood sugar, serum creatinine, blood lipid levels (LDL lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), inflammatory markers (high sensitivity C- reactive protein, interleukin-6), endothelin (ET-1), pancreas glucagon-like peptide -1 (GLP-1) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The investigators randomly assign eligible patients in a 1:1 ratio to either liraglutide intervention group (N = 200) or control group (N = 200), liraglutide intervention group will accept ischemic cardiomyopathy conventional drugs and liraglutide (Novo Nordisk, specifications: 18mg / 3ml; 1.8mg subcutaneous injection of 1 / day), Control group will accept ischemic cardiomyopathy conventional drugs and a placebo. Primary end point of the study is main adverse cardiovascular events including Recurrent myocardial infarction, recurrent angina, revascularization, all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure again. Secondary end point of the study was 1) New York Heart Association functional class, 2) left ventricular ejection fraction, 3) 6-minute walk test, 4) KCCQ clinical total score, 5) changes in blood glucose levels during follow-up, blood lipid levels and body weight</detailed_description>
