	<brief_summary>We must implement 8 implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) to save a life in 3 years after myocardial infarction (MI) in primary prevention. Only the ejection fraction of the left ventricle (LVEF) is used as a tool for risk stratification of sudden death after myocardial infarction. Several studies have shown that impairment of spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) after MI was predictor of sudden death.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillators for primary prevention of ischemic heart disease with ejection fraction of the left ventricle ≤ 35% Ejection fraction of the left ventricle ≤ 35% Age ≥ 18 years Patients with disorders of the ventricular heart rate recorded by the implantable cardioverter defibrillators and not older than 2 years Implantable cardioverter defibrillators patient carrier for at least 3 years.
