	<brief_summary>The primary long-term objective of this research is to reduce smoking relapse through the use of automated mobile smoking cessation interventions that tailor content (e.g., treatment messages/materials) in real-time based upon currently present symptoms. The primary short-term objective of this pilot study is to determine the initial utility of a novel smartphone based smoking cessation intervention compared with standard in-person smoking cessation clinic care and the free National Cancer Institute (NCI) QuitGuide smoking cessation application. The current pilot study is a 3 armed randomized clinical trial that aims to determine the initial utility of a novel smartphone based smoking cessation intervention compared with standard in-person smoking cessation clinic care and the free NCI QuitGuide smoking cessation application.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Description of Study Visits. Screening and Baseline Assessment (Visit 1). Individuals attending the orientation visit of the Tobacco Treatment Research Clinic (TTRC) will be provided with detailed information about the study and given the opportunity to have their questions answered within a private room to ensure confidentiality. Study staff will review the consent form with interested participants, and they will be screened for eligibility on-site in a private room in the clinic. Participants will be questioned about their 1) age, 2) current level of smoking, 3) willingness to quit smoking, and 4) willingness/ability to attend 4 sessions (including the first visit). Participants will be randomized to treatment as usual (TAU), QuitGuide, or Smart-T groups and advised of their group assignment. Participants will complete the assessment portion of visit 1. Participants will complete self-report questionnaires on a laptop/tablet computer; and weight, and height will be measured in a private room to ensure confidentiality. Participants will be loaned an Android smartphone and instructed regarding the use of the phone as well as the ecological momentary assessment (EMA) procedures. Quit Day (Visit 2). Participants will complete self-report questionnaires on a laptop/tablet computer; and expired CO and weight will be measured in a private room to ensure confidentiality. Participants will compensated completion of the in-person assessments. All questions about study phones will be appropriately addressed and answered. Participants who do not attend will be contacted by phone to obtain their self-reported smoking status. 4 Weeks Post-Quit (Visit 3). Participants will complete self-report questionnaires on a laptop/tablet computer; and expired CO and weight will be measured in a private room to ensure confidentiality. Participants will be compensated for the completion of the in-person assessments, which will take approximately 45-60 minutes to complete. When participants return the phone they will be compensated according to the compensation schedule described above. Participants who do not attend will be contacted by phone to obtain their self-reported smoking status and to request that the study phone be returned by mail or in-person at the next visit. 12 Weeks Post-Quit (Visit 4; Follow-Up). Participants will complete self-report questionnaires on a laptop/tablet computer; and expired CO and weight will be measured in a private room to ensure confidentiality. Participants will be compensated for the completion of the in-person assessments, which will take approximately 60 minutes to complete. Participants who do not attend will be contacted by phone to obtain their self-reported smoking status.</detailed_description>
