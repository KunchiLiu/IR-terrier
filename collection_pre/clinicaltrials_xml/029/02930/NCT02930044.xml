	<brief_title>Early Subcutaneous Insulin Glargine Plus Standard of Care for Treatment of Diabetic Ketoacidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims: To evaluate the impact of early administration of subcutaneous glargine versus standard care on time of insulin infusion in DKA patients and other secondary outcomes listed in this application. Methods: DKA patients enrolled in this study will receive the long acting glargine dose (0.3 units/kg with a maximum dose of 30 units) within two hours after initiation the IV insulin infusion. Besides timing of the glargine dose, no other changes in standard patient care will occur in those patients enrolled in this study, the same labs will be collected and the insulin infusion will be titrated using the same hospital protocol algorithm. Patients enrolled in the prospective arm will be compared with the retrospective control group, which received standard insulin therapy (subcutaneous insulin glargine administered at least 2 to 3 hours prior to termination of the insulin infusion). There will be 18 patients in this group selected in reverse chronological order from our pre-specified date range of 8/1/2014 to 7/31/2016.</detailed_description>
