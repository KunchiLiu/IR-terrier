	<brief_title>The Core Body Temperature Rhythms: Distinguishing MCS From UWS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Living beings have multicomponent biological rhythms. There was a research recorded 24-h virations in electroencephalographic patterns. In normal subjects, the circadian rhythms of core body temperature is close to 24 h. When the interference of environmental and mental elements were eliminated, circadian rhythm shows the endogenous circadian rhythm of body acquiescently (&gt;24h ), which is also called free-running period. Measuring the continuous external auditory canal temperature of 4 unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and 3 minimally conscious state(MCS) on the fluorescent lamp surrounding every 2 hours for 168 hours starting at 00:00 on the first day to address circadian capabilities. Researchers expected to see the difference between MCS and UWS.</detailed_description>
