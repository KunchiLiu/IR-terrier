	<detailed_description>Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) is a painful musculoskeletal condition, which is considered to be due to overuse, over-stress or over-exertion of the wrist extensors of the forearm, especially extensor carpi radialis brevi. Different treatment approaches are described in the literature. The primary aim of the treatment approaches are decrease the pain and improve the functional level in patients with lateral epicondylitis. Thus, decreasing pain and regaining the functional performance in the daily living activity is essential in early diagnosed patients. The aim of this study is to compare the short-term effects of different treatment approaches on pain, function and grip strength in the rehabilitation of patients with lateral epicondylitis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>diagnosed with tennis elbow, and the duration of symptoms was between 8 and 10 weeks, and pain over the lateral epicondyle, pain during grip strength testing, and pain with one of the following tests: extensor carpi radialis test (i.e., resisted middlefinger extension), resisted wrist extension, or passive stretch of the wrist extensors. Furthermore, the participants had to agree to abstain from any other form of treatment during their involvement in this study patients with inflammatory, autoimmune, endocrine or kidney diseases, cubital tunnel syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, radiculopathies due to cervical disc pathologies, additional shoulderhandwrist pathologies, inflammatory arthritis, upper extremity operations or traumas, allergies to adhesive tape, and the patients who received corticosteroid injection due to lateral epicondylitis within the last 3 months</criteria>
