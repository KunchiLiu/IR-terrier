	<brief_summary>Neuromas are frequent after trauma and surgery, including amputation and can be identified by high-resolution ultrasound. The role of neuromas as the cause of neuropathic pain is uncertain. The investigators therefore wish to explore if spontaneous and evoked pain will be relieved by injection of local anesthetics near painful neuromas in subjects with peripheral nerve injury.</brief_summary>
