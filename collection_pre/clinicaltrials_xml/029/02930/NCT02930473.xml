	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Psychotherapeutic Intervention Model in Nursing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a psychotherapeutic intervention model in nursing regarding nursing diagnosis "Anxiety" (according to International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP)/North American Nursing Diagnoses Association (NANDA) standardized nursing language). A pilot randomised controlled trial will be carried out to testing procedures for their acceptability, estimating the likely rates of recruitment and retention of subjects, and the calculation of appropriate sample sizes. Moreover, this pilot study aims to test hypotheses. In a double-blinded nurse-led 4 months controlled trial, conducted at a hospital outpatient setting in Portugal, 60 patients with anxiety will be randomised to the intervention (n=30) or control groups (n=30). The objective is to compare the outcomes associated with "treatment as usual" and the benefits of implementing the psychotherapeutic intervention model in nursing previously developed (5 sessions), which will be evaluated using Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) outcomes "Anxiety Level" and "Anxiety Self-Control" (Portuguese version).</detailed_description>
