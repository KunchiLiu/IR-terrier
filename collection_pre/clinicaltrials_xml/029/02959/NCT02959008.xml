	<brief_summary>Cerebral autoregulation can be explained by a tight coupling between oxygen supply and demand of the brain, and is essential to maintain a constant cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the context of changes in cerebral perfusion pressure. In this study, investigators use Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to monitor cerebral autoregulation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continous Assessment of Cerebral Autoregulation With Near-infrared Spectroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive technology that real-time monitors cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI). Investigators use Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to monitor cerebral autoregulation of hypertensive participants and non-hypertensive participants.</detailed_description>
