	<brief_summary>Tomosynthesis is an innovative technique developed in digital mammography for obtaining a sectional image of the breast. Mammography has the main disadvantage of being an imaging projection that creates overlays, which eliminates tomosynthesis. The objective of this study is to evaluate if the BI-RADS classification obtained by tomosynthesis with synthetic mammography is superior to that obtained by conventional mammography in terms of specificity while not inferior in terms of sensitivity.</brief_summary>
