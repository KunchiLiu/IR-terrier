	<brief_title>Medical and Surgical Treatment for Idiopathic Granulomatous Mastitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is a rare benign inflammatory breast disease of unknown etiology.It may present with many findings that clinically and radiologically mimic breast cancer. Although IGM as a disease has been known for nearly four decades, the optimal treatment approach has not been established. Surgical intervention in the form of wide surgical excision was the mainstay of treatment before 1980, and is still performed depending on local expertise and preference. Currently,surgical treatment and systemic steroid treatment are frequently employed. With the consideration of side effects of longterm systemic (oral) steroid usage, topical steroid without systemic use were assessed and showed satisfactory curative effect. But the data concerning the use of topical steroid therapy are still very limited.</detailed_description>
