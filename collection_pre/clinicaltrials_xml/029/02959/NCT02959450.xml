	<brief_title>Design and Implementation of a Nutritional Intervention in Patients With Oropharyngeal Dysphagia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oropharyngeal Dysphagia causes complications that compromise the efficacy and security of deglutition. An inefficacy deglutition increases the risk of malnutrition and/or dehydration. On the other hand, unsafe deglutition requires more time to complete the oral preparation of the bolus, which can leave residues in the mouth that can then lead to penetration of small food particles into the respiratory tract. These tracheobronchial aspirations cause aspiration pneumonia in 50% of cases, with 50% of mortality rate. Despite the enormous impact of Oropharyngeal Dysphagia in functional capacity and quality of life, this problem is underestimated and underdiagnosed as a major cause of nutritional and pulmonary complications that generate more material and human resources. There are few studies evaluating the effect of a nutritional intervention on recovery in swallowing ability or improvement of nutritional status. The purpose of this trial is to design a nutritional intervention with modified texture foods to increase viscosity (measured accurately) according to the patient's requirements, also assess if the intervention has a positive effect on the swallowing ability, calorie and protein oral intake and nutritional status.</detailed_description>
