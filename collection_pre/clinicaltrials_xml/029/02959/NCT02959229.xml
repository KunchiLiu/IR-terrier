	<brief_title>Early Versus Late Lactoferrin in Prevention of Neonatal Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was carried out on 180 preterm neonates(&lt; 37 weeks of gestation counting from the first day of the Last Menstrual Period and confirmed by Ballard score) admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of Ain Shams University Hospitals in the period from August 2014 to December 2015. Enrolled subjects were further randomly subdivided into three groups according to the dose regimen of Lactoferrin supplementation. - Group A: (60 preterm neonates) who received oral Lactoferrin supplementation in a dose of 100 mg/day starting on day 1 and continue for 4-6 weeks. - Group B: (60 preterm neonates) who received oral Lactoferrin supplementation in a dose of 100 mg/day starting on day 3 (48hrs-72hrs) of life and continue for 4-6 weeks. - Group C: (60 preterm neonates) who match the subjected neonates, received placebo in form of distilled water.</detailed_description>
