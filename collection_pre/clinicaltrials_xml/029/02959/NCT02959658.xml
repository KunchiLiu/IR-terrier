	<brief_title>Dimethyl Fumarate Treatment of Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system and is presumed to be caused by T cell-mediated autoimmune processes. PPMS has no registered treatment options only symptomatic treatment exists. Progressive forms of MS are characterized clinically by gradual symptom development with or without superimposed relapses. Fumarates have long been known to have disease-attenuating effects in psoriasis. They have been in routine use in dermatology in Germany for several decades. Dimethyl fumarate has the interesting property of combining immunological effects, at least partly mediated by interference with nuclear factor kappa B and other transcription factors, and also anti-oxidative and neuroprotective effects mediated by activation of the transcription factor Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-Related Factor 2 (NRF2). Dimethyl fumarate is currently approved for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS by the European medicines Agency in a dose of 240 mg twice per day. Neurofilament light chain (NFL) is a treatment responsive biomarker of neuronal and axonal death when appearing in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and it has been associated with long-term prognosis in MS. The concentration is often elevated in progressive MS patients. Treatment effect is measured by measuring changes in neurofilament light chain concentration over the course of 48 weeks of treatment with either active drug or placebo.</detailed_description>
