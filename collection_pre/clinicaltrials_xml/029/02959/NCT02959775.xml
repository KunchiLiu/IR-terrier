	<brief_summary>Uptake, adherence, and completion of vaccination among drug users were low, and their immune function and immune response to hepatitis B vaccination were also suboptimal, indicating that the current practice of hepatitis B vaccination can't protect drug users from HBV infection. This is a randomized, open-label, blank-controlled trial, conducted among drug users with drug rehabilitation. This study will compare the immunogenicity and safety of three intramuscular 20µg and 60µg recombinant hepatitis B vaccines at months 0, 1, and 6 among drug users</brief_summary>
