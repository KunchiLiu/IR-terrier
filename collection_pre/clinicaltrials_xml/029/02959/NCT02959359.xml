	<brief_summary>For early stage of HCC, surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the mainstay curative treatments. However, recurrence is still a major issue after the surgery or RFA.

Sovaldi-based treatment plus ribavirin should be as effective as Sovaldi plus rivavirin in the treatment of genotype 2 HCV, as well as mixed genotype 1 and 2 HCV infection.

	<brief_title>DAA in the Risk of Recurrence After Curative Treatment of HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For early stage of HCC, surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the mainstay curative treatments. However, recurrence is still a major issue after the surgery or RFA. According to our previous report, the cumulated recurrence rate for small HCV-HCC was 72.4% at 5 year. PEG-interferon plus RBV treatment is the standard of care for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. NHIRD data showed that PEG-IFN plus RBV treatment can reduce 12% of recurrence rate in 5 years (64% vs 52%) after curative resection of HCC. However, only selected patients are eligible and tolerable to IFN-based treatment after surgical resection and the sustained virological response varied. Harvoni for genotype 1 HCV and sovaldi plus ribavirin for genotype 2 HCV can achieve high SVR and being recommended by AASLD and EASL. All-oral regimen, being more tolerable and effective for HCC patients after curative treatment than IFN-based treatment. Mixed HCV genotype infection accounts for 10% of CHC patients in Taiwan. Sovaldi-based treatment plus ribavirin should be as effective as Sovaldi plus rivavirin in the treatment of genotype 2 HCV, as well as mixed genotype 1 and 2 HCV infection. As genotype 1 and 2 are the leading HCV genotypes in Taiwan, It can simplify the regimen of anti-HCV treatment in Taiwan by using Harvoni plus ribavirin, not only for genotype 1 and 2 HCV but also for mixed genotype 1 and 2 HCV infection. Although an unexpected high recurrence rate in HCC patients under DAA treatment was reported once. However, one recent study showed a low risk of HCC recurrence after DAA treatment. Harvoni is an all-oral regimen, being more tolerable and effective for HCC patients after surgery than IFN-based treatment. The all oral regimen would be beneficial in eradicating HCV viral load and subsequently reduce the risk of recurrence after curative resection of HCV-HCC. In this study, the investigators plan to enroll 130 HCV-HCC patients after confirming curative treatment for their HCC, either by surgery or RFA. For the cases fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a 12 weeks Harvoni plus ribavirin treatment will be provided for all cases (single armed design). The primary objective of the study is annual recurrence-free survival after curative resection of HCV-HCC for up to 5 years. The secondary objectives of the study are SVR 4/12/24 by DAA, regression of fibrosis, incidence of liver-related complications (EV bleeding, ascites) after DAA treatment, and overall survival for 5 years. A hospital-based cohorts of HCV-related HCC undergoing surgical resection or RFA from Taipei Veterans General Hospital and Investigated Sites will be recruited as historical controls. The historical controls include HCV-HCC undergoing curative treatment without Peg-interferon plus ribavirin treatment (cohort 1) or with Peg-interferon plus ribavirin treatment (cohort 2) after curative treatment (surgical resection or RFA) for HCC.</detailed_description>
