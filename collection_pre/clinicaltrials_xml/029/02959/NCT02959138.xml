	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GS-9876 in participants with impaired renal function relative to matched healthy controls. Participants in this study will be enrolled using an adaptive design that includes up to 3 enrolled cohorts. Based on safety and/or PK data in Cohort 1, participants will be enrolled in adaptive Cohorts 2 and/or 3.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key All Individuals Have the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form (ICF), which must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures Be between 18 through 75 years of age, inclusive at screening Have a calculated body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 18 kg/m^2 and ≤ 36 kg/m^2 at screening Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and clinic admission (Day 1). Individuals have not donated blood within 56 days of study entry or plasma within 7 days of study entry and must refrain from blood donation from clinic admission, throughout the study period, and continuing for at least 30 days following the last dose of study drug. Have either a normal 12lead ECG or one with abnormalities that are considered clinically insignificant by the investigator in consultation with the sponsor Must, in the opinion of the investigator, be in good health based upon medical history and physical examination, including vital signs For Individuals with Renal Impairment Must have diagnosis of chronic (&gt; 6 months), stable renal impairment with no clinically significant change in renal function status within 90 days prior to study drug administration (Day 1). Have a creatinine clearance (CLcr) &lt; 90 mL/min (using the CockcroftGault method {Cockcroft et al 1976}) based on serum creatinine and actual body weight as measured at screening. For Healthy Matched Controlled Individuals (Individuals with Normal Renal Function) Have a creatinine clearance (CLcr) ≥ 90 mL/min (using the CockcroftGault method {Cockcroft et al 1976}) based on serum creatinine and actual body weight as measured at screening Match in age (± 10 years), gender, and body mass index (± 20%, 18 kg/m^2 ≤ BMI ≤ 36 kg/m^2). Key Exclusion Criteria Be a lactating female Have received any investigational compound within 30 days prior to study dosing Have current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the investigator to potentially interfere with individual's compliance or individual's safety as judged by the investigator Have a positive test result for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody Have poor venous access that limits phlebotomy For Individuals with Renal Impairment Require or are anticipated to require dialysis within 90 days of study dosing Require during the study or have received moderate or strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A within 2 weeks prior to study drug administration. For Healthy Matched Controlled Individuals (Individuals with Normal Renal Function) Have taken any prescription medications or overthecounter medications, including herbal products and antacids, within 28 days prior to start of study drug dosing, with the exception of vitamins and/or acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen and/or hormonal contraceptive medications and/or stable hormone replacement therapy in peri /postmenopausal female Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
