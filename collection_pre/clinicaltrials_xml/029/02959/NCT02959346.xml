	<brief_summary>Minimal invasive thoracoscopic surgery has been used widely for common thoracic diseases in recent years. Patients who received thoracoscopic surgery recovered much quickly and returned to their daily life sooner because of small operation wound and less invasion. However, operative pain was still an important factor, which might contribute to several post-operative complications. In daily practice, patients received oral/intravenous form non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid agents, or patient-controlled analgesia for post operative pain control. However, some side effects were observed occasionally. The role of acupuncture in post-operative pain control was frequently discussed in recent research. The main mechanisms of acupuncture in pain control were (1) to stimulate the release of endogenous opioid and (2) to block TRPV1 receptor. The randomized controlled trial arranged by Gary Deng and his colleagues in 2008, was the first clinical trial investigated the role of acupuncture in post-operative pain control for traditional thoracotomy patients. However, there was no further research about the role of acupuncture applied to minimal invasive thoracoscopic surgery. Thus, the aim of this randomized controlled trial was to investigate the role of acupuncture in post-operative pain control for minimal invasive thoracoscopic surgery patients. In order to deliver a safe and effective way in pain control, and to save medical cost and promote quality of patient care.</brief_summary>
