	<brief_title>The Effects of Visior on Ocular Hemodynamics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine if glaucoma patients and healthy subject experience any alteration in localized retinal blood flow after retinal stimulation by viewing commercially available content through the VISIOR video goggles. Both groups will undergo measurements of arterial blood pressure, cardiac pulse (heart rate), intraocular pressure, and retinal blood flow using Heidelberg retinal flowmetry (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) at baseline and then ten minutes, thirty minutes, and sixty minutes after viewing commercially available content through the VISIOR video goggles for thirty minutes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with openangle glaucoma 30 years or older, free from other ophthalmic disease, free from diabetes, beta agonists and uncontrolled blood pressure. Women who are pregnant or lactating or who plan to become pregnant (self reporting); smoker during last ten years (self reporting); systemic diseases that may interfere with blood flow measurements or wearing the goggles. In addition, 10 healthy subjects, age 18 or older, free from eye disease will be enrolled. Identical exclusion criteria apply to this healthy group. Identical procedures apply to this group, which only differs by ocular health status.</criteria>
