	<brief_title>Postprandial Effects of a High Potassium Meal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many studies have shown that an increase in potassium through the diet or through potassium pills helps to lower blood pressure. Also, the amount of oral potassium taken can improve how well the participants blood vessels work. These studies have focused on potassium given in the form of a pill. The investigators are interested in the effect of potassium consumed through food sources and how it will effect arterial health and blood pressure. The world health organization (WHO) recommends a K⁺ intake of at least 3510 mg/day from food for adults, excluding those with impaired K⁺ excretion. In this study the investigators aim to provide approximately 75% (approximately 2000 mg) of the total daily recommended intake for potassium in one meal. The investigators do not know whether dietary potassium (not pill form) will acutely improve the arterial health and if it will cause a decrease in blood pressure. The investigators hypothesis to see an improvement in vascular function following a high potassium meal compared to a low potassium meal.</detailed_description>
