	<brief_summary>Bronchial fistula (BF), an abnormal passage or communication between a bronchus and another part of the body, may develop when there are penetrating wounds of the thorax and after lung surgery. Without effective therapy, treatment of BF is a challenge, with a high rate of mortality and teratogenicity. The investigators will conduct endoscopic injection of human amniotic epithelial cells to fistula, observe the recovery of bronchial fistula and systemic reactions, to investigate the application of human amniotic epithelial cells in the treatment of bronchial fistula.</brief_summary>
