	<brief_summary>After endovascular treatment (EVT) for peripheral artery disease (PAD), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAAT) of aspirin (ASA) and clopidogrel are currently drug of choice to prevent occlusion. Anplone SRÂ®, controlled-released Sarpogrelate hydrochloride, has been introduced as an anti-platelet agent for the drug of PAD. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of Anplone + aspirin and clopidogrel + aspirin in patients who underwent EVT for femoro-popliteal occlusive disease.</brief_summary>
