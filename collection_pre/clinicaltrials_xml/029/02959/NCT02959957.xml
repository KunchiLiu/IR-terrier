	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the ecological impact on the intestinal microbiota and compare the safety and efficacy of temocillin compared to cefotaxime, in empiric treatment of febrile UTI. Half of participants will receive temocillin and the other half will receive cefotaxime.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Disturbance of the Intestinal Microbiota by Temocillin vs Cefotaxime in Treatment of Febrile Urinary Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Temocillin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic with activity against gram negative bacteria inclusive many ESBL producing bacteria. Temocillin is approved and marketed in a few European countries since the 1980´s but not in Sweden. The aim of the study is to find an ecological favorable alternative to cephalosporins in the treatment of this common indication. The hypothesis is that treatment with temocillin causes less disturbances on the intestinal microbiota while at least comparable efficacy. The study will be performed as an open prospective multicentre study with two parallel groups comparing 2 g temocillin three times daily with 1-2 g cefotaxim three times daily for 7-10 days in male and female adult patients with febrile urinary tract infection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females ≥ 18 years of age with suspected or confirmed febrile UTI, fulfilling at least one of the following signs and symptoms: Flank pain or suprapubic pain, Tenderness over the kidney on physical examination, Urinary symptoms such as dysuria, urinary frequency or urinary urgency Fever ≥ 38.0°C (highest temperature recorded at home or at the hospital) Positive urinalysis tests (UNitrit and/or ULPK) Have a pretreatment baseline urinary culture obtained Require iv antibacterial treatment of the presumed infection Fertile women: Agree to practice highly effective anticontraceptive methods from studystart to TOC Signed informed consent Have a documented history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to any betalactam Pregnant or nursing women Receipt of any prior potentially therapeutic antibacterial agent within 1 month before randomisation and sampling for urine and faecal cultures. Exceptions will prior treatment with pivmecillinam or nitrofurantoin. Known chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt; 10 mL/min at screening as estimated by CockcroftGault), or receiving intermittent haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis Known colonization with ESBL Any condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject or the quality of study data.</criteria>
