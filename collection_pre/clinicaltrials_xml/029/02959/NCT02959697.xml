	<brief_summary>Blepharoptosis (ptosis) repair is a common and generally well tolerated surgical procedure usually performed using local anesthetic. However, a subset of patients appears to experience intraoperative pain/discomfort during ptosis repair using an anterior approach with subcutaneous local anesthetic. Posterior subconjuctival local anesthetic is currently used for eyelid procedures such as chalazion incision and drainage and full-thickness eyelid resections. The purpose of this study is to determine whether an additional subconjunctival injection of local anesthetic, through the posterior aspect of the eyelid, reduces intraoperative pain during anterior ptosis repair.</brief_summary>
