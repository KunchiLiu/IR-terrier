	<detailed_description>Main Objective: The aim of this observational and prospective study is to evaluate retrospectively the concordance between the actual systolic heart failure patient management during the inhospital treatment of heart failure (as recorded from the usual healthcare data collected) and the therapeutic proposals from a medical algorithmic decision support software. Secondary Objectives: To study the evolution of biological, hepatic and cardiopulmonary ultrasound usual markers in hospitalization, in connection with the duration of hospitalization and drug administered.</detailed_description>
