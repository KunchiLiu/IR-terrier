	<detailed_description>The adherence to treatment for osteoporosis doesn't exceed 50% after one year. The SIOUX project about the inter-professional collaboration (attending physician with dispensary pharmacist) developed therapeutic patient education (TPE) plans and created follow-up booklets which were dealt to the patients who have to transmit it to their two medical professionals twice a year during three years one after one. The results after 18 months are encouraging about the improvement of adherence to treatment and about the lifestyle changes.</detailed_description>
