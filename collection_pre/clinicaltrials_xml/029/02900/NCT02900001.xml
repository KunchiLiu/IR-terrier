	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early invasive strategy and routine delayed invasive strategy in Chinese elderly patients of 75 years or older with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and to verify the hypothesis that routine delayed invasive strategy is inferior to early invasive strategy in such a group of patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Delayed Versus EARly Invasive Strategy in Patients of 75 Years or OLDer With Non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to enroll 520 elderly patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Patients will be identified through screening of all elderly patients of 75 years and older with elevated cardiac troponin and ischemic change of electrocardiogram from over 20 hospitals throughout China. Written informed consent form will be obtained from those patients whose onset of symptom is within 48 hours before admission. When a patient consents to participate in the study, their brief information will be entered in a central randomization system, and a random number will be generated. According to the random number, each patient will be randomly assigned to early invasive therapy versus routine delayed invasive strategy. All patients will initiate dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin+P2Y12 inhibitor) and continued till the end of follow-up at one year. For patients assigned to early invasive group, a loading dose of antiplatelet agent should be given, unless contraindicated. Anticoagulation, anti-ischemic agents, statin and other guideline recommended medicine will be given according to treating physician. Patients assigned to early invasive strategy will undergo coronary angiography within 24 hours after admission and have percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting as soon as possible during the index hospitalization if appropriate. Patients assigned to delayed invasive strategy will undergo coronary angiography and appropriate revascularization after 72 hours at lest after admission and in the index hospitalization. Patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention can receive a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor if indicated and upfront use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors is discouraged. The choice of intervention or surgery and the choice of complete or staged revascularization will be determined by the operator according to coronary anatomy and consistent with current practice guidelines. Patients assigned to delayed strategy should undertake urgent coronary angiography and revascularization accordingly if indicated during the period of time waiting for delayed invasive therapy. Such procedure will be adjudicated as an endpoint. Elective percutaneous coronary intervention on non-culprit vessels, in either study arm, can take place sometime after the index procedure with the goal to achieve complete revascularization. Such staged procedures will not be deemed as an adverse event. Specific data for acquisition: Research demographics: age, height, weight, body mass index, medications at randomization, pertinent medical/family/social history, i.e., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, current tobacco use, history of prior myocardial infarction, PCI or CABG. This data will be gathered by research coordinator through interviewing patient and checking patient's medical record. Procedural: Exact time of onset of ischemic symptoms, of admission, of randomization, and of undertake coronary angiography will be noted by a supplemental chart, along with important information like the evidence of occurrence of an endpoint. Blood concentration of hemoglobin, BNP/NT-proBNP, creatinine, cardiac troponin and C-reaction protein will be tested at admission. First electrocardiography and echocardiography will be recorded. Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow will be recorded before and after PCI procedure, and the images will be copied to calculate the SYNTAX score afterwards. After hospital discharge, the research coordinator will contact the patient at specified intervals （30 days after discharge, 180 days and 365 days after randomization） to determine if an endpoint has been met.</detailed_description>
