	<brief_summary>Much of HIV is related to behaviour: sexual risk taking, late diagnosis, adherence to antiretroviral therapy, follow up, disclosure of one's HIV status. The project aimed to use various psychometric tools to determine if these scores have a predictive value on late testing, treatment succes, quality of follow up, and disclosure of HIV to sex partners. The expected outcomes would be to be able to stratify patients using a behavioural risk score and allocate targeted ressources to improve the quality of care for the most at risk patients.</brief_summary>
