	<brief_summary>The French DIVAT (standing for Données Informatisées et VAlidées en Transplantation in french, and in English "Computerized and VAlidated Data in Transplantation" ) cohort was Kicked off in 1994 by the Transplantation Urology Nephrology Institute of the Nantes University Hospital in France. The primary objective of this multicenter computerized database was to enable prospective clinical and epidemiological research studies concerning kidney transplant recipients, particularly focusing on mid- and long-term clinical outcomes, therapeutic strategies and public health issues. The patient-case system of the DIVAT cohort allows the monitoring of medical records of all patient-specific and allograft-specific data, including bio-banking since 2005. Data are collected from the date of transplantation until the graft failure, at each scheduled outpatient visit or hospital admission motivating by a new clinical, therapeutical or biological expression. The DIVAT cohort contains information on more than 11000 transplant recipients between 1994 and today, issued from 8 French university hospitals centers (the DIVAT Network is organized by a consortium agreement). 18% of all patients underwent retransplantation and 11% of all kidney transplants originated from living donors. The DIVAT network heavily works to ensure a high-quality data collection with the aim of exploring adequately the complex post-transplantation process. The Divat network encourage collaborations and enables interested researchers to submit a research project by completing a request form available on the DIVAT website (http://www.divat.fr/en) describing the context, objectives and design of the study</brief_summary>
