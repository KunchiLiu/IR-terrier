	<brief_summary>Clinical and experimental data suggest that neutrophil activation and extravasation are deleterious in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) involving an increased risk of unfavorable outcome and hemorrhagic transformation (HT). However, clinical trials targeting neutrophil recruitment in AIS patients were negative. Recently, an experimental study has shown that neutrophil activation and transmigration begin immediately after the occlusion. Inhibition of neutrophil recruitment several hours after the start of ischemia appears therefore too late to have a clinical relevance. The objective is to study the time dependent impact of neutrophils in AIS and the predominant mediators in each time point to identify the appropriate therapeutic target and time window.</brief_summary>
