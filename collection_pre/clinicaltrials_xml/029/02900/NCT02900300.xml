	<brief_summary>The first aim of the study is to obtain from chirurgical micro biopsy myoblast in culture which will differentiate in Diaphragm fiber. Then these fibers will be submitted under mechanical stress condition similar to those imposed in vivo by mechanical ventilation to validate in human a model in vitro of diaphragm dysfunction induced by mechanical ventilation. Then the second part of the study will be to evaluate with this model, the efficiency of an antioxidant therapy.</brief_summary>
