	<brief_summary>Although allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (AlloHSCT) is a curative treatment option for malignant hematological diseases, it is also associated with significant morbidity such as graft versus host disease, infections, and immune complications. Moreover, long-term survivors are likely to have reduced physical performance and functioning due to deconditioning, sarcopenia, and bone loss, and particularly high levels of fatigue and psycho-social stress, all of which negatively impact patients' quality of life. Purpose: To conduct a randomized controlled, single site trial investigating whether a partially supervised exercise intervention in the first 100 days post alloHSCT patients will result in improved quality of life at Day 100 post-transplant compared to standard of care treatment. Secondary objectives will investigate the effect of an exercise intervention on muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, mobility, bone mineral density, body composition, exercise, and immunological/inflammatory biomarkers compared to standard of care. Procedure: 120 patients receiving alloHSCT will be baseline tested, and then randomized into an Exercise Intervention Group or Standard of Care Control Group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized non-blinded single centre prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a partially-supervised progressive exercise intervention among patients undergoing alloHSCT compared to a self-directed exercise program. Approximately 120 patients will be enrolled. Following completion of all baseline data collection, participants will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention group or the control group. Patients in the intervention group will receive an exercise manual with background information, descriptions for different resistance and aerobic exercises, and instructions for tailoring the intensity of exercise. All patients will receive Therabands™ for resistance exercises and have access to a stationary bicycle for aerobic exercises with practical introduction by an exercise specialist. The partially supervised intervention is a progressive program with a goal of three aerobic and two resistance exercise sessions per week. Aerobic exercise will consist of 10-30 minutes of bicycling using a stationary bike (supervised or unsupervised) or brisk walking, following the Borg Scale of Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE). Resistance exercise will include exercise for the upper and lower extremities with Therabands™. Exercise will be adapted based on the participant's clinical status for safety and ability to perform exercises. At the weekly supervised session, the exercise specialist will provide adequate progression of exercises, and review adherence to the intervention and provide support for questions and overcoming identified barriers to adherence. Participants assigned to the control group will receive our current standard of care. They will be reviewed by the ward physiotherapist on admission to hospital and encouraged to maintain physical activity by walking around the inpatient unit during their inpatient hospitalization. As per standard of care, the physiotherapist will be available on an as needed basis in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Timely assessments of outcome measures outlined in the "Outcome Measures" section will be conducted for both groups.</detailed_description>
