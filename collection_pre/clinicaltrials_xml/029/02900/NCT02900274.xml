	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Multi-LOC® peripheral stent system to treat de novo and restenotic lesions (no in-stent restenosis (ISR), no restenosis post drug coated balloon (DCB) after flow limiting plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) and/or DCB dilatations in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and popliteal segments (P1, P2 &amp; P3)</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Willingness to treat flowlimiting dissections/recoil after plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA)/drug coated balloon (DCB) interventions Patients in Rutherford classes 2 through 5 Patients eligible for peripheral revascularization by means of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting Patients must be at least 18 years of age Patient with a life expectance of at least 12 months Patients who are mentally and linguistically able to understand the aim of the study and to show sufficient compliance in the following study protocol Patients must agree to undergo at least the 6month clinical followup Patient is able to verbally acknowledge an understanding of the associated risks, benefits, and treatment alternatives to therapeutic options of this trial, e.g. balloon angioplasty by means of other suitable stent devices. Patients, by providing their informed consent, agree to these risks and benefits as stated in the patient informed consent document. Lesions with unsatisfying angiographic results due to recoil and/or dissections after POBA/DCB interventions Infrainguinal lesions in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and popliteal segments (P1,P2 &amp; P3) reference vessel diameters between 4 and 7.0 mm, lesion length suitable for the release of at least 2 Stent (up to 6) segments implanted with a minimum interstent distance of 1 cm Diameter stenosis preprocedure must be larger or equal to 70% Vessels must have adequate distal runoff with at least one vessel to the foot or with collaterals in the calf supplying sufficient flow to the foot. (Lesions separated by less than 2 cm are considered as one lesion) Patient not suitable for revascularization by interventional means</criteria>
