	<brief_summary>This study aims to compare the effects of two water-based training models in physiological parameters of dyslipidemic elderly women. Thus, a randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted in parallel with the participation of 45 dyslipidemic elderly women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Two Aquatic Training Models in Physiological Parameters of Elderly Dyslipidemic Women.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The women will be randomly divided into three groups: water aerobics training (WA), resistance aquatic training (WR) and the third is the control group (who will perform relaxation sessions under water). The three groups will attend classes during 10 weeks, with two weekly sessions of 45 minutes each. The WA and WR groups will use the same four exercises in their training. The WA group will be trained using the interval method, performing six blocks of five minutes each one, alternating four minutes at intensities corresponding to 90 to 100% of the heart rate corresponding to the second ventilatory threshold (HRVT2) and one minute at intensities between 80 and 90% HRVT2. The WR group will perform four to eight sets of 20 to 10 seconds along the macrocycle, always at maximal speed execution of the exercises. Will be measured, before and after the period of 10 weeks of intervention, biochemical, cardiorespiratory, neuromuscular and hemodynamic variables, parameters of quality of life and depressive symptoms in addition to the cardiovascular risk score of the participants of the three groups. Data will be described by means values and lower and upper limits, with a 95% confidence interval. Comparisons between and within groups were performed using the method of generalized estimates of equations (GEE), with Bonferroni post hoc, adopting a 0.05 significance level.</detailed_description>
