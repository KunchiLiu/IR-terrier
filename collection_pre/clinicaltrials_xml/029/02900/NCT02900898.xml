	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease with metabolic alterations due mainly by the liberation of catabolic cytokines leading to changes in body composition as rheumatoid cachexia. Dynamic exercise (DE) has demonstrated to improve muscular, strength and joint function as well as inflammatory process. Also, a diet focused on the consumption of certain fatty acids like the Mediterranean is recommended to reduce inflammation. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of a dynamic exercise program in combination with a Mediterranean diet in strength, joint mobility and disease activity in women with RA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise and Mediterranean Diet on Body Composition, Disease Activity and Inflammatory Markers in Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation, joint pain, destruction of the synovial membranes and metabolic alterations due mainly by the liberation of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta mainly and leading to changes in body composition as rheumatoid cachexia, which is characterized by involuntary loss of muscular mass with or without loss of body weight and with or without gain of fat mass and therefore reducing physical activity and affecting nutrition. Alternative therapies that could improve these metabolical changes are "Dynamic exercise" (DE) which has demonstrated to improve muscular function and muscular strength, as well as joint mobility and joint inflammatory markers without negative effects on RA. Also, "Mediterranean diet" (MD) which is recommended to reduce inflammation by the high intake of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated and low in saturated fats. Previous studies report the benefits of nutritional interventions but in the majority of the cases therapies are based on specific foods and not in the form of diet. Likewise, physical interventions are different regarding in time and type of movement. However both interventions have shown ambiguous findings in terms of body composition (mainly) and which prevents drawing conclusions and generate recommendations on the implementation of these therapies (in combination). As far as the investigators know, no studies evaluating the effect of a diet and exercise combined. Thus the aim of this study is to assess the effect of DE program in combination with a MD on body composition, strength, joint mobility and disease activity in women with RA.</detailed_description>
