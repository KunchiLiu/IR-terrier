	<brief_summary>The main objective of this project is to assess the average cost of the treatment of bleeding postpartum with recombinant activated factor VII (NovoSeven®) and compare it to the reference strategy. Costs related to medicine NovoSeven® can generate surplus, but it also avoids in some cases very costly invasive procedures. It will be interesting to compare the average cost of the complete strategies supported.</brief_summary>
