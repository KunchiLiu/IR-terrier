	<brief_summary>Registry participants with advanced malignancy or myelodysplasia will have a sample of their tumor or tissue analysed for genetic alterations using next generation sequencing (NGS) performed in a lab that has been certified to meet a high quality standard. Treatments and outcomes will be reported to the registry to allow further understanding of how genetic differences can lead to better diagnosis and treatments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MED-C Registry: Advanced Malignancy or Myelodysplasia, Tested by Standard Sequencing and Treated by Physician Choice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every malignancy or myelodysplasia is different on a molecular (genetic) level even in patients with the same diagnosis. These differences often give prognostic information, determine what types of treatments are available for a patient, as well as determine outcomes. In this registry, the method of identifying the genetic difference of the disease (using Next Generation Sequencing or NGS) is standardized, the treatments received by a patient, and the outcome of these treatments are entered into a database where all identifying information is removed. Payers (insurance companies) will pay for the testing, laboratories will report the genetic information, physicians and eventually patients will report treatments and outcomes. This information will then be reviewed frequently and analyzed to find better methods to improve the testing or treatments of disease. It is expected that dozens of other trials or registries will eventually be available for participants.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion: 1. Patient is â‰¥ 18 years old. 2. Patient is able to understand and agrees to comply with the requirements of the study and provides written informed consent indicating voluntary consent to participate in the registry. If the patient is unable to provide consent, but is able to comply with other study requirements, informed consent must be obtained by a durable power of attorney or healthcare proxy. 3. Patient is diagnosed with any of the following malignancies or disorders AND with the corresponding American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) 7th Edition Staging OR listed clinical scenario (i.e. a patient initially diagnosed with early stage lung cancer would not be a candidate, but if they later developed metastatic disease, they would be eligible and could be enrolled in this registry): 1. Solid Malignancies Tumor Type (Initial Stage: Clinical Scenario) Lung and Bronchus (Stage IIIB or IV: Metastatic) Colorectal (Stage IVB: Metastatic) Pancreas (Stage IV: Metastatic) Breast (Stage IV: Metastatic) Prostate (N/A: Androgen Independent) Hepatobiliary (Nonresectable: Metastatic) Tumor of Unknown Primary (Nonresectable: N/A) Bladder (Stage IV: Metastatic) Esophageal (Stage IV: Metastatic) Brain and CNS (All: Initial Diagnosis) Ovarian Cancer (Stage IV: Recurrent) Kidney or Renal Pelvis (Stage IV: Metastatic) Stomach (Stage IV: Metastatic) Endometrial (Stage IV: Metastatic) Melanoma (Stage IV: Metastatic) Oral Cavity and Pharynx (Stage IVC: Metastatic) Uncommon Solid Malignancies* (Stage IV: Metastatic) *Defined as &lt;1% annual death rate in the SEER database. This would also include histologies of common tumors that have been shown to have a more aggressive phenotype and require a different treatment approach than their more common counterpart. 2. Hematologic Malignancies Tumor Type (Initial Stage: Clinical Scenario) NonHodgkins Lymphoma (N/A: Progressed or relapsed after initial treatment) Multiple Myeloma (Nonsmoldering disease: Requiring Treatment) Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (N/A: Initial Diagnosis or Relapse) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (N/A: Progressed or relapsed after initial therapy) Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (N/A: Initial Diagnosis or Relapse) Hodgkins Lymphoma (N/A: Progressed or relapsed after initial therapy) Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (N/A: Progressed or relapsed after initial therapy) Uncommon Hematologic Malignancies (N/A: Requiring Treatment) 3. Myelodysplasia with cytopenias at time of requiring treatment 4. Standardized NGS characterization of the disorder must be obtained on an appropriate somatic specimen (liquid biopsy of solid tumors will not be accepted) obtained within 6 months (180 days) of study entry or their physician plans to have standardized NGS performed on a specimen obtained within 3 months (90 days) following consent to be eligible for inclusion in the registry. Any type of biomarker testing at a nonMEDC lab is allowed but does not meet the testing requirement for this registry. If these test include other biomarkers, this data will be required to be reported. 5. Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02 at screening. 6. Patient is willing and able to be treated by a care plan determined by their physician. 7. Patient may participate in other clinical studies while participating in this observational registry. 8. Patient agrees with regular follow up</criteria>
