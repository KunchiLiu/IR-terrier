	<brief_summary>The main objective is to identify the genes involved in congenital dislocation of the hip. The secondary objectives are to measure the association between mechanical risk factors and congenital dislocation of hip and study the interactions between these factors and genetic factors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Research for Genetic Factors Involved in Congenital Dislocation of Hip: Genome-wide Association Study in Grand West France</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital hip dislocation (CHD) is one of the most frequent skeleton abnormalities in the Caucasian population (incidence: 2-10 / 1000). This disease results from an abnormality of the reports of the femoral head with the acetabulum, generated by a morphological defect of the cavity and / or joint hypermobility. This condition is now defined as a multifactorial disease involving in the one hand, mechanical factors related to the conditions of pregnancy and childbirth, and secondly, genetic factors suggested by ethnic predisposition and familial aggregation observed. Despite the neonatal screening, CHD remains a public health problem because of its high frequency, because of the functional handicap which it leads in case of late diagnosis and of its natural evolution to coxarthrosis. CHD was the object of a significant number of publications on the difficult aspects of its screening and treatment but, at the moment, few data are available on the genetic factors involved. The genetic studies led on the CHD based on studies of case-control associations, focused on candidate genes, and genetic linkage analysis, two strategies classically used in genetic epidemiology. To date, these strategies did not allow to elucidate the genetic determinism of the pathology. The considerable progress made in recent years both in the field of knowledge of the human genome and its variability, in the development of methodological and technological tools allow to better understand the genetic determinism of complex diseases such as CHD. The development of the techniques of broadband sequencing, new generation said sequencing (NGS for Next Generation Sequencing) makes indeed accessible the sequencing of the whole genome or of the set of its coding regions (exome) and now allows identify rare variants, that is to say variants having a minor allele frequency of less than 1%. These variants were previously not recognizable by the strategies traditionally used in genetic epidemiology, which are based on the study of common variants (minor allele frequency of ≥ 5%) listed in the public databases of the human genome . The NGS sequencing technique makes it possible to address the problem of the study of complex diseases in a new light and it appears necessary to apply this strategy to the CHD to search for genetic factors involved in the pathology.</detailed_description>
