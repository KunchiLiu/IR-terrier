	<brief_summary>Intra-aortic Balloon Pumps (IABP) have been used for roughly 50 years in Critical Care Units, Intensive Care Units, Cath labs as a way to improve systemic and coronary circulation in patients in cardiogenic shock (CS) or at high risk situation as mechanical complications stemming from myocardial infarction (MI), critical coronary stenosis, high-risk PCI, etc. Several papers recently questioned the relevance of this assistance device - namely the IABP-SHOCK II trial in CS and the CRISP-AMI trial in anterior MI without CS - resulting in the downgrading of the recommendation standards of the IABP by medical societies.</brief_summary>
