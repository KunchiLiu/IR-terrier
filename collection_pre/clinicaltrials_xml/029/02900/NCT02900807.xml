	<brief_summary>Oro-tracheal intubation is performed daily in anesthesia and in the ICU. When a patient is intubated, the endotracheal tube must be inserted into the trachea to the right depth. If the tube is not deep Inserted enough there is a risk of accidental extubation and trauma to the vocal cords by the balloon. If the tube is inserted too far there is a risk of selective intubation into the right or left mainstem bronchus, which can lead to contralateral lung atelectasis and hypoxemia. The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a correlation between the measurement of the airway of an adult population and criteria that would be easily accessible in daily clinical practice: the height of the patient and the size of their feet.</brief_summary>
