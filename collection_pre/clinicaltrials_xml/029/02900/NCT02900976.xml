	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how rituximab and latent membrane protein (LMP)-specific T-cells work in treating pediatric solid organ recipients with Epstein-Barr virus-positive, cluster of differentiation (CD)20-positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. LMP-specific T-cells are special immune system cells trained to recognize proteins found on post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder tumor cells if they are infected with Epstein-Barr virus. Giving rituximab and LMP-specific T-cells may be better in treating pediatric organ recipients with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder than rituximab alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab and LMP-Specific T-Cells in Treating Pediatric Solid Organ Recipients With EBV-Positive Cluster of Differentiation(CD) 20-Positive Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of treating pediatric and young adult solid organ transplant recipients with newly diagnosed or recurrent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive CD20-positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) with a novel T cell therapeutic, allogeneic Latent Membrane Protein(LMP)1/LMP2-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (third party latent membrane protein [LMP]-specific T cells), in a cooperative group setting. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the percentage of eligible patients for whom a suitable LMP-specific T cell product derived from a third party LMP-specific T cell bank is available. II. To estimate the response rate (RR) to three doses of rituximab (RTX) as single agent in children and young adults with EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD after solid organ transplantation (SOT). III. To estimate the 2-year event-free survival (EFS) of children and young adults with EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD after SOT treated with RTX with/without LMP-specific T cells. IV. To estimate overall survival (OS) of children and young adults with EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD after SOT treated with RTX with/without LMP-specific T cells. V. To estimate the RR to LMP-specific T cells of children and young adults with EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD after SOT who have not had a complete response to RTX. VI. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) of children and young adults with EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD after SOT treated with RTX with/without LMP-specific T cells. VII. To describe the toxicity of third party LMP-specific T cells in children and young adults with EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD after SOT treated with RTX and LMP-specific T cells. VIII. To validate that absence of EBV viremia correlates with RR, EFS and OS. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether third party LMP-specific T cells promote autologous immune reconstitution of EBV-specific T cells. II. To determine whether EBV viremia is inversely correlated with an increase in EBV-specific T cells in vivo. III. To determine whether plasma cytokine profile and changes in cytokines over time correlate with treatment response or toxicity (e.g. cytokine release syndrome). OUTLINE: INDUCTION: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15. Course continues for up to 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I (RTX): Patients with newly diagnosed PTLD who achieve a complete response (CR) receive additional rituximab as in induction. ARM II (LMP-TC): Patients with newly diagnosed PTLD who achieve a partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), or recurrent PTLD regardless of response after induction, receive allogeneic LMP1/LMP2-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes IV over 1- 2 minutes on days 0 and 7. Course continues for up to 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with PR or SD after first course of course allogeneic LMP1/LMP2-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes receive an additional course. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.</detailed_description>
