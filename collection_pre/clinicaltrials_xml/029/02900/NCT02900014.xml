	<brief_summary>Cell therapy appears to be an alternative to treat bone defects. Scientific advances have shown in animal models and in humans that mesenchymal stem cells were good candidates to support cellular bone regeneration after transplantation. However, their collection requires invasive sampling usually bone marrow. A new candidate stem cells able to stimulate bone regeneration has recently been identified in the nasal cavity, these cells are called "ecto-mesenchymal" cells. These stem cells have very similar biological characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells of bone marrow. They exhibit a high mitogenic activity and hold great potential for differentiation into osteoblast lineage. Given their properties and their ease of access within the nasal cavity, ecto-mesenchymal stem cells offer new prospects for cell therapy targeting bone involvement. In this context, the ecto-mesenchymal stem cells represent a nasal bone reconstruction interesting alternative in particular in indication of the cleft. They are directly and easily accessible in these children when conventional surgical reconstruction. The investigators propose in this study to validate a production method of stem cell called "ecto-mesenchymal" isolated from a biopsy of the nasal cavity of children with cleft lip and palate to be able to soon propose cell therapy innovative in this indication.</brief_summary>
