	<brief_title>Study on Sodium and Caffeine in Children and Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sodium consumption among adults is high in Switzerland, as in most parts of the world. It is expected to be high in children as well, but little is still known. 24 hour urine collection is the golden standard to assess sodium consumption. However, this method is logistically difficult, especially for children. Therefore, alternatives are needed. Urinary spots have been used as a proxy to estimate sodium excretion over 24 hour in adults, but not in children. This study will assess whether urinary spots can be used to estimate sodium consumption in children in comparison to 24 hour urine collections. Caffeine consumption has risen in children over the past years, mainly before of the increase in consumption of soda drinks. A precise way to measure caffeine consumption is by assessing the concentration of caffeine and its metabolites in 24 hour urine samples. An alternative to 24 hour urine collection is using questionnaires, however this remains difficult due to the multiples food sources of caffeine. This study will compare caffeine consumption estimated by 24 hour urine collection and by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire targeting caffeine containing products.</detailed_description>
