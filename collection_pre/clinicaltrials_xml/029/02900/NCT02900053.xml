	<brief_summary>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which there was the potential for or actual occurrence of grave physical harm. Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, accidents, and military combat. People with PTSD have persistent frightening thoughts and memories of their ordeal, may experience sleep problems, feel detached or numb, or be easily startled. Its lifetime prevalence is quite high, with 7-8% in various studies and 4% in french studies. The current PTSD treatment usually involves antidepressants as serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapies, such as exposure therapy to trauma-linked elements (memories, feelings and thoughts) so the fear associated to the traumatic event can decrease. But the therapeutic response stays partial, even combining these treatments. To improve the PTSD treatment efficiency, innovative approaches are being explored like new drugs or cerebral stimulation. This project aims to assess the efficacy of a less known but promising therapeutic strategy for PTSD : the use of transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation (tDCS) to enhance the trauma-focused therapy results.</brief_summary>
