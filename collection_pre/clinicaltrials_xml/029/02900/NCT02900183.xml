	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Effect of ARC-AAT Injection on Circulating and Intrahepatic Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, multi-dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effect on intrahepatic and circulating Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) levels of ARC-AAT Injection, administered intravenously. Participants who have signed an Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) approved informed consent form and met all of the protocol eligibility criteria will receive multiple intravenous doses (7 total doses administered every 28 days) of ARC-AAT Injection. Patients previously, currently or never receiving AAT augmentation therapy are acceptable for enrollment. All subjects will require a pre-dose biopsy and a post-dose biopsy completed after the last dose or at early termination as applicable. For each participant the duration of the study clinic visits is approximately 49 weeks, from the beginning of the Screening period to the Day 287 End-of-Study (EOS) visit. The following evaluations will be performed at regular intervals throughout the study: medical history, physical examinations, bee venom allergy blood test, vital sign measurements (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate), weight, adverse events monitoring, electrocardiograms (ECGs), pregnancy tests (females), concurrent medication evaluation, pulmonary function testing, clinical laboratory tests including hematology, coagulation, chemistry, FibroTest, anti-drug antibodies, drug screens, serum AAT levels, liver biopsy, FibroScan, and urinalysis.</detailed_description>
