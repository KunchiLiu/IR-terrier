	<brief_summary>Integrative approaches to promote wellness and reduce the distress associated with cancer are considered as essential components of cancer care. In case, exercise training has been shown to produce many positive physiological and psychological benefits. Mindfulness-based stress reduction program shows similar beneficial effects, and especially in emotional distress management. The aim of the study is to examine the cumulative effect of an 8 week-exercise-training program combined with an MBSR program on cardio-respiratory fitness and quality of life in women with breast cancer. These effects are thought to be mediated in part through changes in underlying brain processes, that investigators will be put in light. Through telomerase activity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial respiration and blood cytokine level measurements, investigators could expect to better understand the effect of these combined training in breast cancer.</brief_summary>
