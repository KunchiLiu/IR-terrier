	<brief_title>Health Effects of Mentoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants are randomly assigned to either being a mentor or a wait list control. These participants are drawn from a population of undergraduate students. Participants are also randomly assigned to either being a mentee or a wait list control. These participants are drawn from a population of Chicago Public School children. In total, there will be 30 mentors, 30 control mentors, 30 mentees, and 30 control mentees. Participants will come for a laboratory visit in which cardiovascular health measures will be taken (details below). Visits will occur once at baseline (before the intervention starts), and once post-intervention. The protocol will be the same at the two study visits. Participants in the intervention group will engage in one-on-one mentoring sessions (between mentors and mentees) once a week after school for the school year</detailed_description>
