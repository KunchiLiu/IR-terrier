	<brief_summary>Atopic Dermatitis is a chronic relapsing eczematous skin disease with increasing prevalence. Complementary and alternative medical approaches have been employed to relieve symptoms of Atopic Dermatitis. We aim to establish basic clinical efficacy and safety data for Jaungo in patients with Atopic Dermatitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy, Safety and Dose Finding Trial of Topical Jaungo Application in Atopic Dermatitis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre trial with three parallel arms (trial group 1, trial group 2, and control group). The diagnosis of Atopic Dermatitis will be made according to the criteria of Hanifin and Rajka. Participants will receive Jaungo or a placebo-drug for three weeks. Participants in trial group 1 will apply Jaungo and placebo to the lesion once a day for three weeks. Participants in trial group 2 will apply Jaungo to the lesion twice a day for three weeks. Participants in control group will apply placebo to the lesion twice a day for three weeks. Each participant will be examined for EASI (Eczema area and severity index), SCORAD (SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis), TEWL (Transepidermal water loss) and DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) before and after applying medication. The outcomes to evaluate the maintenance of safety are Draize score, blood test and expert's opinion.</detailed_description>
