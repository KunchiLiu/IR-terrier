	<brief_summary>The investigators performed a randomized, prospective study method on observation of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) combined with chemotherapy maintenance to prolong the efficacy of long-term survival of advanced non small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) patients.The investigators plan to involve 100 cases for observation in 3 years (50 cases for chemotherapy maintenance, 50 cases for chemotherapy maintenance plus TCM), expecting that integrated TCM combined with chemotherapy maintenance has a better efficacy on prolonging progression-free survival time, overall survival, improving quality of life(QOL) of patients than that of chemotherapy maintenance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study of Chinese Medicine Plus Chemotherapy Maintenance in Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Maintenance therapy refers to systemic therapy that may be given for patients with advanced NSCLC after 4 to 6 cycles of first-line chemotherapy. However, patients are only candidates for maintenance therapy if they have responded to their previous treatment or have stable disease and their tumors have not progressed. Pemetrexed, docetaxel and gemcitabine have been approved for chemotherapy maintenance in the NCCN Guide. Chemotherapy maintenance can be partly extend patient's TTP, but the toxicity and the side effects of chemotherapy will decrease the QOL, and even lose the opportunity to receive subsequent therapy. Besides, high cost of chemotherapy will cause greater economic pressure on patients. Our preliminary studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can prolong survival time and improve QOL, but high-level evidences are needed. The investigators perform a multicenter, randomized, double-blind controlled, prospective study in advanced non small cell lung cancer patients with stage Ⅲ～Ⅳ.Advanced NSCLC patients after first-line chemotherapy will choose maintenance therapy according to the patient's wishes, including targeted therapy maintenance, chemotherapy maintenance and maintenance of TCM therapy. Patients who choose chemotherapy maintenance are randomized over observational group (TCM granules plus chemotherapy maintenance),and control group (TCM placebo plus chemotherapy maintenance). The treatment should be continued until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, and after that regular follow-up will be arranged. The primary efficacy assessments are: PFS (progression-free survival）; Secondary efficacy assessments are: (1) OS(overall survival); (2) Objective response rate; (3) TTP（Time-to-Progression）; (4) QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer therapy-lung, FACT-L4.0 scales;Lung Cancer Symptom Scale,LCSS); (5)other efficacy assessments are: 1) TCM symptoms changes; 2) Toxicity, side effects and security of the treatments will be assessed at the same time.The investigators expect that integrated TCM combined with chemotherapy maintenance has a better efficacy on prolonging progression-free survival time, overall survival, improving QOL of patients than that of chemotherapy maintenance. Therefore our study can provide evidences for optimizing and promoting integrated TCM combined with Western Medicine treatment.</detailed_description>
