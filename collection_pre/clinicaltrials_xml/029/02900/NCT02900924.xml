	<brief_title>Observational Study to Evaluate the BioMimics 3D Stent System: MIMICS-3D</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MIMICS-3D study is a prospective, multicentre, observational study of the BioMimics 3D Stent System in patients undergoing endovascular intervention to relieve symptomatic peripheral arterial disease of the femoropopliteal artery. The study is designed to enable the collection, analysis and reporting of data from "real-world" use of the BioMimics 3D Stent System used in accordance with the Instructions for Use (IFU) associated with the product's CE Mark approval. Data collection will include that relating to safety, effectiveness and device performance and the period of observation during which data will be collected will extend from the index procedure through 3 years (36 months), according to the standard follow-up practice of the enrolling institution.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient is age ≥18 and ≤85 years at date of consent. Patient has provided written informed consent for participation in the study prior to index procedure. Patient has documented symptomatic peripheral arterial disease scheduled for treatment with the BioMimics 3D stent in accordance with the approved CE Mark indication and Instructions for Use (IFU) Patients whose lesions cannot be crossed with a wire and/or balloon catheter and cannot be dilated sufficiently to allow passage of the delivery system. Patients with a history of intolerance or adverse reaction to antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapies, bleeding diathesis, severe hypertension or renal failure. Patients with known hypersensitivity to nickeltitanium. Patient has a comorbidity that in the Investigator's opinion would limit life expectancy to less than 12 months. Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding. Patient is unable or is unwilling to comply with site standard of care procedures and followup visit schedules for patients undergoing femoropopliteal intervention.</criteria>
