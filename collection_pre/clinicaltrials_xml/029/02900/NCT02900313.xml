	<brief_summary>Cardiac surgery associated acute kidney injury is an independant factor of morbidity and mortality . Despite its delayed elavation, serum creatinine (Cr) remains the goal standard to diagnose AKI. Hyperphosphatemia is well-know in case of AKI because of its excretion decrease. Moreover, serum phosphorus (Ph) is daily measure d after cardiac surgery since its variation may lead to cardiac dysfunction. In case of AKI, Ph may reflect the decrease of renal function in this context. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the predictibilty of Ph to detect both AKI induction and in a second time, renal recovery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serum Phosphatemia Predictibility for AKI Diagnosis After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is a one-year prospective diagnostic validation study included all patients &gt; 18 years-odl admitted in our center after cardiac surgery. AKI is define according to KDIGO criteria and classified in the groups of severity according to the Cr elevation and the need of renal replacement therapy. Serum Cr and Ph are measured at baselin before surgery , at ICU admission, every 12 hours until ICU discharge and every 24 hours until hospital discharge. To evaluate the predictability of Of Ph to diagnose AKI, the postoperative Ph percentage of maximal elevation (%EPh) will be calculated. Then the diagnostic performance of %EPh wil be assessed by calculating the areau under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) to determine an optimal threshold with sensibility, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value.</detailed_description>
