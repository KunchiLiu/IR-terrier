	<detailed_description>This study will correlate MA-abstinence outcomes from an 8-week program of voucher-based incentives using an escalating schedule for 30 treatment-seeking, MA-dependent individuals with scores on tasks of working memory and assessments of neuropsychological and demographic status. At the beginning and end of the CM program, participants will participate in MRI scans while performing a working memory task and will complete a battery of select neurocognitive and psychological assays to address two specific aims: (1) to determine whether changes in neural function within frontostriatal circuitry from baseline to end of the 8-week CM program are associated with parallel changes in measures of cognitive control and impulsivity and with MA abstinence outcomes and (2) to determine whether structural changes in frontostriatal circuitry over the 8-week CM intervention correspond with neurocognitive, psychological and MA abstinence measures.</detailed_description>
