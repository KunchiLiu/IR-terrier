	<detailed_description>Social insecurity is a significant cost in human terms (health and societal), it defines evil and can be identified as difficulties accessing health and especially water. We chose to take stock of these populations defined by difficulties accessing water as precarious setting. Subjects homeless population fall into this by accident of life, a life "homeless" or migrant subjects often illegally having only transitory access (associative or charitable structures host) the conditions precarious sanitation including drinking water or toilet. Populations of slums in the same conditions or the presence rationed water (one tap for 150 people) restricts hygiene. The sampling system as part of a consultation in routine care (will be in DBS (blotter) only alternative to invasive venous sample and requiring heavier care facility. The capillary sampling on filter will also detect a marker of malnutrition . Thus in live in large social precariousness adult this study should show which interventions in public health and management proposals are most appropriate for this population.</detailed_description>
