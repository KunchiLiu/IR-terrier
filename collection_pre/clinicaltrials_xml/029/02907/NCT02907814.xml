	<brief_summary>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is routinely used in ophthalmic clinical practice. It uses infrared light to image patient's eyes. Some patients, such as those with an inflammatory disease called uveitis or those who have just undergone cataract surgery, have intraocular inflammation. This intraocular inflammation commonly manifests as cells that can be seen on routine microscopic clinical examination. However, the only currently available method to quantify this intraocular inflammation is by manually counting on the microscopic clinical examination. The investigators plan to use the OCT machine to image patient's eyes. The investigators will then use the images obtained from the OCT to objectively quantify the degree of intraocular inflammation.</brief_summary>
