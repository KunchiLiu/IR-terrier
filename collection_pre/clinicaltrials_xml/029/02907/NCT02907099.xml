	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab and BL-8040 in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: Each cycle is 21 days (3 weeks). If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, on Days 1-5 and 8-12 of Cycle 1, you will receive BL-8040 as an injection under the skin. After Cycle 1, you will receive BL-0840 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each cycle. You will not receive BL-08040 during Days 15-21. On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond, you will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes. You will not receive pembrolizumab during Cycle 1. You will be given standard drugs (such as hydrocortisone and diphenhydramine) to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. Length of Treatment: You may receive pembrolizumab and BL-8040 for about 1 year. You will no longer be able to receive treatment if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Study Visits: On Days 1 and 8 of each cycle: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Before each dose of BL-8040, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. One (1) time during Week 4 and every 3 weeks after that: - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests. - During Weeks 1, 4, and 7 blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker and tumor marker testing. During Week 7, you will have a tumor biopsy to learn if the study drug has had any affect on the disease. The study doctor will discuss with you what type of biopsy you will have. Every 9 weeks, you will have an MRI or CT scan. End-of-Treatment Visit: Within 1 week after your last dose of study drugs: - You will have a physical exam. vYou will have a CT or MRI to check the status of the disease. - Blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, tumor marker, and biomarker testing. Follow-Up Visits: About 30 days after the last dose of study drugs, you will be called by a member of the study staff to ask how you are doing and if you have had any side effects. This call should last about 5-10 minutes. About every 10 weeks after your last dose of study drugs, you will have a CT scan or MRI and a physical exam. This will continue unless the disease gets worse or you start a new anti-cancer treatment. Every 12 weeks, you will be called by a member of the study staff to ask how you are doing. Each call should last about 5-10 minutes. You will continue to have these calls unless you withdraw from the study or the study ends, whichever happens first. This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of melanoma and lung cancer; however, it is not FDA approved for pancreatic cancer. BL-8040 is not FDA approved or commercially available for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 15 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion from a metastatic site. Newlyobtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects for whom newlyobtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from Merck. The specimen must be from a biopsy site that would be accessible for at least one subsequent biopsy after initiation on the trial. 7.
