	<brief_title>Effect of Intra-operative Glove-changing During Cesarean Section on Post-op Complications: A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a randomized, single-blind controlled trial of women who underwent cesarean section at Healthpartners Regions Hospital. Potential participants were identified during routine obstetrical care of singleton pregnancies at Regions Hospital, at the time that cesarean section was decided as the route of delivery by patient and provider. Patients were excluded if the cesarean section was performed emergently. Randomization occurred in the operating room during preparation for cesarean section; nursing staff drew a computer generated allocation card from a stack placed within an envelope in the room. Patients assigned to the control group underwent cesarean section with standard surgical technique at the discretion of the attending surgeon. Patients assigned to the glove change group underwent cesarean section in which the surgical team - surgeon, assistant, and scrub nurse - replaced their outer surgical gloves with a new sterile pair of gloves prior to abdominal closure. Abdominal closure was considered to begin with closure of the peritoneum, if performed, otherwise with closure of the abdominal fascia.</detailed_description>
