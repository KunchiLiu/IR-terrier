	<brief_summary>Regional analgesia via caudal neuraxial blockade provides pain relief for pediatric patients following urological and lower extremity procedures. The injection of local anesthetic into the caudal epidural space causes a sensory loss. This sympathetic blockade in turn causes a vasodilation, or increased blood flow, to the lower extremities. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the FLIR ONE thermographic camera, a smartphone attachment which utilizes an application ("app") to measure the temperature at a site on an image of the lower extremity, will be able to differentiate between caudal, non-caudal, and failed caudal images.</brief_summary>
