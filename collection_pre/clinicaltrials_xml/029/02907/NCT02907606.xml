	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of urinary ctDNA detection and dynamic monitoring during treatment of NSCLC patients prospectively,by collecting and detecting tumor tissues, peripheral blood samples and urine samples of NSCLC patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Urinary Circulating Tumor DNA Detection in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: a Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liquid biopsy, specifically through the assessment of circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA) from peripheral blood, has shown great promise in lung cancer diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. Urinary samples are completely non-invasive and easily obtainable compared to blood and tissue extraction. To date, only a limited number of published studies have examined the feasibility of ctDNA detection from urine. This study will collect tumor tissues, pretreatment peripheral blood samples and urine samples from different TNM stages of NSCLC patients, and detect EGFR gene mutations in paired samples.</detailed_description>
