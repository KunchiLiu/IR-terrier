	<brief_summary>A 16-week single-blind, split-face, randomized study. Each patient served as their own control, receiving onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA randomized to either the left or right side of the face. Patients received intradermal BTXA injections at week 0 and intramuscular BTXA injections at week 2. The objective is to examine the effectiveness of intradermal botulinum toxin type A (BTXA) injection in improving skin texture and midface lift while reducing pore size and sebum production, as well as investigate the differences in effectiveness between onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA using intradermal and intramuscular injection methods.</brief_summary>
