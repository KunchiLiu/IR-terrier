	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of spironolactone on liver fibrosis progression and portal hypertension in patients with compensated cirrhosis. The patients were nonrandomized according to the medical conditions determined by the physicians, in 3 arms (spironolactone start from 40mg once daily and increase every week with a maximum dose as 100mg once daily, carvedilol start from 6.25mg once daily and increase to 12.5mg once daily in next week if being tolerated, spironolactone in combination with carvedilol: spironolactone is added when carvedilol has reached the most tolerated dose). Portal pressure gradient by virtual hepatic venous pressure gradients based on enhanced CT, and liver elasticity by Fibroscan Medical Device are documented at baseline level and every six months after the treatment. Changes in serum fibrosis markers and liver function are monitored before and every 3 months after the treatment.</brief_summary>
