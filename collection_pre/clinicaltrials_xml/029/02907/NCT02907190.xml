	<brief_title>Glycemic and Insulinemic Impact of Selected Canadian Beans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order for a food to be able to claim a reduced glycemic response, it must be shown that a typical serving of the food elicits a significantly lower blood glucose responses compared to a serving of an appropriate control food. While many studies have examined the GI of beans, few studies have compared the glycemic impact of a typical serving of beans to a typical serving of other starchy foods. Therefore, there are insufficient data to allow for a claim that beans have a low glycemic response. In addition, in order to make a claim of a reduced glycemic response, regulatory agencies also require that the insulinemic response to a food is not disproportionately increased.</detailed_description>
