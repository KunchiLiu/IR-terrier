	<brief_summary>Current medications have only a limited effect on two core symptoms of schizophrenia, negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. Minocycline is a second-generation tetracycline which has a beneficial effect in various neurological disorders. In the past years, various findings from clinical studies showed its potential role for the treatment of these symptoms of schizophrenia. The current study aims to examine the efficacy of minocycline as add-on treatment for alleviating positive, negative and cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia patients.The current study is a single center, double-blind, randomized study that assess the adjuvant therapeutic effect of minocycline vs. placebo added to antipsychotic medications, in adult patients suffering from schizophrenia. Patients will be recruited and randomly allocated to a minocycline or placebo treatment (200 mg/day) for 6 weeks of treatment. In addition, all patients will receive probiotics (450mg/day) in order to prevent any gastrointestinal influences of antibiotics administration. Positive and negative symptoms , as well as cognitive functions will be assessed before and after treatment.</brief_summary>
