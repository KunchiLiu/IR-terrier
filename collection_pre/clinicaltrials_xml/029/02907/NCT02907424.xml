	<brief_summary>In order to make Cambodia independent from importing a product for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, UNICEF, DFPTQ Fisheries Administration and IRD have started a collaboration for the development of a range of products for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition. To reduce costs of the product, and to adapt the taste to local circumstances, the protein source of the usual RUTF (milk powder) has been changed to fish (Trey Riel). The main objective of this sub-study is to test the efficacy of the newly developed RUTF on the recovery of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition. As comparison, the current treatment of SAM with BP-100 will be used.</brief_summary>
