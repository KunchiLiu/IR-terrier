	<brief_summary>A prolonged stay in intensive care unit (ICU) after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass increases not only cost of patient care but also morbidity and mortality of patients. The ability to predict which patient has the tendency to have a prolonged ICU stay would help in patient and resource management of the hospital. There are many predictive models aiming at identifying patient at risk of prolonged ICU stay after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass but almost all involve the preoperative assessment for proper resource management with one model, Open-Heart Intraoperative Risk (OHIR) Scoring concerning intraoperative manipulatable risk factors to improve anesthetic care and patient outcome. The OHIR model comprises 6 risk factors, 5 of which can be managed intraoperatively, with total score of 7 and a score of â‰¥ 3 indicating a likely prolonged ICU stay. The objective of this study was to re-validate the performance of OHIR score in the recent context.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of OHIR Score to Predict a Prolonged Intensive Care Unit Stay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a retrospective, observational, analytical study. The study protocol was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee, Khon Kaen University (HE581287). The investigators will review all eligible medical records at Srinagarind Hospital and Queen Sirikit Heart Center of the Northeast, Khon Kaen University during January 2013 and December 2014. The extracted data consist of patient's clinical data and all risk factors in the OHIR score. The investigators will apply the OHIR scoring to the data to assess its performance. The investigators will use the same criteria for a prolonged ICU stay as in the previous study, i.e. a stay longer that the median.</detailed_description>
