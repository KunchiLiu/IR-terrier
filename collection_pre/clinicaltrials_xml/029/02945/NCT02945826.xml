	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the applicability of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) / MRI molecular imaging of glioblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>uPAR-PET/MRI in Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>68Ga-NOTA-AE105 is a radioligand targeting urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), which is a promising imaging biomarker of tumor aggressiveness. 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 PET/MRI will be applied in patients suspected of glioblastoma multiforme. The uptake of the radioligand 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 will be compared and correlated with expression of the molecular target: uPAR using immunohistochemistry of tumor tissue samples obtained during routine stereotactic biopsies or operation. In addition, the semiquantitative uptake (standard uptake values, SUVs) of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 in tumor tissue will be correlated with overall survival and progression free survival</detailed_description>
