	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn what women of childbearing age think of Long Acting Reversible Contraception. A variety of myths regarding LARCs have been described in the literature. This study is designed to asses women's cultural belief's regarding LARCs. Investigators are looking to collect information from women in general, rather than solely who are seeking contraception. Investigators will be recruiting women ages 18-45 years from seven family health centers affiliated with UPMC. Participants will be asked to a attend a 60-90 minutes focus group session. During the session the facilitator will try to engage participants in a discussion about contraception in general. They will also be asked to complete a short demographic survey of 8-12 questions. Data from focus groups will be assessed for recurring themes which will be used to create a cultural survey instrument that will be used in the second phase of the study.</brief_summary>
