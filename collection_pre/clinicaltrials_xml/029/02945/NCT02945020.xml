	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of steady-state concentrations of odalasvir (ODV), as a single agent or in combination with simeprevir (SMV), on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of dabigatran etexilate in healthy participants.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participant must have a body mass index (BMI: weight in kilogram [kg] divided by the square of height in meters) of 18.0 to 32.0 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2), extremes included, and a body weight not less than 50.0 kg Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. If there are abnormalities, the participant may be included only if the Investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the Investigator Participant must have a blood pressure (after the participant is supine for 5 minutes) between 90 and 140 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90 mmHg diastolic. If blood pressure is out of range, up to 2 repeated assessments are permitted Female participant, except if postmenopausal, must have a negative highly sensitive serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin at screening Participant must be nonsmoker for at least 6 months prior to the first study drug administration Participant has a history of liver or renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance below 90 milliliter per minute (mL/min) calculated using the CockcroftGault formula or below 90 mL/min/1.73 square meter (m^2) for estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation [CKDEPI]), significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal (such as significant diarrhea, gastric stasis, or constipation that in the investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or bioavailability), endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, neoplastic, or metabolic disturbances Participant has any condition for which, in the opinion of the Investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the particiapant (eg, compromise the wellbeing) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocolspecified assessments Participant with any history of clinically significant skin disease such as, but not limited to, dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, psoriasis, food allergy, or urticaria Participant has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to odalasvir (ODV), simeprevir (SMV) or dabigatran etexilate mesylate or their excipients Participant has a history of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody (antiHCV) positive, or other clinically active liver disease, or tests positive for HBsAg or antiHCV at screening</criteria>
