	<brief_summary>The use of esophageal balloon catheter to estimate pleural pressure has gained renewed popularity in recent years. Indeed, measurement of transpulmonary pressure may allow a more pathophysiological-based approach to ventilator strategy in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. Nevertheless, it is well known that esophageal balloon catheter derived parameters can be influenced by several patient-related or technical-related factors. During a PEEP trial, the investigators will observe in-vivo the esophageal pressure and derived measurements obtained using different esophageal balloon calibration volumes.</brief_summary>
