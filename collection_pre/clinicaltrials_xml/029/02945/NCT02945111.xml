	<brief_title>Watching Live VIA/VILI Examinations on a Digital Screen May Reduce Patients' Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study took place in the District of Dschang, Cameroon. Women aged between 30 and 49 years, addressed to undergo a pelvic examination with VIA and VILI, were invited to participate. Throughout the examination, one part of the women underwent the routine VIA/VILI, with no visual support (control group), whereas the other part of patients were shown the pictures of the cervix in real-time on a digital screen (study group). At the end of the procedure, all women had the possibility to see the pictures retrospectively. Randomization determined the women's distribution between the two groups. Their anxiety level was measured by asking them to complete the Spielberg's State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) both prior to and immediately after the procedure.</detailed_description>
