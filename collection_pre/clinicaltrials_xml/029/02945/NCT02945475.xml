	<brief_title>Neural Mechanisms for Appetitive Responses to High Reward Foods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Animal studies have shown that fructose may act centrally to promote food intake. Compared to glucose, fructose may also be a weak suppressor of appetite due to attenuated stimulation of the purported satiety hormones, insulin and glucagon-like polypeptide-1 (GLP-1). Moreover, fructose is sweeter than glucose and may stimulate central taste and reward pathways to promote feeding behavior. The investigators have combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with hormonal and behavioral assessments to better understand the impacts of glucose and fructose on appetite and its central regulation in humans and have made important observations in lean individuals linking fructose consumption to overeating and obesity. The ingestion of fructose: (a) reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), a marker of neuronal activity, in the hypothalamus less than ingestion of glucose; (b) stimulated levels of two potential satiety hormones, insulin and GLP-1, less than glucose; and (c) failed to induce the satiety that was observed after glucose ingestion (Page et al, Journal of American Medical Association 2013). The investigators now propose to expand this work by examining some potential biological underpinnings of the different impacts of glucose and fructose ingestion; examining responses to combinations of glucose and fructose ingested together, as occurs in real life; and by examining effects of a common non-nutritive sweetener, sucralose, on brain and appetitive response. The investigators propose a random-order crossover design to determine the effects of caloric and non-nutritive sweeteners among lean, obese, and obesity-prone groups of participants. The investigators will measure body fat, circulating levels of hormones involved in satiety signaling, quantify food intake, and measure brain activity using blood-oxygen level dependent and arterial spin labeling methods and functional connectivity analyses.</detailed_description>
