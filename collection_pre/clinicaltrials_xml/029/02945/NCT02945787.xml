	<brief_summary>Results of a recently completed National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded trial of an intervention, Forever Free: Stop Smoking for Good, revealed high efficacy throughout the 24- month follow-up period, further supporting the utility of extended self-help for promoting and maintaining tobacco abstinence. Investigators have recognized that wide-scale implementation, and therefore public health impact, would be enhanced by the availability of a Spanish-language version to reach the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority population of smokers. The goal of this study is to address this gap by testing a Spanish-language version of the validated self-help smoking cessation intervention. If demonstrated effective, the proposed intervention would represent an easily disseminable and low-cost intervention with significant public health impact for Hispanic/Latino smokers throughout the United States. The aims of this project are to test the efficacy of a Spanish-language version of a validated, extended self-help intervention for smoking cessation among Spanish-speaking smokers against usual care control. Participants (N = 1240) recruited nationally will be randomized to the two arms.</brief_summary>
