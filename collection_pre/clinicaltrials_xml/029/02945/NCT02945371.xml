	<brief_summary>Insufficient inhibitory control is one pathway through which early adversity is related to a range of problems including excessive alcohol use, tobacco use, and unhealthy eating. The proposed research leverages a neurally informed model of inhibitory control and how it can be improved to test the efficacy of a person-centered inhibitory control intervention in a sample of mid-life individuals with early adversity. The knowledge obtained by this study could be scaled into a flexible, low-cost, and wide-ranging intervention to remediate some of the effects of early adversity on inhibitory control and thus a number of prevalent health risking behaviors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tailored Inhibitory Control Training to Reverse EA-linked Deficits in Mid-life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early adversity (EA) in humans is a major contributing factor to a range of deleterious physical and mental health outcomes extending through adulthood such as depression and anxiety, obesity and heart disease, and premature death. In addition to detracting significantly from individual well being and quality of life, these conditions also consume considerable resources from federal, state, and community organizations. The mechanisms through which EA exerts its effects on these outcomes are increasingly well understood, and include neurocognitive pathways related to executive function. An intervention that can successfully target, engage with, and alter the functioning of one or more of these mechanisms would be a promising way of mitigating the impact of EA on deleterious outcomes later in life. The proposed research focuses on one such pathway—deficits in inhibitory control (IC)—and tests the feasibility and efficacy of an intervention to increase functioning in that pathway in a sample of individuals who experienced EA. The intervention is grounded in a neurally informed model of change that specifies deficits in IC as an underlying causal factor common to several health-risking behaviors (HRBs). These IC deficits emerge during development as a result of a range of EA, and, critically, can be remediated in mid-life through targeted intervention. Research from our laboratory has validated an intervention that can increase IC performance and alter its underlying neural systems in young adults (Berkman, Kahn, &amp; Merchant, 2014). The next step in this program of research, proposed here, is to test the efficacy of that intervention in a sample of mid-life individuals who have experienced EA and the extent to which our intervention generalizes to HRBs that are prevalent in that sample. The first Aim is to test whether the intervention alters the IC system in tasks both similar to and dissimilar from the training task in terms of both behavioral performance and neural functioning. The second Aim is to test whether alterations in the functioning of the underlying neural systems mediate the effect of the intervention on performance and disinhibition-related HRBs. The two Aims will be accomplished within the context of a single randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two arms (IC training vs. active control) and pre-post measurements of IC performance, IC neural systems, and HRBs. All participants (N = 110) come to the lab for an initial assessment of behavioral / neural measures of IC and HRBs, among other measures. Then, participants are randomly assigned to receive a Person-Centered Inhibitory Control (PeCIC) training or active control training, every other day for 3-4 weeks. The PeCIC systematically pairs IC engagement with alcohol, tobacco, and/or energy-dense food cues, depending on each participant's reports of disinhibited behavior in those domains. The active control task uses personalized cues and response time tasks but does not involve IC. Finally, participants return to the laboratory for an endpoint assessment where all baseline measures are repeated. The two Aims will be robustly tested in a series of analyses comparing the behavioral and neural change from pre- to postintervention between the groups.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 3555 Experience of early adversity (EA) before age 18 (EA is be defined as a score of 4 or higher on the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) questionnaire [Felitti, Anda, Nordenberg, Williamson, Spitz, Edwards, et al., 1998]) IC difficulties such as disinhibited alcohol use, tobacco use, or food intake during adulthood. IC difficulties will be selfreported based on questions from the selfcontrol questionnaire (Tangney, Baumeister, &amp; Boone, 2004) modified to be specific to alcohol, tobacco, and energydense food intake (e.g., "I am selfindulgent with unhealthy food at times", "I refuse alcohol when offered") using a 4point Likertstyle scale. Individuals over age 55 will be excluded because of established functional and structural neural changes that begin to escalate at that time (Good, Johnsrude, Ashburner, Henson, Friston, &amp; Frackowiak, 2001; Grady, Springer, Hongwanishkul, McIntosh, &amp; Winocur, 2006) Given the high rates of morbidity for such disorders among people with high EA, we will not exclude based on past diagnoses for any of those disorders or based on current drug and alcohol use. However, we will exclude individuals who do not pass a urine toxicology screen during either of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions to ensure that the neuroimaging data are as homogeneous and reliable as possible. Participants who cannot undergo an MRI scan will be excluded; contraindications include metal implants (e.g., braces, pins) or metal fragments, pacemakers or other electronic medical implants, claustrophobia, pregnancy, and weight greater than 550 lbs. Beyond these criteria, participants will be recruited without exclusions based on gender, race, or ethnicity, so our sample will reflect the diversity in the local population (Lane County, Oregon) with regard to gender, race, and ethnicity.</criteria>
