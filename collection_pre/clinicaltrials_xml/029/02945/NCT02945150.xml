	<brief_summary>Proof of concept, open-label single center study for the donation of HCV positive kidneys to HCV negative patients, with preemptive, interventional treatment to prevent HCV transmission upon transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preemptive Treatment With Grazoprevir and Elbasvir for Donor HCV Positive to Recipient HCV Negative Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study objective is to determine if the administration of grazoprevir and elbasvir (with or without ribavirin) for 12-16 weeks after kidney transplantation prevents the spread of HCV infection from a donor kidney with known HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection to a HCV negative recipient as evidenced by a negative HCV viral RNA at 12 weeks post treatment</detailed_description>
