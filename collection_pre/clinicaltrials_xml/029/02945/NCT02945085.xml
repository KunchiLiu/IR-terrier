	<brief_summary>This study addresses how to achieve better outcomes for cognitively vulnerable community-dwelling older adults and their families. Cognitive vulnerability means living with dementia, depression, and/or a recent episode of delirium (the 3Ds). The investigators will test the effectiveness of a team care model focused on the 3Ds (Home Based Care Team) guided by nurse practitioners with expertise in geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry. Specific aims are to determine Home Based Care Team effects on hospitalization or emergency department use, and other outcomes including depression, disability, and quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3D Team Care for Cognitively Vulnerable Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study addresses how to achieve better outcomes for cognitively vulnerable community-dwelling older adults and their families. Cognitive vulnerability means living with dementia, depression, and/or a recent episode of delirium (the 3Ds). Cognitive vulnerability in older adults is often overlooked by primary care and hospital-based providers, and represents a marker for overall vulnerability or frailty often missed when disease-specific approaches are emphasized in the care for older adults. Such patients often cannot adequately self-manage their comorbidities. Many studies of older adults and their families have demonstrated the great burden of living with cognitive vulnerability. The investigators will test the effectiveness of a team care model focused on the 3Ds (Home Based Care Team) guided by nurse practitioners with geriatrics expertise. Other team member disciplines will include pharmacy, social work, occupational and physical therapy, nutrition, and community health worker. Long-term objectives are to determine whether this care model can become a widely available approach for improving healthcare systems for older adults with cognitive vulnerability and their families, while improving outcomes of importance to these patients and families. A project Steering Committee, including cognitively vulnerable patients and family caregivers, will provide extensive input into many aspects of the research process.</detailed_description>
