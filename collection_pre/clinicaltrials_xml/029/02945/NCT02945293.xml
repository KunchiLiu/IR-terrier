	<detailed_description>Potential participants complete a phone screen. If still found eligible, the participant comes in for 1 screening visit (3 hours long). Cognitive/problem solving tests, computerized tasks, CPT, and questionnaires are given. A blood draw is done to determine eligibility. If the participant is still eligible, he/she comes back for 1 full study day visit (9-10 hours long). A testing battery (very similar to the one done during the screening visit) is done in the morning. Study medication is then administered, and additional testing batteries are done throughout the day. Blood draws, vital signs, and pupil measurements are taken throughout the day. A follow-up phone call is completed within a few days of the full study day visit, during which a questionnaire is given.</detailed_description>
