	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how often breast cancer recurs (returns after treatment) in the breast in patients who have been treated with chemotherapy and have had follow-up radiation therapy (but not surgery) and are in complete remission (no evidence of disease).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Length of Study: You will receive radiation therapy for as long as your doctor thinks it is in your best interest. Your participation on this study will be over after the follow-up period (5 years after you complete radiation therapy). Study Visits: At any point after you have completed chemotherapy and before you begin radiation therapy, you will have an image-guided biopsy of the breast to test for evidence of disease. To perform an image-guided biopsy, a needle is inserted into the affected area using imaging such as CT, ultrasound, MRI or mammography to collect cells or tissue from an organ, lymph node, or suspected tumor mass. The doctor will use the imaging to guide the needle into the area. The sample collected will be a core biopsy that collects a small piece of tissue. If the biopsy shows evidence of the disease, you will be scheduled for standard of care surgery and will still receive radiation therapy and remain on this study. You would sign a separate consent form for the surgery. Within 12 weeks after you have completed chemotherapy, you will have radiation therapy to your breast. The doctor will discuss the dose amount and length of the radiation therapy period with you. During radiation therapy, you will have weekly visits with your doctor. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check for circulating tumor cells (CTCs) before your first radiation therapy visit, and at 6 months and 1 year after you complete radiation therapy. CTC testing checks how many tumor cells are in your blood. You will be asked to complete 3 questionnaires about your quality of life and symptoms when you first agree to take part in this study, and again at 6 months, 1, 3, and 5 years after your post-chemotherapy biopsy. The questionnaires can be completed by mail, email, or during a phone call. The questionnaires should take about 15 minutes to complete each time. Follow-Up: Every 6 months for 5 years after you finish radiation therapy, you will have a physical exam and mammogram. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an MRI instead of a mammogram at every other 6-month visit. This is an investigational study. Radiation therapy is delivered using FDA-approved and commercially available methods. The study doctor can explain how radiation therapy is designed to work. About 50 participants will be enrolled on this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Pathologically confirmed unicentric invasive breast cancer defined as radiologic clinical stage T1 or T2 (&lt;/= 5 cm), N0 or N1 (&lt;/= 4 abnormal axillary nodes on initial ultrasound), clinical stage M0. 2. HER2 positive (IHC 3+ and or FISH amplified) or triple receptor negative (TN, ER/PR &lt; 10% HER2 negative (IHC 1+ or 2+ FISH nonamplified) receiving any standard routine clinical NST regimen. 3. Patient desires breast conserving therapy. 4. Age 40 years or older. This age cutoff is justified because breast cancers in women under the age of 40 are known to have a significantly higher risk of IBTR presumably due to underlying biologic differences. 5. Female sex. 6. If the patient has a history of a prior nonbreast cancer, all treatment for this cancer must have been completed prior to study registration and the patient must have no evidence of disease for this prior nonbreast cancer. 7. Patient must have an initial nodal ultrasound that does not demonstrate more than four suspicious lymph nodes, any suspicious lymph nodes should be biopsied to determine if nodal metastatic disease present. 1. Clinical evidence for a stage T3 or T4 breast cancer. 2. Clinical or pathologic evidence for distant metastases. 3. Prior diagnosis of invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ breast cancer in the ipsilateral breast. 4. Clinical evidence of progression of disease &gt; 20% in the breast or new evidence of nodal metastases. 5. Patient is known to be pregnant. 6. Patient is participating in a NST protocol in which surgical excision of the breast and or lymph nodes are required.</criteria>
