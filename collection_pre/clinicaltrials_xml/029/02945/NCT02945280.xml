	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of a drug called apixaban for the treatment of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) and clinically important bleeding. Subjects will receive apixaban 10 mg by mouth twice a day for 7 days, followed by 5 mg by mouth twice a day for a duration of 11 weeks. There will be a followup visit at 12 weeks for all participants. A total of 375 are to be enrolled. The study drug has been approved to treat blood clots. The study drug has not been studied uniquely for the treatment of blood clots in the upper extremity however. Because it is unknown whether it is effective to treat blood clots in the upper extremity, the principal investigator cannot guarantee that there will be benefit to study subjects; however, it is hoped that the information obtained from this research study will help treat patients in the future.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apixaban for Routine Management of Upper Extremity Deep Venous Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) constitutes approximately 10% of all DVT. A recent increase in incidence is largely secondary to the increasing use of peripherally inserted central venous catheters. Treatment for UEDVT is derived from evidence for treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (LEDVT). No evidence exists for the use of a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for the treatment of UEDVT. Population: Sequential patients identified within the Intermountain Healthcare system and University of Utah Healthcare system with UEDVT defined as the formation of thrombus within the internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, and brachial veins of the arm demonstrated by imaging. Intervention: Apixaban 10 mg PO twice daily for 7 days followed by apixaban 5 mg twice daily for 11 weeks. Comparison: In the primary analysis, the principal investigator will report the rate of clinically overt objective VTE and VTE-related death in comparison to the rate reported upon literature review ("reference value in the literature"). If the confidence interval for this rate excludes the commonly accepted threshold event rate of 4%, the principal investigator will conclude that treatment with apixaban is noninferior, and therefore a clinically valid approach to treat UEDVT. As a secondary analysis the principal investigator will compare the rate of the primary efficacy outcome and primary safety outcome with a historical control of case matched patients with UEDVT ("historical control") treated with therapy conventional (low molecular weight heparin plus warfarin) prior to the approval of DOACs. Sample Size: A sample size of 357 patients who meet eligibility criteria was chosen so that an exact 95% confidence interval would exclude an event rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the observation cohort of 4%. The principal investigator will add 5% for anticipated withdrawal to assure adequate patient enrollment in the case of patient withdrawal and enroll 375 patients. Outcome: 90 day rate of new or recurrent objectively confirmed symptomatic venous thrombosis and VTE-related death. The primary safety outcome is major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be â‰¥ 18 years of age Have received no more than four (4) doses of any anticoagulant, or intravenous and bridging heparin for longer than 60 hours Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug. Women must not be breastfeeding WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug apixaban plus 5 halflives of study drug apixaban (3 days) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 33 days posttreatment completion. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug apixaban plus 5 halflives of the study drug apixaban (3 days) plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for a total of 93 days posttreatment completion. Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive requirements. However WOCBP must still undergo pregnancy testing as described in this section. Another indication for longterm anticoagulation for which no FDA approval of apixaban exists (e.g. prosthetic heart valves) Life expectancy of less than 6 months Unable to engage in reliable followup as per protocol Participating in a conflicting clinical trial or has participated in a trial within the last 30 days Receiving concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy Requires aspirin dose of greater than 165 mg daily A hemoglobin level of less than 8 mg per deciliter A platelet count of less than 50,000 per cubic millimeter A calculated creatinine clearance of less than 25 mL per minute Alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase level greater than 2 times the upper limit of the normal range A total bilirubin more than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range. Active cancer for which treatment (chemotherapy/radiation therapy) is being delivered, is imminent, or has been delivered within the last 6 months For patients receiving ELIQUIS 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, the dose of ELIQUIS should be decreased by 50% when coadministered with drugs that are strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and Pgp (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, or clarithromycin). For patients receiving ELIQUIS at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministation with strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and Pgp. Intend pregnancy or breastfeeding within the next year Known allergy to apixaban, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban Active pathological bleeding. Any condition that at the discretion of the investigator is thought to prohibit active participation and followup in the trial UEDVT that occurs while therapeutic anticoagulation is being taken by the patient ("event on therapy") The patient has concomitant VTE diagnosed elsewhere (e.g. DVT Of the lower extremity or PE)</criteria>
