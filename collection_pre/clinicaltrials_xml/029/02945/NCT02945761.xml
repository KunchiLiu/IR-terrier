	<brief_summary>Surgeons easily get wound infections. Most wound infections will be cured by applying medicines and changing dressing in very short period of time. But some wounds are severely contaminated combined with fat liquefaction, crateriform ulcer and large undermined lacuna, so changing dressing takes a very long time. In order to better change the dressing, it needs to expose the wound thoroughly, which requires to completely open the healed skin, so the healing will be slowed down. Some scholars lay stress on prevention. Wound infection control concerns prevention--not therapy--of an infrequent but expensive kind of surgical morbidity.(1.2)Some scholars think that the main armamentarium of the attack is the use of topical anti-infectives, which invade the bacteria where they reside, and, consequently, reduce their numbers and promote wound healing.(3)For example, silver is reemerging as a viable treatment option for infections encountered in burns, open wounds, and chronic ulcers. But it is expensive and is difficult to acquire silver-containing dressings. And Recent findings, however, indicate that the compound delays the wound-healing process and that silver may have serious cytotoxic activity on various host cells. (4) As High concentration of sugar solution, honey appears to heal partial thickness burns more quickly than conventional treatment (which included polyurethane film, paraffin gauze, soframycin-impregnated gauze, sterile linen and leaving the burns exposed) and infected post-operative wounds more quickly than antiseptics and gauze.(5)This study involve the use of another high-concentration of sugar solution (HCSS) to lavage infected wounds when changing dressings.</brief_summary>
