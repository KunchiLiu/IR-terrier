	<brief_summary>Intracavernous injection of Wharton jelly Mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Wharton Jelly in Erectile Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted at the Cell Therapy Center (CTC), Jordan, in which fifteen male patients ranging from 25-65 years diagnosed with erectile dysfunction will be selected. This diagnosis is based on medical history, validated questionnaires, physical examinations, laboratory tests and specific diagnostic tests. The patients are followed by clinical assessment, laboratory investigations as well as Doppler ultrasound. The investigators hypothesize that the intracavernous injection of stem cells will facilitate the recovery of erectile function resulting in satisfying clinical outcomes in patients.</detailed_description>

Body Mass Index between 2030. 6. Willing to provide written informed consent, complete questionnaire, and to be available for all baseline treatment and follow up examinations required by protocol. 1. Current urinary tract or bladder infection. 2. Clinical/Laboratory evidence of transmissible diseases. 3. Clinically evident penile anatomical deformities(e.g., Peyronie's disease) or history of priapism. 4. Skin irritation, infection, wound, sore or disruption in the immediate areas of skin entry for penile injection. 5. Current or previous malignancy. 6. Use of any non study treatment for erectile function within 4 weeks of study treatment. 7. Lack of willingness to continue through 6 months after study treatment. 8. Any previous penile implant or penile vascular surgery. 9. Uncontrolled hypertension or hypotension(systolic blood pressure &gt; 170 or &lt; 90 mm Hg, and diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 or &lt; 50 mm Hg). 10. Reported unstable cardiovascular disease (e.g., unstable angina, myocardial infarction within past 6 months, cardiac failure or lifethreatening arrhythmia, congestive heart failure) or symptomatic postural hypotension within 6 months before screening. 11. Bleeding or clotting disorder, use of anticoagulant therapy. 12. Lab values for complete blood count (CBC), prothrombin time (PT)/ partial thromboplastin time (PTT)/ international normalized ratio (INR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatinine falling outside the normal lab values. 13. Systemic autoimmune disorder. 14. Significant active systemic or localized infection. 15. Receiving immunosuppressant medications. 16. Postradical prostatectomy.</criteria>
