	<brief_summary>Traumatic knee injury is common and highly debilitating. Surgical reconstruction/repair improves knee biomechanics and function, but neuromuscular dysfunction persist for years despite rehabilitation, hindering resumption of normal activities, increasing risk of further injury and, in a majority of patients, hastening the development of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Our goal in this research study is to evaluate the utility of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), initiated following injury and maintained through the early post-surgical period, to prevent muscle atrophy and intrinsic contractile dysfunction compared to active control intervention of micro-electrical stimulation.</brief_summary>
