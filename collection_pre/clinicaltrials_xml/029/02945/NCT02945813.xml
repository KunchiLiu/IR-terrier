	<brief_title>PROMET - Trial of Salvage Radiotherapy +/- Metformin for Patients With Prostate Cancer After Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use salvage radiotherapy for biochemical progression after prostatectomy has provided suboptimal results over the years. Metformin has shown anti-cancer and radio-sensitizing properties in several studies, therefore it is a promising drug to improve the treatment results for this important group of patients. In this trial, we aim to assess the role of metformin in decreasing failures (PSA progression) following salvage radiotherapy. For that, patients with PSA progression after surgery will be treated with the standard of care (salvage radiotherapy) plus metformin.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent according to ICH/GCP regulations before registration and prior to any trial specific procedures Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without small cell features Tumor stage pT2a3b, pN0 or cN0, M0, R01 resection margins, according to UICC TNM 2009, Gleason score available Radical prostatectomy (RP) at least 12 weeks before registration PSA progression after RP defined as two consecutive rises with the final PSA &gt; 0.1 ng/mL or three consecutive rises. The first value must be measured earliest 4 weeks after RP PSA ≤ 2 ng/mL within 14 days prior to registration Age ≥ 18 years at time of registration WHO performance status 01 Adequate hepatic function within 14 days prior to registration: bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (exception if Gilbert's syndrome ≤ 3 x ULN), AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Adequate renal function within 14 days prior to registration: calculated corrected creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min, according to the formula of corrected CockcroftGault Patient agrees not to father a child during trial treatment and during 6 months thereafter Persistent PSA (&gt; 0.4 ng/mL) 4 to 20 weeks after RP Pelvic lymph node enlargement &gt; 0.8 cm in short axis diameter (cN positive) assessed by mpMRI within 12 weeks prior to registration, unless the enlarged lymph node is sampled and negative Evidence of macroscopic local recurrence assessed by mpMRI within 12 weeks prior to registration Palpable prostatic fossa mass suggestive of recurrence, unless an ultrasound guided biopsy is negative for malignancy Presence or history of prostate cancer metastases. In case of clinical suspicion (e.g. bone pain), imaging (e.g. bone scan, CholinPET, PSMAPET, whole body MRI) must be performed. The imaging method is at the discretion of the investigator. History of hematologic or primary solid tumor malignancy, unless in remission for at least 3 years from registration with the exception of curatively treated localized nonmelanoma skin cancer Patients on pharmacotherapy for diabetes mellitus Treatment with metformin within the last 3 months prior to registration Prior pelvic radiotherapy Hormonal treatment as bilateral orchiectomy prior or following RP Usage of products known to affect PSA levels within 4 weeks prior to start of trial treatment Bilateral hip prosthesis Severe or active comorbidity likely to impact on the advisability of salvage RT, e.g.: History of inflammatory bowel disease or any malabsorption syndrome or conditions that would interfere with enteral absorption Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the last 6 months Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration Any condition associated with increased risk of lactic acidosis (e.g. alcohol abuse, congestive heart failure NYHA III or IV Clinically significant history of liver disease consistent with ChildPugh Class B or C, including viral or other hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis Severe or uncontrolled kidney disease resulted in impaired kidney function (GFR &lt;60ml/min) Any acute or chronic condition that could cause tissue hypoxia (e.g. cardiac or respiratory insufficiency, recent myocardial infarction, shock) Treatment with any experimental drug or participation within a clinical trial within 30 days prior to registration (exception: concurrent participation in the biobank project SAKK 63/12 is allowed) Any concomitant drug contraindicated for use with metformin according to the approved product information Known hypersensitivity to metformin/placebo or to any of its components Hereditary intolerance to fructose; known galactose1phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency, UDP galactose 4 epimerase deficiency, galactokinase deficiency, FanconiBickel syndrome, congenital lactase deficiency, or glucosegalactose malabsorption (due to the lactosecontaining placebo) Inability or unwillingness to swallow oral medication Any other serious underlying medical, psychiatric, psychological, familial or geographical condition, which in the judgment of the investigator may interfere with the planned staging, treatment and followup, affect patient compliance or place the patient at high risk from treatmentrelated complications</criteria>
