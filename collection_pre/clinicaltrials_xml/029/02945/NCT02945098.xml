	<brief_summary>Sixty volunteers with a mean age of 21,8 Â± 2,6 years participated in this study, randomly distributed into one of the following groups: control, Kinesio taping group with tension in the anterior arm region and Kinesio taping group without tension in the same region. All subjects underwent an eccentric exercise protocol and three evaluations: before the protocol, immediately after and 48h after protocol. The following variables were analyzed: sensation of pain as the primary outcome; peak torque normalized by body weight; average peak torque; total work and average power, using an isokinetic dynamometer. In addition, muscle activation amplitude (Root Mean Square) and median frequency were recorded using surface electromyography.</brief_summary>
