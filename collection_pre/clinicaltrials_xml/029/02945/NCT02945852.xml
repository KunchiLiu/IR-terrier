	<brief_summary>Although fist-line therapy with Cisplatin and etoposide(EP)or Carboplatin and etoposide(CE)and second-line therapy with topotecan has been given, patients with extensive small cell lung cancer(ED-SCLC) still relapse and 2-year survival is less than 10%. There is no standard treatment recommendation for this group of patients who failed to second-line therapy and had good performance status. Apatinib has been approved as a second-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer. Several phase III clinical studies of non small cell lung cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer and other tumors also showed apatinib has less toxic side effects and better patient tolerance. However, the clinical application of apatinib in small cell lung cancer is still lack of evidence-based medicine. And this clinical trial is designed to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in refractory or recurrent ED-SCLC patients in our center.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apatinib for Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer After Second/Third Line Chemotherapy.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive disease characterized by its rapid doubling time, high growth fraction, early development of disseminated disease, and dramatic response to first-line chemotherapy and radiation. Small cell lung cancer accounts for approximately 20%-25% lung cancer patients. SCLC patients are categorized as limited disease, defined as disease that is confined to the ipsilateral hemithorax that can be encompassed within a tolerable radiation port, or extensive disease (ED), defined as the presence of overt metastatic disease determined by imaging or physical examination. Two third of patients are diagnosed with ED at presentation. Despite the development of novel cytotoxic drugs, the therapeutic approach to SCLC has been stagnant for more than twenty years. Standard treatment for ED-SCLC remains EP or CE, a regimen that yield a median survival of approximately 9 months and a 5-year survival of less than 1%.In some guidelines for SCLC, topotecan is recommended as the standard second-line treatment in patients who relapse less than 3 months. As for patients who relapse more than six months after the end of initial treatment, EP or CE regimen is recommended to be used again.There is no standard treatment recommendation for this group of patients who failed to second-line therapy.Apatinib has been approved as a second-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer. Several phase III clinical studies of non small cell lung cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer and other tumors also showed apatinib has less toxic side effects and better patient tolerance.And this clinical trial is designed to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in refractory or recurrent ED-SCLC patients.</detailed_description>
