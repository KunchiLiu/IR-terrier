	<brief_summary>Collectively, evidence shows that a combination of medication and behavioral therapy is most effective for migraine care. The ED is a critical point of contact with the health care system for many migraine patients; in current practice, it is a missed opportunity to initiate and establish a comprehensive migraine management paradigm. Behavioral headache treatments (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)) are effective migraine treatment options that are essentially free of side effects. PMR has also been successful as a technique that patients can do independently. Studies have shown that combination pharmacological-behavioral therapy is most effective for migraine treatment. Several aspects of this study are innovative, including: 1. Initiation of preventive medication in a timely manner for migraineurs who present to the ED. 2. Introduction of PM+PMR in the ED at a time that can serve as a teachable moment. 3. Introduction of a smartphone application-based product (a minimal contact based behavioral therapy) in the ED setting to reduce headache disability, frequency, and intensity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators will conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the impact of a comprehensive migraine treatment program on the quality of life for migraineurs with frequent and disabling headaches who present to the ED. The intervention (PM+PMR) will combine acute treatment, migraine preventive medication-topiramate, and the APP with PMR. Data from patients in the intervention group will be compared with data from an enhanced usual care (EUC) group to examine the efficacy of the combined treatment effects.</detailed_description>
