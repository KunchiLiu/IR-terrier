	<brief_summary>Primary: The primary objective of this pilot study is to compare the intraarticular kinematics by fluoroscopy of Vanguard XP to that of Vanguard CR. Secondary: The secondary objective of this pilot study is to compare the standing balance by force plate of patients with the Vanguard XP prosthesis to those who have Vanguard CR prosthesis. Furthermore, we wish to assess isometric quadriceps muscle strength in both groups.</brief_summary>
