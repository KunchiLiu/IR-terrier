	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well veliparib works with combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with rectal cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced). Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as modified (m)FOLFOX6 regimen, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving veliparib with combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells and giving it before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To demonstrate an absolute improvement in neoadjuvant rectal cancer (NAR) score for the experimental regimen as compared to control. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare overall survival (OS). II. To compare disease-free survival (DFS). III. To estimate the rate of disease progression during chemotherapy (prior to chemoradiation). IV. To compare the rate of pathologic complete response (nodes and tumor). V. To compare the rate of clinical complete response rate (cCR). VI. To compare the rate of negative circumferential margin. VII. To compare the rate of completion of all cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. VIII. To compare the rate of completion of full course of chemoradiation. IX. To compare the rate of sphincter preservation. X. To compare the toxicity and safety between interventions. XI. To explore the correlative molecular predictors of response and distant failure. XII. To explore the relationship between radiographic findings and pathologic outcomes. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive mFOLFOX6 regimen consisting of oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 3-4 weeks after last does of mFOLFOX6 patient undergo radiation therapy and receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) Monday-Friday for 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive mFOLFOX6 regimen consisting of oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 3-4 weeks after last does of mFOLFOX6 patient undergo radiation therapy and receive capecitabine PO BID and veliparib PO BID Monday-Friday for 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 6 months for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must have signed and dated an Institutional Review Board (IRB)approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the rectum with the major portion of the tumor intact; Note: prior to randomization, the investigator must specify and document the following: Distance of the lowest tumor margin from the anal verge; and Intent for sphincter sparing surgical resection or not according to the primary surgeon The tumor must be clinically determined to be locally advanced stage II or stage III rectal cancer, defined as meeting any ONE of the following criteria: Distal location: cT34 =&lt; 5 cm from the anal verge, any N (as defined by measurement on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], transrectal ultrasound [ERUS]/pelvic computed tomography [CT] (with IV contrast) scan or palpable on digital rectal examination [DRE]) Bulky: any cT4 with the majority of the untreated tumor &lt; 12 cm from the anal verge or below the peritoneal reflection as determined by the treating surgeon, or evidence that the tumor is adjacent to (defined as within 3 mm of) the mesorectal fascia on MRI or ERUS/pelvic CT (with IV contrast) scan High risk for metastatic disease with 4 or more regional lymph nodes (cN2) Not a candidate for sphinctersparing surgical resection prior to neoadjuvant therapy (as planned by the primary surgeon) Note: clinical stage of the primary tumor and nodes may be determined locally by endoscopic ultrasound or abdominal/pelvic MRI (MRI is preferred); CT scan with IV contrast is acceptable provided there is evidence of T4 and/or N2 disease; clinical nodal or "cN" status for eligibility includes the total number of nodes (N2 = 4 or more) in the mesorectal and superior rectal stations measuring &gt;= 1.0 cm in any axis on cross sectional or endoscopic imaging At least two (2) untreated core biopsy specimens from the untreated tumor (formalinfixed, paraffinembedded [FFPE]) must have been collected previously and be available for submission per protocol requirements Patients must have the ability to swallow and retain oral medication Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be &gt;= 1200/mm^3 Platelet count must be &gt;= 100,000/mm^3 Hemoglobin must be &gt;= 10 g/dL Total bilirubin must be =&lt; ULN (upper limit of normal) for the lab unless the patient has a bilirubin elevation &gt; ULN to 1.5 x ULN due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin Alkaline phosphatase must be =&lt; 3 x ULN for the lab Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be =&lt; 3 x ULN for the lab; Note: if alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is performed instead of AST (per institution's standard practice), the ALT value must be =&lt; 3 x ULN; if both were performed, the AST must also be =&lt; 3 x ULN; if AST and/or ALT is &gt;= ULN but =&lt; 3 x ULN, serologic testing for hepatitis B and C must be performed and results for viral infection must be negative Serum creatinine =&lt;
