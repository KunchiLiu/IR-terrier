	<brief_title>Trial Comparing ELUVIA Versus Bare Metal Stent in Treatment of Superficial Femoral and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The EMINENT study is a prospective, multi-center study confirming the superior effectiveness of the ELUVIA stent versus Self-Expanding Bare Nitinol Stents in the treatment of lesions 30-140 mm long located in the femoropopliteal arteries in subjects with symptoms classified as Rutherford categories 2-4. The study is a 2:1 randomized (ELUVIA vs Self-Expanding Bare Nitinol Stents), controlled, single-blind, superiority trial (RCT). The objective of the study is to confirm the superior effectiveness of the ELUVIA Drug-Eluting Vascular Stent System (ELUVIA Stent) for treating Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery (PPA) lesions up to 140 mm in length when compared against bare metal stents, and collect additional data including health economics data.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subjects age 18 and older 2. Subject is willing and able to provide consent before any studyspecific test or procedure is performed, signs the consent form, and agrees to attend all required followup visits 3. Chronic, symptomatic lower limb ischemia defined as Rutherford categories 2, 3 or 4 4. Stenotic, restenotic or occlusive lesion(s) located in the native Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery (PPA): 1. Degree of stenosis ≥ 70 % by visual angiographic assessment 2. Vessel diameter ≥ 4 and ≤ 6 mm 3. Total lesion length (or series of lesions) ≥ 30 mm and ≤140 mm (Note: Lesion segment(s) must be fully covered with one ELUVIA stent or Self Expanding Bare Nitinol stent) 4. For occlusive lesions requiring use of reentry device, lesion length ≤ 120 mm 5. Target lesion located at least three centimeters above the inferior edge of the femur 5. Patent infrapopliteal and popliteal artery, i.e., single vessel runoff or better with at least one of three vessels patent (&lt; 50 % stenosis) to the ankle or foot with no planned intervention 1. Previously stented target lesion/vessel 2. Target lesion/vessel previously treated with drugcoated balloon within 12 months prior to randomization/enrollment 3. Subjects who have undergone prior surgery of the SFA/PPA in the target limb to treat atherosclerotic disease 4. Use of atherectomy, laser or other debulking devices in the target limb SFA/PPA during the index procedure 5. History of major amputation in the target limb 6. Documented life expectancy less than 24 months due to other medical comorbid condition(s) that could limit the subject's ability to participate in the clinical study, limit the subject's compliance with the followup requirements, or impact the scientific integrity of the clinical study 7. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to contrast dye that, in the opinion of the investigator, cannot be adequately premedicated 8. Known hypersensitivity/allergy to the stent system or protocol related therapies (e.g., nitinol, paclitaxel, or structurally related compounds, polymer or individual components, and antiplatelet, anticoagulant, thrombolytic medications) 9. Platelet count less than 80000 mm3 or more than 600000 mm3 or history of bleeding diathesis 10. Concomitant renal failure with a serum creatinine higher than 2.0 mg/dL 11. Receiving dialysis or immunosuppressant therapy 12. History of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke/cerebrovascular accident (CVA) within 6 months prior to randomization/enrollment 13. Unstable angina pectoris at the time of randomization/enrollment 14. Pregnant, breast feeding, or plan to become pregnant in the next 3 years 15. Current participation in an investigational drug or device clinical study that has not completed the primary endpoint at the time of randomization/ enrollment or that clinically interferes with the current study endpoints (Note: studies requiring extended followup for products that were investigational, but have become commercially available since then are not considered investigational studies) 16. Septicemia at the time of randomization/enrollment 17. Presence of other hemodynamically significant outflow lesions in the target limb requiring intervention at the time of the index procedure 18. Presence of aneurysm in the target vessel 19. Acute ischemia and/or acute thrombosis of the SFA/PPA prior to randomization/enrollment 20. Perforated vessel as evidenced by extravasation of contrast media prior to randomization/enrollment 21. Heavily calcified lesions 22. As applicable by French law, subject who is a protected individual such as an incompetent adult or incarcerated person</criteria>
