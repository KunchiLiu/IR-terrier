	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of decitabine when given together with filgrastim, cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome that is newly diagnosed, has come back, or has not responded to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim, may increase the production of blood cells and may help the immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Decitabine, filgrastim, cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine, Filgrastim, Cladribine, Cytarabine, and Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed, Relapsed, or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of decitabine when used sequentially or concomitantly with filgrastim, cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride (G-CLAM) independently in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate, within the limits of a phase I study, disease response and duration of remission. II. Describe, within the limits of a phase I study, the toxicity profile of the study regimen. III. Describe, within the limits of a phase I study, the impact of the study regimen on quality of life. OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study of decitabine. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups. GROUP I (PRIMED): Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days -14 to -5. Patients also receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-5, cladribine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 2-4 hours on days 1-5 and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes on days 1-3. GROUP II (CONCURRENT): Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-10. Patients also receive filgrastim, cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride as in Group I. In both groups, treatment repeats every 10 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Beginning 6 weeks after achieving complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi), patients receive decitabine, filgrastim, cladribine and cytarabine as in Arm I. Treatment repeats every 10 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at for 1 month and every 3 months for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For patients with newly diagnosed disease: diagnosis of "highgrade" MDS (&gt;= 10% blasts by morphology) or AML other than acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with t(15;17)(q22;q12) or variants according to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification; for patients with relapsed/refractory disease: prior diagnosis of "highrisk" MDS or nonAPL AML, with relapsed/refractory disease according to 2003 recommendations of the International Working Group, requiring first or subsequent salvage therapy; patients with mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) are eligible Outside diagnostic material is acceptable as long as peripheral blood and/or bone marrow slides are reviewed at the study institution; flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood and/or bone marrow should be performed according to institutional practice guidelines Patients with prior autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are eligible if relapse occurs provided symptoms of graftversus host disease are well controlled with stable use of immunosuppressive agents Treatmentrelated mortality (TRM) score =&lt; 9.2 as calculated with simplified model Should be off any active therapy for AML with the exception of hydroxyurea for at least 14 days prior to study registration unless patient has rapidly progressive disease, and all grade 24 nonhematologic toxicities should have resolved May have previously received monotherapy with demethylating agents for MDS or AML or treatment with a mitoxantrone or cladribinebased regimen for MDS or AML, including GCLAM, but not demethylating agent as priming for or in combination with chemotherapy Patients with symptoms/signs of hyperleukocytosis or white blood cells (WBC) &gt; 100,000/uL can be treated with leukapheresis or may receive up to 2 doses of cytarabine (up to 500 mg/m^2/dose) prior to enrollment Bilirubin =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) unless elevation is thought to be due to hepatic infiltration by AML, Gilbert's syndrome, or hemolysis (assessed within 14 days prior to registration) Serum creatinine =&lt; 2.0 mg/dL (assessed within 14 days prior to registration) Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;= 45%, assessed within 3 months prior to registration, e.g. by multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) scan or echocardiography, or other appropriate diagnostic modality and no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure; if the patient had anthracyclinebased therapy since the most recent cardiac assessment, cardiac evaluation should be repeated if there is clinical or radiographic suspicion of cardiac dysfunction, or if the previous cardiac assessment was abnormal Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written consent Refractory/relapsing myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), unless patient is not considered candidate for tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment Concomitant illness associated with a likely survival of &lt; 1 year Active systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection, unless disease is under treatment with antimicrobials and/or controlled or stable (e.g. if specific, effective therapy is not available/feasible or desired [e.g. chronic viral hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)]); patient needs to be clinically stable as defined as being afebrile and hemodynamically stable for 2448 hours Known hypersensitivity to any study drug Pregnancy or lactation Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents</criteria>
