	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of the bleselumab regimen (basiliximab induction, tacrolimus, steroids and bleselumab) compared with the Standard of Care (SOC) regimen (basiliximab induction, tacrolimus, steroids and mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]) in the prevention of the recurrence of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) as defined by nephrotic range proteinuria with protein-creatinine ratio (&gt; 3.0 g/g) or initiation of plasmapheresis and no other evident etiology through 3 months post-transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Bleselumab in Preventing the Recurrence of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis in de Novo Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will consist of the following periods: Screening (Days -21 to -1), Transplant (Day 0), Post-Transplant (Day 0/post-skin closure through 12 months post-transplant). All subjects will enter into a Screening Period (Days -21 to -1 prior to transplant), undergo a Transplant (Day 0 [zero]), and are then to be followed for up to 12 months in the Post-Transplant Period (Day 0 through 12 months post-transplant).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject is a recipient of a de novo kidney from a living or deceased donor and has biopsyproven, primary FSGS as a cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in the subjects native kidneys. Subject is anticipated to receive first oral dose of tacrolimus within 48 hours of transplant procedure. Subject must be willing and able to comply with the study requirements including prohibited concomitant medication restrictions. Subject agrees not to participate in another interventional study while on treatment. Subject has Induction therapy, other than studyassigned basiliximab, planned as part of initial immunosuppressive regimen. Subject has a diagnosis of secondary FSGS (familial, virus associated, medication, etc.) or a defined genetic cause of FSGS. Subject has previously received any organ transplant including a kidney. Subject will receive a kidney as part of a multiorgan transplant. Subject will receive a dual kidney transplant from a deceased donor. Subject will receive a kidney with an anticipated cold ischemia time (CIT) of &gt; 30 hours. Subject will receive a kidney that meets BOTH Extended Criteria Donor (ECD) and Donation after Cardiac Death (DCD) criteria. (A kidney that meets either ECD OR DCD criteria may be eligible for inclusion.) Subject will receive a blood group system incompatible donor kidney. Recipient or donor is known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Subject has a current calculated panel reactive antibody (cPRA) level &gt; 50%. Subject has a current malignancy or a history of malignancy (within the past 5 years), except nonmetastatic basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been treated successfully, or a renal cell carcinoma that has been treated successfully more than 2 years prior to transplantation. Subject has significant liver disease, defined as having during the past 21 days consistently elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) levels greater than 1.5 times the upper value of the normal range of the investigational site. Subject is known to have a positive test for latent tuberculosis (TB) and has not previously received adequate antimicrobial therapy/or would require TB prophylaxis after transplant. Subject has an uncontrolled concomitant infection or any other unstable medical condition that could interfere with the study objectives. Subject is concurrently participating in another drug study or has received an investigational drug up to 30 days or 5 halflives prior to transplant. Subject is currently receiving or has received up to 8 weeks prior to transplant an immunologic biologic compound (i.e., tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, [e.g., etanercept, adalimumab], intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)). Subject has previously received bleselumab or participated in a clinical study with bleselumab. Subject has a known hypersensitivity to tacrolimus, MMF, basiliximab, corticosteroids, or any of the components. Subject has any form of substance abuse, psychiatric disorder, or a condition that could invalidate communication with the Investigator. Subject has a clinically significant abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) at Screening. Subject is unlikely to comply with the visits scheduled in the protocol</criteria>
