	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate, in comparison with placebo, the efficacy of SAR156597 administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks on skin fibrosis in patients with dcSSc. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the efficacy of SAR156597 compared to placebo on physical/functional disability in patients with dcSSc. - To evaluate the efficacy of SAR156597 compared to placebo on respiratory function in patients with dcSSc. - To evaluate the safety profile of SAR156597 compared to placebo in patients with dcSSc. - To evaluate the potential for immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies [ADA] response) of SAR156597 in patients with dcSSc. - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) (trough plasma concentrations) of SAR156597 administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks.</brief_summary>

Positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) serology or a known history of HIV infection, active or in remission. Abnormal hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C tests indicative of active or chronic infection: Abnormal Hepatitis B tests: Positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) OR positive total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) with negative hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) OR positive total hepatitis B core antibody with positive HBsAb and presence of hepatitis B DNA (HBV DNA). Abnormal Hepatitis C tests: Positive antiHCV Ab and positive HCV RNA. Positive or 2 confirmed indeterminate QuantiferonTB Gold tests at screening (regardless of prior treatment status). Serious infection (eg, pneumonia, pyelonephritis) within 4 weeks of screening, infection requiring hospitalization or intravenous antibiotics within 4 weeks of screening or chronic bacterial infection (eg, osteomyelitis). History of anaphylaxis to any biologic therapy. Evidence of any clinically significant, severe or unstable, acute or chronically progressive, uncontrolled infection or medical condition (eg, cerebral, cardiac, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal or neurologic other than SSc or SScILD) or previous, active or pending surgical disorder, or any condition that may affect patient safety in the judgment of the Investigator. Any prior history of malignancy or active malignancy, including lymphoproliferative diseases (except successfullytreated carcinoma insitu of the cervix, nonmetastatic squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin) within 5 years prior to baseline. Clinically significant abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening that may affect the conduct of the study in the judgment of the Investigator. High dose steroids (&gt;10 mg/day prednisolone equivalent); or change in steroid dose within 4 weeks prior to screening or during the screening period; or expected changes during the course of the study. Previous treatment with rituximab within 12 months prior to screening. Previous treatment with bone marrow transplantation, total lymphoid irradiation or ablative ultrahigh dose cyclophosphamide. Treatment with high dose immunosuppressive drug (eg, cyclophosphamide &gt;1 mg/kg oral/day or &gt;750 mg IV/month; azathioprine &gt;100 mg/day; methotrexate &gt;15 mg/week; mycophenolate mofetil &gt;2 g/day) within 3 months of screening or change in dose within 4 weeks prior to randomization (or baseline visit); or expected changes during the course of the study. Treatment with etanercept, cyclosporine A, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), rapamycin, Dpenicillamine, tyrosine kinase inhibitors within 4 weeks of screening or antithymocyte globulin within 6 months of screening. Treatment with infliximab, certolizumab, golimumab, abatacept, or adalimumab, tocilizumab within 8 weeks of screening or anakinra within 1 week of screening. Treatment with any investigational drug within 1 month of screening, or 5 halflives, if known (whichever is longer). Abnormal laboratory tests at screening: Alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) &gt;2 times upper limit of normal range (ULN); Hemoglobin &lt;11 g/100 mL for male and &lt;10 g/100 mL for female; Neutrophils &lt;1500/mm^3 (except &lt;1000/mm3 for those of African descent); Platelets &lt;100 000/mm^3; Creatinine ≥150 µmol/L. Note: Laboratory parameters may be repeated once during the screening period if felt to be spurious or due to technical error in order to determine eligibility. Current history of substance and/or alcohol abuse Current employee of Sanofi or has an immediate family member (eg, spouse, parents, child or sibling) who is a current employee of Sanofi. Currently incarcerated or anticipated/scheduled to be incarcerated during the course of the study. Any condition or circumstance that will preclude the patient from following and completing protocol requirements, in the opinion of the Investigator. Pregnant or breastfeeding woman Women who are of childbearing potential not protected by highlyeffective contraceptive method(s) of birth control as (defined in the informed consent form and/or Appendix G for United Kingdom), and/or who are unwilling or unable to be tested for pregnancy. Note: Women of childbearing potential must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test at screening and randomization visits. They must use an effective contraceptive method throughout the entire duration of the study treatment, and for at least 12 weeks after the last administration of IMP. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months.
