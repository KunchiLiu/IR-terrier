	<brief_summary>This is a single center, randomized, partially-blinded, Phase II, small, targeted, prospective study in approximately 30 healthy male and non-pregnant female subjects aged 18 to 49 years old, inclusive, designed to evaluate and compare the immunogenicity between an intramuscular monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine given with and without AS03 adjuvant, and an intramuscular unadjuvanted monovalent inactivated influenza A/H3N2v virus vaccine. The primary objectives include assessing the serum anti-HA hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) response to influenza A, identifying differentially expressed genes in human immune cells, and identifying differentially abundant cellular proteins in human immune cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a single center, randomized, partially-blinded, Phase II, small, targeted, prospective study in approximately 30 healthy male and non-pregnant female subjects aged 18 to 49 years old, inclusive, designed to evaluate and compare the immunogenicity between an intramuscular monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur given with and without AS03 adjuvant manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, and an intramuscular unadjuvanted monovalent inactivated influenza A/H3N2v virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur. The primary objectives include assessing the serum anti-HA hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) response to influenza A/H7N9 antigen (with and without adjuvant) at Day 57 (approximately one month after the second study vaccination with A/H7N9 vaccine ± AS03) and influenza A/H3N2v antigen at Day 29, identifying differentially expressed genes in human immune cells on Days 2, 4, and 29, and identifying differentially abundant cellular proteins in human immune cells on Days 2, 4, and 29. The secondary objectives are to compare plasma cytokine and chemokine profiles at specific time points and between treatment arms at post vaccination points, assess the neutralizing antibody responses to influenza A/H7N9 antigen, identify differentially expressed genes in human immune cells on Days 2, 4, and 8 following one intramuscular dose of influenza A/H3N2v , and identifying differentially abundant cellular proteins in human immune cells on Days 2, 4, and 8 following one intramuscular dose of influenza A/H3N2v vaccine compared to baseline assessments performed prior to study vaccination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures. 2. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all study visits. 3. Are males or nonpregnant females, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive. 4. Are in good health a. As determined by medical history and targeted physical examination, if indicated based on medical history, to evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that have been present for at least 90 days, that would affect the assessment of the safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations. Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days. This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a medication change, and there is no additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the exception of inhaled corticosteroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria (see Section 5.1.2)), herbals, vitamins, and supplements are permitted. 5. Oral temperature is less than 100.4F. 6. Pulse is 50 to 115 bpm, inclusive. 7. Systolic blood pressure is 85 to 150 mm Hg, inclusive. 8. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 mm Hg, inclusive. 9. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is less than 30 mm per hour. 10. Women of childbearing potential 2 must use an acceptable contraception method 3 from 30 days before first study vaccination until 60 days after last study vaccination a. Not sterilized via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy or successful Essure® placement (permanent, nonsurgical, nonhormonal sterilization) with documented radiological confirmation test at least 90 days after the procedure, and still menstruating or &lt;1 year of the last menses if menopausal. b. Includes, but is not limited to, nonmale sexual relationships abstinence from sexual intercourse with a male partner, monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner who has been vasectomized for 180 days or more prior to the subject receiving the first study vaccination, barrier methods such as condoms or diaphragms with spermicide or foam, effective intrauterine devices, NuvaRing®, and licensed hormonal methods such as implants, injectables or oral contraceptives ("the pill"). 11.Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to study vaccination 1. Have an acute illness 4, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, within 72 hours prior to study vaccination. a.Including acute or chronic medical disease or condition, defined as persisting for at least 90 days that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere with the evaluation of responses or the subject's successful completion of this study. 2. Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, is a contraindication to study participation. a.Including acute or chronic medical disease or condition, defined as persisting for at least 90 days that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere with the evaluation of responses or the subject's successful completion of this study 3.
