	<brief_summary>This study was a pilot 3-month clinical trial that investigated the feasibility, effectiveness, and acceptability of using the Track Health function of the Veterans Health Administration's patient health record for effecting a more positive physical activity (PA) and dietary intake lifestyle in a sample of 38 overweight and obese Veterans with prediabetes. Baseline and three-month post-intervention outcomes were measured in two main domains: objective (e.g., weight) and subjective (e.g., self-efficacy).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This was a pilot clinical trial that used a single-group design to test the feasibility, effectiveness, and acceptability of using the Track Health (TH) function of My HealtheVet, the VA's patient health record (PHR), as a tool for effecting a more positive physical activity (PA) and dietary intake lifestyle in overweight and obese Veterans with prediabetes. Baseline and three-month post-intervention outcomes were measured in two main domains: objective (PA as measured by an accelerometer, diet, weight, abdominal circumference, BMI, and blood pressure) and subjective (self-efficacy, intent to adhere to lifestyle change, and patient activation). Assessments, including screening on inclusion and exclusion criteria, physiological measurements, administration of questionnaires, and training on use of two critical features of the TH function--the use of Journals to enter dietary and PA data and the use of Vitals + Readings to enter weight and track physiological measures--took place place across four visits to the study site, which was the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Miami. The investigators hypothesized that this PHR-based intervention would demonstrate improvements and increases, respectively in the objective and subjective domain measures. The investigators also hypothesized that engagement by study participants with MHV would be demonstrated through meeting target criteria regarding making entries into this PHR's TH function, and that participants would be satisfied with the intervention.</detailed_description>
