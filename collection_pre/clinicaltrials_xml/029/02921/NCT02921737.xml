	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, non-randomized, sequentially enrolling single arm phase II trial to evaluate the activity of TAS-102 in previously treated metastatic and locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer after progression through or intolerance to first line chemotherapy. Trial therapy will consist of TAS-102 (Lonsurf®) 35 mg/m2 to be given orally twice daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 with cycles repeating every 28 days. The primary endpoint is to determine the progression free survival (PFS) in subjects with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologic or cytologic confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Clinically metastatic or locally advanced unresectable disease as verified by radiographic imaging. Documented progression or intolerance to first line chemotherapy. TAS102 will be planned to start after disease progression on firstline chemotherapy, provided any prior chemotherapyrelated toxicities have resolved to less than or equal to Grade 1 or baseline. Grade 2 or greater toxicities including alopecia, skin pigmentation,and platinum induced neurotoxicity/neuropathy are acceptable for starting on trial, as these toxicities do not preclude treatment with TAS102 ECOG Performance Status of 02 Capacity to understand and sign the informed consent document Able to take medications orally Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks as predicted by the treating oncologist's clinician judgement Age &gt;18 years Patients of childbearing potential must be using an effective means of contraception including but not limited to barrier methods, birth control, intrauterine devices. Histologic diagnosis of pancreatic cancer that has been treated previously with one line of chemotherapy. Previous surgery and/or radiotherapy could have been performed up to one month prior to study enrollment, but there must be evidence of disease progression radiographically or intolerance to firstline chemotherapy. Patients on anticoagulation need to have no evidence of bleeding and be on a stable anticoagulation dose for at least 2 weeks prior to trial enrollment Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. WOCBP include any woman who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Postmenopause is defined as: Amenorrhea that has lasted for ≥ 12 consecutive months without another cause, or For women with irregular menstrual periods who are taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT), a documented serum folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) level of greater than 35 mIU/mL. Males with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use physicianapproved contraceptive methods (e.g., abstinence, condoms, vasectomy) throughout the study and should avoid conceiving children for 4 weeks following the last dose of study drug. Subjects must have provided written informed consent and be willing to comply with all studyrelated procedures. Baseline laboratory values (bone marrow, renal, hepatic) must include: Adequate bone marrow function: Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1500/µL Platelet count &gt;75,000/µL HGB equal to or greater than 7g/dL Renal function: Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg % Hepatic function: Bilirubin &lt;3.0mg/dL AST and ALT equal to or less than 3 times the upper limit of normal Serum calcium &lt; 12 mg/dl Pregnant or lactating females Decline using effective means of contraception if sexually active Previously taken TAS102 Myocardial infarction or ischemia within the 6 months before study screening Uncontrolled' clinically significant dysrhythmia No history of an invasive malignancy within the five years prior to initiating therapy on this protocol. Patients may have prior in situ carcinomas (such as of the breast or cervix), nonmelanoma skins cancers, Rai Stage 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia or monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance and still otherwise qualify for enrollment on this protocol Radiotherapy to the target lesion within 2 weeks Major surgery within prior 4 weeks (the surgical incision should be fully healed prior to study medication administration). Antineoplastic, biologic or anticancer treatment within prior 3 weeks Lingering NCICTCAE toxicity grade 2 or higher from prior cancer treatments (excluding alopecia, skin pigmentation, and platinum induced neurotoxicity) Any co morbid condition that' in the view of the attending physician' renders the patient at high risk from treatment complications including but not limited to chronic infections, uncontrolled diabetes, congestive heart failure according to the NYHA criteria, untreated brain metastases, liver or renal failure, gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Patients with severe hepatic enzyme impairment manifesting as total bilirubin greater than 3.0mg/dL or greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal of AST or ALT Known brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease Active infection (i.e., body temperature &gt; or equal to 38degrees C due to infection) Other concurrently active malignancies excluding malignancies that are disease free for more than 5 years or carcinomainsitu deemed cured by adequate treatment.</criteria>
