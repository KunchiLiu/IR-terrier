	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of supplementation with the Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor compound, Nicotinamide Riboside (NR), for improving physiological function (vascular, motor, and cognitive) in healthy middle-aged and older adults.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overall, the proposed research project has the long-term potential to influence clinical practice by establishing novel therapies for treating multiple domains of age-associated physiological dysfunction and thereby reducing the risk of clinical disease and disability.</detailed_description>
