	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the College Park Sidekicks to conventional stubby prosthetics to investigate their effects on bilateral above-knee-amputee gait velocity, exertion, and balance. The investigators aim to demonstrate that: (i) greater balance will be observed and reported on a level and gravel surface with the Sidekicks; (ii) time to complete the 10-meter walk test will be decreased wearing Sidekicks compared to the conventional stubby prosthesis; and (iii) subjects will report feeling less exerted with the sidekicks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>bilateral transfemoral amputee own a pair of conventional stubby prosthesis with standard adaptation dependence on assistive walking device or wheelchair (may use devices occasionally but should be able to ambulate without them) use of prosthesis that do not allow change of feet with standard adapters any medical condition that may put an individual in greater risk of injury than normal daily activity.</criteria>
