	<brief_title>Lethal Congenital Malformations: Palliative Therapy From An Islamic Point of View</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective observational study where all abnormal antenatal ultrasounds are discussed in a weekly prenatal meeting and plans are drawn for management of these abnormal fetal findings. Lethal malformations are defined as conditions which will end in death regardless of supportive care. Cases are discussed extensively and parents are involved in management decisions. When a decision of non- intervention is reached for a lethal malformation consent of the family is obtained and a plan of non monitoring for the mother is documented together with no resuscitation for the newborn. Families who do not consent to such plan are offered full support for the pregnant mother and her newborn. A record of all cases is kept available together with the management plan so that the appropriate action is taken when the the pregnant lady presents for admission. All babies with lethal malformations are recorded whether stillborn or live born and their diagnosis is confirmed. Survival time is recorded for each case.</detailed_description>
