	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of sIPVs of different dosages in adults, children and infants in a phase I open-label study, and then assess its immunogenicity and safety in healthy infants between 60 and 90 days old in a phase II blind, randomized, and controlled study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studies of the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Sabin Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a combination of phases I and II. Phase I study is open-label, and only collect safety information of the investigational sIPVs in adults, children and infants. Phase II study is double-blind, randomized, controlled study of the immunogenicity and safety of the investigational vaccines and two other commercialized inactivated poliovirus vaccines in healthy infants.</detailed_description>
