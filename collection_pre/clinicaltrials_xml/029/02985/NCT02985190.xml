Lactating patients are excluded. Agree to use, and to be able to comply with, effective contraception without interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug throughout the entire duration study drug therapy (including doses interruptions) and for 3 months after the end of the study drug therapy. Male patients must : Agree the need for the use of a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a woman of childbearing potential during the entire period of treatment, even if disruption of treatment and during 3 months after end of treatment. Agree to learn about the procedures for preservation of sperm before starting treatment.
