	<brief_summary>The main purpose of the present study is to verify whether, as compared with conventional-intensity noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, high-intensity noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may more effective in correcting hypercapnia, hence reducing the need for intubation and improving survival in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</brief_summary>
