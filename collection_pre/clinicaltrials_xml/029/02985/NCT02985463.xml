	<brief_summary>"Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion and Biomarker Evaluation" (LABEL) is a single-center, prospective and observational study evaluating changes of the expression of biomarkers in eligible patients before and after percutaneous implantation of a left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion device at mid-term follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion and Biomarker Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the changes of different types of biomarkers before and after successful percutaneous implantation of an LAA occlusion device. Biomarker evaluation will focus on blood derived biomarkers including neurohormones, proteins, cytokines, microRNAs and metabolomics.</detailed_description>
