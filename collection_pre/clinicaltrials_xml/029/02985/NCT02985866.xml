	<brief_title>The International Diabetes Closed Loop (iDCL) Trial: Main Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The protocol is a 6-month parallel group multi-center randomized trial designed to compare Control-to-Range (CTR) closed-loop (CL) with sensor augmented pump therapy (SAP). Approximately 240 subjects will be entered into the randomized trial at approximately ten clinical sites in the United States and Europe, such that at least 207 subjects complete the randomized trial. The goal will be to randomize approximately 115 subjects with HbA1c ≥7.5% and 125 subjects with HbA1c &lt; 7.5%, with the minimum being 92 subjects with HbA1c &lt;7.5% and 86 with HbA1c &gt;7.5%.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Clinical diagnosis, based on investigator assessment, of type 1 diabetes for at least one year and using insulin for at least 1 year 2. Use of an insulin pump for at least 6 months 3. Age ≥14 years old 4. HbA1c level &lt;10.5% at screening 5. For females, not currently known to be pregnant 6. Willingness not to add glucoselowering agents (such as Pramlintide, Metformin, GLP1 analogs, SGLT2 inhibitors) during the study 7. Willingness, if using the closedloop system, to stop closedloop when taking acetaminophen and avoid closedloop for at least 4 hours afterward 8. Willingness to suspend use of any personal CGM for the duration of the clinical trial once the unblinded study CGM is in use 9. Willingness to establish network connectivity on at least a weekly basis either via local Wifi network or via a studyprovided cellular service 10. Currently using no insulins other than one of the following rapidacting insulins at the time of enrollment: insulin lispro (Humalog), insulin aspart (Novolog), or insulin glulisine (Apidra) 11. Investigator has confidence that the subject can successfully operate all study devices and is capable of adhering to the protocol 1. More than one episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the 6 months prior to enrollment 2. More than one episode of severe hypoglycemia involving seizure or loss of consciousness in the 6 months prior to enrollment 3. Medical need for chronic acetaminophen 4. Use of any glucoselowering agent (such as Pramlintide, Metformin, GLP1 analogs, SGLT2 inhibitors) in the 3 months prior to enrollment 5. Hemophilia or any other bleeding disorder 6. A condition, which in the opinion of the investigator or designee, would put the participant or study at risk 7. Participation in another pharmaceutical or device trial at the time of enrollment or during the study 8. Use of a closedloop system within the last month prior to enrollment 9.
