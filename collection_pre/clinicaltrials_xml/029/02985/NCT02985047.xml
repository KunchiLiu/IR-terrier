	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to test a standardized version of brief admission (BA) through randomized controlled trial (RCT). The main objective is to evaluate if BA can serve as a crisis management model for individuals with recurrent self-harm, including suicide attempts and at least three symptoms of Borderline Personality disorder. Participants will be allocated to BA + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or TAU.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brief Admission Skane: Replacing General Admission for Individuals With Self-harm and Acute Risk of Suicide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When individuals with recurrent self-harm and suicidal behaviour seek acute admission to hospital due to a crisis and associated increased suicidal ideation, recommendations for clinical care are still conflicting. The risk for iatrogenic effects of inpatient care are considerable, and long hospital admissions without a clear treatment structure may predict decompensation in functioning. This has resulted in a clinical practice of avoiding admission for individuals diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Brief admission (BA) as an intervention has a longstanding history in the delivery of mental health services in the Netherlands. The core elements of brief admission were determined through consultation with Dutch researchers, interviews with individuals with experience, Dutch clinicians familiar with Brief Admission, and local guidelines from hospitals familiar with implementing this crisis management intervention. Core elements of the intervention were standardized into a protocol, and an educational manual was developed to train clinicians involved in the trial. An objectively rated fidelity measure was developed in order to ensure adherence.</detailed_description>
