	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the fixed combination of orphenadrine, acetaminophen, caffeine and diclofenac sodium is more effective in the treatment of an acute episode of mechanical postural low back pain than Voltaren®. Will be randomized 110 participants of both sexes, aged 18 years or older and less than 65 years of age with an acute episode of mechanical postural low back pain and they will be allocated to one of two treatment groups: Group 1: Fixed combination of orphenadrine, acetaminophen, caffeine and diclofenac sodium; or Group 2: Voltaren®</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Evaluate the Superiority of Fixed Combination (Orfenadrine 35mg, Acetaminophen 325mg, Caffeine 65mg and Diclofenac Sodium 50mg) Compared to Voltaren® (Diclofenac Sodium 50mg) in the Treatment of Acute Postural Low Back Pain.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The fixed combination of orphenadrine 35mg, acetaminophen 325mg, caffeine 65mg and diclofenac sodium 50mg aims to provide patients with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and myorelaxant action with adequate safety and tolerability profile. Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic action and is effective in the treatment of a variety of acute and chronic inflammatory and painful conditions. Its anti-inflammatory effect occurs by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 in an equipotent manner. Orphenadrine, on the other hand, is a central acting muscle relaxant that has analgesic and anticholinergic effects. It presents clinical efficacy in the treatment of painful conditions associated to pictures such as strains and sprains, especially of acute character, among other musculoskeletal conditions that present with pain and muscular contracture. Concerning acetaminophen, its a drug with analgesic and antipyretic action as well as anti-inflammatory properties. It is widely used in a wide variety of pathologies with a focus on the treatment of mild to moderate pain. It is a non-opioid analgesic with action in the inhibition of cyclooxygenase and consequently in the production of prostaglandins, with potency similar to that of aspirin. It is the analgesic of choice for children, the elderly and pregnant women. It has been used successfully in the treatment of back pain. The association between acetaminophen and orphenadrine is known and clinically effective in analgesia, as well as the combination of acetaminophen and diclofenac, which also provides clinical efficacy in the management of acute postoperative pain. Lastly, caffeine, an alkaloid belonging to the group of methylxanthines, is an agonist that competes with adenosine receptors, acting in these receptors in very varied areas, such as throughout the peripheral circulation and in the cerebral cortex. Caffeine enhances the effects of other analgesics, improves acetaminophen pharmacokinetics, and induces mood changes. All these mechanisms may contribute to improve the analgesic action of acetaminophen. The association of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, muscle relaxant, analgesic and caffeine in the symptomatic treatment of painful conditions associated with the musculoskeletal system is quite old.</detailed_description>
