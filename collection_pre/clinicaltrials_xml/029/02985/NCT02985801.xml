	<brief_title>PERT for Treatment of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency in Patients With Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, double-blind clinical trial aiming to assess the impact of pancreas enzyme replacement therapy in weight loss and quality of life. Prevalence of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) will be determined with fecal elastase-1 test (FE1) in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer, without evidence of pancreatic duct (PD) or common bile duct (CBD) obstruction based on MRI or / and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Patients with PEI (FE1 &lt;200) receive Pertzye or placebo in a cross-over fashion, each for 4 weeks. Body weight, body mass index (BMI), body composition (Bioimpedance), are measured at the time of diagnosis of PEI and at 4 and 10 weeks of cross-over treatment. Baseline measurement of Vitamin D-25, Vitamin A, iron (ferritin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), iron), Vitamin B12,Tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG) with total Immunoglobulin A (IgA). Quality of Life (pain, diarrhea, weight, bloating, etc.) assessed at 0,4,10 weeks with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for patients with liver, bile duct and pancreas cancer (FACT-Hep) for physical, social, emotional, and functional quality of life.</detailed_description>
