	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to determine if antibiotics combined with immediate induction can significantly reduce the rate of maternal and neonatal infection compared with immediate induction alone in women presenting with PROM later than the 37+0 weeks of gestation. The secondary aim is to compare the rates of infection between immediate and delayed induction in women submitted to antibiotic prophylaxis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In a randomized controlled non-blind trial, low-risk women with singleton term pregnancies and a negative Group B Streptococcus culture presenting with PROM are randomly assigned to group A (immediate induction with antibiotic prophylaxis), group B (immediate induction without antibiotic prophylaxis) or group C (delayed induction with antibiotic prophylaxis).</detailed_description>
