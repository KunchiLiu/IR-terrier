	<brief_summary>Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is a common part of routine anesthesiology practice.However several steps of RSI are not based on evidence based data (EBM) and are considered controversial. In an electronic evaluation form that will be send to Czech society of anesthesiology, resuscitation and intensive care (ČSARIM) members, the investigators bring 4 clinical scenarios in which RSI should be used. In the questionnaire the participants have to choose RSI or no and they have to describe all the next steps on anesthesia induction process in each single clinical scenario.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is a common part of routine anesthesiology practice.However several steps of RSI are not based on evidence based data (EBM) and are considered controversial. In an electronic evaluation form that will be send to Czech society of anesthesiology, resuscitation and intensive care (ČSARIM) members, the investigators bring 4 clinical scenarios in which RSI should be used. In the questionnaire the participants have to choose RSI or no and they have to describe all the next steps on anesthesia induction process in each single clinical scenario. - 1st. scenario - adult patient with acute abdomen in the OR to be anesthetized - 2nd. scenario - 4 years old child with acute abdomen in the OR scheduled for an acute surgery - 3rd. scenario - pregnant women scheduled for an elective caesarean section in the OR - 4th. scenario - geriatric patient with hiatal hernia scheduled for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In each scenario the several steps of the RSI sequence has to be answered: Is RSI indicated? Y N Peripheral vein line before induction? Y N Nasogastric tube before/after induction or without? Patients position: neutral, head-up, head-down? Preoxygenation - 3/5minutes, breaths, (CPAP)/Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)? Sellick manoeuver? Y N Drugs for induction (order with the number in the row) - propofol, etomidate, ketamine, thiopental, midazolam, suxamethonium, rocuronium, cisatracurium, atracurium, vecuronium Manual hand-bag ventilation after induction: with limited pressure/contraindicated Airway: tracheal tube with the cuff/without cuff/laryngeal mask Comments</detailed_description>
