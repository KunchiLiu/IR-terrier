	<brief_title>LEE011 Plus Everolimus in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Refractory to Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single arm, open label Phase I/II study to evaluate the progression free survival at 8 weeks (PFS8week) of the combination of LEE-011 plus everolimus, in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer refractory to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Previous studies of third-line therapy in mPAC are limited but reveal stable disease in 25-31% of patients with no partial or complete responses (31% of patients in the GVAX/CRS-207 combination vaccine study had stable disease but only 52% of these patients were treated in the third-line setting). It is hoped that the combination of LEE-011 plus everolimus can increase the PFS8weeks to at least 50%, though early stopping rules are in place for lack of efficacy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed mPAC (mixed histology is acceptable as long as the predominant histology is pancreatic adenocarcinoma) 2. Patient must consent to two mandatory biopsies and have tumor amenable to biopsy 3. Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 criteria (tumor ≥ 1 cm in longest diameter on axial image on CT or MRI and/or lymph node(s) ≥ 1.5 cm in short axis on CT or MRI) on baseline imaging 4. Documented progression of disease on at least one 5FUbased regimen and at least one GEMbased regimen for metastatic disease (progression during or within 3 months of the completion of adjuvant therapy is acceptable) 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 02 (see Table 2) 6. Age ≥ 18 years 7. Subjects with no brain metastases or a history of previously treated brain metastases who have been treated by surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment and have a baseline MRI that shows no evidence of active intracranial disease 8. Patients with available standard 12lead ECG with the following parameters at screening (defined as the mean of the triplicate ECGs): QTcF interval at screening &lt;450msec Resting heart rate 5090bpm 9. Bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3; Platelets ≥100 × 109/L; hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL • Patients may have a transfusion of red blood cells to meet the hemoglobin requirement 10. Renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper normal limit of institution's normal range or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine levels above institutional normal 11. Hepatic function: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 × the upper normal limit of institution's normal range. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × the upper normal limit of institution's normal range. For subjects with liver metastases, AST and ALT &lt; 5 × the upper normal limit of institution's normal range, and total bilirubin &gt;1.5 3.0 x the upper normal limit of institution's normal range are acceptable as long as there is no persistent nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia. 12. Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) must be ≤ 1.5 × upper normal limit of institution's normal range and International Normalized Ratio (INR) &lt; 1.5. Subjects on anticoagulant (such as warfarin) will be permitted to enroll as long s the INR is in the acceptable therapeutic range as determined by the investigator. 13. Potassium, total calcium (corrected for serum albumin), magnesium, sodium and phosphorus within normal limits for the institution or corrected to within normal limits with supplements before first dose of study medication 14. Patients must have fully recovered from all effects of surgery. Patients must have had at least two weeks after minor surgery and four weeks after major surgery before starting therapy. Minor procedures requiring "Twilight" sedation such as endoscopies or mediport placement may only require a 24hour waiting period, but this must be discussed with an investigator. 15. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to initiation of treatment and/or postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing potential 16. Patient is capable of swallowing pills whole 17. Patient is capable of understanding and complying with parameters as outlined in the protocol and able to sign and date the informed consent, approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), prior to the initiation of any screening or studyspecific procedures 1. Patients previously exposed to, intolerant of, or ineligible for Cyclindependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and/or their combination 2. Prior antitumor therapy within 3 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1 (antitumor therapy defined as, but is not limited to, anticancer agents (cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and biologic therapy), radiotherapy, and investigational agents), the "washout period" 3. Patient has any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, cause unacceptable safety risks, contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g. chronic pancreatitis, chronic active hepatitis, active untreated or uncontrolled fungal, bacterial or viral infections, etc.). 4. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding 5. Concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibiting or activating medications 6. Concurrent use of an Angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (increased risk of angioedema with ACE inhibitors administered in combination with everolimus, seen in approximately 6.8% of patients) 7. Psychiatric illness or social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements 8. Patient has a concurrent malignancy or malignancy within 3 years prior to starting study drug, with the exception of adequately treated, basal or squamous cell carcinoma, nonmelanomatous skin cancer or curatively resected cervical cancer. 9. Patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement unless they meet ALL of the following criteria: At least 4 weeks from prior therapy completion (including radiation and/or surgery) to starting the study treatment Clinically stable CNS tumor at the time of screening and not receiving steroids and/or enzymeinducing antiepileptic medications for brain metastases. 10. Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection). 11. Patient has a known history of HIV infection or chronic, active Hepatitis B (testing not mandatory). 12. Patient has any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, cause unacceptable safety risks, contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g. chronic pancreatitis, chronic active hepatitis, active untreated or uncontrolled fungal, bacterial or viral infections, etc.). 13.
