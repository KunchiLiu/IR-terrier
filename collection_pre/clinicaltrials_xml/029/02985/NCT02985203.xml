	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multi-center clinical trial, aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of oral Navelbine and Cisplatin followed by metronomic oral Navelbine in Patients with advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. The study comprises two stages. In the 1st stage (Week 1-12), all patients will receive combination chemotherapy. In the 2nd stage (Week 13-25), patients who complete the combination chemotherapy with acceptable tolerance and have no progressive disease (PD) will be allocated into 2 arms, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of maintenance chemotherapy with metronomic oral Navelbine (Arm A) or other regimen (Arm B).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Navelbine and Cisplatin Followed by Metronomic Oral Navelbine in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the 1st stage (Week 1-12), all patients will receive combination chemotherapy, i.e. Platinum and Navelbine, for 4 cycles. The regimen is: Navelbine oral 60mg/m2 d1,8 the first cycle; oral 80mg/m2 day1,8 in sequential cycles q3w plus cisplatin: 75mg/m2 d1 q3w. In the 2nd stage (Week 13-25), patients who complete the combination chemotherapy with acceptable tolerance and have no PD will be allocated into 2 arms, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of maintenance chemotherapy with metronomic oral Navelbine (Arm A) or other regimen (Arm B). The allocation will be done in sequence at each site, i.e., the first subject who complete the combination chemotherapy with acceptable tolerance and have no PD will be allocated to Arm A, and the second will be allocated to Arm B, and so on. Arm A will continue with oral Navelbine 3 times weekly as maintenance therapy, up to 12 weeks, or till progression, unacceptable toxicity or death occurred. As contrast, Arm B will receive other therapy as per the physician's choice. Arm A: Navelbine oral 50mg three times per week (Day 1, 3, 5 of each week ) Arm B: Physician's choice (other than Navelbine oral) computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be done at the screening visit, Week 7, Week 13 (before the initiation of maintenance therapy), Week 19 (after 6 weeks of maintenance therapy), and Week 25 (after 12 weeks of maintenance therapy), to evaluate the tumor response. The Disease Control Rate (proportion of patients in complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD)) after 6 weeks and 12 weeks of maintenance therapy will be evaluated separately for the 2 arms. And Arm B is for observational study only, and will provide rationale for control group selecting in future study.</detailed_description>
