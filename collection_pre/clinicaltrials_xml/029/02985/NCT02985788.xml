	<brief_title>Self Digital Photography for Assessing Elbow Range of Motion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Loss of elbow range of motion is common after trauma and can significantly affect activities of daily living. Patients across the country travel to tertiary referral centers to have this problem addressed. Followup is critical and can often be difficult given distances between patients home and their healthcare provider. Measuring postoperative outcomes requires accurate and reliable documentation of range of motion. Previously, the investigators have validated digital photography as a means of accurately measuring elbow range of motion. In that study, photographs were taken by a non-professional photographer. With the advance in personal technology, patients now have the ability to take photos themselves. This study seeks to validate self photography, which will ultimately improve patient follow up and improve clinical monitoring</detailed_description>
