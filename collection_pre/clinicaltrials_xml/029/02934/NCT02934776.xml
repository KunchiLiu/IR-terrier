	<brief_title>Prospective Cohort Study of the Ability of MRI/DTI to Diagnose Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective cohort study of the ability of MRI/DTI to diagnose prostate cancer in men undergoing prostate MRI. Study design: Male adults who are scheduled to undergo MRI of the prostate, for clinical reasons, will be subjected to additional 10 minutes of image acquisition inside the MRI machine. The added MRI/DTI acquisition does not involve injection of additional contrast material. Investigators will compare between ability of the full mp-MRI images to diagnose prostate cancer to that of the MRI/DTI images</detailed_description>
