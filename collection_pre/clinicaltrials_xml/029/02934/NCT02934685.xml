	<brief_summary>To determine if hypofractionated IG-VMAT (70 Gy in 28 fractions over 5.6 weeks) will result in disease-free survival (DFS) that is no worse than DFS following conventionally fractionated IG-VMAT (80Gy in 40 fractions over 8 weeks) in patients treated for localized prostate cancer. Analysis the local progression, disease-specific survival (DFS), freedom from biochemical recurrence (FFBR), and overall survival (OS) of two groups. Observe the incidence of GI and GU toxicity.</brief_summary>
