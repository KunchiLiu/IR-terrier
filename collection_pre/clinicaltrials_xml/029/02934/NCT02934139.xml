	<brief_title>MAD Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Cavosonstat (N91115) in Healthy Subjects (SNO-9)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess the safety and tolerability of escalating, multiple ascending doses of Cavosonstat (N91115) in healthy subjects. Approximately 5 ascending cohorts are planned with approximately 8 subjects per cohort (6 active, 2 placebo). Each subject will undergo screening (Day -28 to Day -2) and, if eligible, return to the unit on Day -1 when eligibility will be reconfirmed. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive investigational medicinal product (IMP) N91115 (daily [QD] or every 12 hours [Q12H]) or matching placebo (QD or Q12H) for 7 days and will be followed for safety while housed in the clinical research unit (CRU) until discharge on Day 8. Pharmacokinetics will be followed from Study Day 1 through the morning of Study Day 8. The subjects will be discharged from the CRU and complete the post treatment withdrawal phase, including a follow-up phone call on Day 15.</detailed_description>
