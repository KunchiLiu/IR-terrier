	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose escalating, study in 5 sequential cohorts to investigate the effect of a single s.c. injection of SHR-1314 at 5 dose levels (20mg, 40mg, 80mg, 160mg, and 240mg) in healthy subjects. Each cohort will consist of 6 subjects receiving active drug and 2 subjects receiving placebo, for a total of approximately 40 subjects dosed at one study site.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of SHR-1314 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will consist of a 27-day screening period (Days -28 to -2), clinic check-in (Day -1), a treatment day (Day 1), a 10-week treatment period and a study completion evaluation (Day 71) as shown in above figure. A review of blinded interim PK data will be conducted by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) to confirm the study sampling schedule captures the full PK profile of SHR-1314. This interim analysis will be conducted for Cohort 1 and may be conducted for subsequent cohorts if serum SHR-1314 concentrations in Cohort 1 or any of the subsequent cohorts are below the limit of quantification of the assay preventing evaluation of the PK profile. The expected duration of participation for each subject will be up to 99 days. Subjects who are withdrawn for reasons other than safety may be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor.</detailed_description>

Use of other investigational drugs within 5 halflives of screening, or within 30 days of screening (for small molecules), or until the expected pharmacodynamic effect has returned to baseline (for biologics), whichever is longer. 3.

Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

History or complication of tuberculosis. 12. Has a clinically significant abnormality on the screening chest xray that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect the subject's safety or ability to participate in the study; including, but not limited to, evidence of previous exposure to tuberculosis. 13. History of immunodeficiency diseases, including a positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test result at screening. 14. Positive hepatitis B or hepatitis C test result at Screening 15.
