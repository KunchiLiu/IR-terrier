	<brief_title>Push With Lower Uterine Segment Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructed labor refers to failure of labor progress in spite of good uterine contractions and is attributed to mismatch between the size of the presenting part of the fetus and the mother's pelvis. Approximately 8% of maternal deaths worldwide are attributed to obstructed labor and subsequent puerperal infection, uterine rupture, and postpartum hemorrhage. In these situations, Cesarean section could minimize maternal and neonatal morbidity. However, Cesarean section is challenging when the head is deeply impacted and is associated with high risk of maternal injuries and perinatal injuries. The most common complication is extension of uterine incision which could involve the vagina, bladder, ureters and broad ligament. Neonates are also at risk of skull fractures, cephalhematoma, and subgaleal hematoma mainly due to manipulations. Currently, the most popular approaches for fetal head delivery are the push and pull methods. Although push method seems to be more convenient and does not necessitate extensive experience, it is more significantly associated with extension than the pull method. Although pull method seems to be more safe, it is more difficult to perform and usually warrants an aggressive uterine incision to deliver the fetus. In 2013, investigators published a case series on abdominal disimpaction with lower uterine segment support which basically allows obstetricians to deliver the fetal head through a transverse uterine incision with minimal risk of extensions and neonatal complications. In this study, investigators aim to validate this approach in comparison to the classic push method.</detailed_description>
