	<brief_summary>Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women in western countries. The improvement of therapeutic management associated to the developement of supportive care allows patient to live longer in better conditions. But several studies have showed the deleterious impact of treatment such as chemotherapy on cognition. To limit these damages, non therapeutic approaches such as Adapted Physical Activity (APA) have been developped. The goal of this study is to evaluate the benefit of APA program on cognitive functions in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Adapted Physical Activity on Cognitive Functions in Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient with cognitive complaint will be randomized in two groups : - Experimental group : Immediate APA program (after randomization) - Standard group : Delayed APA program (3 months after randomization) APA program contains 10 sessions of APA within five weeks (twice a week). Each session is composed of 5 exercises (each made of 3 serial of 7 repetitions in slow speed). A cognitive and quality of life assessments will occur in two groups at 3 and 6 months after randomization. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of APA program on the improvement of cognitive functions in patients with breast cancer who have been treated by adjuvant chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
