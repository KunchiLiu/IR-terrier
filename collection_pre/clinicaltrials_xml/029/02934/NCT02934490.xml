	<brief_summary>The study is to explore the effectiveness of a new-style anterior vaginal wall mesh in the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence(SUI). Meshes were made by Gynemech TM PS, (Johnson &amp; Johnson Shanghai Medical Equipment Co. China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) registration No. 3460365, size 10 Ã— 15cm). Meshes were cut to appropriate size. The incontinence questionnaire summary table (ICIQ-SF), pad test, urodynamic and other diagnostic tests were used for preoperative assessment and the evaluation of postoperative surgical outcome and complication. The results were compared with the one-year cure rates of Burch and trans vaginal taping (TVT) surgeries. The analysis indicated that the surgery using the new-style anterior vaginal mesh, as a minimally invasive procedure, not only achieved its expectation with similar cure rate to Burch, TVT/ trans vaginal taping obturator (TVT-O) surgeries, but also has lower economic cost and complication rate than the TVT /TVT-O approach. The evaluation of long-term treatment effect needs further follow-up of the patients.</brief_summary>
