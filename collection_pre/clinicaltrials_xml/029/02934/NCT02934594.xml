	<brief_title>Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression (MSCC): Treatment Timing and Survival Rate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MSCC patients who underwent palliative decompression after January 2012 in National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) were divided into the preoperative motor function intact group (Group A) and motor deficit group (Group B). The motor deficit group was subdivided into operation within 48 hours (Group B1), and after 48 hours (Group B2). All patients underwent palliative decompression and posterior stabilization. Investigators did wide laminectomy for tumor invading the vertebral body, and debulking surgery for tumor destructing the posterior column of the spine. Investigators retrospectively reviewed all patient records, including patient demographics, prognostic factors for survival (Kaplan-Meier survival analysis), neurological outcome (Frankel grade), primary tumor, complications, and relevance of Tomita and Tokuhashi scores.</detailed_description>
