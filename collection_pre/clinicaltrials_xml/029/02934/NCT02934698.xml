	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Ivacaftor in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis and Two Splicing Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The two sisters have a splicing mutation that is predicted to respond favorably to ivacaftor therapy. In addition to measurement of usual clinical outcomes (i.e. lung function, nutritional status), there is great interest on the impact on nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) airways infection. Subjects will undergo sputum cultures at baseline and monthly during treatment, initially in the absence of anti-NTM therapy but with the intent to treat with antibiotics if there is persistence of the infection in cultures. Other clinical outcomes will include changes in sweat chloride, lung function and weight. Safety measures will include periodic assessment of liver enzymes. All serious and non-serious adverse events will be collected</detailed_description>
