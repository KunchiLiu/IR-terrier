	<brief_summary>The investigators will longitudinally measure cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in acute (≤3 days from injury), subacute, and chronic phases after TBI as a biomarker of TCVI as compared to healthy controls. CVR will be measured by fNIRS response to hypercapnia. The investigators hypothesize that CVR will be decreased after TBI and that these decreases will correlate with clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the investigators predict that administration of a vasodilatory medication (sildenafil) will augment CVR after TBI.</brief_summary>
