	<brief_summary>Cirrhosis results in decreased synthesis of both procoagulants and anticoagulants resulting in "rebalanced homeostasis". However, conventional blood tests (platelets/ INR levels) that are performed prior to invasive procedures do not accurately reflect the coagulation changes that occur in cirrhotics, resulting in unnecessary transfusion of blood products. Thromboelastography (TEG) is a global hemostasis assessment tool that is being used in surgery (including liver transplant) to help guide blood product transfusion in the operating room. The investigators would like to compare the use of TEG vs. INR/platelets to help guide blood product transfusion in cirrhotic patients undergoing inpatient endoscopy. The investigators will evaluate to see if there is a decrease in prophylactic blood transfusions prior to endoscopy when using TEG.</brief_summary>
