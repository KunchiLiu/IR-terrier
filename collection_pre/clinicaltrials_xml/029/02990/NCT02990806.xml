	<criteria>Patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as defined by the 2010 ACR and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria Patients have active RA, as confirmed by the following criteria: ≥6 swollen joints and ≥6 tender joints at screening and baseline (28joint count) Creactive protein (CRP) ≥0.7 mg/dL (≥7.0 mg/L) at screening Patients taking methotrexate (MTX) (oral or parenteral) for at least 3 months prior to screening and at a stable dose of between 10 and 25 mg/week for at least 8 weeks. Concomitant folic/folinic acid at a dose of at least 5 mg/week is to be taken during the study; patients can start treatment with folic/folinic acid at screening if not already receiving it. If the patient is currently taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the patient must be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and during the study. Patients who are ≥18 and ≤75 years of age at screening Patients who are rated as Class IV according to the 1991 ACR revised criteria for classification of global functional status for RA Patients who have received diseasemodifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), other than MTX, within a period prior to screening shorter than the washout period appropriate to the pharmacodynamic profile of the specific drug Patients who have received immunosuppressive drugs within 4 weeks prior to screening. Patients on a stable dose of oral corticosteroids (≤10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) for ≥4 weeks prior to screening are permitted. Patients who have received intraarticular, intramuscular, intravenous, or epidural injection of corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to screening Patients who have received intraarticular sodium hyaluronate injections within 4 weeks prior to screening Patients who have received surgical therapy for RA such as synovectomy or arthroplasty within 6 months prior to screening Patients who have received arthrocentesis within 4 weeks prior to screening Patients who have had prior treatment with infliximab Patients who have had prior treatment with &gt;1 biological drug or &gt;1 protein kinase inhibitor for RA either as part of clinical management or during a clinical study Patients who have had prior treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors for RA who had lack of efficacy as per clinical judgment (primary failure). Patients who have discontinued TNFα inhibitors for RA (other than infliximab) for any reason other than lack of efficacy are allowed. Presence of chronic or acute infection at screening, including positive result for active tuberculosis (TB) Patients with an acute infection requiring parenteral antibiotics within 4 weeks of study dosing or requiring oral/topical antibiotics within 2 weeks of study dosing.</criteria>
