	<brief_title>Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of MeRT Treatment in Persistent Post-Concussive Symptoms (PPCS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MeRT-TBI-005 is a prospective, double blind, randomized, sham-controlled, parallel group, adaptive clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of EEG/EKG-guided MeRT in active duty military service men and women, reservists on active duty orders, and military retirees with Persistent Post-Concussion Symptoms (PPCS) and Traumatic Brain Injury. A total of 150 participants will be randomized, with blinded adaptive sample size reassessment up to 250 participants, and a contingent group-sequential single look at interim efficacy data by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Participants will be recruited from military bases, and their vicinities, in two locations. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either MeRT or Sham MeRT treatment groups in a 1:1 allocation ratio, with stratification on recruitment site and two levels of PTSD co-morbidity (+/-). Treatment will be initiated on Day 1 of the study, following eligibility evaluation and data collection at the Screening Visit (SC) and Baseline (BL) Visit. Following the SC and BL visits, there will be a 4-week treatment period. Main study outcomes will be collected at the second follow-up visit (F2) at the conclusion of the 4-week treatment period. An abbreviated data collection visit will occur at the conclusion of the second treatment week (the F1 follow-up visit). Participants, clinicians, and all personnel who participate in evaluation, or who interface with treatment protocol downloading software, will be blind to study treatment group assignment.</detailed_description>

TBI according to the following American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) criteria for mTBI, excepting that the severity of injury associated with focal neurological deficit(s) may exceed the ACRM criteria for mild injury: Sustaining of a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function, as manifested by at least one of the following Any period of loss of consciousness Any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the accident Any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident Focal neurological deficit(s) that may or may not be transient 4. The TBI was followed within a maximum of 4 weeks by symptoms in at least 3 of the following 6 categories listed in the ICD10 criteria for PostConcussive syndrome: Headache, dizziness, malaise, fatigue, noise tolerance Irritability, depression, anxiety, emotional lability Subjective concentration, memory, or intellectual difficulties without neuropsychological evidence of marked impairment Insomnia Reduced alcohol tolerance Preoccupation with above symptoms and fear of brain damage with hypochondriacal concern and adoption of sick role 5. Symptoms in at least 3 of the 6 PostConcussive symptoms categories listed above have persisted for at least 6 months as of the Screening Visit 6. Rivermead PostConcussion Questionnaire (RPQ16) score â‰¥ 30 7. No plan to move away from the area, or knowledge that there will be a deployment, prior to 5 weeks and 3 days after the day of the Baseline Visit 8. Willing and able to adhere to the study treatment and data collection schedule and study procedures Participants will be excluded from study participation if one or more of the following exclusion criteria apply: 1. History of open skull injury 2. History of a neurological disorder including, but not limited to: Seizure disorder Any condition likely to be associated with increased intracranial pressure Space occupying brain lesion 3. History of cerebrovascular accident 4. History of cerebral aneurysm 5. EEG abnormalities that indicate risk of seizure, i.e., abnormal focal or general slowing, or ictal spikes, during the EEG recording 6. Participation in any interventional research protocol within 3 months prior to the Screening Visit 7. History of any type of ECT, MeRT, or rTMS 8.

Implanted cardiac pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), or medication dispensing device 12. Clinically significant abnormality or clinically significant unstable medical condition that in the Investigator's judgment might pose a potential safety risk to the participant 13. Clinically significant medical illness or condition, including, but not limited to, any uncontrolled thyroid disorders, hepatic, cardiac, pulmonary and renal malfunction, or chronic excessive alcohol consumption 14. Clinically significant psychopathology, including, but not limited to, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, or other psychiatric disorder that in the Investigator's judgment might pose a potential safety risk to the participant or limit the interpretation of the trial results 15.
