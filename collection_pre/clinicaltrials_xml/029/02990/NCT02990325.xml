	<detailed_description>The purpose of the ABX464-005 study is to characterize the systemic and mucosal immunological sequelae associated with exposure to ABX464 and to explore selected immunological endpoints, compartmental pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. The site will screen and enroll 12 HIV-infected subjects who will receive 150 mg ABX464 orally once daily for 28 days (Cohort 1). Following completion of this cohort a further 24 subjects will be enrolled (12 HIV-infected and 12 HIV-uninfected) and will receive 150 mg ABX464 orally once daily for 28 days. (Cohort 2)</detailed_description>
