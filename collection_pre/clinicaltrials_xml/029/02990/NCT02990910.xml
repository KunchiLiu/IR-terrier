	<brief_summary>A high incidence of respiratory morbidity after adenotonsillectomy is reported in children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). So we designed a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled study to determine the effects of personalized opioid analgesia compared with conventional opioid analgesia on respiratory morbidity after adenotonsillectomy in Children with OSAS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Personalized Opioid Analgesia After Adenotonsillectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All children were randomized 2 groups based on a computer-generated random number. The main interventions were occurred in post anesthetic care unit (PACU). In the operating room, all patients received a standardized anesthetic regimen by one anesthetist. Sevoflurane was used for maintenance without any opioids. Before the end of the procedure, spontaneous respiratory was recovered. All the patients were given 1 mcg/kg fentanyl intravenous injection after the end of the procedure. The positive result was defined as spontaneous respiratory rate decreased more than 50%, the others were defined as negative result. The result of fentanyl test submitted to assistant, and prepared the rescue analgesic drugs according to this result. One group: positive result 10μg/kg morphine; negative result 50μg/kg morphine. Another group: all received 25μg/kg morphine .The trachea was extubated when patients were awake, and then transported to the PACU. Patients with a Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale score&gt;6 received rescue analgesic drugs and observe respiratory morbidity in each group.</detailed_description>
