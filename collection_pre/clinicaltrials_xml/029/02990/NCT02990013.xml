	<brief_summary>Aim 1: To determine in vivo capability of AvenovaTM against common cutaneous microbial biome on human skin Aim 2: To compare to povidone-iodine 5% solution, 4% chlorhexidine and isopropyl alcohol against AvenovaTM as a sterile skin agent</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AvenovaTM as a Sterile Skin Preparation Agent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 30 eligible participants will be identified with clinically-acquired information by Dr. Wendy Lee, an oculoplastic surgeon and aesthetic treatment specialist at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, during regular clinic visits. Part One: Patients will have their skin swabbed and then cultured for various skin flora agents. The petri dish will then be swabbed with Avenova to see what percent of skin flora microbe is killed. Part Two: Patients will have their skin divided into 5 quadrants. The area will be pre-swabbed to monitor microbe growth. One quadrant will be used as a control. The area will be cleansed for one minute with AvenovaTM , povidone-iodine 5% solution, 4% chlorhexidine and isopropyl alcohol, each in a different quadrant. The area will be post-swabbed for monitor for microbe growth. Specific pathogens tested would include staphylococcus epidermides, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium, candida albicans, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 and adenovirus. Patients will not be told of positive results as these are normal skin flora.</detailed_description>
