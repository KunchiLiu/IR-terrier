	<brief_summary>Ultraviolet (UV) phototherapy is a standard treatment for many inflammatory dermatological diseases, including psoriasis. The systemic effects of UV phototherapy are still not well studied. There are several factors that may affect patient's cardiovascular (CV) risk during UV phototherapy. Atherosclerosis is now known to have an inflammatory origin and to be frequently associated with psoriasis. In this study the investigators aim at studying the effect of psoralen-UVA phototherapy on several biomarkers of CV risk in patients with psoriasis with or without atherosclerosis.</brief_summary>
