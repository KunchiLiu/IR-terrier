	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether placing Ologen over the posterior plate of the Ahmed glaucoma drainage device during initial implantation will allow the formation of a thinner capsule, and decrease the incidence and/or the extent of IOP elevation during the postoperative period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effectiveness of Ologen® Collagen Matrix in Preventing Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Spikes After Ahmed Glaucoma Valve Surgery (AGV-FP7)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uncontrolled glaucoma may require surgical intervention. Glaucoma drainage implants such as AGV-FP7 are in wide use upon glaucoma and comprehensive surgeons. The success of aqueous shunt surgery depends on the formation and maintenance of a thin permeable capsule around the posterior plate of the aqueous shunt. Encapsulated bleb formation, where the capsule is thick and elevated, is a common cause of drainage failure in the early post-operative period. This finding is usually accompanied by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), which requires additional intervention, often surgical and therefore reduces the success rate of the initial surgery. Recently, a biodegradable porous collagen-glycosaminoglycan copolymer matrix implant (Ologen), has become available for glaucoma surgery. This device is constructed so as to minimize random growth of fibroblasts and instead to allow them to grow through the pores in the matrix. Ologen® CM,a biodegradable scaffold matrix, induces a regenerative non-scarring wound healing process without using anti-fibrotic agents. This study is to investigate whether placing Ologen over the posterior plate of the Ahmed glaucoma drainage device during initial implantation will allow the formation of a thinner capsule, and decrease the incidence and/or the extent of IOP elevation during the postoperative period.</detailed_description>
