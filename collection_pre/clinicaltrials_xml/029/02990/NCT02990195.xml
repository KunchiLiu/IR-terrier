	<brief_title>Restoring the Beneficial Effects of Enterohepatic Bile Salt Signalling by Chyme Reinfusion in Patients With a Double Enterostomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients supported by chyme reinfusion will be followed for 3 days pre chyme reinfusion and for 7 weeks during chyme reinfusion. Three days prior chyme reinfusion, baseline characteristics will be determined, an ileal biopsy, blood, chyme and urine will be collected. Furthermore, blood, chyme, faeces and urine will be collected at the first day of chime reinfusion. These materials will be collected again at week 1, 3, 5 and 7 weeks after initiation of chyme reinfusion. A second ileal biopsy will be performed at week 3.</detailed_description>
