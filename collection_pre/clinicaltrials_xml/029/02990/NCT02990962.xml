	<brief_summary>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Rather than other progressive disease, CTS is characterized by remission and recurrence. Although many conservative managements of CTS, the effectiveness of these methods is insignificant or only persist for a short duration including steroid injection. Recently, the ultrasound-guided perineural injection with 5% dextrose was widely used for entrapment neuropathy with positive benefit. The investigators design a randomized, double-blind, controlled trail to assess the effect of ultrasound-guided perineural injection with 5% dextrose in patients with CTS and compared with steroid injection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Perineural Injection Therapy Versus Steroid in Patients With Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After obtaining written informed consent, patients of clinically diagnosed with CTS were randomized into intervention and control group. Participants in intervention group received one-session ultrasound-guided perineural injection with 5% dextrose and control group received one-session ultrasound-guided perineural injection with steroid. No additional treatment after injection through the study period. The primary outcome is visual analog scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as on the 2nd week, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 6 month after the treatment.</detailed_description>
