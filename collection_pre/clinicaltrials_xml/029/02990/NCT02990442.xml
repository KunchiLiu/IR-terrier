	<brief_summary>Forensic patients will undergo 30 rTMS treatments, once per day each business day using a 1Hz frequency at the right dorso-lateral pre frontal cortex, located using modified BEAM F3. Patients will be assessed before and after the study with a battery of assessments and using 2 computer tasks: a ball passing task, and the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP). The investigators will also monitor and record aggressive incidents that take place on the unit.</brief_summary>
