	<brief_summary>An Advanced Virtual Exercise Environment Device (AVEED) has been developed that incorporates arm and leg ergometers in conjunction with a virtual reality interface. The purpose of this study is to examine participant perspectives regarding the virtual interface and exercise device combination with regard to usability, comfort, safety, rating of perceived exertion, and enjoyment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals with physical disabilities show much lower rates of exercise participation than their able-bodied peers (Boslaugh et al. 2006, Preventing Chronic Disease). Much of the reason for the low rates of activity among this population come from the presence of barriers. Lack of motivation, lack of transportation, lack of accessible facilities and equipment, and cost are all factors that discourage exercise participation among those with disabilities (Rimmer et al. 2008, JRRD; Barfield and Malone 2013, JRRD). Based on these factors, there is a need for accessible enjoyable exercise options for people with physical disabilities. The AVEED is comprised of an ergometer with foot and hand pedals, and a visual display in front of the user that can show a variety of scenic pathways. The AVEED builds on previous work that demonstrates the potential benefit of interactive exercise for those with physical disabilities. The present study will establish the potential of this device to provide an engaging moderate intensity exercise opportunity for persons with disabilities.</detailed_description>
