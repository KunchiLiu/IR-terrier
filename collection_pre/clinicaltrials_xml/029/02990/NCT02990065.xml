	<brief_summary>The purposes of the study are: - To strictly ensure the appropriate level of protein and caloric provision in critical illness, according to the latest literature recommendation; - To determine if an association exists between protein intake and nitrogen balance in the context of a nutrition with appropriate protein provision based on the latest literature recommendations, rather than in a standard diet with a caloric target weight-based. Creatinine clearance will also be evaluated to determine if there is any harmful effect to the kidney secondary to an elevated BUN. - To determine if there is a difference in ICU mortality rate between the current nutrition standard and a hyperproteic nutrition protocol.</brief_summary>
