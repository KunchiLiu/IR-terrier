	<brief_summary>Esophageal pressure measurements are used in to determine chest wall elastance and calculate lung elastance and transpulmonary pressure in mechanically ventilated patients. A dedicated esophageal balloon catheter is then placed in the esophagus to measure tidal variations in esophageal pressure. In this study high resolution solid-state manometry technique was used to provide detailed and continuous measurements of esophageal pressures in the different parts of the esophagus. Measurements were performed during ongoing mechanical ventilation at different levels of endexpiratory pressure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Esophageal pressure measurements are used in to determine chest wall elastance and calculate lung elastance and transpulmonary pressure in mechanically ventilated patients. A dedicated esophageal balloon catheter is then placed in the esophagus to measure tidal variations in esophageal pressure. In this study high resolution solid-state manometry technique was instead used to provide detailed and continuous measurements of esophageal pressures in the different parts of the esophagus. The manometry catheter has 36 circumferential sensors at 1 cm intervals. Each sensor has 12 pressure-sensitive segments that add to the signal at that location. Measurements were performed during ongoing mechanical ventilation at different levels of endexpiratory pressure. Possible differences in tidal variations in esophageal pressure in different parts of the esophagus were assessed.</detailed_description>
