	<brief_summary>This randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate the difference in surgical site infection following excision of soft tissue sarcomas. The intervention is a negative wound pressure therapy dressing for 120 hours, the control is standard absorbent dressings</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NPWT in Soft Tissue Sarcoma Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: The application of a negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) dressing will reduce rates of wound breakdown in patients with resection of soft tissue sarcomas which are primarily closed. Patients will be randomised into either NPWT or standard absorbent dressings with primary outcome measure of surgical site infection according to the Health Protection Agency guidance. Secondary outcomes are; time to wound dryness, delayed discharge from hospital, adverse events, cost estimation</detailed_description>
