	<brief_title>Renal Denervation by Iberis MultiElectrode Renal Denervation System in Patients With Primary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose was to evaluate 3-month outcomes of RDN for the treatment of primary hypertension in Chinese patients.In a prospective, multi-center study, 216 Chinese patients with primary hypertension would be recruited to undergo RDN by Iberis Multielectrode denervation system. The primary effectiveness endpoint wasReduction in average 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressue at 3 months follow-up.</detailed_description>
