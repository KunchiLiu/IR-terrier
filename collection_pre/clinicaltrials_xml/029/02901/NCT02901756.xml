	<brief_title>A Combination of Coenzyme Q10, Feverfew and Magnesium for Migraine Prophylaxis : a Prospective Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three visits were planned: V1, V2 on Day 30 (± 10) and V3 on Day 120 (± 10). On V1, after checking the inclusion criteria and receiving informed consent, GPs collected demographic data, medical and migraine history and information on migraine attacks, associated symptoms and rescue medications via an electronic case report form. V1 was followed by a one-month observation period (baseline phase) during which migraine treatment of patients was not modified. From V1 till the end of the study, all patients kept an electronic diary in which they reported migraine characteristics (number of days with migraine headache, intensity, associated symptoms and concomitant medications). On the second visit (V2; Day 30 ± 10), eligibility of patients was verified: patients with less than 2 or more than 15 migraine attacks during baseline phase and patients unwilling to be supplemented with the combination were excluded from the study. Eligible patients were advised to start supplementation. On V3 (Day 120 ± 10), information provided in patient's diary and compliance with supplementation were checked. The day before V2 and V3, patients had to complete the French migraine-related quality of life questionnaire (Qualité de Vie et Migraine [QVM]) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The study was conducted in accordance with articles L.1121-1 and R1121-2 of the French public health code defining non interventional studies; all the acts were practised and products used in a usual way without any additional or unusual procedure of diagnosis or surveillance.</detailed_description>
