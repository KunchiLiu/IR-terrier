	<brief_title>Capnography At the Bedside: Leading Educational Efforts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to develop a multi-faceted implementation program (referred to as the Capnography At the Bedside: Leading Emergency Education (CapABLE Trial)) to increase the use of capnography during two critical events in the emergency department, intubation and CPR, for better detection of endotracheal intubation, endotracheal tube dislodgement, and quality CPR. The specific aims of the proposed study are to examine: 1. the effect of a comprehensive theory-based educational intervention on staff knowledge and skills related to capnography (outcome measure). 2. the effect of a multi-faceted implementation program on the adherence to national guidelines regarding the use of capnography during critical events in the emergency department (process measure). 3. the sustainability of effects of the implementation program on adherence, knowledge and skills (outcome and process measure). The design and methods of this study are based on the knowledge transfer framework, which dictates identification of the message, target audience, messenger, process and communication, and evaluation.</detailed_description>
