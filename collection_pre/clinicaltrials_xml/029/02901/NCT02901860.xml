	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to test the hypothesis that those with non-traditional work schedules (e.g. shift workers) have a higher cardio-metabolic risk than those with traditional work schedules (e.g. day workers), and that both accumulated sleep debt and the degree of circadian disruption predict the elevated cardio-metabolic risk. The findings of this research are expected to increase our understanding of physiologic tolerance to non-traditional work schedules and provide the basis for the development of methods for the early detection of adverse health effects and determine coping strategies for the millions of workers with non-traditional work schedules.</brief_summary>
