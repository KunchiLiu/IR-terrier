	<brief_title>The Effect of Different Force Magnitudes on Maxillary Posterior Segment Intrusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized controlled trial is aiming to study the effect of the different force magnitude on maxillary posterior segment intrusion. Two groups are going to be allocated and the amount and rate of intrusion will be measured and compared.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult patients with an age range from 17 to 25. Skeletal open bite. Dental open bite that is due to overgrowth of maxillary posterior segment as seen clinically and that can be corrected without surgical intervention (a minimum of 3 mm and a maximum of 8 mm). Skeletal class I or mild to moderate skeletal class II that enables camouflage treatment. Normal incisor show on smiling (that makes the case indicated for molar intrusion and not for incisor extrusion). Full set of maxillary posterior dentition (first and second premolars, first molars at least). No previous orthodontic treatment. Medically compromised patients. Patients suffering from any congenital or hereditary diseases. Smoking or any systemic diseases. Chronic use of any medications including antibiotics, phenytoin, cyclosporin, antiinflammatory drugs, systemic corticosteroids, and calcium channel blockers.</criteria>
