	<brief_summary>The aim of the project is to investigate the clinical and patient centred outcomes of people with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) attending a podiatry led integrated care pathway, utilising advice on diet, activity and smoking cessation. The podiatry clinic will be delivered from the Move More centre (NCSEM) and participants will be encouraged to access these facilities as part of their activity programme which will be agreed with the physical activity team. Primary and secondary outcomes will be clinical - claudication pain, distance walked at 3 and 6 months, blood pressure and lipid monitoring, weight management, reduced BMI, and the success of any smoking cessation. Quality of life and patient satisfaction with the programme will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
