	<brief_summary>Malnutrition is prevalent among chronic liver disease patients. Inadequate ingestion and/or metabolic alterations modify the body composition and biological functions. The purpose of this study is to determine whether whey protein comsumption, due to amino acid profile, digestibility and bioactive compounds may be beneficial for patients waiting for liver transplantation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Whey Protein Consumption by Patients Waiting for Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, double-blind, intervention study in which patients are randomly assigned to receive packages of 20g of whey protein (WP) or casein (CA) to take twice a day (20g in the morning and 20g at night), as a supplement, during 15 days. They are monitored weekly by calls. Regular usual diet is maintained. Patients underwent muscle functionality assessment by handgrip dynamometry and 6-min. walking test and, the inflammatory response by plasmatic cytokines. All tests are performed at the beginning and the end of intervention.</detailed_description>
