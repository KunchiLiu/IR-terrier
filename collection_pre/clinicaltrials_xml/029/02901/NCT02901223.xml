	<brief_title>The Impact of Oncoplastic Breast Surgery on the Oncological Safety and Patient Satisfaction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non randomized prospective trial was conducted on 70 female patients presented to our tertiary referral breast unit -Ain Shams University hospitals with non metastatic breast cancer during the period from September 2012 to September 2013. All of them signed an informed consent to share in this study that was approved in the ethical committee held on April 2012 - Ain Shams University. Our patients were divided into 2 equal groups: group A (35patients) who underwent standard quadrantectomy, group B (35 patients) who underwent oncoplastic surgery. In group A all quadrantectomies were done by general breast surgeons while in group B the oncoplastic procedures were done by well trained oncoplastic breast surgeons not assisted by plastic surgeons. The following data were reported in all cases including: age, family history, tumor size, volume and weight of the specimen, location of tumor, margin length, (primary tumor, regional nodes, metastasis) staging, molecular subtype and patient satisfaction.</detailed_description>
