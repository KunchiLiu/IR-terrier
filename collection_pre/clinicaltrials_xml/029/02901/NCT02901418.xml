	<brief_summary>Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a serious liver disease worldwide，HBV MTCT is the important reason to keep high prevalence of chronic HBV infection in China. Intrapartum infection is the main period of neonatal HBV infection. Injecting HBIG and hepatitis b vaccine immediately after birth is the most important method of blocking mother-to-child transmission of HBV. However, regular doses of HBIG combined with hepatitis b vaccine blocking measures still have a failure rate as high as 5% ~ 15%.There are numerous studies to explore pregnancy women with HBV positive, especially high viral load of those women during pregnancy being treated with nucleoside analogs to increase the blocking rate of HBV MTCT, but there is still a failure rate of 2.2% to 18%. In this study, we will explore the efficiency of personalized blocking method of HBV maternal-neonatal transmission in high-risk newborns,according to the venous blood HBsAg state of neonatus at birth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the Interruption on the Mother-to-child Transmission of Hepatitis B Virus （HBV MTCT）in Newborns at High Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this trial, the study population were consisted of patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B who had achieved HBeAg positive and HBV DNA &gt; 106 copies/ml and their newborns who were born with HBsAg positive. Before injecting hepatitis b vaccine and HBIG for newborns, we tested their vein blood HBsAg levels, and the venous blood HBsAg positive newborns were randomly divided into the control group and the interventional group in which group we injected the additional 200 IU HBIG within 24 hours after birth, in addition to routine injection. We gathered the neonatal venous blood of 0, 7 and 30 days to test the level of anti HBs, HBsAg and HBV DNA., then detected the level of anti HBs, HBsAg and HBV DNA when these children were seven months.According to the venous blood HBsAg state of neonatus at birth, exploring the efficiency of personalized blocking method of HBV MTCT in high-risk newborns.</detailed_description>
