	<brief_title>Body Perception and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With the investigation of spontaneous sensations (SPS) according to the protocol of Michael and al (2011) the investigators study how patients can listen to their internal sensations located in other body part than the painful member in order to construct a representation of the body and maintain it in active consciousness. A group of controls will be included to understand if there is a global modification in the perception of SPS witch may be linked to the pathology.</detailed_description>
