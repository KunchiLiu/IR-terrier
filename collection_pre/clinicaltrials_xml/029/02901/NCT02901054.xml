	<brief_summary>Serotonergic 5-HT3 receptors in the central nervous system are involved in pain processing after nerve injury. We are interested in learning if 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron might be an appropriate drug for treating pain after nerve injury (neuropathic pain), by investigating its bio-distribution in the cerebro-spinal fluid, and the genetic variability that may affect that distribution. Study procedures will include iv ondansetron administration, serial blood draws, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling, pregnancy testing, and possible ECG.</brief_summary>
