	<brief_title>REU-stop - Effect of Intensive Smoking Cessation Intervention on Smoking Cessation and Disease Activity in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tobacco smoking is a well-known environmental risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The onset of RA can occur in all age groups, with the majority being women aged 50-60 years. RA is a chronic inflammatory disease and cannot be cured. However, the activity of the disease can be reduced by medication. During periods with high disease activity, patients experience increased pain and fatigue and subsequent restrictions in social life, psychical activity and activities of daily life. Furthermore, the inflammatory process underlying RA can cause pain, fatigue, reduced health-related quality of life and reduced physical function. Patients with RA are at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases similar to the risk demonstrated in patients with diabetes. Furthermore, several studies indicate that smokers with inflammatory arthritis tend to experience more pain and fatigue, and a reduced quality of life compared to non-smokers. The primary aim of this study is to examine if an intensive smoking cessation intervention leads to smoking cessation and reduced disease activity in patients with RA. Secondary aims are to examine the effect on the risk of cardiovascular diseases, lung function, psychical function, health-related quality of life, pain and fatigue in patients with RA. Material and Methods Study design: A multicenter randomized 2-armed controlled intervention study (RCT). It is not possible to blind patients or smoking cessation counsellors to the intervention. All outcomes will be assessed by blinded outcome assessors. Data on remaining secondary outcomes will be patient-reported. Baseline and outcome data will be collected at baseline before randomization, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post intervention. Study setting: Patients will be recruited from rheumatology outpatient clinics at University Hospital Rigshospitalet - Glostrup (Capital Region of Denmark), Frederiksberg Hospital (Capital Region of Denmark) and Preventive Cardio-Rheuma Clinic, Diakonhjemmet Hospital Oslo, Norway. Randomization and blinding: After accepting participation in the study, baseline data will be collected. Following this, patients will be randomized using computer-generated stratified block randomization (blocks of 6-10 patients). Patients will be allocated 1:1 to either 1) the intervention group (N = 75) or 2) the control group (N = 75). Data collection: Outcomes will be assessed four times up to 13.5 months post-intervention: 1) at baseline 2) 3 months post-intervention 3) 6 months post-intervention 4) 12 post-intervention. At baseline, patients will be asked to complete self-reported questionnaires regarding demographics, lifestyle, smoking history, consumption of pain medication and alcohol consumption. Charlson's co-morbidity Scale is used for assessing co-morbidity based on data from the patient's chart. In addition, data on medical treatment, IgM-RF (rheumatoid factor) and Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (Anti-CCP) status will be obtained from the DANBIO registry. At each subsequent follow-up, patients will be asked to complete self-reported questionnaires regarding smoking status, disease activity (FLARE instrument), psychical function (HAQ), and health-related quality of life (SF-36 and EQ-5D), pain (VAS scale) and fatigue (BRAF-NRS). All patient-reported questionnaires will be completed electronically using a tablet. The tablet is exclusively for use in this study. Arterial stiffness, blood pressure, pulse, weight and waist circumference will be assessed at baseline and all follow-up visits. Blood samples will be drawn and analyzed for C-reactive protein (CRP), triglycerides, cholesterol level and HbA1c. All outcomes excluding patient-reported outcomes will be assessed by project nurses blinded to the patients' group allocation. Ethics, confidentiality and dissemination: The study will be carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. The study has been approved by The Regional Committee on Health Research Ethics (H-16022001) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (I-suite number 04849). All data and information collected during the study will be handled in accordance with the Danish Data Protection Agency and Good Clinical Practice.</detailed_description>
