	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test if an experimental drug called Durvalumab (Medi4736) given by intravenous (IV) infusion is effective in treating carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the bladder that no longer responds to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and to collect information on the safety of these drugs and whether they cause any side effects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Must have pathologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the bladder and meet one of the following criteria: Failed to achieve a diseasefree state within 6 months after initial BCG, with either maintenance or retreatment at 3 months because of either persistent or rapidly recurrent disease; New onset CIS by 3 months after the first induction course of BCG; Nonmuscle invasive urothelial carcinoma with CIS component relapsed more than 6 months after at least 2 induction courses of BCG; BCG intolerant due to BCG related adverse effects. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 01. Adequate organ and marrow function. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization (e.g., HIPAA in the USA, EU Data Privacy Directive in the EU) obtained from the subject prior to performing any protocolrelated procedures, including screening evaluations. Females must not be pregnant, or breast feeding and must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 28 days prior to treatment on day 1. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner must use a highly effective method of contraception from the time of screening, and must agree to continue using such precautions for 90 days after the final dose of Durvalumab. They must also refrain from egg cell donation for 90 days after the final dose of Durvalumab. Nonsterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception and refrain from sperm donation from Day 1 through 90 days after receipt of the final dose of Durvalumab. Muscle invasive (T2 or above) urothelial carcinoma or urothelial carcinoma outside the bladder. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site) or previous enrolment in the present study. Any previous treatment with a PD1 or PDL1 inhibitor, including durvalumab. History of another primary malignancy except for: Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease ≥5 years before the first dose of study drug and of low potential risk for recurrence; Adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease; Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease e.g., cervical cancer in situ. Receipt of the last dose of anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, biologic therapy, tumor embolization, monoclonal antibodies, other investigational agent) ≤ 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug and within 6 weeks for nitrosourea, mitomycin C or intravesical therapy). Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) ≥470 ms calculated from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) using Frediricia's Correction. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 28 days before the first dose of durvalumab, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid. Any unresolved toxicity (CTCAE grade 2 or above) from previous anticancer therapy. [Potential participants with irreversible toxicity that is not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by the investigational product may be included (e.g., hearing loss, peripherally neuropathy)]. Any prior Grade ≥3 immunerelated adverse event (irAE) while receiving any previous immunotherapy agent, or any unresolved irAE &gt;Grade 1. Active or prior documented autoimmune disease within the past 2 years. NOTE: Potential participants with vitiligo, Grave's disease, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment (within the past 2 years) are not excluded. Active or prior documented inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis). History of primary immunodeficiency. History of allogeneic organ transplant. History of pneumonitis. History of hypersensitivity to durvalumab or any excipient. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, active bleeding diatheses including any participant known to have evidence of acute or chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or compromise the ability of the participant to give written informed consent. Known history of previous clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis. History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 30 days prior to study entry or within 30 days of receiving durvalumab. Females who are pregnant, breastfeeding or males or females of reproductive potential who are not employing an effective method of birth control. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results. Uncontrolled seizures. Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastases requiring concurrent treatment, inclusive of but not limited to surgery, radiation and/or corticosteroids.</criteria>
