	<brief_summary>Randomized double-blind parallel group study in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension to evaluate the effects beyond the blood pressure lowering effect of treatment for 12 weeks with ramipril or doxazosin on hemostatic mechanisms and on endothelial function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxazosin and Ramipril in Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to answer the following questions: 1) Does antihypertensive therapy with doxazosin exhibit antithrombotic effects in patients with essential hypertension? 2) Are the potential antithrombotic effects of doxazosin different to the effects of an ACE inhibitor? 3) Is there a relation between the antihypertensive effect and the antithrombotic effect of these antihypertensive agents? The co-primary outcomes are changes in endothelial function assessed by flow mediated vasodilatation, and in haemostatic function measured by the generation of thrombin-antithrombin complex.</detailed_description>
