	<brief_summary>Childhood deaths from pneumonia is almost 2000 times higher in developing countries than in developed countries. In 1970, pneumonia was responsible for 9% of all deaths in children under 5 years. This rate was 2% in 2007. Some studies have shown that supplementing with vitamin D reduces disease of the respiratory tract infection. Some other studies have shown anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin D in cell lines. Studies about the role of vitamin D supplementation in pneumonia in children are inadequate to conclude about its role. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (RISC) hospitalized clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia.</brief_summary>
