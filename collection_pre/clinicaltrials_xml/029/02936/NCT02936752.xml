	<brief_summary>This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of entinostat when given together with pembrolizumab in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome after deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) therapy failure. Entinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving entinostat together with pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome after DNMTi therapy failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Entinostat and Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome After DNMTi Therapy Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess safety, tolerability, and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of entinostat given in combination with pembrolizumab. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of entinostat in combination with pembrolizumab. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the dynamic quantitative change in measurable immunological biomarkers (proportions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSCs], and programmed death protein-1 [PD-1] expression in bone marrow) with the combined epigenetic-immunotherapy and correlation with any observed clinical responses. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of entinostat. Patients receive lower dose entinostat orally (PO) on days 1 and 8 or higher dose entinostat PO on days 1, 8, and 15, and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of course 2 and courses thereafter. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve an objective response or maintain a stable disease (SD) status after the first 4 courses may continue to receive entinostat and pembrolizumab for up to 1 year. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months.</detailed_description>
