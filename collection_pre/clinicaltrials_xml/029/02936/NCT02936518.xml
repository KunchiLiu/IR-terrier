	<brief_summary>A previously published study (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27641715) identified breastfeeding improvements following lingual frenotomy and/or maxillary labial frenectomy. In the previous cohort, babies were excluded from the study if they had previously undergone an attempted frenotomy prior to seeing the P.I. in the office. The proposed study will only look at those babies who did undergo a previous frenotomy to determine: 1. the presence of continued problematic breastfeeding symptoms 2. if further tongue tie or lip tie release improves those outcomes</brief_summary>
