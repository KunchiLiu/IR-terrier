	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this multicenter randomized controlled trial is to evaluate treatment effectiveness of intervening simple obesity people with catgut implantation at preferred acupoints, which excludes placebo effect; the secondary objective is to evaluate safety and superiority of treating simple obesity with catgut implantation at acupoints to provide high-level evidence for it clinically.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Catgut Implantation at Acupoints for the Treatment of Simple Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, double-blind sham-controlled clinical trial will be conducted at Hubei Provincial Hospital of TCM, Dongzhimen Hospital Beijing University of Chinese Medicine and the First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine. This study includes the following time points: a treatment period of 16 weeks after screening and a follow-up period of 24 weeks. The total study period will be 40 weeks. All patients will be randomized into the real catgut implantation at acupoints group or the sham catgut implantation at acupoints group.The primary outcome measurement of this study is the rate of waistline reduction compared with baseline. The secondary outcome measurements are the rate of reduction of weight, BMI, hipline, WHR and PBF, and changes in the IWQOL-Lite compared with baseline. These parameters will be evaluated at week 0, week 4, week 8, week 12, week 16, week 28 and week 40. Changes in SF-36, HAD and SES compared with baseline will be evaluated at week 0, week 16 and week 40. SF-36 and IWQOL-Lite will be used to evaluate obese patient quality of life. HAD and SES will be used to evaluate psychological status. In addition, hepatorenal function, blood fat, liver bladder spleen colour ultrasound, FBG and insulin concentration will be used to evaluate whether catgut implantation at acupoints can improve the physiological function of obese patients.</detailed_description>
