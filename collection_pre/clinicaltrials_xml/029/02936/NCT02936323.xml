	<brief_summary>Protocol PEN-221-001 is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2a study evaluating PEN-221 in patients with SSTR2 expressing advanced gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) or lung or thymus or other neuroendocrine tumors or small cell lung cancer or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Protocol PEN-221-001 will first enroll patients into a dose escalation phase, where a Bayesian logistic regression model, guided by the escalation with overdose control principle and overseen by a safety review committee, will be used to make dose recommendations and estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Once the MTD has been determined, additional patients will be enrolled into an early expansion phase to confirm or adjust the MTD. Once the MTD has been confirmed, remaining patients will be enrolled into a full expansion phase to assess PEN-221 efficacy.</detailed_description>
