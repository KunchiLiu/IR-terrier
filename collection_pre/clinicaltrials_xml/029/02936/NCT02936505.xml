	<brief_summary>A controlled randomized, open-label, multi-centre study evaluating if an immunosuppressive protocol, based on ATG-induction, once daily tacrolimus-dose (Advagraf®), mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroid reduces the incidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) after lung transplantation, in comparison with a standard cyclosporin-based protocol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Evaluating Two Treatment Protocols for Immunosuppresive Drugs. Looking at 3-year Incidence of CLAD.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study purpose: To evaluate whether the use of a once-daily tacrolimus-dose regimen (Advagraf®), based on anti-thymocyte globuline (Thymoglobulin®) induction, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, reduces the cumulative incidence of CLAD after de novo lung transplantation at 36 months, in comparison with a twice-daily cyclosporin-based protocol, otherwise identical between groups.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Male or female lung recipients 1870 years of age undergoing primary double (including size reduction) lung transplantation. 2. Patient willing and capable of giving written informed consent for study participation and anticipated to be able to participate in the study for 36 months. Exclusion Criteria 1. Recipients of multiorgan transplant, and or previously transplanted with any organ, including previous lung transplantation. 2. Patients with hypersensitivity to, or other reasons to not be able to take the immunosuppressive drugs used in the study. 3. Donor lung cold ischemic time &gt; 12 hours. 4. Patients who previously have been treated with antithymocyte globuline preparations (e.g. ATGFresenius®, Thymoglobulin®). 5. Patients who are recipients of ABOincompatible transplants. 6. Patients with platelet count &lt; 50,000/mm3 at the evaluation before transplantation. 7. Patients who are unlikely to comply with the study requirements. 8. Patients, and/or those receiving organs from donors, who are positive for HIV, Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C virus. 9. Patients with donor greater than 75 years. 10. Patient who have received an unlicensed drug or therapy within one month prior to study entry or if such therapy is to be instituted posttransplantation. 11. Patient unable to participate in the study for the full 36month period 12. Patients with any past (within the past 35 years) or present malignancy (other than excised basal cell carcinoma). 13. Females capable of becoming pregnant must have a negative pregnancy test prior to randomization. Females are recommended to practice a medically approved method of birth control for the duration of the study and a period of 8 weeks following discontinuation of study medication, even where there has been a history of infertility</criteria>
