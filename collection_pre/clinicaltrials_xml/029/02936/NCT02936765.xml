	<brief_summary>This is an investigator-initiated study. The primary goal is to evaluate the efficacy of two different cervical disc devices (prosthesis vs rigid spacer) with respect to postoperative change in neck disability index. The evaluation will include clinical and radiological parameters.</brief_summary>
