	<brief_summary>Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is an emerging clinical entity defined as the presence of intestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms induced by the ingestion or gluten and relieved by a gluten free diet (GFD) in patients without celiac disease or wheat allergy. The pathologic mechanism of the disorder is unknown, and there are no known biomarkers or associated histopathologic findings. In this prospective, randomized controlled trail, we are investigating the utility of patient reported symptom questionnaires, as well as stool gluten and urine quantification tools in patients with NCGS and healthy controls.</brief_summary>
