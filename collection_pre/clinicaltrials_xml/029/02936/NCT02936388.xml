	<brief_summary>Characterisation of effect of SIRT and DSM-TACE as local treatment options for liver metastases in patients with advanced uveal melanoma with respect to progression-free survival and exploratory comparison of secondary endpoints regarding application, activity, adverse effects and impact on quality of life in a randomized study design.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transarterial Radioembolisation in Comparison to Transarterial Chemoembolisation in Uveal Melanoma Liver Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized phase II trial to evaluate the effect of transarterial radioembolisation with yttrium-90 microspheres (SIRT) and transarterial chemoembolisation with cisplatin (DSM-TACE) in patients with liver metastases due to advanced uveal melanoma in terms of progression-free survival and multiple secondary endpoints. Patients in study arm A will receive transarterial radioembolisation one time only. Patients in study arm B will receive transarterial chemoembolisation every 4 to 6 weeks until complete tumor devascularisation is observed or disease progression or intolerable toxicity occur. At the time of local tumor progression patients will be offered the other treatment respectively (either SIRT or DSM-TACE) as part of the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (main): ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2 Histologically or cytologically confirmed liver metastases of uveal melanoma At least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria v1.1 determined MRI (if contraindications against MRI exist CT with contrast media can is allowed) Metastases in other sides are allowed if not in need of treatment (e.g. asymptomatic bone metastasis without indication for radiation) Prior treatment with systemic anticancer therapy is allowed if terminated ≥ 4 weeks prior to study treatment start and recovery from toxicity is achieved Surgery in general and hepatic surgery in particular (e.g. lobe resection, radiofrequency ablation) prior to study enrollment are allowed if realized ≥ 4 weeks prior to study enrollment and recovery from surgery is achieved Exclusion Criteria (main): Surgically treatable liver metastases Previous intraarterial hepatic treatment (e.g. radioembolisation, chemoembolisation, intraarterial chemotherapy, isolated or percutaneous hepatic perfusion) Previous treatment with external liver radiation Major intrahepatic occlusion of the portal vein and/or tumor infiltration of the portal vein Liver cirrhosis ChildPugh C Progressive liver failure Renale failure, bone marrow insufficiency, coagulopathy Uncontrolled or severe medical conditions which could impair the ability to participate in the trial such as unstable cardiac disease or uncontrolled infection Other malignancy and/or metastases in need of treatment Current treatment with any anticancer therapy</criteria>
