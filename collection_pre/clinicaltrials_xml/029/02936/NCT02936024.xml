	<brief_summary>Undescended Testis (UDT) is the most common congenital anomaly of the genitalia in boys and it is commonly managed by surgical intervention. Patients with intra-abdominal or non palpable testis, specifically, are often managed using a laparoscopic assisted orchidopexy, a common surgical technique to bring undescended testes down into the scrotum. Evidence in the medical literature to support the superiority of either one stage or two stage gubernaculum sparing laparoscopic orchidopexy (GSLO) is lacking. Due to this reason, this study focuses on the effects of one stage versus two stage GSLO on a patient important outcome: testicular atrophy.</brief_summary>
